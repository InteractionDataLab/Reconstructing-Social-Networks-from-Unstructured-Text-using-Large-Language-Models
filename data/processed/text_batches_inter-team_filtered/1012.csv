Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," coli. was closely related to H. influenzae, a species of bacteria well known for it's high frequencies of natural transformation (competency). H. influenzae uses a Type-IV pilus structure to uptake DNA, so the team researched whether or not such a system could be implemented into E. coli. to yield similar transformation rates. Studies conducted by Dr. Rosemary Redfield - an E. coli. expert - showed that all gram-negative bacteria share two common regulator genes for competency; sxy and CRP (Sinha & Redfield, 2012) . A deeper analysis of Dr. Redfield's papers also revealed that E. coli. lacks a pilF2 homologue. Curious, we contacted Dr. Redfield to gain insight into the subject. Dr. Redfield stated that during her experiments, all the proteins involved in DNA uptake were able to be expressed, but the rates of competency in E. coli. were quite low to begin with. It was decided that E. coli. would not be used for our project as there were many unknown variables which dictated the expression of competence gene homologues in E. coli.
Additional studies on E. coli. conducted by Sun et. al. were looked at. The findings of these studies stated that OmpA (an outer membrane protein) plays a role in uptaking DNA from conjugative plasmids and bacteriophages (Sun, Wang, Chen, & Zhan, 2013) . The researchers also hypothesized that OmpA plays a stimulatory role in DNA uptake in liquid Ca2+ cultures, along with an inhibitory role on agar plates (Sun et al., 2013) . OmpA negative strains (JW0940) were found to have a higher transformation frequency than wild-type strains (BW25113) when grown on agar (Sun et al., 2013) . Surprisingly, transformation frequencies did not change with varying agar thickness, so it remains uncertain how agar plays a role in E. coli.'s natural transformation (Sun et al., 2013) . Conversely, the OmpA negative strains showed a lower frequency of transformation than wild-type strains when grown in liquid Ca2+ cultures (Sun et al., 2013) . We concluded that it may be possible to make E. coli. naturally competent on agar by replacing the OmpA gene with a gene that codes for kanamycin resistance.
In additional to E. coli., B. subtilis. was researched as a potential platform for DNA uptake. Current trends and methods in B. subtil"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Treatement modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," This gives the time necessary to internalize all the phages of the bacteria.
The diffusion through the walls of blood vessels
The movement in Y is the distribution of phages in the blood (j(n)). It depends on the equation of diffusion of a particle (n) in a fluid (Fick's Law).
With n the number of particles (phages), grad n the difference between the concentrations and D the diffusion coefficient. The cellular distribution of vectors within the blood vessel and then through the wall is a phenomenon of diffusion with output. So, there will always be a strong gradient of concentration of phage in the blood. We can therefore say that the gradient is constant (equal to 1) over time. Thus the diffusion rate (j(n)) is equal to D.
Dispersal area of phage
When we combine moving Y (diffusion rate) and moving in X (blood flow velocity), we obtain, after integration on the perimeter of a blood vessel, the action surface of cell vectors . Then, we are able to determine the number of cancer cells per 100 cell vectors destroyed or 1 tissue vector .
The diffusion rate of the cell vector is equal to 0.5 μm.s-1 and the size of a capillary blood is 10μm in diameter. The particle farthest places so 10s to reach the vessel wall.
With this dissemination length (10s), the blood flow velocity (1x10 ^ 3μm.s-1) in the capillaries, and the surface of one cancer cell (1 micron square), we can determine:
The length (L) covered by the cell vectors released by one tissue vector .
The surface (S) occupied by phages in blood vessel diameter of 2r.
The amount of cancer cells available.
L = 1 x 10^4 µm 2r = 10 µm S = 2 x π x L r = 31.4 x 10^4 µm²
Thus, a tissue vector can potentially target more than 31 000 cancer cells, yet it has that 100 cell vectors . We can make a simplification to say that 100 cell vectors destroy 100 cancer cells. The efficiency of the dispersion is complete.
For phage, once reached the wall, comes in the cellular internalization. This model responds to two courses of action.
Back to top
Step Five: The cell vector internalization
Once in contact with the cell, the cell vector has two possible ways of action.
The vector fix then it detaches from the cell.

Thus, two team members attended the 5th Systems and Synthetic Biology Summer School at Siena, Italy, and brought back with them their experience and the cutting-edge ongoing research. At the same time, our team had the chance to present its idea at the poster session and discuss with other participants on our project.
The fact that our team members participated in such an outstanding conference, one that managed to bring together the research elite on Synthetic and Systems Biology, gave our team the opportunity to broaden its horizons. This conference strengthens our efforts to engage our communities, inform the greek society on the cutting-edge technological advancements, educate students and the general public on synthetic biology, and even dissolve common misconceptions regarding this field. The knowledge that we gained can now be disseminated through our own presence in our respective communities.
Researcher’s Night @Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece
Among the events that were organized in Athens for the Researcher’s Night, was the Doctoral and Post-Doc Research Meeting, hosted by the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. Our team was there to present its work and engage in discussions with researchers and the general public.The emphasis of our presentation was given on the laboratory techniques that were implemented, and our project received heart-warming comments on its innovative nature.
Analyzing the Greek Reality
The next step on our path to make an actual impact on greek society was to analyze how immersed the greek society is in the biotechnological advancements and what are the misconceptions that disorientate the general public. We focused on the educational system of Greece, engaged in discussions with specialists and came up with proposals, discussed in our report along with the existing Synthetic Biology-related classes and programs.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html," of the IaaH-Pep2A-IaaM fusion protein in the GoldenBrick plasmid K812050 using standard Golden Gate protocol. This protocol hadn't been optimized at the moment. However, out of 16 cloned on which we did colony PCR, 10 of them had the good size. We sequenced 4 of them and obtained the sequence expected.
Fig 13: Colony PCR of 15 clones from the transformation plate. The ones marked with a star were sequenced and proved to be correct. The one with an exclamation mark was sequenced and had only one of the CDS inserted.
This experiment demonstrates the possibility of doing GoldenGate in the GoldenBricks plasmids K812050 (and similarly in K812051) in a very efficient way.
Material and methods
Construction of the library
The GoldenBricked parts were constructed amplifying the corresponding biobricks using primers flanked by the appropriate GoldenBricks extensions, using Phusion (Thermo Scientific) or Q5 (NEB) DNA polymerase in a 30 cycle reaction. The PCR products were PCR purified and then digested using FastDigest® EcoRI and PstI (Thermo Scientific). The standard plasmid pSB1C3 (or pSB1K3) were digested similarely. Both vectors and inserts were PCR purified and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific) before being transformed with home made competent cells (chemical or electroporation). Four white clones were inoculated and sequenced.
The either red or non red colonies were minipreped and then digested with BsaI for screening. All the clones that had the correct digestion pattern were sequenced and gave the correct sequence.
The RBSs were synthetized in the form of two matching oligos. A mixture of 10 µM of the two oligo was incubated at 98°C for 2 min and then cooled down to 4°C with a ramp of -1°C/s. They were then PCR purified, digested and PCR purified again before beeing ligated in pSB1C3.
Assembly protocol
The protocol given here hasn't been optimized yet. We are only starting the development of this new technology. It is given here as a matter of indication. Some optimized protocol will be available soon.
About 75 ng of each plasmid (more accurate ratios will be optimized) were mixed together with 2.5 units of BsaI enzyme (NEB) and 15 units of T4 DNA ligase (Th"

1. Test of self-killing: Warrior I kills itself but warrior II doesn’t
    We compare the amount of warriors in medium containing A+K with the amount of warriors in medium containing C. If the amount is apparently lower in the medium containing C, the warrior must have killed itself.
    We find that the amount of warrior I is apparently lower in C group, which means that warrior I kills itself.
    The figure shows the result. The ratio represents the amount of warriors in C medium divided by in A+K medium.(group 4/group 1, group 5/group 2)
*A+K stands for ampicillin + kanamycin,"

Through various kinds of practices (like, survey, consulting professors, attending lectures, discussions, etc.), we gained more insights into our project and our responsibilities, and were aware of these potential impacts when planning the project.
With the potential impacts on scientific problems and societal questions in mind, when designing the project we integrated many fine details into the software. We tried hard to make more positive contributions to scientific and societal practices, and reduce and even eliminate the potential negative impacts. When the project was (nearly) complete we did project assessment and public testing, and got many feedbacks from the experts and the public, which helped us improve the project.

√ 2. Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the issue by creating an online software solution.
Wet-lab team NJU-China wants a tool that can track the movements of the mice in the cage while recording the positions of the mice in the form of coordinates. We developed this tool and this tool can be downloaded here!
Collaborations: https://2015.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations
√ 3. Re-use and further develop a previous iGEM software project (or parts thereof) and demonstrate how future teams can continue this trend through good code documentation, use of open source materials and creation of great instructional materials.
For the software itself, we re-used and refined some useful functions in FLAME, project of 2014 SYSU-Software. Following are what we did.
1. In FLAME, radar map was used to demonstrate the ratings of different aspects for a defined genetic circuit. We found that radar map is a good way to representing ratings, so we reuse it to representing the ratings of different aspects for a genetic design. However, we made a big change to this settings; CORE allows every user to rate these aspects of a design (while in FLAME, user cannot rate the circuit), then computes the average and shows the result via this radar map.
2. In FLAME, there are many useful devices (represented as “frameworks”). These frequently used devices (AND gates, OR gates, NOT gates, etc.) are re-used by CORE, and in CORE users can directly use this device to engineer their circuits. Further, we enable users with more flexibility"

By modifying this derivative through the addition of positively charged amino acids (lysine), I was able to give strengthen its amphiphilic characteristics.  Amphiphilicity is a measure of the extent to which a molecule can behave in both a polar and nonpolar way.  This gives these molecules the ability to dissolve in the blood and also to pass through hydrophobic cell membranes.  After biological studies, I found that the molecular photosensitizer I constructed was very potent in terms of phototoxicity, which means that even at very low concentration there was destruction of the cancer cells.
In terms of biosafety, I want to focus on the basic principles of biochemistry and cell-photosensitizer interaction.  In general, my photosensitizer was much more of a safety risk due to its ability to uptaken into individual cells from the extracellular space.  Additionally, it is not heavily altered by spending time in the extracellular space due to its amphiphilic characteristics. KillerRed, however, is a ""genetic"" photosensitizer that is created within a cell of interest and (as far as we know) can only act upon that individual cell.  This is due to the very unique fact that KillerRed is a protein that folds to form a chromophore that produces 10-fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than other fluorescent proteins such as GFP.  All proteins have unique foldings that can be quite sensitive to its surroundings (pH, temperature, etc.) and if a cell containing KillerRed were to lyse and release the photosensitizer, I believe that no other cells would be greatly (if al all) affected due to two main points:
1.)  The KillerRed protein may become denatured (unfolded) due to a change in environment, breaking apart the chromophore and rendering all ROS production to null
2.)  The KillerRed protein maintained its proper folding, but fails to enter any nearby cells due to its size (macromolecule) and inability to be uptaken into other cells (lack of receptors, etc to trigger any other form of uptake)     
I hope this explanation will help to address some of the safety concerns we will be collaborating upon for the iGEM Competition.  Please let our team know if anything further is needed.  Thanks!

As team leader for this year's competition season, she has addressed the multifarious setbacks associated with modern lab work with an admirable aplomb. However, iGEM is only the beginning. Having been born in the giddy years immediately following the much-celebrated demise of the USSR, Jonlin has watched the rise of new threats to American dominance with concern and hostility. With destabilizing challenges to American primacy more pernicious than ever before, she is biding her time, waiting for the moment to seize the ultimate mantle of power. When Jonlin assumes her rightful place at the top of Executive Branch, fires of liberation will envelop the globe. There can be only one.

The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models to simulate and predict the process of biological systems. Our team established two models simulating the process of sweeteners binding on T1R2-T1R3 receptor and the process of sweeteners signal transduction in GPCR pathway. After that we designed and improved our biological systems based on the simulation results.
We developed our models for the following four main purposes:
1. Simulate different sweeteners how to bind on receptors.
2. Build a structural model to provide us with a solution for retrofitting and designing Gα.
3. The establishment of the GPCR signal transduction model gives us a better understanding of the sweetness signal in our system.
4. Simulate the relationship between sweetness signal and RFP fluorescence intensity and define the relationship between sweetness and fluorescence intensity.
Our structural model used the method of homology modeling on the SWISS MODEL server and then used AutoDock for molecular docking. The GPCR model was established by the reaction kinetics equation (RKE) of each signal transduction process. We used MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we obtained the relationship between sweetener concentration and fluorescence intensity of our biological system.
System Overview
Our goal is to detect the sweetness of the sweeteners by retrofitting the GPCR signal transduction pathway in yeast (Cen.PK-1C).
The structure of TIR2-T1R3 (Picture from：Molecular mechanism of sweetness sensation)
In order to make the signal more accurate and reliable, we established T1R2-T1R3 receptor structure model and took aspartame, glycyrrhizic acid, stevioside and so on with its docking. And we got the binding sites of different sweeteners with T1R2-T1R3 receptor.
The design of sugar hunter
As you can see, this is a simple line model for our biological systems. We can divide it into four modules: the T1R2-T1R3 receptor module, the nucleotide exchange reaction module, the MAPK kinase module, and the RFP expression module.

Place plate back into warm plate reader for 1 minute, but no longer as the 5μl volume will evaporate quickly.
Pipette 50μl of the tubulin reaction mix into each of the eight wells using a single channel pipettor. Work rapidly, use medium pipetting speed and keep the tip of the pipettor on the wall of the well. This technique avoids bubble formation which will disrupt absorbance readings.
Start plate reader immediately. If the software crashes in the first 5 minutes it is worthwhile to restart the process because some data can be rescued in most cases.
22. Using DNS for determination of reducing sugars
3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS or DNSA, IUPAC name 2-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid) is an aromatic compound that reacts with reducing sugars and other reducing molecules to form 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid, which strongly absorbs light at 540 nm.

NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," government used to encourage scientists to devote themselves to their work. This is because China used to be poor and weak in 1950s. Many scientists devoted themselves to the country and scientific research, which was badly needed at that time.
But now China is a confident and powerful country. As Chinese scientists are doing better and better, they shouldn't be encouraged to work for too long simply in order to publish more papers. They should be encouraged to care about their own health, instead.
Rationale: We hope to change the life of Chinese young scientists and we wish them to be safe and healthy. The most important part is to change their working habits. We decided to start from master and PhD students because it's a crucial period for them to form their habits of working, which might influence their whole career. The more people we could influence, the larger changes there will be.
Information collecting
What are the most common poisonous reagents in biology laboratories? We have asked many students in the campus. In fact, the answers varied in different labs. As undergraduate students, we can remain careful when we use the hazardous reagents. But postgraduate students might lower their guard after working in the lab for several years. So we summarized the hazardous reagents most often used in biology labs.
Ethidium bromide (EB) is an intercalating agent commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) to determine DNA and RNA location in agarose gel and SDS-PAGE gel. Due to its ability to intercalate and deform double stranded DNA, EB is considered as a strong mutagen and carcinogen which would impair DNA replication and transcription, as well as to damage mitochondrial DNA during cell proliferation.
Mostly, the amount of EB used in the laboratory (0.25C1 mg/ml) is below the level of toxicity. However, for students under chronic exposure to EB, the potential risk still exists.
EB may evaporate under high temperature (60oC or higher). Thus, EB should not be added into gel when it's not adequately cooled. For protection, nitrile gloves and masks are required.
The disposal of EB remains a controversial subject. Generally, purification treatments are required before the disposal according to different concentrations.
For solvents containing EB over 0.5mM, the solvents should be diluted below 0.5mM and mixed with certain amount of KMnO4 and HCl or NaOH. Low concentrations of EB can be simply mixed with active carbon for at least one hour.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an important non-proton polar solvent"

The Flow layer of a microfluidic is the layer that liquid(s) flow through. Etchings on this layer, known as primitives, are used to manipulate and alter fluid flow. For more information regarding primitives refer to the Primitive Table .
How can Microfluidics Apply to Synthetic Biology?
Microfluidic chips can be designed to perform various procedures used in synthetic biology. There are many advantages to integrating microfluidic devices into a synthetic biology laboratory. For example, these devices utilize microliter volumes of liquid which decreases reagent waste, allows for more trials to be performed with the same volume of reagents and lowers costs as reduced reagent volumes can be effectively utilized. Furthermore, complete protocols can be transferred onto a single chip and automated. Due to their microliter handling abilities, multiplexed systems can also be run on a single compact chip. As a result, researchers can save significant amounts of time spent on performing protocols in the lab and simply run a single chip instead. Using our fabrication system, researchers can also rapidly produce microfluidic devices at low cost to easily integrate into their lab environment.

Paris_Bettencourt,2012,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," structured debate. I think this was a very interesting concept to let experienced debaters but non-scientists / non-iGEMers debate the merits of synthetic biology. This perhaps reflects more closely the discourse that happens on a policy and society level. I found this a bit frustrating, as both sides didn't really progress the arguments much beyond the cliché. Maybe I was expecting too much, coming from a synthetic biology background and recently dealing a lot with the ethical, legal and social issues. But the more I reflect on the experience and on having had the privilege of taking part in the judging panel, I realize that in a public debate and public decision, style and presentation can often matter more than substance or correctness of arguments. I find this worrying, but a very valuable lesson that the debate showed. Following up from the debate, I wonder how we can learn from this, how we can make sure we can judge these issues dispassionately and rationally in society and policy.""

In spite of their background (medicine, law, and engineer studies) they showed a real knowledge in the different fields they approached. The members of the jury had backgrounds from different horizons; making the judging procedure fair and opened to any discussions.
Although, the argumentation deployed by the speakers seemed a bit too simple for a warned public; the debate makes totally sense as part of Paris Bettencourt’s human practice project. The content was really accessible even for a callow public which is something we very much appreciated and which is quite difficult to achieve in the case of scientific debates around topics like synthetic biology.
The questions/remarks session, offered to the floor the opportunity to develop the speakers’ argumentation. Moreover, people working in the field of biology gave more in depth information regarding the topic.
Finally, I would like to thank the Paris Bettencourt team for inviting us to this wonderful debate and afternoon in Paris.""

The N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are a class of autoinducer secreted by many Gram-negative bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae. While Escherichia coli does not produce AHLs, it does have the SdiA receptor necessary to detect these autoinducers. The binding of AHLs from V. cholerae to the SdiA receptor on E. coli triggers a signal cascade that activates the transcription of quorum sensing linked genes in E. coli. By inserting our target genes into the quorum sensing linked section of E. coli’s DNA, we can design a specific response to the detection of V. cholerae by E. coli.
Biofilm
Bacteria living in a biofilm are physiologically different from a bacterium of the same species in a planktonic state. In a biofilm, cells are fixed within a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS.) Vibrio cholerae's virulency is one of the physiological changes it undergoes when changing its physical sate. The formation of its biofilm is reciprocally controlled by two chemical signaling systems: 3’,5’-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP,) which activates biofilm formation, and quorum sensing, which represses it. Many species of bacteria in the Vibrio genus form biofilms, although they are very different in their structure and stability. Vibrio cholerae produces a biofilm that is free floating rather than one that attaches to solid surfaces which presents major issues in characterizing and running degradation assays on it.

Developing an enzyme-based method for converting chitin in Chitosan has obvious attractions such as environmental friendliness, lower chemical costs, higher molecular weight, quality and standardization (Roberts, 2008).
Latin America and Mexico
The data on Chitosan production and consumption for Latin America is inaccurate due to the size of the market. In Latin America, Chitosan is used mainly for water treatment and research purposes. Regulations for its use in cosmetics and foods are still ambiguous.  Out of the total world production, only 462 tons are produced outside the US, Canada, Japan, Europe and Asia Pacific, which is 3.36% of world production.
Nowadays Latin America consumes 530 tons of Chitosan per year and most of it is imported form producer countries. The biggest part of the product is sold by big companies such Sigma Aldrich and produced by companies such as KitoZyme, a Belgium based company famous supplier of fungi-derived high purity Chitosan. Prices in nonproducing countries increase due to import tax fees and transport costs. Nevertheless, industry is calculated to be growing at 18% per year (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2014), (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2014), (Sigma-Aldrich ).
Mexico is the second biggest economy in terms of GDP, which is 1.2 Billion USD. The country represents about 22% of total Latin America’s GDP (5655 Billion USD). If we assume that Mexico’s weight in Latin American economy is 22%, we can infer that Mexico consumes about 22% of the total 530 tons of Chitosan per year, which is 106 tons per year (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2014), (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, 2014).
In order to identify the size of both markets, our team created a sample of Latin-American customers who had requested Chitosan through online stores such as Alibaba.com, Quiminet.com and Amazon.com. Out of 234 observations, 34% where Mexican customers, whose requests went from 0.009 kg to 24000 kg per year. Also, out of all the requests, 26% demanded medium-low purity Chitosan and 6% demanded high purity Chitosan. The smallest order was posted by a Mexican student and the biggest one was posted by the general director of a water treatment plant. This proportion"

Cadmium Sensing
Our design allows bacteria to intake cadmium through the manganese channel MntH, as cadmium also leaks through these channels in addition to other metals [1]. The metal sensing proteins we intend to use are CzrA and ArsR which both bind cadmium as well as zinc cobalt and nickel, and arsenic, silver and copper respectively [2]. These proteins are repressor proteins which also bind DNA preventing transcription of downstream CDS. The repressor proteins however release the DNA to preferentially bind cadmium [2] allowing transcription to occur allowing selective sensing of cadmium in the form of a logic AND gate.
Population Dynamics
As well as sensing cadmium we plan to engineer our bacteria’s normal population dynamics, by nudging the natural stochastic sporulation decision in favour of higher sporulation rates, to account for the spores that will be lost as metal containers. Our population model simulates whole cell populations using inputs from single cellular models and will be used to determine the required increase in sporulation rate.
Stochastic switch
Our artificial stochastic switch in a ‘biased heads or tails’ which we can tune. The stochastic switch determines the cell's decision to become a metal container or not. This switch will be regulated by an invertible segment of DNA using the hin recombinase/hix [3]. We favoured the use of an invertable DNA segment since the choice will be heritable and maintain its expression inside a spore. This stochastic switch will either induce the expression of the genes which switch on the ‘metal sponge’ phenotype or will direct the cell to a wild-type lifestyle.
Metal Containers
To make our spores into metal containers we will be using the metallothionein protein SmtA, which is a relatively small cysteine rich protein known to ‘soak up’ metals such as cadmium [4]. We will guide this protein to the spore by creating a fusion with the spore coat protein CotC, which will embed cadmium bound metallothionein throughout the spore [5].  Finally, to ensure that metal containing spores will not germinate again, releasing their bound cadmium, we will ‘knock-out’ essential germination genes sleB and cwlJ and selectively re-complement the resulting mutation.
Sporulation tuning
In order to tune sporulation, our team is proposing the idea of inducing the synthesis of KinA, with IPTG as a sporulation initiation signal. KinA is a major kinase which provides phosphate input to the phosphorelay, which in turn, activates the sporulation pathway upon starvation via"

Jiangnan iGEM team is devoted to construct an original cell line feasible for the rapid production of a broad spectrum of vaccines. We strictly follow the safe regulations in the project design, lab work and shipment. Please see details as below.
Safe project design
(1) For materials
We use three cell lines, i.e., MDBK(NBL-1), BHK-21, CHO, and two viruses, i.e., IBRV, CDV in our project. We have submitted the check-in form for each one of them and got the permission from HQ in using them in our experiment. All of these aforementioned organisms are only used for scientific research purposes, and Jiangnan team has strict specifications to ensure that they do not affect the environment and society.
Cell lines
1) MDBK cells were used as our chassis cells. Through genomic modification, we enabled this cell line with three features, i.e., broad spectrum, high titer and suspension.
2) CHO and BHK cells were used to explore genes responsible for the suspension feature of cells. High throughput sequencing was applied to the suspension and non-suspension cells of these lines to determine genes differentially expressed between suspended and non-suspended cells. These genes were used in the network construction, where the top one was selected for in vitro experimental validation.
Virus
1) IBRV was used to construct the ""High Titer"" feature of the chassis cells. We used the ‘infection of IBRV on MDBK cells’ as the infection model to measure changes in titer after genetic modulation and/or plasma treatment, as MDBK is a natural host of IBRV. For efficient test of virus titer, we developed a method that can easily and fast test the titer of DNA viruses including IBRV.
2) CDV was used to construct the ""Broad Spectrum"" feature of the chassis cells. We expressed Nectin 4 and TfR on MDBK cells, and tested whether the sensitivity spectrum of MDBK cells could be expanded using CDV which does not naturally infect MDBK. We may use CPV and other viruses in the future to more comprehensively test the ‘Broad Spectrum’ feature of the established cell line which, however, is not part of this competition due to time restriction.

The ARD1utr sample wells did not run at all and only one of the two RPL8Autr sample wells ran.  A solution, such as changing the temperature for annealing, is being looked into. Extraction and digestion was conducted on TDH3p, KRE9p, and STM1p in addition to the BAP2p and RPS2p extracted on 7/27.
Round 2:
Analysis Gel run on 1 μl samples of:
HH01utr (well 3)
FCY2utr (5)
ARD1utr (7)
FCY2p (9)
RPS8Bp (11)
Gal1/10p (13)
PCR was run at 50C Run on 1.5% gel at 60V 6 μl of 100bp DNA Ladder used
Results The only mixture to show in the gel were HH01utr, ARD1utr, and RPS8Bp suggesting that the annealing temperature needed to be changed.
Round 3:
Analytic Gel run on 1 μl samples of:
HH01p
PRY1utr
KRE9utr
RPL24Autr
RPS2utr
RPS8Butr
TDH3utr
HH01p, PRY1utr, and KRE9utr were run in PCR at an annealing temperature of 52C RPL24Autr, RPS2utr, RPS8Butr, and TDH3utr were run in PCR at an annealing temperature of 48C Run on a 1.5% gel at 60V 6 μl of 100bp DNA Ladder used
Results: None of the mixes ran in the gel due to the use of expired PCR Supermix.
7/29/2011
Purpose: Run an analytic gel for the promoters and UTRs made on 7/28 with intent to extract. Try to amplify more promoters and UTRs.
Procedure:
ROUND 1
We ran a 1.5% agarose gel @70V for the following (PCR'd at annealing temperature 51C):
HH01p
PRY1p
FCY2p
PRY1utr

In fact the real world impact that our technology might have in the future is one of the major reasons that motivated us every day during the last few months. The numerous interviews that we conducted with e.g. medical doctors strengthened our sense for the urgency of organ printing even more and we are more convinced than ever before that a successful implementation of the technology could save thousands of lives every year. However, the interviews also sharpened the responsibility that we perceive when dealing with our new method. Beyond a bio-safety responsibility, researchers in our field are responsible for a clear and honest communication with various stakeholders. Patients on a waiting list for a donor organ are in an extremely stressed situation. Over-optimism and broken promises worsen their situation. We therefore focused on a clear, understandable, and honest communication of our project and our results. For more information please refer to our Engagement page. We did our best to combine a healthy optimism that is needed to do cutting-edge science with a responsible communication to vulnerable stakeholders.
Kill switch (summary)
The kill-switch was implemented into our project as we were asked several times in discussions with experts (such as medical doctors or life science professors) what would happen if we would have some malignant cells in our printed organs. As this case is potentially possible and may also be a factor patients or healthcare officials would probably be sensitized, we started to plan a kill switch. We decided to integrate as very solid and simple kill switch that features a constantly expressed prodrug-convertase enzyme. The prodrug-convertase expressed in the printed organ is generally not harmful as long as no problems for the patient occur. In an emergency case in which a doctor decides that the synthetic tissue needs to be removed from the patient he gives the patient a single pill with the prodrug (which is Famciclovir in our case) and all transgenic cells in the patient will suffer from a reduced viability and die in only a few days.
Linker chemistry (summary)
The second point we identified from our interviews with experts to be crucial was the printed extracellular matrix composed of recombinant proteins. Some of the experts worried about immunogenicity of these components especially if it was somehow mentioned in the discussion that in the future it could be an aim for the bioprinting sector to print replacement organs. Our answer for such questions was always, that the Avidin & Biotin mesh is only used to give the cells initial mechanical stability until they can start to divide and differentiate. From this imput we came to the"

Economical View
The economical considerations regarding our project were carried out according to the motto:
Make the world a better place - Open access for scientific progress
In the center of every economic analysis are the customers and their needs and desires. Every commercial company is interested in satisfying and dealing with all customer needs for better sales figures, in order to maintain regular clientele. Both measures aim for higher financial  profits. On the global seller’s market  of technical laboratory equipment there is a permanent competition between the existing providers.  On the one hand, this competition depends on the mentioned financial profits and, on the other hand, on the following factors: technical improvement followed by price wars. Due to globalization products from the Asian market are increasingly competing with the American and European market resulting in intensive price wars. On the Asian market personnel and production costs are much less and thus the same product can be sold with higher profits. Some of these products are less expensive but are often of lower quality, too. However, for a company it is important to chose a good price-performance ratio because this factor always catch customers and influence their purchase decision.
Costs and operating expenses for companies producing technical laboratory equipment
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2013)
Take a look at cost calculations for technical laboratory equipment including development, production, transport, warehousing and sale. Usually, you will find that in this branche there are really low costs for research and development, restruction and amorthilisation. In contrast, general expenses and costs for administartion, revenues, and sales are high. Lastly, financial profit is a big cost point cause businesses have to be self-financing. In general, these factors are making technical equipment for labs really expensive, and therefore unaffordable for low-budget"

We set up new cultures of pC13BC, pC13BV, and wild type BL21-AI cells. Then, we ran PCRs of the left and right homology regions of G. lucidum along with pC13Y, pC13BQ and pC13BR and gel screened them. Three colonies from pC13P and pC13BA construct transformation were cultured in 5 mL of LB, followed by miniprepping and sequencing. We miniprepped the cultured pC13BF transformants and the liquid cultures of ‘’PpkiA’’ and ‘’TxlnD’’. Unfortunately, the concentrations of the minipreps were too low to submit for sequencing.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," a biological system. We have already held the first 2 lectures in which many Life and Physical science have actively participated.
During the first lecture we have introduced a concept of synthetic biology as a road to biological engineering and how it can lead to achievements in medicine, material science, pharmaceuticals and similar fields. We have then discussed how we can improve and adapt nature’s systems for our needs, as well as limitations of our knowledge and how much we lack towards creating truly complex biological systems, such as artificial cells. Also, students were introduced to basic concepts of biological parts, their assembling into pathways and intentional design of novel components.
The second lecture elaborated on dynamics of biological processes, e.g. operons, their regulators, riboswitches and feedback loops. Also, we discussed recombinant DNA technology concepts, synthesis and sequencing of nucleic acids, and techniques that are important to understand before starting to engineer a biological system.
Now we are taking a short break because of Giant Jamboree after which we are coming back with the third lecture. We have prepared an overview of modelling and engineering principles which will familiarize students with the key principles of system design (modelling, simulation, verification, standardization and optimization). The main idea of this lecture is to give an understanding on how we can take separate biological parts, characterise and merge them to create a certain well-defined system. We will also discuss biological switches and design principles of biological oscillators, as well as how we can exploit naturally existing feedback systems.
The last lecture will be for reviewing all the concepts presented previously and to consider how we could design multicellular systems. We also chose a couple of papers on practical application of synthetic biology to discuss authors’ approach to planning, execution and interpretation of results. Furthermore, we are planning to address the ethical questions regarding synthetic biology, such as uncontrolled release, human or animal genetic modification or creation of artificial life.
In conclusion, this year we have decided to accelerate the spread of synthetic biology in Lithuania. We have set ourselves the goal to achieve that by revamping the Synthetic Biology Organisation. A 5 year strategy plan was developed in order to make the organization more goal oriented and efficient. Then, the strategy plan was initiated. We have redesigned the brand of SinBio in order to attract more people, participated in radio shows, hosted an international microorganism day and create a lecture cycle for Life and Physical science students. We hope that this initiative will immensely accelerate the growth of the general and professional synthetic biology community in Lithuania."

Tec-Monterrey,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Detect_-_-_TEXT.html," Chemistry areas. Starting this October, we’ll be visiting local schools and applying a battery of IQ tests to students from all basic grades. After selecting the highest scores, those children will be interviewed with their parents and offered to participate in the program.
DETECT classes will be held on Saturday mornings on our university Campus. Groups will be formed according to previous knowledge of the area and will never have more than five students per instructor. We’ll take the students from basic biology and chemistry up to molecular biology, biochemistry, organic chemistry and genetic engineering. Advancement through the subjects will be at the maximum pace the students can handle in order to keep them challenged. In order to keep the continuous effort that this program will require, we’ve applied for DETECT to be included in ITESM’s Community Social Services system. When approved, it will mean that, as long as there are college students in the Campus willing to mentor gifted children (not just from SyBRE), the program will continue to exist.
As DETECT develops we’ll look into establishing working partnerships with governmental authorities and civil associations so that early-entry to college education is available to the students in the program. Although there is not much of a chance of that happening in Mexico, there is always the option of talking to American universities and see if they would be willing to help. It will all depend on the advancement shown by the first generations of DETECT alumni. It is our driving hope to be part of the formation of the first 12-year old Biotech major in México.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

In any case, put W3031a cells from all three tubes into 90 mL of fresh YPD media (newly made today) and each of the activator strains into 50 mL of the same media. These mixtures all went into the shaking incubator around 1:15 pm.
Decided to run another gel for the remaining PCR products to determine whether they actually worked.
Saw two bands on the PCR, both around 400 bp in length.  These were from wells 3 and 10 (from the right of the gel), which correspond to mCYC + ZifA BS and pCYC promoter, respectively.
Also, will do PCR purifications of the parts that were successful, namely all activators and apparently all mCYC + BS parts as well.
So far, we have positive PCR results for all 3 activators and also for all three mCYC + binding sites, as well as what appears to be the pCYC promoter.  However, while the band seemed to be at 400 bp, whereas the actual length of this part is 288 bp.  Thus, we were unsure about the true identity of that band of DNA.  Incidentally, since we only plan"
TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Human Practice#Information Day_-_-_TEXT.html," the idea of iGEM and that we are so ambitious to take part in it. Especially the transparency of this competition and the concept of standardization via BioBricks was favored.
What We Did
To inform the people about synthetic biology we distributed two booklets of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. One was entitled ""Hier steckt Biotechnologie drin"" (There's biotechnology inside), the other one ""Weiße Biotechnologie"" (white biotechnology). Besides, we prepared information material to present iGEM and the two projects of the Munich iGEM teams. Last but not least SCNAT (Swiss Academy of Science) provided us a comic about synthetic biology that we distributed.  To get the children interested in scientific topics and to explain them the principles of standardized parts, we provided them Lego bricks at our booth and they build creative constructs. Moreover, many children took part in our painting competition. The challenge was to paint an animal that possesses at least one feature of another animal.
Fig. 2: Lego Brick for the kids
Conclusion
In total the Germany-wide ""Action Day"" was really successful. We addressed a lot of people and informed them about the ideas and opportunities of synthetic biology. Especially our project attracted much interest because everybody in Germany (and mainly in Bavaria) likes beer and consequently the idea to modify it using ""super yeast"". It is a topic everybody can talk about and thus it is easy to communicate the keynotes of genetic engineering and synthetic biology.  The children often painted or built constructs with Lego bricks while their parents talked with us about iGEM and our project. Many people were attracted by our poster and stopped to read it. We are really happy that we addressed so many people and that we communicated them the principles of iGEM and BioBricks.
All in all it was a lot of fun for us and the pedestrians - have a look at the pictures and see for yourself!
Children Painting Contest Illustrating Synthetic Biology
Fig. 3: The tickets for Munich Zoo
The painting competition was a descriptive way to explain children the principles of synthetic biology. By transferring a feature of one animal to another you can create a completely new organism. All in all this is the idea of synthetic biology. We also explained the children that we do this in our project as well. Yet we do not work with big animals but with smaller organisms. Finally, we are able to transfer features of plants to yeast. Besides, we explained the principles of iGEM using Lego Bricks and the children built interesting constructs on their own.

INTRODUCTION
In the past iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element.As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine.To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society which will be our target consumer and real beneficiary.Therefore, we took some actions .we designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project.To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts.Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us to know about and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of SdicZhongluFruitJuiceCo., Ltd(the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China ) right after we finished our original plan.In the later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice so that we can be improved.On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
During we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them still were the fans of sweetness which make people feel happy and warm. According to what we found,  there is an excellent opportunity  for us to research the sweet food.Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that have been observed already.
INTERVIEWING THE EXPERTS
After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind.Generally,"

HUST-Innovators,2014,Team:HUST-Innovators_-_-_TEXT.html,"ic Acid
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that is a primary structural component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin, sperm, testicles and retina. It can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid or obtained directly from maternal milk or fish oil. DHA's structure is a carboxylic acid with a 22-carbon chain and six  cis double bonds; with the first double bond located at the third carbon from the omega end. Its trivial name is cervonic acid, its systematic name is all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexa-enoic acid, and its shorthand name is 22:6(n-3) in the nomenclature of fatty acids.
Cold-water oceanic fish oils are rich in DHA. Most of the DHA in fish and multi-cellular organisms with access to cold-water oceanic foods originates from photosynthetic and heterotrophic microalgae, and becomes increasingly concentrated in organisms the further they are up the food chain. DHA is also commercially manufactured from microalgae: Crypthecodinium cohnii and another of the genus Schizochytrium. DHA manufactured using microalgae is vegetarian.
Thraustochytrids
Thraustochytrids is rich in oceanic environment. And they can produce large amount of DHA. However our strain T-roseum ATCC28210 was still not sequenced yet. It means our project was blocked if we used the traditional Synthetic Biology Methods. To achieve our goal, we need to do something before the Traditional Process.
Tips
This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:
State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and what you plan to do.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2013 calendar
Have lots of fun!

That allowed both of us to take a step back and                 set up a good approach from the beginning of the adventure!
Collaboration with iGEM Paris Bettencourt (France)
We had the opportunity to meet with Santino Nanini. Santino made Celestin a visit of their workspace and building. As you can see they are located in a central area, with a stunning view of Paris. We exchanged ideas on the brainstorming                 approach. We both knew that we wanted to solve a antimicrobial resistance problem so we shared our visions. It was a great science talk that helped both of our team to take take a step back and share point of view. But beside the                 science talk we also shared our management approach, about how to efficiently manage the lab work, and everything else. Since we are teams over 10 people that is a crucial part of the work.                 After our first meeting in Paris, we kept in touch regularly to exchange our point of view and help each other on specific problems."

IIT_Madras,2013,Team:IIT Madras#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html," team, like a good boy, in a fancy restaurant. It was a     much-needed break that seemed to rejuvenate everybody (except Kanishka, maybe!).
To add to the joy, the much-awaited I3A construct finally landed at our doorstep! Without a moment’s delay, we reconstituted the lyophilized DNA and     transformed E.coli DH5α cells with the I3A construct. The LB agar-ampicillin plates showed healthy growth, so a primary culture was inoculated. Mini-prep     was performed and the isolated plasmid was run on an agarose gel to confirm its successful isolation. The I3A plasmid (pUC57) was then subjected to     restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI. An agarose gel run confirmed the release of I3A.
M04W14: The One With Code Red: (1st -7th Sept)
The I3A insert was eluted and a ligation mixture was set up with vector (pSB1C3+BBa_F2620) and insert (I3A) in 1:3 ratio. Once ligation was done, cells     were transformed, primary culture was set up and finally, mini-prep was done. The isolated plasmid was digested with SpeI and PstI followed by an agarose     gel electrophoresis. Again it was the time when everyone held their breath…..and about an hour later, there were shouts of joy and celebration! We got a     positive clone in the first attempt again! The atmosphere in the team was really upbeat now.
However this was not the time to get carried away and we ended the week with our focus on Human Practices. We decided to make a ‘Guidebook on Safe Handling     of Red Meat’, the target being meat vendors, butchers and people working in slaughterhouses. We tried to incorporate all possible aspects relating to     handling and safety of red meat to increase awareness about diseases originating from unhealthy, unprocessed meat.
M04W15: The One With the Take Off: (8th -14th Sept)
With the Regional Jamboree round the corner, it was time to decide amongst ourselves the team members who would travel to Hong Kong to represent the team     and present our project.

PROJECT TIMELINE
Impact of Lambert iGEM’s Integrated Human Practices on the Final Project
For our 2018 iGEM project, we strived to address the devastating effects of waterborne diseases, specifically cholera. We altered and adapted our project over time, integrating feedback from researchers, professors, and doctors working in the field. The goal of our project is to create a practical and beneficial detection mechanism for pathogenic cholera. An inexpensive and efficient mechanism for individuals living in developing nations without access to clean drinking water and for organizations such as the Thirst Project.
iGEM members spoke to residents living in a city called Hato Mayor in the Dominican Republic.  Since a vast majority of the residents living in the Dominican Republic do not have access to clean drinking water, iGEM members wanted their feedback on the usefulness of our overall project and design.
Most of the Lambert iGEM team members have never truly witnessed the tangible consequences of drinking contaminated water; therefore, Lambert iGEM strived to inform every team member, as well as other high school students, to the global problem.  By listening to speakers from the Thirst Project and residents living in the Dominican Republic, we have been inspired to take action.
For example, Lambert iGEM presented the 2018 project in front of researchers working at Boehringer Ingelheim, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company. Members received significant feedback on our project, altering aspects of app development, outreach, and wet-lab. Researchers spoke to us about the practicality of our project and exposed us to the reality of working in the field.

BNH: Did first test readings with the amplifier. Since it was the first day, most data we got turned out to be a learning experience. Since we were working with PAP, without knowing that it oxidizes in air and water, most of the readings were confusing. As a result we started working with a fixed current and measured the voltage, that setup gave us better readings with PAP.
June 21, 2011
BNH: Took control measurements with pure H2O and TPW. Measurements are (relatively) useless since we were still working with constant current, measured voltage.
After running comprehensive BLAST searches it was decided that our sequenced construct was not what we thought it was, we decided to make a culture (in the hopes of running a gel to confirm the identity) of the plate made from the third transformation of the construct made on June 7, 2011.
June 22, 2011
BNH: Felix created .4% by volume (0.01M) CPR stock solution. We ran tests on 10 and 100 times diluted solutions to characterize it. In the process we developed a new test protocol; We switched back to a voltage clamp set-up, the Faraday box was shown to be very effective (10 times less noise in box). We noticed that a higher concentration of CPR recovers faster from the voltage stress. In response to that we increased the time to at least 90 seconds to give all samples sufficient time to reach equilibrium while still keeping tests short.
Started an experiment to measure how well pseudomonas can grow on naphthenic acids by measuring OD over times and concentrations.
The culture from the previous day was miniprepped and restriction digested and a gel was run. Another culture of transformed E. coli was made for the viability assay planned this week to determine the viability of E. coli cells in different concentrations of NAs and in tailings water.
June 23, 2011
BNH: Ran tests on TPW based CPR solutions.
Finished growth experiment, results were as expected, the more naphthenic acid there was the slower the growth. Surprisingly the difference wasn’t large though, will repeat at different concentrations.
The gel from the previous day did not turn up well, so no conclusions were drawn from it. A growth curve experiment was performed for the E. coli cultred the previous day to assess what conditions (heat, shaking) the cells could grow in and to track the progression from lag to log to death"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.
Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

RBS-decoder
Abstract
The efficiency of translation in bacteria is greatly influenced by the binding affinity between the ribosome and RBS, which can be measured by RBS strength. Experimental work to determine a RBS sequences can be awfully laborious while our software program can solve this problem easily. RBS-decoder is a software tool for evaluating RBS strength and locating SD sequences. This program uses the same method-PWM to calculate the similarity between the RBS sequences and the position frequency matrix of SD sequences and transform the similarity to the relative strength of a RBS sequences.
Background
Translational efficiency in Escherichia coli is generally determined at the stage of initiation. There are several principal mRNA sequences elements which can affect the kinetics of ternary initiation complex formation (30 S-mRNA-fMet-tRNA): SD sequences and the start codon (ATG). The SD sequences base-pairs with a RNA molecule that forms part of the bacterial ribosome (the 16s rRNA), while the start codon base-pairs with the initiator tRNA which is bound to the ribosome. In addition the SD sequences and the start codon being important, the spacer between them also influences the RBS strength, these two sequences need to be positioned approximately 6-7 nucleotides apart so they can both make contact with the appropriate parts of the ribosome complex1.
Introduction
How do baterial Ribosome Binding Sites work?
The bacterial ribosome binds to particular sequences on an mRNA, primarily the SD sequences and the start codon (ATG)."

Collaborations
We were very happy to know people and collaborate with teams from all over the world this year! We collaborated with teams from Europe, Asia and America that helped us with modeling, research about laws and engineered probiotics and, of course, contributed to making a happy and fun iGEM season!
Modeling with ETH Zurich
This was the first time our team has ever tried to create a gene circuit’s mathematical modeling and simulate it with MATLAB. That means that we had to start from the very beginning, learning from genetic circuit modeling basics to MATLAB coding with no previous experience at all! After learning the basics of coding and creating our model, we still had many questions about it, and that’s when ETH Zurich Team arrived!
In our first Skype meeting, we talked about our genetic circuit modeling and simulation but also about our projects. After the meeting, the Zurich team reviewed our model and MATLAB code, sending us an useful material about stochastic modeling (that will help future attempts on modeling our circuit or future projects), a simpler and more elegant version of our coding (making it easier to edit), helpful modeling tips, with interesting advice on which parameter we should look at in order to best describe our circuit. In our last Skype meeting, we discussed last changes in the model.
This collaboration was incredibly helpful for building our model and simulation, and to discuss our results. Thanks a lot, ETH Zurich!
TecCEM
iGEM TecCEM had the amazing idea of creating a parody of “Girls Like You” and “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5 called “Labs Like You” and “Moves Like iGEM”, which we agreed to participate for sure! Besides, we also got in touch to talk about our projects and did some research for each other. TecCEM’s project is about healing burns with biological materials, so we look into researches, data about burns and available treatments in Brazil and sent them. In exchange, they looked for data about engineered probiotics and regulation in Mexico.
Check the music video “Labs Like You” and “Moves Like iGEM”:
Engineered Probiotics Around the World

The team Fungi made initial cultures from a freeze dried sample and observed growth. Also the P444 plasmid arrived!
Team MoClo received CIDAR MoClo plasmids from Laura Tuck.
May 23rd - June 3rd
Let The Experiments Begin
After much deliberation, we finally decided to use the Bba_ P10500 Phytobrick Universal Acceptor Vector as our destination vector for all (level 0) MoClo compatible DNA parts. The order for the synthesis of DNA gBlocks for our parts was placed through IDT.
The MoClo team finished their primer design for mutagenesis and began cloning plasmids for template.
The fungi team designed and ordered primers to clone parts from the P444 plasmid with the new PhytoBrick standard by PCR.
June 6th - June 17th
In The Swing of Things
Our first MoClo assembly was finally performed using DNA parts found in the CIDAR MoClo kit. However, very few colonies were obtained and therefore our MoClo reaction mixture and conditions were adapted.
Mutagenesis was conducted to remove illegal sites from the Rhodococcus vectors. Mut2 and Mut3 showed a good result.
Our fungi team worked on their MoClo protocols in order to start assembling devices with our the designed PhytoBricks and achieved great efficiency at LV0. We also worked on optimisation of transformation protocol in P. roqueforti.
Jane Calvert and Deborah Scott helped the group to delve deeper in to the social dimensions of the project and human practices, with discussion focused on new questions of patents, GMOs and ethics that powerful and enabling genetic technologies such as CRISPR/Cas have brought up.
The first microorganisms for the CARE tool were chosen and its secondary metabolites retrieved.
June 20th - July 1st
Halfway There!
All of our designed parts were shipped to the lab and were then cloned into the PhytoBrick Universal Acceptor Vector.
The fungi team designed multiple gBlocks fragments for synthesis of the AMA1 sequence that was to be assembled using a Gibson strategy.  Problems were encountered both with the transformation of P. roqueforti and the assembly of LV1 parts.
The data mining for the CARE tool database began.
July 7th - July 12th

We attended Synbiobeta Activate, a great and informative event that celebrated the official opening of the BBSRC-funded Edinburgh Genome"
DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#Other assembly systems_-_-_TEXT.html," the restriction recognition sites of four restriction enzymes; EcoRI and XbaI should be located upstream of the BioBrick and SpeI and PstI downstream of the BioBrick. The BioBricks can not contain the four mentioned restriction recognition sites. These restriction recognition sites are used to cut the BioBrick to be inserted obtain sticky ends and open the second receiving plasmid also obtaining sticky ends.
The resulting insert and open vector must be purified so unwanted and unspecified parts can be removed. The inserted and cut plasmids are mixed and under the right conditions, making the sticky ends to form hybridization. Subsequently, a ligation is performed to re-ligate in order  to form a plasmid that can be transformed into E. coli cells. [1] .
Difference between Plug'n Play assembly and Standard Assembly
A major disadvantage of the Standard assembly is the need for restriction digestions, ligations and the need for site-directed mutagenesis if more restriction recognition sites are present on the plasmid. The limitation in only assembling two parts at the time, makes the Standard assembly much more time consuming. Furthermore, the scars made by the assembling make it impossible to create fusion proteins by the Standard assembly.
3A assembly
3A (3 antibiotic) is a method for assembling two BioBrick parts at the time. 3A assembly relies on three way ligation (between the two parts and the backbone vector), thereby it differs from Standard Assembly, which uses two way ligation between a part and a part + vector. The 3A assembly was designed to make the gel purification of the digested parts unnecessary. Furthermore, antibiotic selection is used to eliminate unwanted background. The assembled parts can either be in two plasmids or generated by PCR.
The way it's done
The process of assembly with 3A resembles the Standard Assembly method. The 3A assembly uses, just like the Standard Assembly, the restriction recognition sites of EcoRI, SpeI, Xbal and PstI for flanking the BioBricks and destination vector.
Digestion of the two parts and the destination plasmid are performed so sticky ends are compatible with the wanted assembly of the vector. The restriction digestion and ligation has to be executed in two separate steps. After transformation in E. coli cells, positive/negative selection is performed. [2] .
Difference between Plug 'n' Play assembly and 3A assembly
The 3A method is based on use of restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, which means that illegal restriction recognition sites need to be eliminated. The method also leaves"

After studying the experience section on the Registry’s homepage, we decided to change inverters to parts Q04400 (TetR inverter) and Q04510 (cI inverter). The inverters we originally chose were not so well characterized, and the promoters they used as output might be too weak for our system.
Transformation of parts Q04400 (TetR inverter) and Q04510 (cI inverter).
2011-07-12
The day started by running a gel of the mutagenized ccaS, amilCP-BB10 PCR product, and amilGFP_PstI linear plasmid. At the same time we prepared the samples (ccaR, ccaS, RBS-ho1 and RBS-pcyA) for sequencing. Plating of strains carrying plasmids with terminator B1001, PLlacO, pSB3T5 and pSB4K5. Purification of PCR products of ccaS_EcoRI, amilGFP_PstI, amilCP_BB10, and PcpcG2. Re-ligation of mutagenized ccaS and amilGFP, and cloning of amilCP_BB10.
The transformation of inverters from yesterday didn’t go well. The lambda-cI-inverter had only a few colonies, while the tetR inverter had no colonies at all. So TetR inverter has to be redone. This time the transformation used 2 µl of DNA from the MIT distribution. Re-streak of cI inverter transformants from 2011-07-11.

We started the day by running EnvZ-KO, ccaS, EcoRI- digested amilCP and amilGFP on a gel. We obtained good results; there were no distinguishable multiple bands on the gel, although the bands seemed a bit smeared. Then we did transformation of ccaS_EcoRI, amilGFP_PstI, pSB1A3-amilCP, pSB-pcpcG2 and pSB4A5 backbone.

As for FliG, this protein is responsible for the rotation speed and torque power of the bacterial flagella. For our aims in this part of the project, which are to increase the speed and power of the bacterial flagella, we decided to focus on FliG.
In a study by Gina M. Donato and Thomas H. Kawula, it was shown that HNS is not only a transcription factor but also that it can change some protein’s activities through direct interactions with them. . In studies including fluorescence anistropy and chemical cross-linking, it was shown that there is a physical interaction between HNS and FliG proteins.

Numerical simulations
Model equations (1.4) and (1.5) have been used to simulate: i) the sensitivity of the circuit to initial state and ii) the response to
and UVc stimulations . Numerical simulations were performed in Simulink (MathWorks). Simulator scheme is shown in Figure 7. To ensure circuit bistability parameters
and
were both fixed to 10.
Figure 7. Simulink simulator scheme
The trajectories in the plane of the states (see Figure 8) clearly show the separatrix line (red line) and two attraction basins (one for the LacI-ON and the other for TetR-ON equilibrium). Depending on the initial state the memory can reach one of two stable equilibria (blu curve). The memory switches from a stable equilibrium to the other one when an external perturbation move the state over the separatrix entering it in the other attraction basin.
Figure 8. State-Plane Trajectories
To simulate the
reset, we fixed the initial state to the LacI-ON (
= 10 and
= 0.2) and we simulate the application of different levels of

. With a minimal
dose the switching is very slow (about 5 hour). To accelerate the transition it is sufficient to expose the circuit for 1 hour to

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#UofT_-_-_TEXT.html," these resources? Do you have any other suggestions? From least to most, Wikipedia, Google scholar, with NCIB and PubMed being around equal. Web of Science, Scopus It should be noted that while highly cited articles or articles from reputed journals are more credible, results should be interpreted within their scope and context. As such, if people are trying to understand a concept, a search of previous research on the topic is necessary. Ideally, most well written articles would reference such literature. There is trend of extrapolating the results and conclusions of an experiment beyond its scope. Why do you think people with less education tend to refrain from figuring out new scientific concepts? Some scientific concepts require layers of foundational understanding to be built upon each other, and therefore some concepts can seem intimidating and daunting to those who lack such a foundation or are not confident in it. Although education is commonly associated with the accumulation of knowledge, education also aims to teach individuals how to learn new concepts. Perhaps those with less education have less experience with challenging themselves with new concepts, and thus may be intimidated by the thought of a steep learning curve or the amount of time that they need to put into understanding these concepts.  Also, science is a lot more nuanced than most people think. There are often conflicting theories and opinions. In those cases, it is probably better for the public to defer to the consensus of the general scientific community. Government sites and the media should work to make this information more accessible. Moreover, one of the features of science that can be cognitively dissonant for the public is the fact that science does not aim to prove things to be true but rather to prove a concept not to be false. This form of language can make an uninitiated doubt the validity of research. Similar to the group with some post-secondary education, the group without a university degree shows similar trend in terms of trusting skeptical scientific claims and blindly distributing articles without assessments. Do you think general post-secondary education level play a significant role in scientific literacy? From the aforementioned trend, it appears as if post-secondary education does not necessarily ensure that an individual is scientifically literate, and that it is a skill that perhaps post-secondary institutions should pay more attention to.  Also, while experience does allow you to pick up context and scientific ‘red flags’ when reading scientific articles, even veteran researchers cannot claim to be able to speak confidently on all facets of science. It is therefore the responsibility of the government, research institutions and the media to make sure that there are resources available to the public that correctly address hot topics like GMOs or human gene editing for people with different backgrounds."
SCU_China,2013,Team:SCU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," So we want to imitate sexual differentiation in unicellular organism to help us understand the process of sexual differentiation. We believe that this imitation would be very interesting and attract more people to do related research.
Background
At first, we want to introduce some background in the field of using bacteria to imitate the whole developmental procedure from a single cell to a well-organized organism.
 
Life begins from fertilization according to developmental biology. After that, the development process includes differentiation between Germline and Soma,  cell migration, pattern formation and so on. The whole course is self-organized. Imitations of above five steps except fertilization have been explored by 2007 Paris( https://2007.igem.org/Paris ), 2011 USTC( https://2011.igem.org/Team:USTC-China ), Nature 434,1130-34,28 April 2005 ( [1] ) and 2008 USTC( https://2008.igem.org/Team:USTC/Project ), respectively. However, no comprehensive studies on the imitations of gametogenesis and sexual differentiation.
 
 
Our project design
In our project, we intended to construct male and female E. coli separately (called G+ and G- cells). According the natural characteristic of E.coli, the G+ cells possessed F plasmids. On the other hand, the G- cells were constructed by using another plasmid incompatible with F factor.
When cultured separately, the G+/G- cells would divide and reach a threshold of cell density  . Then, the quorum sensing system would turn on its responding promoters, and make G+/G- differentiate into gametes (P+ and P-, respectively), which could not divide any more but were capable of transferring or accepting plasmid.
 
After that, male and female E. coli were mixed. Just like fertilization, the male gametes would recognize the female cells and began to transfer modified F plasmids into female gametes through sex pili. The conjugation made female gametes return to the state of undifferentiation (called G cells), which meant that they could divide again but were not sexually determined.
 
After several rounds of cell divisions, F factor and its incompatible plasmid in G cell would seperate.  Consequencely, the G cell differentiated into a G+ or G-, which, like zygote, maybe contained genes from both male and female gametes.
 
Simply, our project included differentiation from mature E. coli to gametes, conjugation between male"

Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.

There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.

Regulation in Israel
The Israeli Union for Environmental Defense is a non-profit organization that handles legal battles involved in environmental and health-related laws, regulation and governmental approvals In Israel. Through our correspondence with them, we have learned that Israel`s regulation is focused on limiting emissions, not production; meaning industrial facilities are allowed to produce as much dioxin as they wish but may not release them into the environment. This concerned us because a) there is no oversight of how much dioxin is produced, and b) the oversight of emissions seems to be very lax.
Full correspondence
In a 2004 article, we found that there is a law that regulates the amount of dioxin production in factories, but there is little to no enforcement of said law. Could you shed light on whether there has been any progress in this matter in recent years?
""There is no regulation regarding the amount of production, but rather the amount of emissions [of dioxins]. The regulations have improved considerably since the Clean Air Law (2008) and went into effect (in 2011). Factories have limitations on dioxin emissions (as well as restrictions on other materials). Regarding enforcement, we think that there has been a slight improvement since 2004, although, to our understanding, the enforcement level it still quite lacking.""
""An issue where no improvements have been made regards the current information on total dioxin emissions in Israel. Since the 2005 dioxin emission survey, there has been no further investigation or update, and today there is virtually no overall information on all the emissions of these pollutants in Israel.""
In your 2014 report on the emissions of hazardous substances, it was mentioned that the State of Israel had signed the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants treaty in 2001. The report states that, despite the signing, the state has not yet ratified it. What is needed for ""ratification"" to take place and has there been any progress on the issue since.
The signing of an international treaty is [unfortunately] more a declaration of intent, and its practical significance is relatively limited. While this particular ratification has a higher legal status than others - meaning that the state is placing the obligations it has undertaken through the Convention into Israeli legislation, making the obligations part of the binding law - there has been no change on this matter [since 2001].

Grow 1-5 mL culture overnight in a 10-20 mL                             culture tube.
Centrifuge at 10.000 x g for 1minute at room                             temperature. Decant or aspirate and discard the                             culture media.
Add 250 ul Solution I mixed with RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.                             Transfer suspension into a new 1.5mL                             microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 ul Solutions II. Invert and gently                             rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear                             lysate. A 2-3 minute incubation may be necessary.                             Avoid vigorous mixing and do not exceed a 5 minute                             incubation.
Add 350 ul Solution III. Immediately invert                             several times until a flocculent white precipitate                             forms. Centrifuge at maximum speed (>13.000xg)                             for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form.                             Promptly proceed to the next step.
Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL                             Collection tube.
Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 6                             CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini                             Column. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection                             tube.
Add 500 ul HBC Buffer diluted with                             isopropanol
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse collection                             tube.
Add 700 ul DNA Wash Buffer diluted with                             ethanol. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.                             Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection                             tube.
Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column at maximum speed for 2 minutes to dry the column. This                             step is critical for removal of trace ethanol that                             may interfere with downstream applications.
Transfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column into a                             nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 ul Elution Buffer or sterile deionized                             water directly to the center of the column                             membrane.Let sit at room temperature for 1 minute.                             Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.

Depth Interviews
In order to further validate the safety and clinical recognition of our program, we conducted a thorough interview                 with several physicians and discussed the reliability and effectiveness of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy                 with dialectical thinking.
In June 2017, we interviewed Ai Zhang, a senior physician who specialized in rheumatoid arthritis at the                 department of rheumatology at the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou university, who was currently studying                 at Gulou Hospital in Nanjing (Figure 15). She was well aware of CAR-T and made a lot of suggestions to us.She                 pointed out the problems in actual operation which we needed to pay attention to and all of these are very                 instructive, such as Treg in the separation of the choice of flow sorting or magnetic bead sorting problems,                 Treg training problems, etc. We also had to further develop analysis and optimization of specific experimental                 programs. Plus, she suggested that we would focus on foreign pharmaceutical giants in CAR-T and Treg and                 other clinical trials of clinical therapy, and learned from some of the lessons learned.
Figure 15. We were interviewing Ai Zhang
Fortunately, we also interviewed Minning Shen, who is the associate chief physician of Nanjing first hospital                 in , Department of Rheumatology (Video 2). She was very concerned about this area and she gave a systematic                 evaluation within her point of view of the existing treatment and Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. Her views                 were consistent with the conclusions we had made in the survey, and again verified the security and reliability                 of our program from an authority expert. She also made a general prediction of the clinical application of                 Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. From the pre-basic research to the real application, Novartis's CAR-T pathways                 were significant for our application. Optimistically, Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy in the treatment of                 rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases will have a good effect.
Through the interview with two physicians, we received a lot of suggestions and opinions, and more of which                 was the recognition of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. And they were also considered Syn -Notch CAR-Treg                 cell"
UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," we realized that our initially proposed method of engineering biocatalysts to bind to tagatose and emit a fluorescent dye was unnecessarily complex and expensive. In trying to keep it simple and easy to detect, we opted to use HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) . However, the postdoc also expressed doubt that the current metabolic pathway could produce enough tagatose to be chemically distinguished from the other sugars naturally present within the cyanobacteria.
She suggested that we do the following two things to ensure a higher chance of success for this part of the project:
Find the specific HPLC column that has been documented for tagatose detection, because most columns can detect galactose but not really rare carbon sources such as tagatose.
Find a method to increase either the conversion rate for tagatose production or increase the overall amount of tagatose that was being produced. She suggested that modeling specific parameters would be useful in assessing our next step
Deliberation
From this discussion, we changed our detection method to HPLC because it was simpler and more convenient. We also changed the construct of the BioBrick by introducing a flag tag . In the event that tagatose was not successfully synthesized, we would be able to identify at which point the pathway had failed.
Another very important change that we made was a modification to the metabolic pathway. Because we wanted to increase overall concentration of tagatose present within the cell, we did some flux balance analysis modeling and confirmed that a shift to a two loop system instead of a one loop system did not pose any singificant increases.  Although there was no way of knowing for certain, our team felt that using this strategy would get tagatose concentration to at least the minimally detectable level based on the enzymatic pathway that we had constructed.
Point 9: Learning about Bioprocessing Design
Rationale
Going back to one of our initial discussions, we felt that we had not done our due diligence in presenting an industrially viable solution for bacterial contamination. While our solution is economically viable, it was ultimately about being able to visualize some sort of prototype for a bioreactor that contains our ROBUST technology. Therefore, we thought that it would be important to understand the basic parameters of bioreactor design and general bioprocessing techniques. To get more insight, we discussed potential solutions with the Golden Lab about how to put all the components of our project over together.
Exploration
We learned that in order to have an industrially acceptable project, we needed to differentiate between the different stages of bioprocessing, specifically upstream processing and downstream"

 LOVpep and ePDZb
For initial testing and characterization of the system, we fused LOVpep and ePDZb

to corresponding segments of the                                    split                                         firefly luciferase (
1
). We tested different positions of the split protein on                                     the PDZ domain,                                     while the split protein was kept at the N-terminus of the LOVpep domain due to the                                     importance of the C-terminal peptide epitope. We also tested different ratios of both parts of the dimerizing system to determine the optimal conditions for further experiments (

B).
The LOVpep/ePDZ light inducible system fused to the split firefly                                             luciferase.
As luciferase activity was highest with split luciferase on the N-terminus of the                                     ePDZ domain and a 1:3 ratio of the LOVpep:ePDZ constructs, all subsequent experiments were                                     performed with this conditions. An important feature for real life applications is the                                     ability of the system to be stimulated multiple times. Therefore, repeated                                     association                                     and dissociation was tested in real time, by adding luciferin to the medium and                                     measuring luciferase activity upon induction by light (

C). The system exhibited                                     a delayed, but successful induction the first time, but the second induction was                                     much weaker. These results indicate that the LOVpep/ePDZ system in this setup could                                     not be                                     induced more than once, so we decided to test an additional system.

Cambridge iGEM go to Biodesign NightScience
On the weekend that English ferry ports ground to a halt, and travellers faced 14-hour delays, members of the iGEM Cambridge-JIC team defied these odds to reach Paris in the name of science. Rather, in the name of NightScience, an annual conference hosted by the CRI (Center de Recherches Interdisciplinaires) at the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industries which brought together synthetic biologists and innovative thinkers from around the world for two days of fascinating talks and workshops.
The event follows the philosophy of Night Science from the French biologist François Jacob, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his joint discovery of transcriptional regulation of enzyme level expression by the lac operon in E.coli. He proposed the concept of Night Science in his 1988  memoir “The Statue Within”, writing:
“Science has in fact two aspects. Day science involves reasoning as articulated as gears, results that have the strength of certainty…
Night Science, on the contrary, wanders in the dark. It hesitates, stumbles, falls. Questioning everything... Nothing guarantees its successes, its ability to survive the tests of logic and experiments, but sometimes thanks to intuition, instinct and the will to discover, as a lightning it illuminates more than a thousand suns…”.
Given the opportunity to present our project at the conference along with this year’s Paris Bettencourt iGEM team, the resonance of this idea with the iGEM philosophy and experimental process was clear (though we can only hope our project “illuminates” the plant science community with the light of at least a few suns). It also applied to the projects of many participants we met during the conference from interdisciplinary labs, such as the CRI and the Waag Society in Amsterdam, and the Bio Makespace community.
We were inspired by the DIY hacking culture of this community and wanted to lend our support through the engineering side of our project. By developing low-cost open source hardware for the transformation and"

The N-end rule is applicable to a wide range of organisms ranging from E. coli to plants and mammals (Dougan et al., 2010). Of course we are interested in the E. coli N-end rule, described by Tobias et al. (1991) and Shrader et al. (1993). This N-end rule states that if the N-terminal residue is arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan, the protein will have a half-life of only 2 minutes. These amino acids are called primary destabilizing residues. On the other hand, amino terminal arginine and lysine are secondary destabilizing residues in E. coli. These residues conjugate to primary destabilizing residues, which again results in a half-life of only 2 minutes (Tobias et al., 1991).  If the N-terminal residue is neither a primary nor a secondary destabilizing residue, the half-life of the proteins exceeds 10 hours. We applied this rule to the proteins of our interest, with the results displayed in Table 2.

Table 2: The resulting half-lifes after using the N-end rule.
According to the N-End rule the half-life of our proteins exceeds 10 hours. If we compare this value with the generation time of a single E. coli cell, we can conclude that these proteins live far longer than the cell itself . Therefore we will take this generation time as a value for our “protein degradation”. On the Bionumbers website , we found that a good rule of thumb for this generation time is around 3000s, which is 50 min.

The limiting step (associated with the most uncertainty) in the kinetic parameter model is the transcription rate. We hoped to improve this aspect by using wetlab derived mRNA levels, obtained via qPCR studies. Due to the unforeseen circumstances with the qPCR we unfortunately were not able"

After the above relationship is completed, since the absolute protein concentration determination                     is difficult, we define the relative reaction rate as
$$V^{'}=\frac{V}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
$$OxD_{roGFP2}=\frac{[roGFP2_{ox}]}{[roGFP2_{ox}]+[roGFP2_{red}]}$$
$$V^{'}=\frac{OxD^{'}-OxD}{t^{'}-t}$$
At the same time, according to Hypothesis 2, roGFP2total is constant, but the protein                     concentration could not be measured by us. So we thought that under the same promoter conditions,                     the protein concentration was basically the same and according to the data provided in the previous                     literature, it is known that in yeast cells, the Eno2 protein concentration is around 0.5                     mM.[2]
So we could get:
$$[roGFP2_{total}]=0.5\ mM$$
In order to obtain the two constants in the Michealis equation, we measured the reaction rate of the                     reaction in yeast cells by applying different concentrations of H2O2 and                     using the simulation                     results of the H2O2 Decomposition Model in combination with the function of                     roGFP2. The results                     were as follows:

Fig.2 Reaction rate measurement data from wet experiment
Calculate two constants by double reciprocal mapping.
Fig.3 vmax⁡ and Km⁡ calculation using double reciprocal mapping
$$v_{max}=0.015207$$
$$K_{m}=0.451642$$
The relationship between the change in fluorescence intensity of roGFP2 and the concentration of                     intracellular H2O2 is set up successfully.
Summary
Our model has been successfully implemented. Different concentrations of intracellular H2O2 can change                 the spectral properties of our system's roGFP2, and successfully convert our selected ROS signal                 (Intracellular H2O2 concentration) into a visualized fluorescent signal that                 means we can evaluate the                 intracellular H2O2 concentration easily through calculate the OxD value.                 However, due to time and experimental limitation, our model is only a preliminary establishment, and                 its subsequent calibration work is limited by experiment and time, there is"
Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Barriers_-_-_TEXT.html," for drug delivery for various types of diseases there are several hurdles that need to be overcome before they become clinically viable. One major issue is the control of drug delivery. It is essential that the drug be delivered at high enough concentrations to sufficiently induce the appropriate therapeutic effects, yet low enough as to not be toxic to the body. [need to find existing solutions] The inherent toxicity of bacteria also presents an additional challenge. Although these engineered bacteria may appear to non-pathogenic in various healthy animal and human trials, their remaining virulence may still be able to affect patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV and cancer. Scientists have attempted to engineer pathogenic strains bacteria such as Salmonella so that they may have decreased virulence. However, these efforts have not been successful in clinical trials [1].The bacteria remained too virulent to be used inside the human body due to their immunogenicity and pathogenicity outweighing any therapeutic effects[1]. As a result, scientists have been experimenting with nonpathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. This strain that has been shown to be completely non-pathogenic not exporting any toxins. Scientists have been trying to engineer their various systems into this strain, however it has only been shown to be successful in situations where they behave commensally in the gut flora [2].
In addition, since bacterial therapeutics can be variable in their targeting efficiency they pose additional challenges. The problem is that cancer is unique in two ways. First, there are many types of cancer, each of which may have several subtypes. Each cancer subtype has a unique profile, meaning that a single bacterial therapeutic will interact differently with what may at first glance seem like the same type of disease. Secondly, each person's body will interact with the drug differently. Due to this uncertainty, the ideal dosage of the bacterial therapeutic varies between patients, making dosage decisions more difficult and less accurate. These ideas are what Moreover, this lack of consistent targeting efficiency will pose a larger problem for diseases that have metastatic potential. Not only won't the drug be able to spread uniformly, in the case of cancer, throughout the tumor, but also it won't be able to target more distal areas easily.
An additional issue is that the engineered bacteria may be genetically unstable, which may create mutations that alter the pathogenicity or growth potential of the cell itself.
Another problem is the method of delivery itself. Oral delivery of bacterial therapeutics forces bacteria to experience the harsh environment of the GI tract which causes low survival rates. This can be alleviated through higher dosages, but that can then"
