NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Experiment_-_-_TEXT.html," introduce indel mutations, whilst HDR can introduce any donor sequence that we want as long as the donor DNA is flanked by homology regions.
Unfortunately, in living cells, NHEJ occurs more frequently than HDR. Moreover, HDR proteins are expressed only at the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, since these are the phases when sister chromatids have already formed and can serve as a donor should a DSB occur. This poses a problem if we wish to edit non-dividing cells, such as neurons and myocytes. Therefore, improving the efficiency of the HDR pathway is important to enhance the robustness of CRISPR/Cas9.
Therefore, in order to improve HDR efficiency, we tested a fusion protein between SpCas9 and Rad52. Rad52 is one of the HDR proteins involved in mediating ssDNA annealing between homologous sequences and in assisting homologous pairing. The construct was tested in HEK293FT cells and analyzed for the HDR occurrence.
EGFR Project
CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases from a variety of different bacterial species have been studied for their genome editing capabilities, with each nuclease possessing different characteristics. SpCas9 protein, which is a CRISPR/Cas system found in Streptococcus pyogenes, is one of the most common and widely studied CRISPR-Cas types. Besides SpCas9, other Cas9 proteins, as well as the Cpf1 endonuclease, are also of interest to us because of their ability to create blunt or staggered double-stranded breaks in target DNA. This makes them potential candidates for gene inactivation, correction or repurpose. In last year's iGEM project, Team NTU performed the efficiency evaluation for 5 Cas9/Cpf1 endonucleases: Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), Neiserria meningitides Cas9 (NmCas9), Acidaminococcus species (AsCpf1) and Lachnospiraceaebacterium (LbCpf1). In step with the further development and refinement of CRISPR/Cas tools, attempts at introducing the CRISPR/Cas system in vivo through clinical trials have been made. As the application of CRISPR continues to gain traction, we think that there is value in evaluating and determining more suitable CRISPR/Cas systems for therapeutics to facilitate clinical trials for specific diseases.
Therefore, in iGEM 2017, we have decided to investigate the suitability"
Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Project#UnaG_-_-_TEXT.html,"2003011. In this part, the six amino acids were removed (again through PCR), as well as the Serine linker in between. This part has been designed for studying the properties of the protein in vivo, since the high positive charge of the affinity tag could interfere with its function or localization. At each step of the experiments, sequencing was performed using the iGEM standard VF2 and VR verification primers to ensure CDS integrity and especially to avoid introduced frameshift mutations.
Small-scale Expression of UnaG
In addition to mutagenesis experiments, small-scale expression tests were performed to verify that UnaG expresses under our laboratory conditions (Kumagai et.al (2013) purified and crystalized the protein from E.coli, so in theory it should be functional in prokaryotes). BioBricks BBa_K880005 and BBa_K2003010 were 3A assembled and grown overnight in LB. Bilirubin is not very soluble in water, so the stock 1mM solution was prepared in DMSO instead. It seems the molecule does not permeate the cell membrane easily, so appropriate amounts were added to crude cell extracts instead, to a final concentration of 100 µM. Those were obtained by replacing LB-medium with room temperature PBS pH 7.4 containing 1mg/ml lysozyme and breaking open the cells through incubation for 30 minutes and occasional mixing. To avoid unspecific fluorescence, cell debris were pelleted before the experiment and small aliquots of the supernatant were added to 200 µL thin-walled PCR tubes.
Figure 1. Induction of fluorescence of UnaG by the addition of bilirubin. The results verify that UnaG does not fluoresce in absence of bilirubin. The samples are exposed to UV light instead of blue light, hence the fluorescence does not appear green.

We believe that since the Interlab protocol is meant be designed to be as useful as possible for scientists around the world, it should be altered to reflect how most growth assays are currently performed which is to prepare a plate and grow the samples in the plate reader whilst taking regular measurements instead of growing large stocks of the samples and taking aliquots to measure. This would not only be more relevant but also a lot less labour and material intensive.
We were glad to participate in the Interlab study as not only did it count as a Bronze award criterion but many of the skills used in the study were directly applied to our own project, namely the use of plate readers to measure absorbance and fluorescence to characterise our parts. Not only did it help us get acquainted with the machines but there was also valuable information about how much samples should be diluted to get to particular starting OD’s.

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," in cases like colon cancer screening, which incurs an enormous cost for follow-up examinations. So please think carefully what you want to achieve with your biomarker and what the follow up would be.
Is there a large diversity of biomarkers for a specific disease?
--> This depends very much on the disease. I believe that infectious diseases are fairly ‘’easy’’ to diagnose, since the infectious agent expresses proteins that are usually not present in the host organism. That way highly specific assays can be developed based on ligand binding assays. This is very much different for multifactorial disease that affect the wider population and that have lifestyle factors, environmental factors interacting with the organism and its inherent genetic make-up, physiology etc. It is highly unlikely to find single, specific biomarkers for such diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, COPD) and a trend is going towards ‘’biomarker panels’’. It is fair to say that very little has materialized in this respect, as studies are poorly reproducible, study designs inadequate and methods not properly validated. So these aspects are critical to take into account.
What kind of techniques do you use in order to discover new biomarkers ? How do you then evaluate their “strength”?
--> We mainly use LC-MS/MS with a lot of bioinformatics and statistics behind to try and find significant differences between different sets of samples. Validation in separate sets of samples, preferably from different centers, is very important as its proper method validation. Again the ‘’strength’’ of a biomarker depends very much on the context. What would you do with false positives and how important is it to avoid false negatives? Most biomarkers are not stand-alone diagnostics/prognostics but are used in the context of decision-making pipelines, for example based on IHC, CT scans, …
Overall, are the best biomarkers for a specific disease concentrated in a particular body fluid (blood, urine, etc) ? Or is it possible to find them in various body fluids?
--> I think that blood-based body fluids are most widely used in practice, because they are easily obtained. A biomarker may also be found in urine or another body fluid (e.g. CSF) but especially urine levels may be very variable depending on how it was collected and on the metabolic state of the person. Urine is certainly of interest for kidney-related diseases. There is a trend towards so-called extracellular vesicles that circulate in blood for cancer-derived biomarkers, since cancer cells have a more rapid turnover and tend to shed such vesicles (e.g. due to necrosis). However, this"

The lambda phage lysozyme fused to this signal will be transported outside the cell and will attack the Gram Positive contaminants lysing them.
The Kamikaze System induces a strong expression of the T4 endolysin when the Killer receives the contaminant signal. The endolysin is accumulated inside the cell and when its concentration reaches a threshold the own Killer is target of the endolysin breaking the cell wall and lysing the cell, consequently the endolysin is free in the medium to attack the Gram Positives contaminant.
The Colicin System is our most accurate system. After the conjugation between   the Killer and the contaminant, the contaminant receives a plasmid with the colicin gene. This gene is expressed producing the E2 colicin which act as an endonuclease cleaving the contaminant’s DNA leading it to death. The Killer cell have a immunity gene capable of blocking the colicin activity.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," concerning biotechnology and genetic engineering are basic elements of our education at TU Munich. In this context, the handling of biological material, dangerous aspects of chemicals and the circumstances and protocols at the lab we work in are explained. Additionally a special safety briefing was held for all iGEM students by Dr. Martin Schlapschy, who is responsible for safety in Prof. Skerras lab.
All of us have worked in laboratories before and have experience with biological parts and chemicals. When we are unsure about the safety measures that have to be taken when handling certain chemicals and devices, we always have the support of our instructors and the researchers working at Prof. Skerras lab.
Safety precautions during molecular biology experiments
Just like in every other biochemical laboratory, there are substances and devices in our lab which are potentially dangerous. Here are three examples of how these situations are handled in our lab.
In every laboratory of molecular biology, specific chemicals are required for the staining of DNA, in order to make it visible on agarose gels. Most of them directly intercalate into double-stranded DNA, making them carcinogenic. The substance we use is ethidium bromide. To prevent skin contact, we wear protective gloves made from nitrile rubber and change them frequently to prevent contamination. All gels and materials that come into contact with ethidium bromide are disposed of separately. This is done in order to prevent their unintended leakage into the environment with subsequent harm to humans, animals and plants.
Methods of molecular biology often require strong acids or bases, like hydrochloric acid, or toxic substances such as methanol. We handle them with extreme caution under a fume hood and dispose of them separately.
Many devices in the lab can be potentially dangerous towards researchers if they are used carelessly or in the wrong way. One example for this are lamps emitting ultraviolet radiation, which can cause damage to the eyes. When dealing with UV radiation, we always wear safety helmets made out of plexiglas. We are aware of the potential harm caused by devices that we are using and thus can protect ourselves appropriately.

Coloring book
Scientific research is not always a dull work, it can also an interesting experience that everyone could share. In order to spread the fun and attractiveness of synthetic biology, we designed a coloring book. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attention by showing its fun part, following the idea of combining science and art. To our delight, the public were in favor of color painting and they praised our activity for being a good chance to broaden their horizons. Finally, we collected more than 200 painting works. Most surprisingly, kids loved our coloring book very much. With their creative imagination, they developed interests in synthetic biology and at the same time, gave us much courage and inspiration.
We were inspired by the recently popular coloring book Secret Garden, and we learnt from its design. In our coloring book, we simplified several important scientific items into simple stick figures, including DNA chains, viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria, so that people would understand some basic concepts of synthetic biology by painting them. Drawing itself is relaxing and thought-inspiring, and in the form of drawing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, this coloring book will be a carrier of the spirit of scientific research and our wish to bring benefits to the world.
We have brought our coloring book to the Giant Jamboree, hoping that all of you could have fun with it and know more about us. We also want to discuss with the organizers of iGEM abut the perspective of publishing the coloring book, so that the spirit of iGEM could be spread out and keep encouraging more iGEMers to devote their talent and passion.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html," Yet, the notion of standardizing parts is necessary to ensure the accumulation of work in the field.  Both instruments and research methods are standardized in iGEM, resulting in an interesting interaction between crowdsourcing data and preserving data interoperability, where contributors who have varying degrees of expertise and exposure to the field must navigate, then conform to, the knowledge infrastructure’s established standards. For example,  GenoCAD is “a web-based application to design synthetic constructs… [that] is built upon computational linguistic foundation” (Cai, Wilson, Peccoud, 2010) to synthesize the DNA sequences by assembling the necessary parts. This standardizes the instruments used to conduct research. Hence, iGEM encourages the use of advanced technology to conduct research.  However, several problems arise, both in pursuing design specifications for parts (or bricks) submission and also promoting the reusability of such data. One difficulty is spawned from reconciling the nature of the field and standardizing it (Müller & Arndt, 2012).  The registry dictates all parts must have a prefix and a suffix flanking the sequence being submitted, each containing two recognition sites compatible to be cut by a prescribed set of restriction enzymes (EcoRI, XbaI and SpeI, PstI for the first BioBrick Assembly Standard (BBa1.0), for example). Incidentally, several cloning strategies have been implemented so that parts adhere to this requirement.  However, a single protocol which meets the specifications of the project, or alternatively, a method that is independent of sequence composition and size, that also produces successful results within a time constraint, is non-existent and leaves a challenge among participants in the field (Müller & Arndt, 2012).  Despite the drawbacks, such obstacles in data conformity practices are not necessarily prohibitive and the registry’s policy does cultivate a common standard among synthetic biologists (Müller & Arndt, 2012).  In fact, while most labs acknowledge the difficulties with cloning, current solutions are effective enough that impetus for something better is poorly motivated (Müller & Arndt, 2012).
Thus, the data that exist in iGEM are in a format that can be understood by other participants, functionally overcoming some of the inter-institutional barriers of different synthetic biology laboratories. iGEM’s employment of GenoCAD is indicative of its dedication to contribute to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts through adopting new technology. Nonetheless, data exchange between GenoCAD and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts has limitations since"

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates#home_-_-_TEXT.html," a project that fits the needs of the public while maintaining technical viability and high potential for commercialization. Our team did extensive educational outreach in addition to educating ourselves on public perception of our work. We used this input to inform our device design such that it could be implemented in a way that addresses the major concerns of both scientists and consumers. We also took steps to protect our intellectual property and explore the patenting and commercialization process of our product. Finally, our team sought to investigate ethical issues brought up by our discourse with the public by discussing both our work and ethics related to the project with a variety of experts and ethicists.
Educational Outreach
Building on past successes, our team has been devoted to volunteering our services to the community in a number of educational venues. The team took our curriculum, first developed in 2013, and improved the structure and delivery of our lesson plans in the hopes of encouraging awareness and education on topics in synthetic biology. Since 2013 our educational outreach group ECORI (Educating Communities On Research Innovation) has taught our original, interactive curriculum to over 200 students (K-12) and their teachers. This year we also created a mobile exhibit form of our curriculum along with a layman’s introduction to our project that we displayed on over half a dozen weekends to visitors of all ages at the Science Museum of Minnesota. Our curriculum has also been brought to several other STEM fairs and family fun events in the Twin Cities area including the 3M Science Day Fair for 3M employees and their families, UMN Biodiversity Fair, CSE Family Fun Fair, and the Middle School STEM Fair hosted by the Association of Multicultural Students at UMN. Finally, the team designed a Synthetic Biology Game Show that was presented on stage with 30 participants at the Minnesota State Fair to assess the general public’s knowledge of the subject and teach hundreds of passers-by in a way that was both engaging and interactive. Winners were rewarded with reusable bags, magnets, and gift cards donated by our sponsors. In the spirit of science, our curriculum has been ever evolving to constantly address salient topics and educational materials. The variable versions of our curriculum allow it to be flexible and practical in various settings.
Public Perception
Our team sought to inform the majority stakeholders in our community concerning the scope of our project. This year our team chose to have an exhibit catered towards adult residents at the Minnesota State Fair (the largest statewide annual gathering with over 1.8 million visitors each year) to learn how we can best design our technology to meet the needs and concerns of the people whose waters we hope to"

Figure 10: Circuit design of Composite part 3 with FucO and GSH genes. BBa_K2571006 .                 Our construct includes a strong promoter, RBS, FucO, RBS, GSH and double terminator.
Our construct was inserted into pSB1C3 and delivered to the Registry. Our construct was also inserted into pSB1A3 and transferred into KO11 to                  conduct further biochemical assays.
Given that FucO is NADH-dependent, it outperforms other oxidoreductases by not interfering with the NADPH metabolism of the organism while converting highly                  toxic substances, furfural and 5-HMF to non-harmful alcohols. This characteristic of FucO is crucial because the expression of oxidoreductases like Yqhd are                  NADPH-dependent, hence they compete with the biosynthesis for NADPH, which results in inhibiting the growth of the organism.
Glutathione, on the other hand, is recycled using NAD(P)H pathways and since its over-expression with NADH metabolism not being altered thanks                  to FucO, antioxidant capacity of the cell will be increased dramatically; resulting in amplified immunity to both furans and ROS, habilitated cell growth and                  increased ethanol yield by the virtue of increasing cell mass and reproduction, and improved metabolism.
Gel Results

We’ve inserted our composite part 3(BBa_K2571006) in both pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 backbones. The construct in pSB1C3 is for submission to registry and is  cultivated                  in DH5 alpha. The plasmid having pSB1A3 as backbone, thus carrying ampicillin resistance is for our biochemical assays since we’ve chosen the chassis organism                  for assays as E.coli strain KO11 which already has Chloramphenicol resistance in its genome.  After cloning our genes, we’ve made colony PCR to verify our insertions.                  We chose the primers as FucO specific since the composite 3 contains FucO coding region.

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
1.We use ethidium bromide to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories and it is thought to  act as mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA, which indicates that it can be toxic.
2.E.coli may have little effect on human health.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No.E.coli in our lab has nearly no difference with normal innocuous E.coli in nature.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No.E.coli in our lab has nearly no difference with normal innocuous E.coli in nature.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
The leakage of high -rate mutation bacteria may cause variety of problem to public and its result might be catastrophic. Unpredictable diseases caused by the bacteria we structured through mutation may lead to disastrous results,though the possibility of this extreme situation is tiny.

PARTICIPATION IN THE iGEM COMPETITION
Universities in Brazil has attracted increasingly to participate in iGEM competition. The first team to participate in the competition was the State University of Campinas, in 2009, and by 2012 there were only a Brazilian representative per year. However, this year we already have the presence of four teams in Brazil.
The four Brazilian teams that participate in the competition in 2014 are the University of São Paulo (USP) together with the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) and Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar); the second team belongs to the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG); the third to the Federal University of Amazonas; and the latest belongs to the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). The University of Pernambuco is the newest member in the group of Brazilian universities, participating for the first time in 2014, while UFAM and UFMG participate for the second time and USP goes to 3rd participation.
BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS
The industries of Biotechnology in Brazil are in the growth stage, and the capacity and infrastructure in this area vary from sector to sector. According to a survey conducted in 2011, Biominas identified 143 biotechnology companies (Biominas, 2011). By contrast, the work of BrBiotec (2011) estimates that there are 237 biotech companies, a significantly higher number. Bianchi (2013), in a new survey, divided biotech companies in Brazil in three categories and found 92 companies that are solely engaged in biotechnology, as shown in the figure below:
In this set, we consider companies dedicated to Biotechnology and others that belong to this broad universe of companies dedicated to bioscience activities, which carry out activities related to biotechnology. This number also includes companies that operate"
Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html," In order to optimize our colony-PCR protocol (we had some issues with the amount of cells in the tube and the temperature) we made a gradient-PCR with eight RFP-pSB1C3 colonies. We did some colony-PCRs of mPR Dr and Padh1 using the new protocol and cut the plasmid preparations of the positve colony-PCR-colonies. The control restriction showed: Padh1 is positive!
Week 15
We transformed the ligations of of Week 14 into competent cells, performed a plasmid preparation on them and checked the results with colony-PCR and restriction. No postive results. Furthermore we ligated some more parts (Pfet3, Tadh1, Panb1) into pSB1C3 and made some gelextractions of Pfet3 and the plasmids pSB1C3 and pTUM100.
Week 14
We did digested (with E and E/P) all plasmid preparations of parts that seemed to be successful (until now) and had devastating results. We found out that we had had a lot of false positive results because of supercoiled plasmid with bands of the same size as our suspected parts. Only rox1-pSB1C3 and mPR Xl-pSB1C3 were confirmed, all other parts were back at start.
Week 13
This week, we did some transformations of rox1, Padh1, and Psuc2 in pSB1C3 and of Pfet3 and luc in pGEM. The result: rox1, Padh1, Pfet3, and luc had colonies! After controling them, we prepared glycerol-stocks of these constructs. However, Psuc2-pSB1C3 was negative. Since we were running low on money, we experimented with a protocol for plasmid preparations without kit and had some positive results.
Week 12
Again, last week's chemo-competent cells were useless because they had an endogenous AMP resistance - for whatever reason. Thus, we had to create competent cells once again --- this time: no resistance! We attempted a ligation of rox1 in pSB1C3 and ran gels of plasmid preparations of mPR Dr-pSB and mig1-pSB - at first, everything seemed to be positive. As we found out later the band was in fact the supercoiled plasmid!
Week 11
We checked last weeky transformations but had only negative results. In contrast"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Monday (06/04/18)
Lab 1
The students brainstormed ideas on project goals and ideas. After briefing many ideas, the students and Mike ultimately decided to bring a “sense and attack” approach to the project. In theory, the module would be able to move naturally towards jet fuel biofilms via chemotaxis, and a higher concentration of biofilms would allow the module to swim towards biofilms before attacking the biofilm and nullifying it before it destroys the jet fuel. Researchers and students alike were excited at the idea and eager to begin the research.
Lab 2
The RX students eagerly began their first day of work by acquiring their base passes early in the morning.  They then left to UES where they had a meeting with UES employees and they signed papers and contracts to solidify their positions.  They then arrived on base where they were introduced to the colleagues they would be working with inside of the lab and were shown around the lab.  With the assistance of previous year team member, Andrea Poole, they made 2 liters of LB Broth.  They also made 2 liters of LB Agar of which they added Ampisilin and used the solution to pour plates.
Tuesday (06/05/18)
Lab 1
In an effort to reintroduce the students the lab after the break, they began the day by making LB Media. This was also another way to ingratiate the new members of the team to become familiar with real world lab experience and excite them in pursuing the project. Later, the students spent time researching possible project ideas and ways of utilizing quorum sensing and chemotaxis. They spent the day researching in literature and beginning preliminary wiki work.
Lab 2
The students sat through a 3 hour long meeting from 9:00 until around 11:30 as a portion of their in-processing into the RX laboratory.  The students in the lab performed a transformation of the plasmid by placing it into the cell.  After this was accomplished, the students then plated the LB Agar plates.

Danzi_Kesh_8,2015,Team:Danzi Kesh 8#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," no obligation for school to offer non-allergy foods.
In Israel the food offered to students in the educational system is standard, and definitely contains allergy food components, the do not have any substitute. In America there is mainly reference to nuts in foods, however, no reference to gluten or milk for those who have a sensitivity.
The outcome for students who have the disease are to be different, not to use the school cafeteria, eat only at home or stand in line and attempt to use judgement from an early age. 
Conclusion
A.The awareness towards the celiac disease in Israel and the world over is increasing, that is why there is a constant increase in diagnosed patients from year to year. This data increases the target audience that will use the “Alergln” kit in the future.
Since there is no legislation that requires food businesses in marking products containing gluten, there is no legislation requiring the sale of products for people suffering from allergies, the necessity of our kit is vital, even life-saving.
Selling food containing allergenic in the food may embarrass students or prevent them from eating food they can eat. The kit may resolve the dilemma and avoid the embarrassment of a student who is standing hungry in the cafeteria.
Prices of gluten-free food are very high, most food products are labeled as suspected presence of celiac allowing food manufacturers to often increase profits for food products that do not necessarily contain gluten. The ""Alergln"" will save quite a lot of money for celiac sufferers and their families in the future.
There must be an ain the activity dealing with awareness of food containing allergens in order to find more patients and to prevent life-threatening situations.
Alergln as a social project
The State of Israel in 2015 is home to approximately -60 000 celiac patients and their number is growing from year to year. Celiac disease does not require being reported and therefore there is no official data, and the existing data is constantly changing. According to the evaluation of the Celiac Association in Israel there are approximately 35,000 diagnosed, of which 30% are adult patients (over age 30), 50% of children aged up to age 18 and the rest in different age groups.
In the last decade there has been a rise in awareness of celiac disease, this is the reason that the diagnosed is increasing. Knowing that this is a genetic disease makes it possible to expand in the area of the family the explanation for colic and diarrhea attacks to the family members diagnosed. 
In this way the target population has grown from year to year and therefore the awareness of routine life of c"

4.3 Barcode DNA for Nanopore Sequencing
Aim: Develop a system to generate DNA barcodes within sequencing adapters for the identification of sample’s subject.
Approach: Minimizing sequencing time and costs is accomplished by implementing our targeted sequencing approach. During our interaction with stakeholders, Prof. Hagan Bayley from Oxford University (one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies) suggested multiplexing with  additional barcoding to reduce time and costs.  Multiplexing is the simultaneous sequencing of multiple samples from different athletes using one sequencing device. To assign the output sequences to the corresponding athlete, the output sequence should be labeled with an athlete specific mark. We designed a system to embed a personal DNA barcode for each subject. Implementing barcode length of 17 nucleotides would provide enough variation to cover every single person on Earth. We developed a tool that generates a 17 nucleotide unique sequence that indicates specific features from athletes. For more details on this module, please visit our improvement page .
4.4 Nanopore Targeted Sequencing
Aim:
Sequence different DNA samples (plasmid and linear) prepared with ONT fragmentation kit on a MinION device.
Assess whether DNA that has not been processed with transposase is identified and sequenced with MinION sequencing.
Replace fragmentation step from Rapid Sequencing Kit with targeted integration of sequencing adapter by fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5.
Approach: Sample with pool of different DNA molecules We generated different DNA molecules to mimic gene doping. These molecules included intronless EPO (insert in BBa_K2643004 ), EPO with unnatural introns ( BBa_K2643005 & BBa_K2643006 ), and EPO in a plasmid ( BBa_K2643004 ). We used a pool of these molecules at different molar ratios to perform library preparation with rapid sequencing kit from ONT and sequenced them using a flow cell FLO-MIN 106. After sequencing, we base called, filtered and aligned the data generated to a reference sequence for analysis in distinguishing different sources of different groups of reads.

Decoding – costs and fidelity
The cost of sequencing DNA has plummeted in the last two     decades. For instance, in the early 2000’s it took 13 years and $3     billion US dollars to sequence the entire human genome. With     current technologies, we have approached the $1,000 dollars mark. This development can be seen in figure 6. In     fact, since 2007 you can have your whole DNA sequenced for less     than that! However, there are still issues with the fidelity and     accuracy of the readings obtained that would prevent them from     being used for our system [27] .
Figure 6. Price of sequencing one million of base pairs. Prices dropped     from 2007, when second generation techniques were introduced in the     marked. Source: National Human Genome Research Institute
Existing laboratory-level DNA sequencing technologies typically     allow for a reading error of ~1%. Thanks to optimization and     fine-tunning, traditional readings using Sanger biochemistry offer     now accuracies of up to 99.999% in a read length of 1,000 bp. With     modern, second generation or cyclic sequencing, higher reading     lengths have been achieved but with a decrease in accuracy [26] .
Among the bioencryption layers, CryptoGErM prevents unauthorized     parties from reading the message by having a high ratio of decoy     spores that contain a useless sequence. In addition, if the right     growing conditions are not supplied our system prevents germination     and replication of spores that do contain the message. So, what     ratio of decoy:spores do I need to prevent brute force sequencing and     message retrieval from a third party? (see figure 7)
Figure 7. A) One of the bioencryption bilayers is having a      high proportion of decoy spores vs those that do contain the      intended useful sequence. If the right conditions are not met      (i.e. adding an X antibiotic to the system) those spores that      contain our message will die and be outgrown by the decoy. B)      Current sequencing techniques will not be able to distinguish      the hidden message from noise.
Fox et. al. (2014) reports that there is a 50% chance of     accurately distinguishing a true subclonal variant from a     sequencing artifact in an excess of 100 wild-type DNA sequences     using standard Q30 filter reads (error rate: 10-2) [23] . In     agreement with that result, in"

1. Preparation of APs for PREDCEL: After all AP variants have been generated and their sequences were confirmed, electro competent cell strains were produced (according to our protocol for electro competent cells), each containing one ORI variant.
To start the first PREDCEL attempt the AP 1030 pBR ORI competent cells were chosen, as this is the strongest ORI and serves as a control to see whether something does happen or not. At the same time the AP 1030 pBR competent cells were transformed with MP6 to also generate a strain that produces mutations for later PREDCEL experiments.
2. First PREDCEL run: The first PREDCEL run was conducted with AP 1030 competent cells (lacking MP6). The aim of this experiment was to see whether the addition of theophylline or caffeine to the AP strain (containing gene 3 and the chaperone protein for the CYP1A2) lead to an increasing phage titer, as gene 3 is crucial for phage propagation. Based on literature, theophylline and caffeine concentrations have been defined that were used in this experiment. So we chose to add 100 �M theophylline, 500 �M caffeine and 5mM caffeine. Also two different sample time points have been defined, after one hour and after 16 hours. The outcome of this experiment was checked by Plaque Assyas. Not to forget to mention, that besides the Theophylline SP also Dickinsons SP was used as a control.

Chart 1. Dry Weight of Metarhizium in different concentration of L-Tryptophan
Fig.18 Dry Weight of Metarhizium in different concentration of L-Tryptophan
We can see the chart and graph that, in the liquid czapek, the Dry Weight of Metarhizium stay in a stable level from 0% of [Trp] to 0.08% of [Trp], because it didn’t grow at this low concentration. At the L-Trp concentration of 0.09% or higher, its dry weight grow as the concentration of L-Tryptophan grow.
From our experiment we can see that, the limited Tryptophan concentration for Metarhizium to survive is 0.9% of Tryptophan.

Anthocyanin
The magenta pigment will be anthocyanin, a pigment commonly found in plants. It is produced using the following genes: DFR, which codes for Dihydroflavenol 4-reductase (Anthurium andraeanum), F3H, which codes for 3B hydroxylase (Malus domestica), ANS, which codes for Anthocyanin synthase (Malus domestica), and 3GT, which codes for 3-o-glucosyltransferase (Petunia hybrid) (Figure 6).  The E. coli membrane transporter yadH has also been shown to export anthocyanin from the cell (Yan et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2015).  The DFR, F3H, ANS and 3GT genes constitute a pathway that converts eriodictyol into anthocyanin (Figure 7) and overexpressing the yadH transporter in E. coli has been shown to increase anthocyanin yields (Lim et al., 2015).  A key reason for choosing to produce anthocyanin as opposed to a different pigment, is that it can change color according to the pH level of its environment (Yan et al., 2008). This may allow us to have more versatility in making ink of different colour and shades, simply by adjusting the pH of the solvent. The efficacy of this method has yet to be determined.  Previous constructs for anthocyanin production have been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry (BBa_K1497023).

Zeaxanthin
The yellow will be zeaxanthin, and will be produce by a modified carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. The genes used will be crtY and crtZ, which come from the organism Pantoea ananatis (Figure 8). The crtY gene encode a lycopene cyclase and crtZ and codes for beta-carotene hydroxylase (Sedkova et al., 2005, Misawa et al., 2007). We will attempt to skip the first steps of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway to"

Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.

extracted about 750 uL of double dialyzed silk.
aliquoted 20 uL of concentrated dope, allowed to dry at 60 C
weight of empty weigh boat: 0.596 grams
weight of weigh boat + dry silk: 0.600 grams
calculated w/v%: 20% w/v.
Received a fraction of Tamura from Fasih and Jessica
We need to dilute down the silk concentrate before spinning. I do not know the concentration of the Tamura, so I will be assuming that the Tamura is dilute enough to treat as water in the calculations. That is to say, instead of diluting the silk dope with water, I will be diluting it with the Tamura fraction.
Let's spin 250 uL of the Tamura.
To obtain 250 uL of ""15% w/v silk,"" we need 187.5uL of the 20% w/v silk dope, and 62.5 uL of the Tamura fraction.
However, before adding the Tamura fraction, we need to ensure that there are no particulates
Currently, the fraction has a lot of particulates -- probably some coagulated silk, as well as some of the resin.
Aliquot 500 uL of the fraction into a tube. Centrifuge at 5000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4 C.
Transfer supernatant to a syringe with a filter tip, then inject into a new tube.
Some problems
Upon centrifugation, both the resin and the silk particles settle at the tube bottom (checked under UV box)
I aliquoted another 250 uL of the fraction to syringe filter, all of the silk particles were trapped in the filter (checked"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"

Why Choose to Spend Money on Interplanetary Explorations?
Scientific Development
Mars is the most realistic target in our solar system for a future in sustainable development in space. Although sending robots on Mars is a safe and cost effective method in exploring our neighboring planet, experts in the field say that it is incomparably slow to human researchers. Furthermore, robots would not be able to conduct many desired investigations such as discovering life on Mars. These investigations are critical because not only do we learn more about Mars but we learn about our own planet. Mars’ dry and cold temperature was very similar to Earth's warm and wet climate at one point. This change begs the question of what happened to Mars, and whether the Earth will one day have a similar fate? However, we cannot answer these questions with just Earth being our single point of reference. To find the answers to these questions, we need to create a sustainable environment to host human researchers on Mars.
Inspiration
Not only does traveling to Mars have scientific benefits, it can also be used to inspire future generations and progress our society. It can drive interests in the STEM field, as well as challenge and inspire future mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. It is critical that we make scientific progress because we are laying down the foundation for future generations to build upon.
Inevitability
If our human race is to survive, space exploration and space colonization is an inevitability.  Although we prioritize immediate problems, we must look past short sighted goals and began working towards our goals years into the future. Since Mars has the biggest potential for sustainable development, with water and an atmosphere, it will be a valuable way for humans to test colonization in space.
Spin-Off Technologies
To advance space exploration, there are constantly new developments and innovations. By-products of such innovations are discoveries called spin-off technologies that can be applicable in solving problems on Earth. An example of a spin-off technology from space is CT scans, used in hospitals. When Nasa’s engineers were tackling the task of finding safe landing spots in the dusty geography of the moon, they created a system that uses high-frequency sound waves and magnets that can scan potential landing"

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," biocontainment is not demonstrated, even if positive results are obtained.
Bacteria have a high growth rate and can spread and mutate quickly. This aspect is all the more frightening as bacteria are microscopic and thus the risk is invisible. When the invisible can have an impact on the visible, fear might arise.
On the other hand it is also crucial to make sure that our molecules do not have a negative impact on the bees.
Early on in the project, we thought about how best to address the biocontainment issue regarding our bacterial system. Thus we have decided to put our bacteria in a small plastic bag. This specific plastic called TPX® is microporous and the size of the pores will not allow the bacteria to pass through. We also chose to place this bag in a solid device , adding yet another barrier between the bacteria and the environment.
As mentioned before, ethics was a dimension that was present from the very first stages of the development of our project. During the summer, we had the great chance to meet and talk with a few ethicians: M. Vincent Gégoire-Delory, M. Simon Desbois and Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen. They helped us develop our reflexion and they also shared their knowledge with us while still having the skill to let us think by ourselves.
We further realized that the iGEM competition is the perfect moment to develop our ethical thinking. Indeed, beeing able to use ethics at an early stage of a scientific project is not only a great opportunity but also a true advantage compared to being included in an already existing project in which you may not have time to think critically. The ability to carry out this type of deliberation, to question one’s own work, is what singles out a good scientist, in our opinion.
Finally, we would like to share with you this quote by Arthur M. Schlesinger that underlines something that we have learned this summer:
Science and technology revolutionize our lives, but memory, tradition and myth frame our response.
Any ethical reflection, to be pertinent, has to root itself in a society’s history, tradition and beliefs. This is the way in which one will be able to identify the barriers and the fears of the public, and understanding them is the first step to conquer them.

Perhaps more convincingly the importance the Chinese government places on synthetic biology development, synthetic biology was recently identified as a key industry for China’s Five-Year Plan (which was recently published in 2016) [16].
Singapore (a notably different country from China) has similarly invested $25 million (about USD 18.2 million) in its recently-launched “Synthetic Biology Research and Development Programme”, which includes groundbreaking projects ranging from exploring uncharted biosynthetic pathways for the production of medical cannabinoids, to engineering microorganisms that are able to convert readily available and renewable substrates into valuable organic compounds. In 2015, Singapore set-up its first research centre dedicated to synthetic biology, SynCTI, at the National University of Singapore with the aim of anchoring Singapore as a leading Synthetic Biology Hub in the world. In 2016, the Singapore Consortium for Synthetic Biology, SINERGY, was launched in order to create a vibrant and globally connected bio-based economy in Singapore [17].
Likewise in Australia, where the Australian Council of Learned Academies recently published a outlook report on the prospects, opportunities, and issues associated with synthetic biology [18]. Synthetic biology was identified as critical to Australian economic development - from complementing and supporting the continuous growth of industries in which Australia has been traditionally strong in, i.e. agriculture, to providing new opportunities for further research and development, in the fields of health and medicine, and the environment. The focus on synthetic biology has been welcomed by the Australian government, whose Research Infrastructure Investment Plan supports research initiatives and studies into synthetic biology.
Compared to chemically synthesized products, bio-manufacturing offers a competitive advantage for producing products that are both economically viable and ecologically sustainable. An appealing option nowadays, as both consumers and governments are changing consumption patterns and policy regulations to take into account the negative externality that is environmental pollution. An example of the competitive advantage in environmental sustainability that synthetic biology can offer is optogenetic regulation. This new tool in synthetic biology provides the potential to eliminate chemical-dependent control, removing the carbon footprint from chemical production and waste treatment and further enhancing its environmental sustainability.
Synthetic biology is an emerging market with many techniques and tools that have yet to mature [19]. Strong governmental support is required to aid in the development of this market, but current signs for its development are promising. Recent start ups such as Zymergen and Ginkgo Bioworks have experienced explosive growth and are making big waves in the synthetic biology industry. Synthetic biology itself has shown potential for high applic"

89% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that iGEM should sub-categorize the “WORKS” comment into 1) “Quantitative”      for parts which are characterized with experiments and 2) “Qualitative”      for parts which are not characterized will be an appropriate measure      for standardization of Biobrick database.
In order to overcome these problems we suggest enforcing the working     conditions title for the registry entrance, in order to collect quantitative     experimental details on submitted parts, which might slow down the registration     process but will definitely increase the quality of the database.
61% of participants agree that POPS (Polymerase Per      Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks with a promoter,      where appropriate. - 57% of participants have been agree that RIPS      (Ribosome per Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks      with a RBS brick.
Though most participants agree the need for POPS and RBS information     , they are concerned about the workload it would bring to individual     labs.
“To do this, the Registry need to define a reliable and easy method     of determining the PoPS for teams to use. However, I would say that     there are better systems for quantifying promoter output than PoPS,     and they should be used instead, if possible”.
67% of participants have thought that entering POPS      information should not be mandatory while submitting new parts.      Similarly, 65% of participants disagree that entering RIBS information      should be mandatory while submitting new parts
Even though the researchers feeling the need for this information     they are shying away from requesting it as a mandatory title for parts     registry as it would be difficult for underfunded and inexperienced     groups to perform these measurements.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would be even better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately.
82% of participants have thought that information on      working conditions of the parts should be mandatory while submitting      new parts.

As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation to a metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucleotides (the chemically converted substrate nucleotides). Those must then be merged with Amplification Droplets, wherein every droplet contains the same amount of amplification reagents and Reference Nucleotides. After the droplet merging, each droplet now contains a ratio of Product nucleotides to Reference Nucleotides. If the catalytic biomolecule was highly active, the ratio of Product Nucleotides to Reference Nucleotides will be high. In contrast, if the biomolecule activity was low, the ratio will also be low.
These specific nucleotide ratios in droplets can then be recorded into DNA, by the means of DNA amplification. As DNA is amplified in each droplet, specific ratio of nucleotides is incorporated into the copy of initial template. Such amplification results in molecules that both encode the sequence of a specific biomolecule and information about that particular biomolecules’ catalytic activity.
Proof of concept
We now have a population of droplets, wherein each droplet contains a specific amount of Product Nucleotides or 2'-deoxycytidine triphosphates.
As already mentioned earlier, we have chosen to use MDA reaction in order to amplify the DNA isothermally. Isothermal amplification allows us to amplify the DNA without disrupting the stability of the droplets. Also, for the Reference Nucleotides, we have decided to use Methylated Cytidines (2'-deoxy-5-methylcytidine 5'-triphosphates). These Reference Nucleotides can be readily incorporated by multiple polymerases, including Phi29 which we use for our MDA reaction.
Next, we need to merge our Substrate Droplets with the Amplification Droplets containing the MDA reaction mix. Droplet merging is not an easy task to achieve, as efficient merging requires precise tuning of multiple parameters, such as 4 different droplet and oil flow rates and the strength of the electrical field that helps the droplets to merge. Searching for these parameters experimentally can often be like searching for a needle in a haystack. For this reason, before starting to do droplet merging experiments in the laboratory, we have written a thorough mathematical model which describes the droplet merging in detail and has the ability to predict the correct experimental parameters. We have successfully determined those parameters and showed experimentally, that they were indeed well-performing conditions for the droplet merging.
Substrate Droplets could then be merged with Amplification Droplets containing MDA mix and Reference Nucleotides.
Each merged droplet now contains a"

Week 7: June 16th - 20th
On the 16th the human practices team met with Dr. Lisa Allen who has a biomedical background and a PhD in Public and Global Health.  She has had direct international experience with misdiagnosis of malaria, working in a rural hospital in Tanzania since 2008. After discussing potential priorities of their impact with the hospital and the community, it was determined that malaria was perceived as the biggest issue. The medical officer in charge thought malaria diagnosis was ineffective, so the main task of their presence was to improve the situation. 95% of patients were diagnosed with malaria based on microscopy; however pregnant women and children under 5 malaria had a default diagnosis of malaria for a fever.  In the region in which Dr. Allen worked, actual malaria cases were declining due to high altitude and the temperature drop to 4∘ Celsius during the night.  Despite this decline the diagnosed cases of malaria were showing no decrease, despite the low potential for infection.  Citizens of this area would automatically assume that that fever is malaria, culturally using this inclusive term to describe any similar illness, similar to how our society using the term “flu” to describe what is potentially different health issues.  Dr. Allen emphasized that awareness and education of other neglected infectious diseases was imperative, as this mindset of clinicians was part of the problem.  Missing a case of malaria is considered “unforgivable” therefore overdiagnosis is present.  Clinicians are aware of the algorithms for diagnosis of other diseases, but usually do not have lab capacity for bacterial infections. Having “safer than sorry” mindset, patients often receive both antimalarial drugs and antibiotics in the hopes it will treat malaria, and whatever other diseases exist if it happens not be malaria.  Overdiagnosis and treatment  with both antimalarial drugs and antibiotics result in a great economic impact on institutions and patients, shortage of antimalarial drugs, and increasing drug resistance. Patients pay for their prescription drugs, and if the diagnosis is not accurate and treatment is unsuccessful, patients waste their personal resources. Dr. Allen also looked into rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) what clinicians think of them. Many seems"

It's important to understand the difference between the software darwin and the utility dwndiff. Over the summer, the team produced dwndiff, which is a command-line utility for producing what are called ""diff"" files suitable for use with genomic data. darwin, on the other hand, is the overall vision of the software team: to produce a solution for tracking changes to all sorts of genomic data. Given input files in FASTA, GenBank, or ApE format, the dwndiff utility can speedily produce output files which can be used with an external version control system much more easily. Examples of such version control systems include git, svn, and hg.
Using dwndiff is somewhat complex at first, but let's start with the most obvious solution: the ""help"" command:
$ dwndiff --help       Usage: dwndiff [OPTION...] FILE...       dwndiff is a command-line tool to format DNA sequences for use in version       control systems. It is intended to be used as a backend for version control       tools which act upon biological data. It defaults to 'format' mode, where it       formats a given DNA sequence (through stdin, or the given files) to a special       format, appending the '.vcsfmt' suffix. If given the '-c' option, however, it       will take two files, convert them to .vcsfmt format if necessary, and produce a       .vcscmp file which can be used in version control software.        -p, --preformat_loc=DIR    Location of pre-existing .vcsfmt files for given       input DNA       -w, --write                Write output to file(s) instead of stdout       -c, --compare              If two files given, produce unix diff-compatible       comparison .vcscmp file       -v, --verbose              Produce verbose output       -?, --help                 Give this help list       --usage                Give a short usage message       -V, --version              Print program version        Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional       for any corresponding short options.
Let's break this down into multiple cases:
Given a genomic file, convert it to a version-controllable format, which we call vcsfmt.
Given two vcsfmt, find the difference betweem them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcsc"

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," shortage of biological membranes, from the phospholipid bilayer at the smallest scale to the keratin-based epidermis of mammals, the structure that has to tolerate the highest pressures is probably the arterial wall. The natural solution to the high pressures and repeated expansion and contraction is a mixture of the proteins elastin and collagen. Elastin, as the name suggests, forms highly elastic fibers that provide membranes with resilience, but it has a low ultimate tensile strength. Collagen picks up the slack in that regard; up to a certain strain, collagen provides low resistance as the fibers orient parallel to the stress and then “un-krimp,” but after that point it sharply limits extension and strengthens the membrane. When the force required to extend a collagen-elastin composite is graphed against the extension of the fiber, the resulting plot takes the general shape of the plot on the right.
Elastin Collagen Stress Strain Curve.
The area under the green curve is a measure of energy stored at a certain extension. Compared to a single material with comparable ultimate tensile strength and strain, a combined elastin and collagen membrane stores much less energy when stretched. This energy is what drives fracture propagation, so less energy stored makes the composite more robust to minor damage.
Both elastin and collagen are made up of long, repetitive protein monomers; this makes them difficult to synthesize recombinantly via most standard methods, but opens up new avenues for production. Elastin and collagen, however, lend themselves to vastly different means of production. More detail on those means can be found in their respective pages.
poly-pABA
While the material poly-pABA may not bring many features to mind, and the name p-aramid is hardly more recognizable than that, the name Kevlar® almost certainly rings a bell. That brand recognition stems primarily from the use of the fibers in bulletproof vests, but it can be used to reinforce gloves or even balloons. A number of other less well-known polymers with similar properties all fall under the umbrella of aromatic polyamides, or aramids. While we aren't aiming for a bulletproof balloon by any stretch, when we learned that a close analog of Kevlar® could be produced from a monomer already found naturally in many cells, we could hardly resist exploring means of overproduction.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," of the problems they need to tackle, responding to the ecological crisis will only have a marginal effect on the social system in which policies are formulated. Consequentially, fears lead to insecurity out of the inability of expertise to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding certain technologies. These, then, turn into the main driving forces in dealing with environmental hazards. Now, the focus of industrial and environmental policy becomes one of reducing the impact of industrial practices instead of reforming the practice altogether. Eventually, a risk society can self-correct itself by adopting a reflexive attitude toward the technologies and institutions so that society can have the opportunity the rehabilitate. The acceptance of a decline in trust in them hence turns the continuous anxiety from growing uncertainties into an objective to ensure mechanisms of accountability (Cohen 1997).
Chapter 1: Synthetic Biology for Environmental Reform
Seeking Ecological Innovation
Many emerging technologies have often been proclaimed to be paramount when it comes to addressing the impediments to sustainable developments in society. This also applies to synthetic biology as it promises to deliver solutions in wide range of areas that require innovative efforts. The U.S. National Research Council, for example, has indicated that this kind of New Biology has the potential to bring great benefit to society in terms of the sustainable production of food and biofuels, the restoration of ecosystems, and the improvement of human health (National Research Council (U.S.) et al. 2009: 6). There is an ongoing narrative which describes the impact of synthetic biology in revolutionary terms as to how ecological issues are being addressed. This suggests that this narrative follows a discourse of ecological modernisation in the way technological innovation enables society to set out a trajectory for social and environmental change (Mol and Jänicke 2009). Organisers of the iGEM competition hold on to this conceptual premise as well. In his final address to the competitors of iGEM 2013, the President of the iGEM Foundation, Randy Rettberg, compared the future development of synthetic biology with the invention of tools that sparked revolutionary changes throughout the course of history. According to him, during the industrial revolution and information revolution, the machine and the computer respectively have been the cause for these kind of drastic changes. Both technologies, he argues, ‘changed everything’ since energy and information appeared to be ‘a fundamental aspect of nature’. In the light of synthetic biology, he predicts however that ‘the next revolution’ will be ‘about being good at material’ using biological systems as the appropriate tools (iGEM 2013b).
This technological optimism has also been translated into finding solutions for environmental problems as"

3. Plasmid purification
Culture of E-coli: Select single colonies from plate culture medium then inoculate them into 1-3ml liquid nutrient medium containing antibiotics, then culture them at 37 degrees Celsius overnight. (Usually the culture time is 12-16 hours, because if the cells have been cultured over 16 hours, it is hard to lysis the cells so that plasmid production will decrease. Besides, the medium should not be excessive, because too many bacteria are difficult to be fully lysised so that plasmid purity is affected.)
Collect 1-4ml overnight culture of bacterial fluid, then centrifuge it at 12000rpm for 2 minutes and throw away the filtrate.
Use 250μl Solution | (be sure that RNase A is added to Solution |) to fully suspend the bacterial precipitation. (Pay attention not to leave over small pieces of bacteria. Vortex can be used to make the bacteria fully suspended)
Add 250μl Solution || and gently blend the solution by turning it up and down for 5-6 times to make the bacteria fully lysis until the solution becomes transparent. (Be sure to blend the solution gently instead of oscillating fiercely, and this step should be no more than 5 minutes.)

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair did another double digest on the CaMV promoter and pSBIC3 plasmid; this was followed by a ligation and then ran on a gel. Ben Jevans and Gurdeep re-did another PCR of their Ble gene mutants grown in the same medium used before.  They then ran this on a gel which got some results. Ben Jevans and Gurdeep then grew three different site-directed mutagensis cultures  from three separate colonies in LB broth overnight. Mario and Mark ordered some essential consumables including phleomycin antibiotic and dNTP for use in PCR.
Ben Jevans and Gurdeep gathered their cultures made from the previous day and did another miniprep. After this they ran there results on a gel and performed a nanodrop; results did not look to promising. Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair ran a gel on all their digested DNA parts; results yet again did not look to promising. They then did a nanodrop on the luciferase PCR product and pSBIC3 to determine the DNA concentration for future digests. Mario and Mark started researching ingredients for an assay buffer to test bioluminescence in the E.coli transformants. Mario and Mark went on to do some wiki work and help Abbie,Ben Hardy and Alistair with the moss transformation.
This morning Gurdeep worked on the wiki by adding additional context to the methods and lab journal. Gurdeep and Abbie then carried out a miniprep and gel electrophoresis on new cultures of the bleomycin gene, which unfortunately once again showed no bands, leading to no results. Ben Jevans made 15 new cultures from the colonies created from the Bleomycin resistant plates, ready for tomorrows miniprep procedure. Alistair also made new cultures from the transformed E.coli with GFP and YFP. Kimberley confirmed the images and lesson plan she would be using for her SAW project.
The day began with Gurdeep, Ben and Abbie performing minipreps on the cultures from the bleomycin resistant colonies. They performed minipreps on 5 cultures each and compared results through a nanodrop and gel electrophoresis. However, once again the news wasn’t good, there were no bands again. On a positive note, Alistair also carried out a miniprep followed by gel electrophores"

We got you!
Congratulations, you just clicked on one of our Easter Eggs in the iGEM TU Darmstadt2018 wiki, now you are on our FUN Page. This page cannot be found in our menu bar and if you found it, please tell no one you did or even how. So, let's play a little game, if you found all of our Easter Eggs in this wiki, come to us at the Giant Jamboree and tell us how many there are. When your answer is right you will get a small surprise.
Additionally, on this page we show pictures of our iGEM year 2018 and of all the fun we had.
This year’s iGEM team of TU Darmstadt is shaped by an intense team spirit. Learning about SynBio was always the central point of our team. During our time in the lab, everyone learned to be patient with microorganisms and different biological methods. No matter, how precise the preparations for an experiment have been, all kind of mistakes happened. One of our most stupid mistakes resulted in an award instead of punishment.  For this some examples are given:
Person 1: why stands this bottle on the table with an open lid?
Person 2: It´s the liquid waste.
Person 1: Nope, that is LB-media
Person 2: ohhhh….
♯sterilworkisourprofession
Or
Application of pressure to the chemical apparatus where a plug was not secured. The result was a flying plug in the fume cupboard
Or

Modelling with SVCE
UK Meet-up
In August we co-hosted the annual UK iGEM meetup together with the University of Westminster and the University of Warwick . Meetups are the closest iGEM teams get to a Jamboree experience before November. With poster/ powerpoint presentations, interactive debates and lectures on current topics by SynBio experts, meetups are the perfect opportunity to hear about other iGEM teams’ projects and to form collaborations on similar topics.
Collaborating with  two other universities allowed us to span the meetup over days, giving the members of different teams more time to share iGEM experiences. We spent quite a bit of time setting up a schedule offering a variety of activities at various locations across London (University of Westminster Cavendish Campus; UCL main campus and Warwick Business School in the Shard).
Modelling with SVCE
Throughout the summer we had a bilateral collaboration with the iGEM SVCE 2017 team from India. Our collaboration started off with us sending each other useful sources and tutorials on how to approach modelling for cellular mechanisms, as neither team considered themselves an expert in the field. Once we both started forming the differential equations for our respective models, we sent each other documents with a summary of our ODEs and provided feedback to each other. SVCE helped us getting started with our LEGIT model . Both teams provided constructive feedback on how to present complex information in a simple manner to make it easy to understand for non-modellers, while at the same time we helped refine each other’s differential equations."

The intention was to expose our peers to our project and inform them of the existence of the iGEM competition to motivate the freshmen to form their own team and ensure an unbroken succession of teams from our institute and also to obtain feedback and suggestions from faculty members.
The turnout for the event was around 150 people. Like any normal poster session, after each round of presentation, questions were taken and the audience was asked to give their comments in writing. The PDF of the poster presented there can be found here . The poster has been displayed below:

Supplementary Results: Effect of Population Mesh Density on Steady State RBC Population
The density of the population mesh determines how many mesh points each day is split into. A mesh density of 10 means there are 10 points per day (\(\Delta t = \Delta \mu = \) 0.1 days), while a mesh density of 100 means there are 100 points per day (\(\Delta t = \Delta \mu = \) 0.01 days). Figure 26 shows that increasing the density of the population mesh results in a reduction in the difference (error) between the steady state solution and the dynamic steady state solution. It also shows that increasing the mesh density increases the run time of the model exponentially.
Figure 26. Effect of mesh density on run time and error reduction. (a) Shows the reduction in error due to the increase of mesh density. (b) Shows the effect of mesh density on the model run time. (c) Shows the error reduction plotted against the model run time.
The error in the dynamic model with a mesh density of 100 and the steady state model is 0.55%. This is an acceptable degree of error between the two models. The error in the dynamic model is reduced by 0.015% by increasing the population mesh from 100 to 200. The run time of the model is increased from about 2.5 minutes to around 15 minutes when increasing the mesh density from 100 to 200. For these reasons the mesh density was kept at 100 throughout the EPO gene doping tests.
Supplementary Results: Effect of Initial Population Mesh on Dynamic Steady State RBC Population
The red blood cell feedback loop on EPO release from the kidneys was implemented to determine the dynamic effect of changing EPO concentration. The initial population of the mesh was varied to determine is the starting conditions had an effect on the final steady state. The initial mesh was set to 0, steady state values, a population of 1010 at each maturity point, and a population of 1011 at each maturity point. Negative populations were not considered.
Figure 27: Effect of the initial population in the population mesh on the final steady state of the dynamic model.
For every initial population mesh, with the population density set to 100, the dynamic model reached a steady state of 24.59 trillion red blood cells. Due to the combination of feedback loops"

On the one hand, for the   existence of the world's serious copper and cadmium pollution situation, our   project can provide viable solutions and ideas. On the other hand, while some areas   are seriously polluted, other regions even ignore the investigation of copper and   cadmium pollution. Our projects can, to a certain extent, contribute to the   attention of these countries for copper and cadmium pollution
Through the mapping of copper and cadmium pollution in the world, we understand the   pollution of copper and cadmium around the world, but because of constraints of our   team’s human resourse and time, the world copper and cadmium pollution map has a   lot room for improvement, we sincerely hope and welcome other teams to   participate in this work.
At the same time we would like to be able to play our own efforts to hold some   science popularization activities, which aimed to attach importance to the issue of   heavy metal pollution. In order to be able to make a real and effective database   containing heavy metal pollution data around the world, we also launched an   invitation on the official website of collaboration called for more iGEM teams to   join our alliance or to provide some data and information. As a result, we received   mails from iGEM EXETER,  iGEM CSMU X NCHU TAIWAN and Nazarbayev University, and   Exeter provided us with European data and shared their own protocol with us.
E-mails sent by iGEM EXETER and Nazarbayev University
Besides, CSMU X NCHU TAIWAN provided us with statistical information on heavy   metal pollution in Taiwan and listed the major pollution incidents in Taiwan in   recent years for us.

According to the results provided by the database, by using the alliance’s forces, we speared the questionnaire designed by us about the situation of heavy metal pollution throughout the country, and in the end, we received nearly 1,000 replies.
Consultation in many ways
In this situation, we consulted Professor Qu Hongyan who worked at the School of   Environmental Sciences at Tianjin University. He told us that the study of heavy   metal removal from groundwater was a very important subject that still needed to be   studied."

Checking on 1/100 ul and 1/10000 ul 78, 79, and 82 plates
We got colonies on all the plates,  but the 1/100 ul plates look a bit crowded. On the other hand, the 1/10000 plates only have a few colonies. We decided to save both plates, and decide which to use later.
Based on these results, a 1/1000 ul dilution might be best.
Check on 85 culture
There was no growth in our culture.
Later: It ends up that our ultramer from 85 (Pos Con 77) had an error in it. Instead of coding for fingers 2 and 3, it codes for fingers 1 and 2. We ordered a new ultramer, and we no longer need to work on 85.
Finalizing the practice plate
We decided on using a practice plate with 24 oligos, consisting of 18 target sequences, and 6 controls. Our 6 controls are Zif268, OZ052, OZ123, and 3 sequences from the CODA table. We will need to construct the expression plasmid for Zif268, OZ052, and OZ123. Their ultramers were ordered today.
Our 18 targets were GNN/TNN sequences, which are more likely to have a binder, and were distributed among the backbones. The target and control groups each have their own set of primers, to facilitate picking them from the pool.

3.5 Test Design
3.5.1 Q: why should we standardize our test method?
A: To evaluate the reaction of these gene modified worms, we find some different aspects to observe them which are the trace, the speed and its angle when the C.elegent makes a turn. So standardize the video is very important for us to analyze the speed and the trace.
So we use 5-10-10 routine to make the video of the worms, so that it can benefit our analyzation later.
3.5.2 Q: What is 5-10-10 routine? Why should we use this style?
A: The 5-10-10 routine means that the first 5 seconds leave the worm in white light, after that give it 10 seconds of LED light, at last leave it in white light for about 10 seconds or more. The 5-10-10 routine is better for us to analyze the speed of those worms. And the first 5 seconds white light is used to observe the normal behavior of the worms which can make comparison to the following period. The third period is use to observe how long the worm can get right.
3.5.3 Q: Why should we analyze the trace of the C.elegens?
A: The trace of the c.elegens is very useful to our project. It can show the movement of these worms visually. We can find the worm keep going or turn left/right or stop even recede during we give the light. After combining the trace with the coordinate, we can change the graphic information into digital information which is easier for us to analyze.
3.5.4 Q: What kind of software do we use to record the reaction of worms? Why?
A: To record the behavior of the worms, we use DP7200 camera and software called Biolife DP to make a video. Compared to those ordinary cameras, DP7200 can change the color temperature of the background. It means that no matter what color the background is, we can always change it to a white background relatively. This can make sure that we can have a high quality video to analyze.
3.5.5 Q: Why should we use a red glassine paper to filtering the white light when testing the worms?
A: The white light contains all kinds of light qualities include the blue light or green light. Using the red glassine paper is to make sure our worms will not infect by the"

Figure 15: Relative beneficial effect of the different transporter variants when cultivated in MOPS minimal media supplemented with 10 mM ATP. No substantial beneficial effect could be observed for any of the transporter variants. The highest beneficial effects were reached by E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-TAT-SP-PtNTT2 (+17.2 % ± 7.2 %) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(31-575) (+14.0 % ± 4.7 %).
The highest beneficial effect was reached by TAT-SP-PtNTT2 with a value of +17.2 % ± 7.2 %, followed by PtNTT2(31-575) with +14.0 % ± 4.7 %. All other strains did not show a substantial beneficial effect. These results suggest, that the activity of the different transporter variants is concentration dependent and that expression of PtNTT2 in media supplemented with higher concentrations of ATP equalizes the effects of uptake and export of NTPs. Therefore, no substantial beneficial effect could be observed, but also no negative effect.
The experiment was repeated once again with MOPS media supplemented with 100 µM of iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP. Substantial differences were observed for all transporter variants. PtNTT2(66-575) reached the highest beneficial effect with +38 % ± 10 %. All other transporter variants reached showed a negative effect compared to the reference. This confirms that ATP is exported in presence of the unnatural nucleotides, leading to a net loss of ATP and inhibition of growth. Therefore, it can be concluded that the native transporter variant PtNTT2 has the highest activity towards iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP, followed by PtNTT2(31-575).
Figure 16: Relative beneficial effect of the best PtNTT2 variants cultivated in MOPS media supplemented with 100 µM of iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP each. Substantial differences can be observed for all transporter variants, with PtNTT2(66-575) reaching the highest beneficial effect +38 % ± 10 %. All other transporter variants reached showed a negative effect compared to the reference, which means that ATP is exported in exchange for iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP, leading to a net loss of ATP.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," practiced answering potential questions that can arise after our presentation at aGEM. We also started uploading policies and practices content on the wiki.
The Canadian and American governments as well as the FBI attend the Pathogen Security Partners meeting that will be taking place this fall in November.  We have stayed in contact with representatives from the Public Agency of Canada and the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs as they are interested in a presentation from our team at this event and governmental meeting.  This in addition to our teams experience at the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva will allow iGEM and its teams to create an awareness of undergraduate research in synthetic biology and the impact of iGEM on this industry.  Over the next couple weeks our team plans to continue to plan this presentation with our contacts with the Canadian government, and continue to pursue our project after the Giant Jamboree in Boston.  We have forwarded more information regarding our project and its potential impact and have set up several phone meetings to discuss these plans.  Although this is a future direction for our project that will take place after Boston, our team is very passionate about the synthetic biology industry and scope of our project and wants to take this opportunity to showcase the potential of iGEM.
Week 19: September 8th - September 12th
We have continued discussion with the Government of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada over the past week and will continue for the entirety of iGEM 2014 to ensure they have the necessary background information on our project.  This necessary background information will ensure that a relevant presentation can be created addressing the conferences interests in our team’s project.  By staying in contact and discussion the necessary planning measures that will need to be taken to attend this event we can make this experience possible.
The remaining weeks until iGEM composed of finalizing and compiling all results of the research and perspectives we have gathered.  Additionally we have continued to organize the logistics for the presentation at the Pathogen Security Partners meeting and implement this policy throughout our designs and device.

A: 5'-AGTT-3'
B: 5'-TGTC-3'
C: 5'-CGTG-3'
We incorporated these NEWLY DESIGNED sticky ends into MaSp1 and MaSp2 sequences. We tested the ligation characteristics of these new monomers by ligating pairs of monomers. The expected result of this test is a single band corresponding to a 2-mer product.
Fig. 2 Ligation test of AB, BC, CA. Lane 1 is A+B, Lane 2 is B+C, Lane 3 is C+A. The expected band size for ligation is 204 bp. The bands at 102 bp correspond to unligated monomers.
Our test results show only the expected ligation product, which validates the proper functioning of our REDESIGNED MONOMERS
In addition to characterizing the ligation behavior of the MaSp monomers, we also characterized the behavior of the redesigned monomers with accessory oligos used in ICA( 6/3/2015 ). We tested ligating monomer with each capping oligo, and the AB and CA monomers with the initiator and terminator respectively.
Fig. 3 Characterization of initiator, terminator, capping oligos with MaSp AB, BC, CA. The first lane is the negative control with only one monomer type. The 102 bp band corresponds to unligated monomer size. The initiator is 59 bp, the terminator is 39 bp, and the caps are 20 bp. The 122 bp bands correspond to the capping oligos ligated to the monomer.
We showed that the caps work as intended and would be usable in ICA.
We expected the following combinations to ligate.
AB + Initiator (inconclusive)
AB + B-cap
BC + C-cap
CA + A-cap
CA + Terminator (inconclusive)
There was an insufficient amount initiator and terminator in the reaction, so no bands. But the sticky ends should work as expected.
CA weakly ligates with C-cap, which is shown by the double bands present. This result was not expected, and may be due to non-specific ligation.
Because of possible undesirable non-specific interaction between monomer CA and C-cap, we performed a test to verify which end of the monomer the cap was binding to ( 6/5/2015 ). If the cap bound to the C"
