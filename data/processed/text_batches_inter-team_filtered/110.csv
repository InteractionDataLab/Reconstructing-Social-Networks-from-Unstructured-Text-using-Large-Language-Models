From the image, we can see that there is little difference among 0.1mg/L, 0.2mg/L and 0.3mg/L                             of                             antigens. It showed that the antigens in this concentration range have almost no effect on                             the                             vertical alignment of liquid crystal. The number of bright spots increased, but not more                             differences among 0.5mg/L-4mg/L. It suggested that the molecular weight of antigen may be                             too                             small to affect the vertical alignment of liquid crystal. Therefore, the effect of antigens                             of                             0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good.
Experiment of Suitable Nanobody Concentration
Time:
8 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 1000 ng/ml; Antigen concentration                                 500ng/ml,                                 antibody concentration 1500 ng/ml; Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody                                 concentration                                 2000 ng/ml.
9 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 250 ng/ml; Antigen                                 concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml.
10 Sept: Antigen concentration 500ng/ml, antibody concentration 500 ng/ml.
After the experiment of suitable antigen concentration, we found that the effect of antigens                             of                             0.5mg/L concentration on the vertical alignment of liquid crystals is good. Therefore, we                             take                             the concentration of antibody solution as 0.5mg/L as the premise to investigate suitable                             nanobody concentration. An appropriate amount of 0.5mg/L, 1mg/L, 1.5mg/L and 0.5mg/L concentration                             of the nano-antibody solution was sequentially added dropwise to the slide to which the                             antigen                             was immobilized. For details of subsequent treatment, please refer to the fifth step of                             competitive immunoassay method .Three parallel experiments were carried out in each group,                             and                             we chose the best picture to integrate them together under both quadruple and tenfold                             objective.

Desaturase Intro
P. acnes naturally resides in the skin making it an ideal candidate for an engineered skin probiotic. One our team’s goals is to engineer P. acnes to secrete a lipid-restoring enzyme, which would reduce inflammation by maintaining a healthy balance of oils on the skin. Specifically, we are aiming to express Δ12 Fatty Acid Desaturase. The Biobrick for this gene was first cloned by the Manchester 2013 iGEM team (Part: BBa_K1027002).
On the skin it is thought that a reduction of linoleic acid and elevation in oleic acid, contributes to the occurrence of acne-related inflammation. Thus by inserting a desaturase enzyme to increase the concentration of linoleic acid we will attempt restore the natural lipid balance of characteristic of healthy skin.
Figure 1. Delta Fatty Acid Desaturase converts linoleic acid to oleic acid.

UFMG_Brazil,2013,Team:UFMG Brazil#humanpractice_-_-_TEXT.html," is being developed as a diagnostic tool by the UFMG team (CardBio project), will be able to report, according to the fluorescence intensity, the amount of certain substances (biomarkers) in serum of the patient, allowing a more accurate assessment of their health conditions. Despite its simplicity, the fluorometers are expensive equipaments and not so easy to use, so, there is a necessity to develop simple and cheaper model.
Based on previous iGEM projects[1] we design and build a portable and low cost fluorometer, that could be used with the Cardbio bacteria. The first version is based in the project of the Cambridge Team 2010 (Eglomer), but we use a cheaper light sensor: the TSL235, it´s a light-to-frequency converter that outputs a square wave (50% duty cycle) with frequency directly proportional to light intensity (irradiance). As you can see in the video below, which uses an open hardware oscilloscope to test the sensor:
In the second version, we inserted a color sensor in the previous project (ADJD-S311, able to discriminate different light frequencies), we remove the keypad and use a larger screen for easier reading. More testing needs to be done to make the device suitable for the needs of the project.

CU LATER PARTS OVERVIEW
For our project we are using parts primarily serving the function of capturing ions, holding on to them and precipitating out of solution.
This includes usage of parts taken from:
the T4 bacteriophage
Cup1 from Yeast
CutA from E. coli
elastin-like polymers (ELPs).
The regulators we are using are:
an inducible promoter induced by IPTG(BBa_I712074)
a medium-strong ribosomal-binding site(BBa_J61100)
and a double terminator(BBa_B0014)"

Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in a relatively low concentration. The size distribution is ranging from 8 nm to 13 nm, which is sufficient for d-AuNPs analysis for prescreening.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The newly generated d-AuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 2000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The plate view is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs occured at a final NaCl concentration of 100 mM. In comparison with the old d-AuNPs batch, they aggregate at a lower salt concentration indicating that they are less stable"

PROJECT UPDATE
We’ve had some issues with the transformation efficiency kit. The efficiency with the provided reagents seems to be almost null. After a series of tests using control plasmids, different competent batches and different bacterial strains, we came to the conclusion that the shipping of the kit may have affected it. We’d like to let other teams be aware of that in case they are having the same issues.
We have also been working to generate 3D structures by homology modeling for some of the peptides that showed affinity towards fungal proteins. However, they still need to be assessed more thoroughly.
Predicted structure of one of our selected peptides. The portion in blue shows the scaffold (B1 domain of protein G) and the red portion is our inserted peptide. We’re using Modeller to generate the structures by homology modeling (https://salilab.org/modeller/).

Treating strong body odor using probiotics, producing a low cost perfume produced by bacteria and setting up a database of microbiome correlated to body odor
Questions it raises : Are you more likely to use a product whose ingredients you are familiar with and can even make on your own? Is the formulation of a cream like the one we’ve described above something that you would put on your skin?
One of our sub-projects has to do with the development of the formulation that our probiotic will be given in. We wanted to make a cream that used components of daily life in order to create something that consumers can make at home and with products they can trust. One such formulation we are looking at is the development of a cream that is an emulsion of beeswax, jojoba oil, and the medium that our bacteria are grown in. We conducted an experiment of such an emulsion with fluorescent E. coli and viewed this cream under a microscope and recorded the images in a time-lapse video (which can be viewed here: http://youtu.be/4IgNmKa"

The iGEM competition is an enriching experience in our student life, and thanks to this competition we gained a lot of important skills.  As we needed to find sponsors we became experts in phone harassment. We also needed to communicate about our project and learned to make visiting cards, newsletters. We also became experts at explaining our project and synthetic biology to the general public. Moreover we had to get in touch with different people such as administrators, scientists, beekeepers, specialists, an ethical expert and other iGEM teams and learned a lot through these interactions.
In this part, we want to thank all the persons who contributed to our project by sharing their experience, their knowledge, and their interest.

Design Overview
Fig. 1. The circuit design of Mosquito Intelligent Terminator. The Cry weapon system is located on strand B. The Low temperature release system is controlled by strand A and B. The population control system is controlled by strand C and D
   The main concept of the Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT or Terminator) is to insert cry gene isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. Israelensis into the E.coli. E.coli with this gene can produce Cry proteins toxic to mosquito larva. When the temperature exceeeds 37°C, the temperature-sensitive RBS BBa_K115002 is activated and produce tetR proteins inhibiting the Ptet promoter. This mechanism serves to regulate the cry protein release in a temperature dependent fashion, where the Ptet promoter is inhibited. On the flip side, when the temperature is below 37°C, the cry proteins will be produced. The whole reaction can be divided into the following steps:
       1. Reproduction status (>37°C): The E.coli population grows and produces tetR proteins to inhibit the Ptet promoter.
       2. Downstream protein release status (<37°C): E.coli released into environment tetR begins to degrade, Ptet promoter actively producing cry proteins, luxI & luxR.
       3. The self-maintain status ( < 37°C): When external bacteria aggregate, the concentration of AHL will rise pass threshold level and resulting the formation of AHL-LuxR complexes. This complex then becomes a translation factor to Plux promoter and"

The washing and crushing experiment was time consuming and error sensitive. Therefore, a new experiment                          was devised to investigate the effect of the adhesin in retaining the E. coli bacteria inside the hydrogel.                         The central component in this experiment is a cubic hydrogel containing a cavity, which we fabricated using                          polydimethysiloxane fabrication. The chamber allows bacteria to be loaded inside the hydrogel and subsequently,                          a leakage experiment was performed to quantify bacterial leakage over time. A schematic illustration can be seen in figure 6.                         Click for more detailed experimental conditions and results With this new prototype hydrogel , more consistent and robust results were obtained.

Afterwards, samples are taken periodically.
Fighting against Infections of Burns and Chronic Wounds
To illustrate the potential of living materials, we decided to develop it into a living skin                          patch capable of the continuous secretion of bacteriocins to combat bacteria responsible for                          infections in patients suffering from burns and chronic wounds. For a detailed analysis                       of the background of the problem and our interviews with experts and stakeholders please                       see our Human Practices section                       and Applied Design section.
As mentioned above, this specific application scenario leads to additional requirements,                       preferences and constraints.
Requirements:
Safety & Biocompatibility: The bacteriocin secreting patch should be safe to use for patients and healthcare professionals. It should be easy to sterilize prior to seeding with bacteria to avoid the introduction of other bacteria near the wound.
Effectivity: The effect of the patch should be limited to infection causing bacteria, with Staphylococcus aureus as our primary target
User friendliness: The patch must be easy to use for healthcare professionals such as doctors and nurses. It must also be comfortable for patients.
Selectivity: The bacteriocins secreted by the patch must only be active against the specific strains of bacteria causing wound infections.
Preferences:
Modularity: Ideally our patch can target different bacterial strains"

Figure 1. Tea Plantation in Lawang, Malang City (Department of Electrical Engineering Brawijaya University, 2014)
Tea extract contain EGCG used as the most effective antioxidant to against cervical cancer. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenol constituent present in green tea to inhibit cancer growth and the effects of EGCG is a potential anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic agent in the human ovarian cancer line.But, levels of EGCG (Epigallocathecin gallate) in tea is very slightly. So, we will increase the level of this EGCG compound using siRNA to knockdown gene non-EGCG with expectation it will produce high yield of antioxidant. The applications are for supplement or feminine hygiene.
Figure 2. EGCG structure 2D (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2005)
Figure 3. EGCG structure 3D (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2005)
Tea plant (Camelia sinensis) has catechin compounds that contains antioxidants.  Catechin family that most effective used as antioxidant is Epigallocathecin gallate (EGCG).  Based on research in vitro and in silico, EGCG is able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells with stop over-expression between L1 HPV 16- EGFR (Epithel Growth Factor Receptor) bond but there are few of EGCG content in tea plant. Based on these problems, we would to over- expression EGCG by knockdown non-compound EGCG gene, so hopefully the content of EGCG on tea are more prominent.
Our Design
EGCG is able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells (Cornelia, 2013) because stop over-expression between L1 HPV 16- EGFR (Epithel Growth Factor Receptor) bond but there are few of EGCG content in tea plant. Based on these problems, we would to over- expression EGCG by knockdown non-compound EGCG gene, so hopefully the content of EGCG on tea are more prominent.
We design siRNA sequence from LAR gene (to inhibit non-EGCG compound) using bioinformatics tool to initiate expression in mammalian cell (using HeLa cell). That part will be insert into the pSB1C3 linear backbone. To checking performance of this part, should be react with sequence target of siRNA LAR into the plasmid pSB1C3. We also prepare for positive control containing siRNA for GFP, insert into"
ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," window. The flux through that window is J′, and the rate of change of NO concentration that results is$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=-\frac{J'A\mathrm{d}t}{Al\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{J'}{l}$$
The net rate of change of NO concentration is therefore$$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\frac{J-J'}{l}$$
Each flux is proportional to the NO concentration gradient at the window. So, by using Fick's first law, we can write$$J-J'=-D\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}+D\frac{\partial c'}{\partial x}=-D\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}+D\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[c+\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}l \right]=Dl\frac{{\partial}^{2}c}{\partial {x}^{2}}$$
The viscosity of water is 0.891 cP (or 8.91 × 10-4kg·m-1·-1), and the effective radius of NO approaches 0.36 nm in this case.
Diffusion Coefficient
With the constant D,which is called the diffusion coefficient, to be obtained, the formula above cannot be solved.
The following picture shows the flux of particles down a concentration gradient. Fick’s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point. $$J(\mathrm{matter})=-D\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{N}}{\mathrm{d}z}$$
Figure 2. The flux of particles down a concentration gradient. Fick’s first law states that the flux of matter (the number of particles passing through an imaginary window in a given interval divided by the area of the window and the duration of the interval) is proportional to the density gradient at that point. (Reference: P W Atkins. Atkins’ Physical chemistry, 7th Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, 757)
If we divide both sides of this equation by Avogadro’s constant, thereby converting numbers into amounts (numbers of moles), then Fick’s law becomes$$J=-D\frac{\mathrm{d}c}{\mathrm{d}x}$$

Now we will use a specific example to demonstrate functions of BioBless.
You can input a truth table where ""1""represents the existence of the substance and ""0"" represents the opposite.
Our software will provide several possible gene circuits for your truth table. You can drag one of these gene circuits on our canvas.
Now you can either drag some other Boolean gates to the canvas or choose some specific Biobricks to substitute the abstract Biobricks in the designed gene circuit. For example, you can drag several OR0 and OR1 to connect them together.
Click the ""Gene Network"" button and input parameters you want to change. For example, you can set the reaction parameter of transcription (trans1), translation (trans2), decay1 and decay2 rates as 0.00005, 0.025, 0.1 and 0.05 respectively. Click the icons on our canvas and you will go into a dialog box to choose Biobricks.
Click the ""Simulation"" button and you will see the concentration-time figure of every substance in designed gene circuit. Click on ""all"" and all figures will be shown on our canvas. Click ""OUT""and you will see the concentration-time figure of this substance individual.
Click the ""Analysis"" button, then input the parameter you want to change and the range of change, such as 5% or 15%. Then you will see the results of stability and robustness.
The ""DNA Sequence"" button will provide information of the DNA sequence and you will see the sequences of designed gene circuit.
Future Work
Noting that the number of prototype substances for inputs of our gene circuit have been limited, hence the functionality of designed gene circuits are strongly weakened. One of our future work is to design novel gene circuit where the inputs and outputs are arbitrary given. Theoretically, if we build up the bridge between an arbitrary input (denoted by A) and several certain functional protein (denoted by B), for example, biologist can design a specific gene circuit like a combination of A-targeted promoter with gene sequence of B in advance to achieve that the concentration of A will be commensurate with that of B, thus designing"

    2. Compare the growth performance of acid-tolerant strains
    According to the 2% inoculation rate, the original strain L. lactis NZ9000, three mutant strains L. lactis WH101, WH102, WH103 were inoculated into 10 ml of liquid medium under the conditions of pH 4.5, 5.0, and 7.0, respectively. The OD value of the strains were measured every 0.5 hours, and the growth curve of the strains are shown as Fig 2.
Fig 2 (A) The growth curve of the four strains at pH 7.0; (B) The growth curve of the four strains at pH 5.0; (C) The growth curve of the four strains at pH 4.5; (D)The survival rate of the four strains at pH 4.0.
    Results analysis
1)  The growth of acid-resistant strains under normal pH 7.0 conditions was not significantly affected.
2)  The growth performance of acid-resistant strains at pH 5.0 and pH 4.5 was significantly improved compared to the original strain.
3)  At pH 5.0, the biomass of the acid-tolerant strains WH101, WH102, WH103 was 7.0, 4.8 and 5.6 times that of the original strain, respectively.
4)  At pH 4.5, they were 5.5, 3.6, and 4.3 times the original strain, respectively.
5)  Under the condition of pH 4.0, the survival rate of L. lactis WH101, L. lactis WH102 and L. lactis WH103 was significantly higher than that of the original strain. And the survival rate increased gradually with the prolongation of stress time and acid resistance after 5 hours of stress. The strains were 16000, 351.4 and 264.3 times the original strain, respectively.
    Finally, through genomic mutation and high-throughput screening, we obtained a strain L. lactis WH101 with good acid resistance from 35,000 strains. Next, we will compare the NZ9000 and WH101 by transcriptomics analysis and mathematical model to obtain key acid resistant components.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Moss_-_-_TEXT.html," Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann, who instructed us throughout the day and gave us many tips how to proceed with the moss. Because of the incubation times and because it was our first try, it took us ten hours without a break until we had two boxes stacked with 6 well plates. We quickly went to get some beers and chips and met with the Freiburg iGEM team for a really nice barbecue. When we finally left, public transport wasn’t running anymore, so we didn’t miss the chance to take a midnight sightseeing tour through Freiburg, where Volker showed us around.
Ten days later, Johanna and Andi visited the Freiburg lab to transfer the then regenerated protoplasts onto agar plates and soon after, we came back for our second and final round of transformation. At our first try, we didn’t get enough moss protoplasts, so we worked through two batches and therefore had to prepare another batch of driselase. Our handling had improved, yet it still took twelve hours and again, there was no time left for a break. After we said good bye, we celebrated with a couple of beers and some yummy flammkuchen at the UC uni café of Freiburg. We had learned so much and got much closer to our goal. A big successful step for our team!
4. Regeneration and Selection of transgenic plants
After Transformation, the regenerating protoplasts were incubated in regeneration medium in 6-well-plates sealed with parafilm for 10 days and then cultivated on a layer of autoclaved cellophane (seperated with Whatman paper during autoclavation, so they dont stick together), on top of Knop medium agar plates for three days under standard conditions. Then we transferred the cellophane layers with the regenerated moss onto Knop medium agar plates containing 25 µg/ml G418 antibiotic for two weeks. The official protocol schedules a two week release period followed by another selection period to ensure stabile transormation, but we didn´t have that much time and went with a single round of selection. We plated only half of our transformed protoplasts. The other half was left in the 6-well-plates where 2 ml of selection medium were added to the 2 ml of regeneration medium from the transormation, with G418 diluted 1:8000.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," library, we got poor time constants.  We still got colonies, but instead of getting a lawn of bacteria there were approximately 150 discrete colonies on the plate.
To get around this, Noah picked colonies from the plates and inoculated fresh LB/spec with them, and let them grow to saturation over the course of the day.  We used these resulting saturated cultures in our selection plates later in the day.
Pre-transformation library selection plates
Today, Noah and I prepared selection plates to test our ability to distinguish a positive hit among negative controls in varying proportions.  The pre-transformation aspect refers to the fact that it is the Zif268 plasmid that is diluted into the negative control plasmids before transformation, rather than diluting Zif268 bacteria into the negative control bacteria after transformation (this is analogous to how it will be done with the chip).  Using the negative control library assembled from yesterday, we created a 96-well plate with the following dimensions.
Going horizontally (each column):
1: Positive control (only Zif268)
2: Positive control (replicate of column 1)
3: 10^-1
4: 10^-2
5: 10^-3
6: 10^-4
7: 10^-5
8: 10^-6
9: Negative plasmid control (only negative control library)
10: Negative plasmid control (replicate of column 9)
11: No plasmid control (Wolfe ECNR2 strain without any plasmid)
12: No plasmid control (replicate of column 12)

We left this in the plate reader overnight.
Selection plate seeding protocol
Notes: Each well contained 150 ul of liquid, and a 1/100 dilution of bacteria at an OD of 3 (so this would be adding 1.5 ul of bacteria).  The bacteria were grown up in LB to saturation and were washed in NM twice.  This was accomplished by the following steps:
Take the equivalent of 800 ul of 1.5 OD bacteria into a tube.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Diversity, the editors wrote the second edition of the Environmental Risk Assessment Guide and iGEM Tec-Chihuahua was able to help with the English-Spanish translation. We wanted to help with this project due to the importance of regulating science.
Instead of us writing a RA guide, we considered this opportunity a great time to learn from experts and reflect on the requirements needed to launch a biotechnology product in the market. Is worth mentioning that, Education and Public Engagement permitted us not only to do the translation of this guide and provide educative material to society but also integrate our product AMPABEE and establish our legal plan.
Another reason why we wanted to do this collaboration was that, rather than disseminating synthetic biology, we wanted to enhance society with something useful.  Many  people  have  the  uncertainty that GMOs will cause more damage than the benefit
that could be obtained from them, but with this, we were able to contribute to Spanish-speaking people that there is a process behind the release of a biotechnological product to the environment.
We are very honored to have been able to leave our contribution to a guide that will be used by all those companies derived from modern biotechnology who wish to create a product and thus solve an abundant problem in the community.
This guide will be discussed and shared in the United Nations Biodiversity Conference on a side event of the 9th meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (COPMOP9) in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt on November 17th, 2018.

With iGEM and every activity we have made, we learned that science is much more than just wet lab work. We passionated with giving society a piece of what we have learned through all these months by making people engaged with new technologies.

Protein Trafficking
Submission of BioBricks
The Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) was cloned from a commercial plasmid, pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen) by PCR. For the MLS BioBrick, we have submitted the MLS BioBrick in RFC 10 and RFC 25, the Freiburg format which allows protein fusion, to facilitate other team to fuse the MLS with other protein for purpose of introducing other protein into mitochondria.
For characterization, MLS and green fluorescence protein was fused with constitutive mammalian CMV promoter. The promoter was cloned from pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech) in RFC10 format, since such part could not be found in partsregistry. The CMV cloned for our characterization construct was also submitted. The two construct for characterization, the CMV promoter – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3 and CMV promoter – mitochondrial leader sequence – green fluorescence protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3 composite parts are also submitted.
Characterization
In order to characterize mitochondria that it can translocate protein into mitochondria in standard BioBrick, we constructed CMV promoter – mitochondrial leader sequence – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3. We use pCMV/myc/mito.GFP (Invitrogen) as positive control, which include MLS with GFP reporter, and we built negative control, CMV promoter – green fluorescent protein – polyadenylation sequence – pSB1C3 for response without MLS. Characterization was conducted on HEK 293FT cell. If the result shows that GFP is localized in mitochondria while the negative control is scatter all around cell, we can conclude that MLS is targeting GFP into mitochondria in HEK 293FT Cell.
Since we could not find a constitutive promoter BioBrick allow expression"

A set of results regarding the content and setup of iGEM at home is visualized in figure 1. The data in (1) reveals that most of the participants are users we want to call ""BOINC veterans"" that already run or ran several BOINC projects on their computers (82%). Comparison of the server data with the data automatically gathered by the iGEM@home user platform reveals that the group of BOINC veterans is slightly overrepresented in the survey (82% survey/75% total users). The two populations of users differ in their attitude towards the two communication platforms screensaver and forum which is represented in the bar chart (Figure 2). BOINC veterans equally pay attention to both media whilst new users tend to focus on the screensaver. The fact that 80% of new users reviewed the slide show is an encouraging result regarding the effectivity of content distribution via the screensaver (also compare figure 1,(2) and (3)).
Figure 1, Pie Charts (1-6):
Pie charts that display data chosen from our online survey with a total set of 14 items and a total number of 82 (20%) participants from a total of 412 iGEM@home users. (1) More than 80% of users that filled out the survey were active members of the distributed computing community before joining iGEM@home. (2) Only 40% of the users paid active attention to the contents of the screensaver. (Please also see the bar chart below for more information). Still 70% of these users evaluated the screensaver as good or better. (3) The forum was evaluated by more than 55 % of the users of whose 60% gave positive reviews. (4) The computing tasks themselves (calculations) were positively rated by 65 % of the participants. Users point out a special need for improvements (in short: ‘work on!’) in the calculations (see comments in the text). (5) An overwhelming majority of about 80% of the participants liked the overall project and ranked it ‘good’ or even ‘perfect’ while none of the participant ranked the overall project as ‘bad’. (6) iGEM@home reached at least 52 persons that had no knowledge of iGEM before which is more than 60% of survey participants.

How would pool designs change the production/ecosystem?
How would future pool & parking garage designs change?
Scale is an issues. The bacterial takes AWHILE to create enough to fuel. Reality in the behavior - take about 100 litres of bacteria to produce a single teaspoon of the fuel.
For large scale production it would take a lot of lakes/pools/time, what if people had their own smaller scale production or source - MOONSHINE, bathtub gin
Gas companies creating their own branded bacteria, the new role of the pool boy, gas station, gas station attendant
What new rituals form around maintaining this pool? - skimming to remove insects, leaves,  the random mouse.
design
The ecosystem surrounding the pool became our site for investigation; our site to ""play out"" our design, questions, and speculation. Researching Los Angeles' own history of fetishized backyard aquatics, we found that the density of pools was drastically different from neighborhood to neighborhood. Beverly Hills had the highest concentration of private lagoons, while urban center-city Long Beach had the fewest. Designing an experiment to simulate different community scales, we created our own model pool communities and placed them throughout the city.
Our first investigation centered on two miniaturized communities of three pools, built to reference the god's-eye view of geodesic satellites. On a sunny rooftop in Pasadena, CA, we inoculated two groups of six pools with algae samples from across Los Angeles. Measuring the contamination rates, acidity, population, and color of the pools against a constant, we were able to determine productive environments for algae contagion.
Our second investigation enlarged our geographic scale and context. With two inflatable kiddie pools placed 10 miles apart, and with algae from the Los Angeles ""River,"" we simulated the actual backyard experience of tending for a biofuel pond and observed how the system integrated into the vibrant urban ecosystem.
Our third investigation incorporated our deep research into the sustainable production of biofuels and proposed an extended Los Angeles County boundary to include more water and c02 sources for better biofuel production. Los Angeles has a long history of aquatic imperialism dating back to the largely illegal import of water from hundreds of miles away. In a search for a more sustainable future, Los Angeles' creation of a ""green belt"" of algae conducive land in a deterministic manner would not be surprising.

Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a pdb file for each of the genes, Phyre2 also produced a homology comparison to each of the ACC deaminase structures submitted to the protein database. Below are the results from all three homolog alignments.
Figure 8: Below are the homolog alignment results for the Fusarium oxysporum gene. As you can see, the highest match is ACC deaminase protein 1TYZ with 57% match.
Figure 9: Below are the homolog alignment results for the Trichoderma asperellum gene. The highest match is ACC deaminase protein 1TYZ with 60% match.
Figure 10: Below are the homolog alignment results for the Pseudomonas sp. gene. The highest match is ACC deaminase protein 1TYZ with 83% match.
From these homolog matches we can conclude that the closest to our model ACC deaminase gene, 1TYZ, is the gene extracted from Pseudomonas sp. This makes sense since 1TYZ was produced in Pseudomonas. Because of this, we chose to use the Pseudomonas gene to transform our endophyte with. This way, we would have the most information regarding the efficiency and functionality of the protein our endophyte was producing. There were a couple amino acid differences between the Pseudomonas gene and the other two. The most important one which should be mentioned, is directly involved with catalytic pocket function.
This point is at position 80 in the amino acid sequence. Both 1TYZ and our Pseudomonas strain have Q or glutamine instead of arginine in position 80. The image below shows this distinction. This is very interesting, since arginine is a very large molecule and is a positively charged molecule. Glutamine, on the other hand is a smaller, polar molecule.
Figure 11: The ring is PLP in the active site of this monomer, and the molecule in purple is arginine and the molecule in blue is glutamine.
Overall, the three genes we had available to us aligned almost perfectly to 1TYZ. Below is a 360° rotation and zoom into the active site of the enzyme where PLP is seen. Each color is a different one of the homologs overlapping with 1TYZ. The color distinctions are given in the figure legend.

With this kind of inducible expression, the pheromones production metabolic cost for the plant will be reduced and the pheromone release will be always under control ( see Switch ).
This switch is composed of two different parts:
A constituvely expressed transcription factor (CUP2) that changes its conformation in the presence of a given concentration of cupper ions. With this change of conformation, it can bind a specific promoter and initiates the transcription of a  particular gene.
A chimeric promoter that includes an Upstream Activating Sequence (UAS) whith the transcription factor binding site.
This switch is naturally present in yeast, so it must be adapted to plants.
Therefore, the transcription factor CUP2, which was obtained from S. cerevisae genome, was assembled with de Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) P35S promoter and T35S terminator to be constitutively expressed. In addition, an activator domain (GAL4 AD) was joined to the CUP2 sequence, in order to improve the transcription initiation.
On the other hand, we needed to assemble the chimeric promoter and the gene of interest. This chimeric promoter is composed of 3 different parts:
The aforementioned UAS, which is a 44bp region. Only 16bp of them are actually the binding site for CUP2 while the rest are spacer nucleotides.
A minimal promoter, miniP35S (-60). These are a reduced number of nucleotides from the CaMV P35S promoter required for starting transcription.
The 5'-UTR region of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), called omega sequence. This sequence functions as a translational enhancer in plants.
As we were going to perform a Luciferase assay to test the switch ( see Luciferase assay ) the gene of interest assembled with the chimeric promoter was the Luciferase. This is the obtained construct.
In order to have a control for the Luciferase assay, we needed another construct already available in the GoldenBraid collection. It included the Renilla and P19 genes.
Finally, we assembled all three constructs into a single multigenic construct that was introduced into the plant to perform the Luciferase assay.

We held several mini lectures for freshmen and high school students. In these lectures, we introduced our project this year -- S-Din, as well as principles of synthetic biology. We received their remarks to our project. From communication with them, we found some previous defect of S-Din, and their views help us think more about the project and improve it.

""Synbio Summit"" with people from different fields
What would happen if people from different fields get together to talk about synthetic biology? We decided to have a try -- to hold ""Synbio Summit"".
We invited guests majoring in sociology, computer science, environmental science, law and so on. At the beginnning of the summit, we introduced the basic concepts of synthetic biology, and express our previous thinking about what synbio will affect other fields. Participants were the first time to learn about synthetic biology, but they gave their opinions to us, including phrase, puzzles and worries after they realized what synbio may do with everyone's life.
For 1.5 hours, we talked about lots of topics around synthetic biology, including safety, societal effects, moral ethics and so on. We realized that we were not only the ""teacher"" in the field of synthetic biology, but also a humble student, for every field could teach us useful lessons.
Through communication, you'll know how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.

Riboregulator Future Work
Catalog Page
Since the number of regulatory RNAs in part registry have been increasing over the years and they have not been well curated, our team wishes to solve this problem by creating a list of category tags and guidelines so that one can search these parts efficiently. Therefore, we will be continuing our work in testing and characterizing the regulatory RNAs for the ease of the synthetic biology community's use in the future.
Please visit our prototype of the catalog page and stay tuned with our updates.
Re-characterization of Riboregulator under different genetic context
The characterization result of riboregulators were out of our expectation - the taRNAs were unable to efficiently unlock their cognate crRNAs. We now realized that our genetic context used was different from how riboregulators were characterized initially. Expression of TAs were supposed to be driven from high copy plasmids while CRs were supposed to be driven from low copy vectors. Thus, we will progressively change the conditions used to characterize the constructs into a new genetic context. We hope that we can replicate others' results soon.
Characterization of Arabinose inducible pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ) in high copy plasmid
We observed a transfer function with an all-or-none response in the pBad/araC promoter on a low copy plasmid during measurement, which matched the experimental result from that of iGEM 2011 Cambridge team, who also used the same genetic context. We are now speculating that the discrepancy between results from iGEM 2011 Cambridge and Groningen was a result due to different copy number plasmids used in carrying the promoter. However, due to lack of sufficient time and manpower, we were unable to test that out in time. Our future work will involve resumption of this characterization, and hopefully, we can"

Clotho Info View
The Info View displays messages (and the number of messages) in three different categories:
Messages - information about the general operation of the system.
Warnings - information about operations that have been denied but still allow future system operation.
Errors - information about operations that have been denied and will prevent future system operation unless resolved.
Each window can be cleared individually or collectively.
Parts Navigation System
Clotho Parts Navigator
The parts navigation system allows the user to browse parts related to a remote parts repository. This system consists of three aspects:
Parts Navigator - tree view for parts.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Functionalizing Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," the stacking of Beta sheets into an actual fiber. The repetitive motifs in between the terminal domains are hydrophobic regions that cluster together, separate from the hydrophilic N terminal domains, thus simulating a micelle. From our co-spinning module, we create a synthetic protein that emulates the composition of native fibroin, with the repetitive motifs between the domains replaced with our functional domain, sfGFP. When co-spun, the N terminal domains on our synthetic protein will recognize and bind to their counterparts on the native fibroin proteins, maintaining the micellar structure. The repetitive regions on the native fibroin and the sfGFP on our synthetic protein are coiled structures that, when exposed to the mechanical stresses induced by in vitro syringe extrusion, will flatten and stack up into Beta sheets, and Beta sheet formation is the key indication of proper fiber formation.

Fig 3: In our co-spinning methodology, Bombyx mori silk dope is spiked with a small volume (3 ul) of functional domain. The N termini on our expressed co-spinning module protein bind to the N-termini in the wildtype silk fibroin, and these hydrophilic heads arrange in a micellar structure, isolating the dangling coils of repetitive regions and sfGFP. After in-vitro syringe extrusion, the sheer forces applied induces Beta sheet formation.

Integrated Human Practices
Introduction
The impact of our project and research conducted to bring it to fruition, will reach all the way from Earth to Mars. For that reason, we decided to define human practices in two different ways: how it will effect Mars and how it will effect the Earth.
For Mars, unfortunately, because there are no users on Mars (yet!) it was impossible for us to engage with end users of our habitat. For that reason we decided the most effective approach would be to discuss with the experts who would be utilizing this design. During our interviews we discussed the parameters of our design and what cautionary steps we would need to talk in our design to not only protect travelers to Mars but the planet as well from contamination.
For earth we explored that technological implications of mycelium composites and how they could be used in sustainable industrial products and housing.
Below is how we engaged with experts and members of the community who had a stake by our research, for “Martian” and human practices.
Martian Habitats
The idea of people living on Mars is an inherently exciting prospect, and it can be a great deal of fun to dream of what the homes, or even cities, of a future martian colony would be like--will they be giant geodesic domes filled with lush greenery that dot the martian landscape and are connected by underground tunnels? Or will they be totally underground, an endless maze that will shield its inhabitants from the harsh cosmic rays? Or perhaps even crafted from ice--creating glistening ice sculptures upon the martian surface?
However, for our team just as alluring and fun as the imaginative aspect of designing for Mars is--which we certainly explored--was the challenge of designing our habitat to be a highly cost-effective, protective, and functional design.
There are a lot of moving parts that go into generating a design like this. We needed to understand what are the basic functions that a general habitat needs to fulfill (i.e. places to rest, to work, and to socialize. Certain degrees of privacy and lighting are also requirements) and what new"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," been preparing to build it, the main question we had was - what is the combination of substrate nucleotide and catalytic biomolecules we should use, in order to confidently know if our system or its parts are working as intended?
For example, if we would have tried to build CAT-Seq using a random library of different catalytic biomolecules and at the same time tested the system performance, we would have no idea whether if it’s the catalytic biomolecule and substrate nucleotide combination that is influencing our positive or negative results, or is it the CAT-Seq method itself. In other words, we had two groups of variables. For that reason, we wanted to reduce the variables to one group - system performance variables.
In order to achieve that, we have decided to use standard, already well established low-throughput methods to find a particular catalytic biomolecule and a substrate nucleotide pair. After that, we can then use that well-characterized catalytic biomolecule and substrate pair to build and optimize CAT-Seq.
Obtaining the first catalytic biomolecule
In order to find a correct combination of Substrate Nucleotide and the Catalytic Biomolecule that can catalyze the removal of the substrate, we have decided to look for a hydrolase. The is because a direct removal of the substrate from nucleotide seemed like the most timewise efficient choice.
First, we synthesized a cytidine which had a benzoyl substrate attached to it: N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate. Instructions on how such substrate nucleotide can be synthesized can be found here.
Then, an esterase library was screened manually using microwell plates in order to find the hydrolase enzyme which can catalyse the removal of the substrate. Once such enzyme was found and its sequence was determined. We have then used this pair of esterase enzyme and substrate cytidine to build the first version of CAT-Seq.
Next, we have performed an in-silico modelling of our Esterase enzyme.  The goal of the in-silico analysis was to create the Esterase mutants which would have different catalytic activities. Once such mutants were constructed, their relative catalytic activities were measured again using the same standard methods we have used to find the initial esterase enzyme. This was done in order to construct a small Esterase mutant library which would have precisely-defined catalytic activities by already established low-throughput measuring methods. Then, with CAT-Seq, we can also measure the activities of those mutants in high-throughput, which"

Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.

Modeling
A model is always a simplistic representation of reality. Using standard descriptions, like chemical reactions and mass action, we analytically derived each formula we wanted to fit. This derivation was only possible thanks to some assumptions. As this page shows, every assumption was carefully made and thought about. The process of simplification was put into question because our human practice project tends to investigate why simplification is powerful but not enough to understand the surrounding world. In our case, a reductionist approach was indispensable. Thus we tried to legitimate every assumption in a biological way.
Our modeling part focuses on parameter fitting (see our parameter page ). We used a classical deterministic model and tried to fit it to the experiments. Matching the reality level with the description level is a complicated task, as there is no optimal match. Differences and similarities between experiments and simulations give insights on where emergent phenomena could happen.
The fact that randomness is a property of complex systems motivated us to derive a stochastic model. Some biological events, like binding, are typically stochastic phenomena.
We opted for an engineered representation (see the information processing page ), thus to divide our systems into simpler submodules seemed obvious. We took the fact into account that the different levels of description can give several insights on how the systems work. The decomposition into interacting submodules (see the modeling overview page ) was crucial to explain the complex problem.
Influence of human practice on our scientific project
As soon as we agreed on a subject for our iGEM project, we started to observe patterns and complexity all among us. Our awareness of structures and compositions, as well as exchange and interaction between subunits, continuously increased. It quickly became a running gag among us to say: ""Anyway, it is too complex"".
Here we aim at describing the influence human practice had on our scientific project. Our human practice part is intricately linked to our scientific project, since we investigated in a philosophical and sociological way the concepts we tried to reproduce biologically: The emergence of a complex pattern from simple rules. By analyzing complexity and pattern formation in depth, we learned new strategies to approach them. Our human practice project allowed us to consider our scientific project from different points of view.
In our human practice project we interviewed experts of different fields, conducted a survey and sought to outreach our experience and knowledge. Thereby we learnt new strategies of how to approach complexity, but also ways to handle it. Furthermore, we found a source of motivation and reinforcement in our human practice project.

Oxford,2017,Team:Oxford#Cell Free Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"in. We decided to use 1.3 μM of hirudin as the amount needed to prevent blood coagulation. (Markwardt, 1992)
By running our model with the following initial conditions:
50 nM of repressed DNA
50 nM of excess TetR dimer
360 pM of Cruzipain (Positive Test)
30 nM of RNAP
30 nM of Ribosomes
We only used repressed DNA in this simulation, because that will give us the rate of production of hirudin without considering the leakiness of the promoter. In other words, this should give us the slowest production rate in the scenario.
Results:
[Fig 1]
From the graph above, we see that it takes around 31 minutes to produce the threshold amount of hirudin. This delay is too long for the hirudin to effectively inhibit blood coagulation. In fact, running the blood coagulation model using this output revealed the presence of a thrombin spike at close to 8 minutes, indicating the initiation of blood coagulation. See the blood coagulation model for more details.
[Fig 2]
To see if we could increase the hirudin production rate, we tried changing the concentration of DNA.
[Fig 3]
We ran the simulations from 10 nM to 100 nM of DNA at 10 nM intervals. We see that increasing the amount of DNA can reduce the time taken to threshold, however, there is saturation at high concentrations of DNA. Further increasing the DNA concentration in our simulations revealed that it is unable to reduce the threshold time to lower than 20 minutes (at 3 μM of DNA), which is still too slow to inhibit blood coagulation.
Another initial condition that could be changed is the amount of excess TetR that is not bound to a promoter. To reduce chances of leakage, we assumed that the amount of TetR added to the kit will be higher than the amount of DNA. However, these excess TetR will competitively inhibit cruzipain cleavage of the TetR that is bound to the promoters. This can be seen in the graph below
[Fig 4]
[Fig 5]
We ran simulations at different concentrations of excess TetR from 0 nM to 50 nM, but found very little difference in the hirudin threshold time.
Finally, we ran a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to determine the most suitable parameters to change to have the best impact on the hirudin production rate.

Gly-Stocks - Making of -stocks for long time storage of bacteria strains
For long time freezer storage of bacteria, they have to be treated with glycerine to prevent the crystallization and damaging of the cells. For this reason 2 ml of LB with the respective antibiotic were inoculated with the bacteria, which were meant to be stored and were incubated at 37°C overnight.
Strains that are to be stored:
E. coli XLI-Blue pMAD-fla  (piGEM-005)
E. coli XLI-Blue pMa12-construct  (piGEM-002)

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of substrate nucleotide was tracked by measuring the decay of absorbance with spectrophotometer. As seen from data showed in 7 Fig., the result of DNA circularization is ~ 3 times faster substrate nucleotide hydrolysis. As the screening conditions were the same (identical enzyme and substrate concentrations), the difference in catalysis speed arises only due to difference in enzyme  expression. This means that there is 3 fold increase in enzyme amount when the RCT is employed. These results conclude, that highly processive T7 RNA polymerase produces more RNA and thus increases the protein yield if the DNA template used in transcription is circular and contains no terminating sequences.
Figure 7. The effect of rolling cycle transcription. The effect of DNA circularization on transcription and thus translation rate was measured by employing In vitro transcription and translation kit with two different DNA templates: circulated with no terminator sequences and linear. The hydrolysis rate of substrate nucleotide was tracked by measuring the decay of absorbance with at 310 nm.
5. Information recording (merging, amplification, reference nucleotides)
Before the catalytic activity of biomolecule could be recorded into DNA sequence as a ratio of incorporated product and reference nucleotides, suitable conditions for multiple displacement amplification (MDA) reaction and droplet merging had to be determined.
However, first we choose to create a mathematical phi29 DNA amplification model that imitates the amplification of the CAT-Seq Esterase DNA template with random hexamers (https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG/Model). The data generated by using the mathematical phi29 model informed us about a potential inhibitory effects of substrate nucleotides and the effect it might have on amplified DNA fragment size distribution. Based on the output of the model we set out to investigate the inhibitory effects caused by substrate nucleotides.
Figure 8. Amplified DNA correlation to substrate nucleotide concentration in the reaction. DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750µM dNTP concentration with varied substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of substrate nucleotides the amount of DNA amplified increases as seen by the increased intensity of the DNA band and smear.
The first checkpoint in the journey for determining experimental conditions for CAT-seq workflow was to investigate the working concentrations of dNTP and substrate nucleotides and and their potential inhibitory effect. MDA reactions were performed with different dNTP and substrate-dCTP concentrations and the amplified DNA was analyzed on agarose gel. Results shown on Fig."

Introduction
People all over the world today tend to lose interest in science, so we think that this tendency disturb progress of synthetic biology. For example, ordinary people seem to think recombinant DNA technologies, which are the basis of synthetic biology as unpleasant. In this way, they do not fully understand what recombinant DNA technologies are, and they still hesitate to buy and eat GM foods. These problems seem to be faced in the world when recombinant DNA technologies will be developed and used in many fields. We want a lot of people to know not only in Japan but also in the world, so we try these things as Human Practice.
At the open campus (2012/08/10,11)
We prepared a booth to introduce iGEM in KIT Open Campus and explained our activity of iGEM to a visitor.
To make the presentation simple, we tried to avoid using technical terms.
Besides, we displayed model organisms used in genetics, such as fruit-fly Drosophila melamogaster, baker's yeast Saccharomyces cereviciae, and colon bacterium Eschericia coli. Students could see Drosophila mutants. And we displayed ""E.Coli Pen"" and some pictures drawn with it.
We aimed to make their understanding clear, and make them feel familiar to genetic engineering.
Survey
Because we wanted to know what kind of image does a thousand and more people of the age to reach the elderly from a high school student have to recombinant DNA technologies, Drosophila melanogaster and Leukemia which we use in Drosophila melanogaster Workshop. For this purpose, we KIT-Kyoto sent out questionnaire survey to them in cooperation with team Osaka and Ehime-Japan . We collected answers from not only students major in biology but also in chemistry, information technology, mechanical engeneering and art in college, in addition to the attendee to the college's open day or people at facebook. Therefore, we could get various ways of thinking to synthetic biology, regardless of their age, job or majors in college.
You can see our questionnaire here .
Also, this is the result .
The result says, 97% of people feel Drosophila as dirty, "

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," class… but unfortunately, no one person can do this competition alone. If your team mate can finish the task at hand twice as fast, perhaps you should consider asking them to help you out. There is no need to give yourself extra stress and frustration if another team member is more capable of doing the job. This idea also works in reverse – if you’re a machine in lab work, maybe you should not be coding that wiki.
Destress – According to Lazarus et al. (1984), reducing stress not only improves communication and inter-team relationships but can also cause an increase in focus and concentration and increase to your sense of time and activity.
According to the World Health Organization, over four hundred million people suffer from depression or other stress related disorders in the world. Being stressed in iGEM is completely normal. Since many of the projects are conceptualized by the students, they feel a great sense of responsibility for the research and the development of their idea. As researchers, our job is to push the frontiers of knowledge and work with the unknown. Unfortunately, not every experiment is going to work out – and that’s alright!
Some ways you can reduce stress:
Exercise – Walking thirty minutes a day decreases the amount of cortisol, a stress hormone, in your body. In small amounts, cortisol is harmless but when people become stressed, their body beings to produce cortisol non-stop. In high amounts, cortisol is known to cause immune system failure. (That’s not the kind of bacteria we want!)
Being social – Being a student researcher can be very time consuming and mentally draining. It is important to take time for yourself to spend with close friends and family. iGEM should not take over your life for four months! Do not forget to relax a little and have some fun.
Sleep – Studies show that by resting twenty to thirty minutes a day, you can improve your overall performance and alertness while also rejuvenating and refreshing your mind (Faraut et al., 2005). As researchers, our minds are our most important asset! We have to take care of our mental health.
Your psychological and mental well-being is the strongest predictor of productivity (Donald et al., 2005). If you are not in your right state of mind, you will not be making a positive contribution in your team. Time is of the essence in the iGEM competition and if you are on a team, they are relying on you to hold your own weight. Take care of your body, your mind and you will be able to manage your time effectively and finish your work efficiently.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Saw two bands on the PCR, both around 400 bp in length.  These were from wells 3 and 10 (from the right of the gel), which correspond to mCYC + ZifA BS and pCYC promoter, respectively.
Also, will do PCR purifications of the parts that were successful, namely all activators and apparently all mCYC + BS parts as well.
So far, we have positive PCR results for all 3 activators and also for all three mCYC + binding sites, as well as what appears to be the pCYC promoter.  However, while the band seemed to be at 400 bp, whereas the actual length of this part is 288 bp.  Thus, we were unsure about the true identity of that band of DNA.  Incidentally, since we only plan"

How to do a quality control system? ColiAlert!
All laboratory as well as, every machine must have a quality control. Our idea was to use a system based on colorimetric changes to control the quality of the automated extraction robot system. For this, we created ColiAlert. The ColiAlert are bacteria genetically modified that present pink color due the presence of chromoproteins.  For this, the biobricks sent to construct a composite that under natural conditions expressed pink, and after extraction procedures, shows yellow color.    For this purpose, we decided to use in our project, biobricks provided by the registry. At that stage, it was very important software developed by team-Aalto Helsinki, the BiobrickSeeker. Much time was saved thanks to this tool, which facilitates the search of biobricks sent. Then, were selected chromoproteins available in the registry by Uppsala team, to build our quality control.
It was then possible to construct 3 biobricks. The first (K1565000) is an indicator of cell lysis by the presence of oleic acid. Oleic acid is one of the fatty acids present in the plasmatic membrane. This acid is released in the presence of cell lysis. We built a biobrick with a promoter sensitive to the presence of oleic acid, which stimulates the production of blue chromoprotein for signaling process (Figure 1).
With the same purpose of signaling the process of extracting nucleic acids, two more biobricks (K1565001 and K1565002)were created (Figure 2). In these yellow chromoproteins were used. This chromoprotein is sensitive in the presence of pH changes. Thus, E. coli transformed with either of these two biobricks, grew with pink color due to the neutral pH of LB media.  However, with the addition of the solution at acidic pH, the bacteria instantaneously change their color to"

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html,"otoxins. The factors produced by these pathogens are specific, can diffuse through the ground and are small enough to be detected using our aptamer system [10] . As output-signal our bacteria should produce pesticides. Therefore we could make use of a TEF-protease at the intracellular domain. The cleaving off of a transcription factor could trigger the transcription of a specific gene encoding for a pesticide. Subsequent translation of the mRNA produced will form the necessary pesticides. Especially antimicrobial peptides could easily be produced making use of bacterial mechanisms. By adding the appropriate signals to the pesticide, it will be transported out of the bacteria cell and into the surroundings. There it will attack the pathogen and protect the plant roots.
Of course one should consider the risks when bringing a genetically modified organism into the environment. To learn more about safety measures we consulted with Frank van der Wilk from COGEM. He stimulated us to think about a safe way to bring our bacteria into the environment.  A possible solution could be to put our pesticide producing bacteria in beads that can be spread across the land inside fertilizer for example.[see safety beads
For the safety part of our project we produced alginate beads as designed by the iGEM team of Paris Bettencourt (2012). Therefore, polymer formation is used to encapsulate the potentially harmful bacteria. The advantage of using this alginate bead is that it captures the bacteria, but still allows for the diffusion of possibly useful molecules from the surroundings. A disadvantage, that could form a problem for our application in pesticide secretion, is that the material has a low mechanical strength and chemical durability.  Polymer chemistry is one of the most quickly developing fields and there are multiple ways to tune polymer properties. Mechanical strength can for example be tuned by the branching rate, where an increase in branching leads to a higher stress-strain ratio. Modulations to the polymer backbone can in turn increase chemical durability, by reducing oxidative susceptibility [11] . A variety of different porous materials is developed for different purposes [12] .
] However, this would entail the risk of the beads being eaten by animals and might lead to contamination of different lands.  An alternative solution could be to produce a tube of a similar material that can be spread across the land. This could avoid contact between our bacteria and animals. Also it could create an easy method for renewing bacteria, by simply putting fluid containing our bacteria in the hose at one end.   In either case it is important that the material used is semipermeable. This means it would allow for (products of) pathogens to diffuse into the tube and for pesticides"
Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project#detailed_-_-_TEXT.html," angiogenesis, and differentiation in neoplasms with the targets amenable to therapeutic interventions in cancer therapy. Membrane-bound human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER), c-MET, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediate mitogenic signals from extracellular ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin growth factors (IGF) are the most popular ligands.
Abnormal expression of integrins in tumor
It is strongly believed that the most promising type of tumor-specific markers are vascular receptors mainly involved in the neoangiogenesis of the solid tumors and the promotion of cancer cells migration and their invasiveness. Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood capillaries are formed from preexisting vessels, is a hallmark of cancer. The process is a common feature to many solid tumors and angiogenic targets are easily accessible for systemic treatments and are genetically stable. These targets are also could be exploited for imaging and destructing tumor blood vessels.
Integrins are the crucial family of receptors for for cell-matrix adhesion and are also involved in various cell-cell adhesion processes. Furthermore, integrins create transmembrane connections to the cytoskeleton and are pivotal for working of many intracellular signaling pathways. Therefore, integrins and their ligands play key roles in development, immune response, cellular hemostasis and cancer. Equipped with these various functions, integrins are desired targets of effective therapeutic drugs and are objects of intensive continuous research in the area for development and targeting of drugs.
Until now, 18 α and 8 β integrins subunits are known in mammalian cells to associate non-covalently forming 24 integrin heterodimers. Each type of subunit is a peculiar glycoprotein which consists of a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix and a short cytoplasmic tail. It should be remark that each of the 24 integrins appears to have a specific, nonredundant function (this can be concluded both from their interactors specificities and from phenotypes of knockout mice).
The relevance of α5β1 integrin as a proangiogenic factor arises from some knock-out experiments. It is assumed that both fibronectin and aforementioned integrin directly regulate angiogenesis.

It was refreshing to see                  their enthusiasm; as we received many questions on the matter after the speech. The crowd also seemed to be                  pleasantly surprised by the fact that us, high school students could come up with such an intricate project.
Overall, this congress served us as a platform in which we reached a large audience (1000 people) to introduce them bioethanol.
Synthetic Biology Day ‘18 with Bilkent Unam
Two weeks before the Giant Jamboree, we attended a conference in Bilkent University, that the Bilkent                  UNAM iGEM team was organizing. From the start of the event, many biologists, project coordinators, and                  university students gave presentations on the innovative projects they have done. When we realized we                  were the only high school students at the conference, we got more and more nervous.
During our presentation, we highlighted the importance of replacing fossil fuels, how our country is not                  taking the steps needed and the urgency of changing. We showed the results we got from our survey to our                  audience consisting of educators, future biologists, and professors. The significance in showing our survey                  was that it actually indicated a lack of knowledge amongst our community that educators can change by                  influencing their students.
As we carried on by presenting our own project, Bio-E, we did more than teaching them about biofuels and                  bioethanol, we taught them about even little changes made by with the age of whatever, can contribute to                  something bigger than themselves. For us, we are a part of many communities, from the iGEM community to                  our country’s, and in all, we are responsible for doing better and for the better.  By this means, the                  conference was our key to have a two-way dialogue with a room of people who will and already has dedicated                  their lives to have an influence on others.
Furthermore, we have realized that we should also direct more of our human practices to university students                  and to graduates. With this thought in mind, we have arranged an interview on a radio station at the 9th of                  October.
On the Radio to Increase Awareness about Biofuels
We gave an interview to maxFM, a local radio station in Ankara, Turkey, in a radio program hosted by                  Özgür Aksuna. We got to share our project, our impact, the importance of bioethanol, and biofuels on a wide                  platform, in a very popular radio station, reaching hundreds of thousands. We explained the obstacles"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", we want the diffusivity of the nutrients to have one value and not be split up. So again we took the average, although we discussed the fact this would favour small values, but we came across a website of the FCSXpert Team (Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy) of Sensor Technologies LLC. They stated that, whatever average calculation you used, it is not a bad way to calculate it as long as it is noted how it is calculated. (15) So for our calculation we took D0,AAs and D0,oligo, summed them and divided them by 2 to get: D0,nut = 5.35E-10 m2/s.
For the diffusivity of NaCl through water we found the value of D0,NaCl =  1.607 * 10-9 m2/s(16). However, since NaCl is a common salt present in all kinds of solutions, we did not think that taking the average would actually realistically influence the total diffusion constant, because the medium in the gel itself will already contain salts like NaCl. Moreover, as said before, it does not contribute to the production of lysostaphin.             Going back to the nutrient diffusivity, thus without taking NaCl into account, we do not want the diffusivity through water (D0) but through the hydrogel, the effective diffusivity De. We use equation 2 to calculate De from D0,nut, εt and τc. For the nutrients we then get:             De,nut = 3.98E-10 m2/s.
Calculation 3
To determine the uptake of E. coli cells of nutrients, we first assumed that the E. coli bacteria in our gel would always use the maximum amount of nutrients available, whether it is used for growth, protein production, division or other processes. Selvarasu et al. conducted experiments to determine the uptake of amino acids by E. coli that are programmed to maximize growth rate during the growth phase using linear programming (LP)(17). They showed AA uptake during three growth phases in which the uptake was maximized in the first growth phase. So to match our assumption we chose to use their data acquired during the first growth phase in column three, Table III of their article, the biosynthetic demand per amino acid in mmol/gDCW/h (DCW is short for Dry Cell Weight).
We divided the biosynthetic demand per AA by 3600 to get the demand per AA in mg/gDCW/s. Next, we"

Yet, according the majority, the impact of GMOs spreading is dependent of the contamination domain or the degree of modification of the organism, thus meaning that it is not an unreasoned fear. But eventually, over 70% think it would be necessary to limit GMOs research for 2 main reasons. First, to stay ethically irreproachable. The other reason is that some domains should be more restricted to GMOs research than others and this is not the case yet. The other 30% think we should carry on with researches without taking into consideration any ethical boundaries.

2. The ethics behind bacteria entering a wound site. (Talia) Ethically speaking this project could provide many questions which the team would need to answer. These questions are centered primarily around implementation. However, two main questions developed on the basis of this project description are: Clotting: As the Lethbridge team has chosen to use snake blood for their construct, the possibility that clotting could occur elsewhere in the body other than at the wound site is relatively high. Ethically speaking this problem could be evaluated many ways. If one is a follower of Kant's belief of dialogical ethics for example, they would be bound by their moral imperative to act rather than the rightness or wrongness of any consequences. Meaning that one could justify the potential use of snakes venom even if their was a high possibility of life threatening clotting as the means are good. They focus on the potential that we could save a life. So based off that, the use of snake venom could be an ethical approach while keeping in mind that the Lethbridge team also intends on investigating the rightness or wrongness of their procedures before any possible application to humans. Bacteria: The second ethical dilemma is surrounding the direct contact of bacteria and a vulnerable wound site. Currently this project uses the chassis e coli. This presents a problem as the directly contact of the e coli could lead to infection or septic shock. Most laboratory strains such as k-12 have very rarely if ever been directed implicated in disease. (1) This means that the likelihood of someone getting sick from contact with the construct is very unlikely. However, one could be concerned about the patient going into septic shock. Also known as sepsis can take place as a result of an infection and cause very drastic changes in the body. Often times the inflammation caused as a result of sepsis can lead to tiny blood clots. This can block oxygen and nutrients from reaching vital organs. (2) This in combination with the potential clotting of blood due to snake venom could have drastic, and life threatening effects on the patient. The ethical approach of Plato which focuses on Eudaimonia or well being could justify this action, as it is intended to create a well being.
3. The Doctrine of Double Effect (Acacia) The Doctrine of Double Effect is mostly used in the medical community, it essentially says that anything done for a positive end result, but which may cause serious harm, is ethical(1). Though this is in direct conflict with the oath to “Do No Harm” it is an accepted practice in the medical community."

To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules, with categories like “pathogenicity” and “antibiotic resistance.” More complicated words would be bolded, with a reference list explaining these words in an educational way. Although the project was not completed, it remains an idea that will be pursued in the future. You can see some of the designs below.
Mycobacterium NBB4
Myca is a soil bacteria that was first found in Sydney, Australia. It’s able to eat ethylene, a gas that causes some fruits to ripen, like apples, bananas and avocados.
Bacillus cereus
This rod-shaped bacterium loves starchy foods like rice, but can cause food poisoning if left to grow for too long. It can make spores that are able to survive cooking temperatures up to boiling point, and toxins which are highly resistant to heat and acid.
Lactobacillus acidophilus
This guy loves to grow in acidic environments, like in dairy foods, and helps to make its home even more acidic by fermenting sugars into lactic acid. It’s used to make some types of yoghurt and is considered a probiotic because of its health benefits.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Although it’s found naturally in our bodies, if this guy is in the wrong place at the wrong time it can cause serious disease. This bacteria is often found to infect burn wounds, where it thrives in the slimy eschar. It is also a serious problem in hospitals, because it can resist a lot of the drugs we try to use against it.
Pseudomonas fluorescens
This bacterium is found in both soil and water and is able to swim with the help of a tail, known as a flagellum. It is also able to fluoresce (glow) due to a pigment it produces called pyoverdin.
Staphylococcus aureus
Golden staph is found happily living on our skin and in our noses. Under the microscope these round bacteria like to cluster into a “bunch of grapes” formation. Unfortunately, as cute as it is, this bacterium can cause serious wound infections and is resistant to many antibiotics.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," as a conjugated antibody for the Western blot so it got pushed back until the next week.
October 16- October 21
We finally tested out the copper part using a fluorescence test and it is functional. We also completed the tests on the plasmids that we received from William and Mary. We were also able to isolate the Cas9 part and it is also very close to completion, it's just missing one final part and has some small mutations. We also ran our Western blot this week. Unfortunately, it was not successful and we didn't see any expression from the blot. We had another two high school visits during the week and they both went well and we talked about synthetic biology and plasmids and iGEM itself. We have another collaboration with BUGSS this weekend as well.
October 22- October 27
This week, we ran a gel on the final Cas9 samples to find one that was correctly completed to submit. The gel for the Cas9 looked good, but the sequencing did not, so we are attempting to redo it before the deadline. We didn't end up doing anything else for the banana project. Now that the year is wrapping up, we are submitting all of our parts before the deadline and making the final touches to the website.
Interlab study
W&M Testing
Mid-Atlantic Meetup
Interlab Study
Expansion of synthetic biology requires collaborative work, where scientists are able to both share and reproduce constructs. However, the lack of a standard protocol for fluorescence measurements prevents direct comparison of data between teams. To propose a solution, the 2017 iGEM’s Fourth International Interlab study invited teams to contribute data towards establishing a standard measurement of fluorescence of fluorescein.. The 2017 UMaryland iGEM team has performed the interlab study with the plate reader protocol and transformation of the specified parts as directed by the Measurement Committee’s guidelines.
Procedures
Absorbance measurements were collected using a n of 3
All measurements were performed with a standard 96 well flat-bottom plate, with each well filled to a total volume of 100uL for every solution tested.
Calibration of our microplate reader used LUDOX-S40 as a single point reference to appropriately convert absorbance values into a standard OD600 measurement. Absorbances were measured for four replicates per LUDOX and deionized water at 600 nm.
Determination of the fluorescein concentration required a standard curve. A fluorescein 1x stock solution of 50uM was prepared via resuspension of 2x solution (100u"
