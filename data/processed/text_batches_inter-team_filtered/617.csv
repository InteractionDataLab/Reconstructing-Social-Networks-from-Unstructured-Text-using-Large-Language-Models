Lindy DHARMAWAN
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad you might think that would make biology among her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing... well, everything. Her plans after UST include earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Words of Wisdom:
When lab work gives you lemons, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.
Winnie Wai In HUI
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST she wanted to try anything new. That was why she joined the iGEM team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memories and friendships through iGEM.
Food for Thought
Although there may be failures in experiments, it is really exciting to see our results come out!
Doyle Jihwan LEE
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Sciences student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization involved in public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Doyle's Two Cents on Life
Doyle sometimes feel envious toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live without stress and tension unlike the neuron cells in his brain.
Cecilia Xilin SHI
Cecilia is a sophomore majoring in financial mathematics and statistics. As she majors in a subject unrelated to biology she only knew a little about synthetic biology before joining, which she did to explore the"

Xiaoyan Hu
 
I am a medical microbiology teacher. I am gald to be an instructor of SDU_CHINA. I am skilled in a variety of experimental skills and responsible for the safety of whole team members in the lab. All students were trained before the experiment starting. In the whole processes, I sensed the passion of these college students and they had lot of fun in this summer!
Qian Cao
 
I am a teacher of Qilu medical college of Shandong University .I major in pathogen biology, I have been working more than 10 years in the laboratory. I like travel and fitness. I am glad to make friends with my classmates. In the team，I helped the classmates to learn safety forms of experimental operation. Wish all to achieve satisfactory results in this summer!
Ying Xiao
Advisors
 
I am a postgraduate in Shandong University, major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I am a kind of person who is easily moved and somewhat of a perfectionist, even in small things, and I do need more self-confidence to see a thing through to the end. I love reading, which can give me happiness and quiet. I really enjoy my life now, although I still have many dreams to chase. In this summer, being an advisor, I am very glad to be involved in iGEM and synthetic biology.
Fei Xie
 
I am a senior student of University of Minnesota, Twin Cities majoring in biochemistry. As an undergraduate student who participated into iGEM twice before, I become the advisor of SDU_China this year. By giving advice on project and experimental design, as well as data processing, I helped to determine how to prove our hypothesis well.
Huiyu Li
 
 
I am Mengqi Jia，a Ph.D Candidate of Shandong University. I helped the team to design the gRNA sequence and gave some important suggestions on construction of plasmid.

Ogem
All the Ontario iGEM teams gathered at the University of Waterloo for the first ever oGEM gathering on May 29th. During this gathering, we had the opportunity to listen to Andrew Hesselʼs presentation and discuss many issues concerning Ontario teams. One of the major focuses of discussion was forming a federation of iGEM Ontario teams. We all agreed that such an organization needs to be a federation of teams that acts of behalf of Ontario teams as a stronger voice and provides a communication point for teams to assist each other.

For digestion of P73, P81, P134 15 µl of the mastermix for XbaI+PstI-HF was added to 5 µl of plasmid DNA.
Analytical digestion mixes were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h.
2 µl of DNA loading buffer (10x) was added to each reaction batch.
10 µl of each sample was loaded into the gel pocket.

Traveled to Carnegie Mellon University for a practice Jamboree and Workshop
Sunday, September 7, 2014
Our lab is currently  undergoing a large move to a new building.  In the next few weeks not much wet lab work could be done because we had limited access to incubated shakers and other lab materials that are always necessary.
We gained a lot of positive and constructive feedback from the practice Jamboree. Hopefully we can work on having a more cohesive presentation for the giant jamboree!

2. incubate the mixture at -20°C for one hour
3. centrifuge the mixture for 15 minutes at 18,000 rpm, 4°C
4. discard the supernatant
5. add 50 µl 70 % ethanol
6. centrifuge the mixture for another 10 minutes at 18,000 rpm, 4°C
7. remove supernatant with a pipet CAREFULLY. If pellet moves, centrifuge again.
8. air-dry the pellet until the ethanol is completely evaporated. Do not over-dry pellet as this makes dissolving more difficult.

Decoder to detect concentration range—above/below limits assign 1 or 0. Can use decoder to tell what range of concentration you’re in. if in normal range, no response. If upper range, produce insulin or something. If below, promote gluconeogenisis.
Biomineralization: Silver-metal alloys not from e.coli but from organism physiologically similar to e. coli. Relatively characterized. Should work since they’re similar organisms.  Works for decoder if we can get alloys to work.  Doesn’t exploit RNA part of decoder. RNA produces quick response. Bring metal in, chelate it, reduce it, complex it, determine extracellular location. Probably need 1 porin for each metal.
Biosurfactants: part of crude oil refinery. Changes the hydrophobicity of the area of the cell. Used for heavy metal crystallization, gold. bioemulsifiers. Work for a bunch of stuff. Surfactant: absorb at surfaces by modifying chemical interactions. Basically detergents, ie: soap. Emulsifier: makes oil and water mix. Important in mining and oil. Lots of uses in industry. Lots of material, information. two systems—biosurfactant, bioemulsifier. Make cell that produces these. All cells have these properties to some degree. Heavy metal removal from sediments with biosurfactants.   Project would be using biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers for oil refining, possible biomineralization. Used to purify components in oil spills. Surfactants enhance solubilization. Inhibits corrosion.  Quantum dots: organisms produce specific crystallized metals, put to membrane, “green” way of producing crystals for nanotechnology. Nothing with any characterization.
Decision: Biomineralization applied to decoder

Lethbridge,2012,Team:Lethbridge#team_-_-_TEXT.html," neuroscience major with an interests in synthetic biology for biomedical applications, in particular by engineering and modifying genetic circuits to facilitate enhanced communication and information processing between cells. Iain wishes to design more refined methods for neurobiological research by building upon the pre-existing knowledge of synthetic biology principles. He is captivated by iGEM because he believes it acts not only as a nexus for innovative and extraordinary applications that will shape and define the 21st century, but is a community rich in intellectual resources through which undergraduates previously had limited access to. He plans to pursue a career in biomedical research focusing on creating new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.
Isaac Ward
Hello, I am a 3rd year Neuroscience major, and looking to gain all the experience I can in my undergrad career.  So I am back for a second year of iGEM.  I think iGEM provides great opportunities to diversify my skill set and while opening the doors to new possibilities.    As an example this year I got the opportunity to be an advisor for the first Lethbridge High School iGEM team, it was an amazing experience to say the least. When I am not busy in the labs (like that ever happens), I enjoy being out having great adventures.
Jenn Huynh
Hello world! My name is Jennifer and I have currently only slogged through three full years of my major, Biochemistry. I have just recently been sucked into this whirling vortex of a world known as iGEM due to many persuasive arguments and have not yet lived to regret such a decision (which is a good thing). Hopefully the science and technology, that will further our lives in the very near future, will keep the remainder of the summer and the beginnings of autumn refreshing and fascinating. In the mean time while I am not slaving away in the lab I will occupy my time with catching up on sleep that I have missed during my time as a real student of the University of Lethbridge. It’s a pleasure to introduce myself and hopefully new friendships will emerge in the nearby future. Peace out … for now.
Justin Luu
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be going into my second of four years in the B.Sc Biochemistry program. This is my first year competing in the iGEM competition and I am extremely excited. When I am not in the lab I enjoy sleeping, eating and spending time with family/friends. Oh wait! Movies are pretty good too! Thanks for taking the time to read my bio.

To determine whether the now correct SOX had been successfully expressed another SDS-Page gel was performed. After inducing, harvesting and washing the cells 1 ml was taken from each culture to be loaded into the gel. The cells were lysed using lysozyme and boiled for 3 minutes at 100°C loading 10 µl into the gel (Figure 7).
Figure 7: Sarcosine Oxidase expression was induced by adding 40 µl of 100 mM IPTG. Lane 1: 6 µl ladder, Lane 2: 10 µl sfGFP, Lane 3: BL21-DE3, Lane 4: 10µl SOX 1, Lane 5: 10 µl SOX 2, Lane 6: 10 µl SOX 3, Lane 7: 10 µl SOX 4, Lane 8: 10 µl SOX 5, Lane 9: 10 µl SOX 6, Lane 10: 6 µl ladder. Circled bands show sarcosine oxidase at ~42 kDa, the expected molecular weight.
To test for the presence of formaldehyde, and to demonstrate this part works, larger cultures were grown following the aforementioned protocols, and the cells harvested, washed and lysed by sonication. 0 µl, 20 µl, 200 µl and 2 ml of Glyphosate at 10 mg/L concentration was added to the cell lysate and incubated at 37°C. Every 2.5 hours the lysate was tested for the presence of formaldehyde with commercial formaldehyde testing strips .
After 8 hours of testing and left overnight, none of the samples had produced formaldehyde according to the testing strips. The testing strips detect a minimum formaldehyde concentration of 10 mg/L, so it was possible that formaldehyde had been produced but that there was too little of it to detect with the strips.
We decided to add Sarcosine instead of Glyphosate to determine whether the part was working. Everything was repeated the same but instead we added 0 µl, 50 µl and 200 µl of Sarcosine at 0.9 g/50 ml (Figure 8).

Our team engaged with the public about synthetic biology often, most notably when we presented at the NASA Ames Research Center Showcase, the Mountain View Tech Showcase, and the NIAC Symposium in Boston. At all of these events we presented on our project to a diverse audience –– ranging from children to researchers working on NASA. At the showcases we also extended our presentation to what the field of synthetic biology is, teaching through demonstration: having individuals extract strawberry DNA (to the delight of many children) and fold up paper origami. It was also particularly rewarding to hear young people, especially young girls, say how much they our project and that they wanted to pursue an education in science.
NASA Silicon Valley Innovations: From the Earth to the Moon and Mars
At the NASA Silicon Valley Innovations: From the Earth to the Moon and Mars Showcase, we were able to engage with several children and introduce them to the field of synthetic biology. As mentioned above, we conducted quick & fun experiments with children ranging from ages 5 to 10 to extract the DNA from strawberries. We also folded DNA structures with them from printed cut outs, as well as provided a mini Mars like environment to encourage children to play and think about how to build their own dream Space Habitat. We additionally had the opportunity to talk to professionals at NASA who further informed our project and encouraged us to consider different avenues of research. We similarly were able to expose them to the potential for synthetic biology in their own practice.  You can learn more about the NASA Ames Showcase by seeing their webpage linked here.

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.

AGP/INV:
Procedure: AGP was PCR amplified from Synechocystis PCC 6803 genomic DNA using the AGP forward and reverse primers and an initial annealing temperature of 57 degrees C. PCR was confirmed successful on 0.7% agarose gel at 13.8V cm. In order to construct the vector backbone for gibson assembly of the AGP knockout/INV operon, the AGP PCR product was topocloned into the TOPOIIPCRBlunt vector (Invitrogen), transformed into DH5α cells, and plated on LB-KNN/2% X-Gal. Successful transformants were selected and incubated in liquid cultures of LB-KNN broth, and plasmid DNA was isolated using a miniprep kit(QIAgen). Plasmid DNA was digested with PstI and SpI at a final concentration of 25 ng/ul. Restriction digests were verified on 0.7 % agarose gel at 13.8V/cm
Results: The electrophoresis data confirmed successful topocloning of agp into the TOPIIBlunt vector for 3 out of the 6 colonies selected. Bands were observed at the expected size for the vector (3.5 kb) and agp (1320 bp). Thus, these plasmid samples will be used for subsequent PCR to obtain the linearized agp/vector backbone for use in Gibson assembly. Also, the sequencing data for INV was checked and confirmed the presence of INV in pSB1C3. Thus, the DNA will be submitted as a part to the iGEM Registry of Biological Parts.

An experiment was done to determine what levels of glucose would be able to give us a noticeable increase in growth for Iq cells grown in BG-11.  Past experiments have shown that the minimum concentration we've used (10 mM) is as effective as higher concentrations, so we wished to see how much lower we could get the concentration, on the chance that our cyanobacteria supplies less than 10 mM glucose.  Glucose concentrations tested were: 10 mM, 5.0 mM, 2.5 mM, 1.0 mM and 0.50 mM.  The experiment was run in triplicate with the pH of all media adjusted to 6.7.
The growth curves indicated that 5 mM glucose consistently produced even greater cell growth than 10 mM and growth slowly dropped off"

As a novice, the primary part I am in charge with is the designing and actualizing of our wiki. Sharing ideas with my coworkers is like watching a firework show --- the infinite sparkles of innovations.
I am Beiduo RAO majored in chemical engineering and I am supposed to have my last year in Tsinghua University as an undergraduate students. I applied for this iGEM in an attempt to broaden knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry to which I have a plan to devote in the future. I always enjoy the happy time in the lab doing experiments. It makes me feel proud of myself, especially in terms of operational ability, and figure out a new definition of myself in the harmony of this team.
Hi! I’m Hao SUN and I am going to be a sophomore once more time in the coming new semester. Please hang on a second if you were considering me as a bad student with poor grades.

As confused as I’ve got with the larger and larger gap between my status quo --- a student majored in chemical engineering --- and my real talent and interest --- computer and programming, my dream hiding in the bottom of my heart is becoming clearer and clearer and finally up to the surface. I changed my major to computer science and thanks to iGEM, I find me the true self this time.
Hi, I’m Hewei TANG a senior student majored in Chemical Engineering. I enjoy the whole procedure of taking part in this awesome IGEM team and working with my fellow teammates. Taking in charge of Human Practice, I find a brand new perspective to appreciate synthetic biology and what it can do for our life. I hope that synthetic biology can be a widely accepted concept one day and that everybody can know how it will make a difference.
Hi, here is Han WANG, a junior student majored in chemical engineering. Tasks in our iGEM team are strenuous and at the same time challenging and enjoyable. As a sophomore last year, I had not tried doing a research, and was entirely confused with the sophisticated equipments in our lab at first. It is really fascinating to take"

The PhyscoFilter for Fluorescein
Figure 6: Successfully selected moss with membrane-anchored FluA. You can clearly see the GFP fluorescence of the membrane-anchored FluA in the edges of the moss cells. Upper images: GFP-fluorescence; lower two left: brightfield; lower two right: GFP-fluorescence plus chloroplast autofluorescence.
In order to prove the suitability of surface immobilized binding molecules in general and of aniticalins in particular we decided to transform our moss with a genetic construct containing FluA , an Anticalin with a high affinity towards fluorescein, fused at the C-terminus to the N-terminus of our developed trans membrane receptor . Especially in the upper and lower fluorescence images on the right a compared to the cytoplasm increased membrane associated GFP fluorescence can be seen. This fluorescence indicates that our used secretion signal and trans membrane domain work properly and lead to the desired membrane localization.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,".
A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a software tool is only accessible if it is properly maintained, updated and if it has a community supporting it. What would happen to Neptune after iGEM? Where will Neptune be in 5 years? If we seriously cared about promoting an accessible workflow, we had to make sure we considered the future of our tool.
What is NONA?
And so we proceeded to reach out to the NONA Research Foundation, a nonprofit whose aim is to broaden access to and develop a community around open source synthetic biology software tools. As cited from the organization, “Nona creates long-lasting solutions to the challenges posed by the rapidly growing complexity of software in the synthetic biology community by using the power of open source.”
Integrating with NONA provided 3 long-term, sustainable solutions to promoting the accessibility of Neptune and microfluidics to the synthetic biology community.
1) NONA would distribute Neptune, allowing Neptune to have a “home” where is can easily be found (beyond GitHub.)
2) NONA is dedicated to integrating all open synthetic biology software tools under one umbrella, thus building a community of researchers and developers who who will use and support these tools. Thus, NONA will be a medium through which other developers can contribute to Neptune, and NONA will be a place researchers can go to learn more about how to use Neptune, ask for help, and so forth.
3) Overall, by having a dedicated community and website where Neptune will always have a place, we are making it very hard for Neptune to be abandoned. Quite the opposite, with NONA will ensure Neptune is sustained for years to come, while also providing the opportunity for a community to flourish around Neptune and similar software tools.
Passing Neptune to NONA
We met with members of NONA to discuss integrating Neptune with their foundation. Discussions went really well; indeed, while NONA offered us a lot in terms of accessibility and sustainability, we found that our team could give NONA a hand as well.
We agreed to pass Neptune along to the NONA community. Neptune, with its installation link and all of the documentation were passed along to NONA. In the coming weeks more and more of Neptune’s supporting content; wiki’s, tutorials and all documentation will be pushed to NONA’s site.
NONA will now holistically support Neptune and ensure it is a successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune"

Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.
Reddit Synthetic Biology Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange . Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations.

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Citrobacter-Freundii#6-Valencia_-_-_TEXT.html," was used to inoculate bottles of M9 minimal medium (containing glucose as a carbon source) and left to grow at 37°C until the culture reached an OD of 0.15-0.25. Half of the bottles were put into a 44°C waterbath for 5 minutes while the other half were not. The fluorescence of the cultures was then measured every 10 minutes for 70 minutes.
Close the method.
Results
Figure 1: Bac2 characterisation. The bars show standard error.
The results in Figure 1 show that there is a significant difference between the start and end fluorescence of the heat shocked cultures, whereas the control cultures' fluorescence remained more or less the same throughout the testing period.
The fact that the fluorescence of the heat shocked cultures is lower than that of the controls may be due to some of the cells dieing after heat shock or due to slight variation in cell number (even though every effort was made to keep cell numbers even).
Bac3
Plasmid construction: Anaerobiosis promoter + ZsGreen1. This promoter is activated when oxygen concentrations in the medium are low, as this is when its transcriptional regulators become active.
Method (expand)
Colonies were picked from Citrobacter and E. coli + Bac3 plates and inoculated into LB + chloramphenicol40 (1 μl/ml) liquid media and grown overnight (aerobically) at 37°C on a shaker. The following day, the ODs were measured and a normalized amount of these cultures was used to inoculate bottles of LB + chloramphenicol. Half the samples were topped up with LB in order to exclude any air and were incubated for two days at 37°C on a shaker, while the other half were incubated under the same circumstances (without adding the extra LB) and they were uncapped and shaken in order to reareate the culture one day after inoculation.
After two days, the fluorescence and the OD of the cultures was measured in LB. 1ml of the cultures was also transferred to Eppendorf tubes which were spun down and the LB was discarded and the cells were resuspended in water. The fluorescence and OD of these cultures was also measured. This was done to minimize any background fluorescence. Close the method.
Results
The fluorescence readings were divided by the relevant ODs in order to normalize the results. The resulting bar charts can be seen below.

Stuttgart,2017,Team:Stuttgart#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ens. TliA is secreted by the ABC (ATP binding cassette) export system (prtDEF gene cluster) from Dickeya dadantii (formerly known as Erwinia chrysanthemi). The LARD secretion tag for the ABC export system is added directly to the TliA gene, which hopefully leads to a good export yield and a high extracellular activity.  In order to control gene expression, the TliA gene is expressed by the pBAD promoter, which can be induced by arabinose. The prtDEF gene cluster is expressed by a constitutive promoter of mediocre strength. So, the ABC export system is always expressed at a certain level and can export the LARD-tagged TliA lipase, if expressed.
PART II - KERATINASES
For efficient hair degradation we chose different keratinases (KerUS, KerA, KerBL and KerP). Moreover we combined this keratinases with different anderson-promotors (BBa_K206000, BBa_J23114 and BBaJ23102) and signal sequences (PelB, OmpA and PhoA) for extracellular transport of the keratinases.
PART III - A LOVELY SCENT OF ...
The microbial synthesis of natural flavor compounds has become a very attractive alternative to the chemical production (1). In recent years microorganisms such as E.coli and Yeast have been metabolically engineered to produce different flavors like limonene, geraniol or rose (1,2,3). For our project we discussed different approaches and choose two different scents: rose and fir.
... ROSE FRAGRANCE
As first special fragrance we want to install a lovely scent of rose in our microbial system. Hair are commonly made of Keratin (90%) and small amounts of amino acids, such as L-phenylalanine. This amino acid can be used as substrate for the production of 2-Phenylethylacetate (2-PEAc), which has a rose-like odor (1). Therefor this odor can act as an indicator for keratin degradation. In recent studies from Guo et al the 2-PEAc biosynthetic pathway was successfully designed and expressed in E.coli (1). This pathway was used for our project and comprised four steps (Fig.1):

Discussion:
mCherry expression in C8-D30 reactive astrocyte cells was visible. Demonstrating the activity of our dcas9 editing approach and verifying expression of rev-caspase3. In fluorescent microscope we were able to detect mCherry fluorophore in several cells.
By demonstrating mCherry expression we were able to demonstrate both the specificity of our chosen promoter as well as the ability of our system to drive the expression of caspase3 (through the mCherry marker) we have designed into our plasmid.
When we used APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit we run into several issues:
The process of transfection and APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit procedure could influence test results, since in both of these procedures cells may die.
Co-transfection efficiency has a major role in the success of our apoptotic induction, in this experiment the co-transfection efficiency was low but we didn't have time to repeat it.
APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit was calibrated in Jurkat cells. Since we are working with a different cell line further calibration is required.

From left to right: B-M + eCFP, M-B + eCFP, B-M + RFP, M-B + RFP.
The figure appears to show fluorescence from the spun-down pellets of each hybrid promoter + fluorescent protein that had been grown in media contain potassium nitrate; it can be inferred from this that the potassium nitrate has induced the hybrid promoter, resulting in expression of the fluorescent protein reporter.
Fluorometer Experiments
The main characterisation of the BioBricks was carried out using a fluorometer. Five tubes of media containing 200 µL transformed bacteria and potassium nitrate were grown for each BioBrick in concentrations as follows:
. B-M + RFP with 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM potassium nitrate
. B-M + eCFP with 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM potassium nitrate
. M-B + RFP with 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM potassium nitrate
. M-B + eCFP with 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM and 20 mM potassium nitrate
The samples were then spun down in a centrifuge and resuspended in Tris buffer before being subjected to sonication in order to lyse the cells. The resulting solution was then spun down in a centrifuge again before the supernatant was extracted (in order to separate the proteins from the rest of the cell). The supernatant was then run through a fluorometer in order to measure the intensity of fluorescence as a method to gauge the activity of the hybrid promoters. RFP-containing samples were excited with a wavelength of 560 nm and the emission measured from 600 – 650 nm; eCFP-containing samples were excited with a wavelength of 410 nm and emission measured from 440-490 nm.
These characterisation experiments gave rise to the characterisation which is now available on the main page for all hybrid promoter + fluorescent protein parts on the registry, and the experience section of the hybrid promoters alone on the registry.
NOTE: All data for the fluorometer has had the equivalent 0 mM reading subtracted from it in order to nulify the affects of light scattering due to cell debris

The relationship between growth and survival after irradiation of Escherichia coli strain B and two resistant mutants. Journal of general microbiology. 1960;22:113-28. . The UT Austin iGEM 2004 team applied the light sensing property of phototrophs to an E. coli. By aligning different phytochromes with the intrinsic kinase EnvZ from E. coli they revealed a way to create a two-component system consisting of a photoreceptor with an intracellular indigenous regulator system found in E. coli. By establishing this system the bacteria acquired the ability to respond to red light Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. . The photoreceptor from phytochrome known as Cph1 was isolated from the cyanobacteria Synechocytis PCC6803. Cph1 has a fusion site, which can be used to combine it with the kinase EnvZ, from the EnvZ-OmpR kinase-regulator system, to form a two-domain receptor known as Cph8.

Motivation
Every product (including a software) is designed for users' needs. We hope to learn about what problems other iGEM teams meet and to analyze what they need to solve their problems. What’s more, the intention of ordinary amateurs is also supposed to be taken into account.
Practices
This summer, we cooperated with SYSU-CHINA iGEM team in many activities in our campus. (See  collaboration page ) We also exchanged our ideas on Synthetic Biology and iGEM frequently.
One day, we conducted a discussion among members from us, SYSU-CHINA and SCAU-China, with the topic of data collection and integration. All participants agreed that data and information online are so scattered that we have to spend much time on collecting it and reusing it.
SYSU-CHINA hoped to solve this problem and put the hope on us software team. We regarded the fragmented data as a problem, too. So we started to conduct further investigations and interviews on it. More details can be found on our Integrated Human Practices page.
Figure 1. The discussion among SYSU-CHINA, SCAU-China and SYSU-Software.
At the same time, we chatted with some students who are interested in biology work. They told us, “We’ll like the software if it shows details of each bio-project, in a way easy to understand.”
Inspirations on our project
From our investigations and interviews, we found that an integrated database is very important for an iGEM team, also for a research group. Our software is supposed to establish such a database in a standard and easy-to-understand format. It will save one's time, which enables one to focus on his project ideas.
Studying the needs of biology labs
Motivation
Apart from iGEM teams, biology labs and other biotechnology institutes have more rights to speak from a genetic circuit design in papers to a practical experiment protocol in labs. It is also very interesting and exciting to meet them who will be most likely to be affected by our project imagine.
Practices
During the summer, we visited several biology laboratories of Sun Yat-sen University. Researchers warmly greeted us. Thanks to Prof. Lu Yongjun’s help, we finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory.
Figure2: Our team member Wang Ziwei is introducing our project idea to researchers of LU laboratory.
By talking with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.

Before she decided to come all the way from India to Germany to do her masters in Molecular Biosciences with majors in Systems Biology, Aastha had already a bachelor degree in Bioinformatics"
Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#Team#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"  In addition, we met again at the Aachen meetup and finalized the collaboration. Team Aachen helped us by providing us with laser-cutted photomasks for 384 well plates that made it possible to generate QR-codes on 384 well plates.  They also started to generate an app for us that is able to scan a cell culture plate and read out the gained data-matrix. The Application is based on Windows Phone 8. Michael programmed it for us and was very helpful during the trouble shooting process. However, as we started the collaboration a bit too late, the app could not be finished. Nevertheless, it could be shown that in principle, a data matrix can be read by the app. The app acts intuitive, quick and easy and promotes various application areas in the future.

We returned the favour by validating their measurment  device for the ascertainment of optical densites. As we knew that they generated their data for procaryotic cells and they had no possibility to work with mammalian cells, we measured the OD for mammalian cell suspensions.
We made dilution series of a murine cell lines (NIH3T3) with a starting cell number of 10^6 cells per ml, what is a realistic working density and measured the transmission of light with a prototype of their device. In parallel we measured the optical density (OD) of each sample with NanoDrop. To verify the data we performed the experiment with biological as well as with technical triplicates. Cells were diluted in completed growth medium to simulate realistic conditions. Providing these data for Team Aachen they could calculate the true OD value of each sample. The Team incorporated our measured data in their project.
Darmstadt
Team Darmstadt exchanged knowledge with us regarding the usage of the fluorescent marker mKate that we used in our cloning strategy. In addition, they helped us by distributing our survey.

RWTH Aachen
After the meetup in Munich we also went to the Aachen meetup. It was really nice to meet the other teams and to see how their projects have progressed since the last meetup. Also we were very grateful for the opportunity to present our project and getting feedback.
LMU Munich
To get in touch with other iGEM teams we took part in two meet ups. The first one was organized from the team of the LMU Munich. We did this and that, and socialized much those days. We exchanged among the different teams and we came to the conclusion to set up a collaboration with the iGEM team A"

Today, the transformed bacteria arrived from MIT. These were plated out and will grow overnight. Five transformed bacteria ( M30109 , B0032 , E0022 , B0015 and R0084 ) were also inoculated in liquid LB medium. Tomorrow, we will make a liquid culture and glycerol stock from the other parts. The competent cells made on Friday seemed to have grown.

We managed our first day without Jonas...
Nick and Maarten worked on the cascade linking of the filter with the inverter. There are serious problems with linking these 2 parts: in a normal scenario there's an equilibrium between LuxR and the HSL_LuxR-complex in which the amount of LuxR is higher than the amount of the complex. This could be fixed by finetuning some parameters (decreasing/increasing some of the strengths of the promoters or the efficiencies of the rbs'). But the main problem remains: in the equilibrium there's still"

During the process of base complementary pairing, GFP sequence could be ligated onto the vector with the help of T4 DNA ligase. At the same time, the recognition site of PstⅠ would be added to the vector.
To digest RFP sequence, we used NotⅠ and SpeⅠ. We also digested the vector with the same restriction enzyme cutting sites. During the process of base complementary pairing, RFP sequence could be ligated onto vector with the help of T4 DNA ligase. At the same time, the recognition site of XbaⅠwould be added to the vector.
We can either connect 3 fragments: GFP, RFP sequences and the plasmid at the same time, or connect 2 fragments first and then connect the other one. However, when carrying out the second scheme, we should decide which one to be connected first. According to the picture, GFP should be the one.

The terminators were built by PCR extension.
Then we can ligated terminator into the backbone and transformed into competent cells.
Characterization devices testing the performance of the terminators utilized fluorescent proteins to measure input and output and altered the arabinose transport system to control inputs. The fluorescence produced by the characterization devices were then measured using flow cytometry to calculate the termination efficiency of the terminators.

1. Introduction
The goal of the 2018 iGEM team was to explore an alternative waste-water cleaning mechanism that is both environmentally friendly and economically feasible. We hypothesized that one could genetically engineer E. coli to bind to waste particles, and then float to the surface of the reactor, allowing for easy E. coli removal. We:
Create a generic dynamic bioreactor system that utilizes E. coli flotation. This model should be so generic that the bioreactor can be used for a variety of applications, with different cells and different starting conditions. Then we characterized the performance of the system with many different initial starting conditions and parameters.
Benchmark E. coli flotation results, using a cellular tracking algorithm we developed. These results can be coupled with our ODE buoyancy model, which allows us to determine the maximum carrying capacity of our particular strain of cells. This is necessary for the bioreactor, it allows us to determine which genetically engineered E. coli strain can perform for what type of waste particle. This model also allows the wet lab to measure how certain genetic variations affect the flotation. Rather than having flotation or no flotation, we can now quantify the characteristics of flotation.
Characterize the growth dynamics of a particular strain of cells. This data is necessary for the bioreactor.
Note: In the very end of this paper, we included a nomenclature defining all the variables used.

The Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a library of DNA sequences combined with online characterization resources.  The Registry has created a standard protocol for making segments of DNA compatible with all other segments of DNA, regardless of order or size.  BioBrick is the term given to such segments of DNA, a term alluding to the fact that any number of bricks may be combined in any order to produce complex, unique systems.  This is accomplished by standardizing the restriction enzymes used to surround BioBricks, as well as the plasmids used to transform them.  For a graphical representation of of the process, please click here .  A powerful online database provides information and characterization of all of the BioBricks in the Registry and uses the wiki format (the same one used in wikipedia) which encourages others to edit content directly on the page.

Having been developed for more than a decade, synthetic biology has undergone considerable growth in scope, expectation and output, and has become a widely recognized branch of biological research. Our team put in great efforts to raise public awareness of exciting opportunities, heartening achievements and marvelous promise in the field of synthetic biology.
Technological Activities Week
Technological Activities Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year, Technological Activities Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC-China and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.

We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens, then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could learn knowledge while having fun.
The Asian Conference in Taiwan
The Asian Conference was held in Tsinchu, Taiwan by NCTU (National Chiao Tung University) from 19th JUL to 23rd JUL, 2015. Over 30 iGEM teams from the Greater China Region attended the conference and 4 members of our team---Chen Xinan, Yuan Xiaofan, Wu Ziyu, Cui Tianyi was sent to the big gathering.
During the conference, our team made a team introduction and a project presentation to the iGEMers. We received lots of feedbacks from them as well as beneficial guides from the professors of other universities. Not only have we established friendship with other teams in advance, but also we realized where our defects lie and what our future work should focus on. It can be said that we really benefited a lot from the worthy experience in NCT"

Figure.1 The devices’ strength measured by this Interlab Study Discussion
We can see that the values are not the same as Anderson’s Promoters. While we got the correct tendency. The value of the device-3 is lower than the NC’s, we think this may be caused by the fluorescence pollution.
Future
to be finished
In this year’s competition, we constructed a series of sensors to measure the pollutant in water. We have added the E.coli-based Cu ions sensor to the MFC and it was proved that the device can sense the Cu ions concentration. Although we have completed the primary goal, we still have much work to do.
Our device can only detect the concentration of the pollutant while it cannot detect which pollution it is. We will couple the device with a system to monitor which pollutant it is before measuring the concentration. Different chromoproteins can be used in the system to distinguish different kinds of pollution.
Besides, we will try to develop the ribB report gene. We hope that the riboflavin-MFC system can be a new measurement standard system for quantitive measuring.

Experiments and Results
To quantify phasin-HlyA, we carried out two experiments: a secretion assay and SDS-Page:
Secretion assay
For this experiment, the production and secretion of PHB from E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with either pSB1C3-phaCAB-phasin-HlyA Tag or pSB1C3-phaCAB (as a negative control) was measured. Triplicates in LB media + 3% glucose + chloramphenicol were incubated at 37°C and 150 rpm in an aerobic environment for 48 hours, then separated into secreted and intracellular fractions by differential centrifugation at 24-hour intervals. The ""secreted"" fraction contained the media that the cells were incubated in, and any PHB found in this fraction was therefore either secreted or released by lysed (dead) cells. The ""intracellular"" fraction contained all of the live cells. Before separation, CaCl2 was added to promote aggregation and pelleting of the secreted PHB. Our method for fractionation can be found on our Experiments page and has been adapted from research conducted by Rahman et. al (2013).
After fractionation, the secreted fractions were treated with 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS to remove cellular debris that may have been pelleted with the secreted PHB, and the intracellular PHB portions were treated with sodium hypochlorite to extract PHB granules. Both secreted and intracellular PHB pellets were dried overnight and relative yield between the two fractions was compared.
After correcting for the mass of secreted PHB to account for the CaCl2 that was added, the results show that at 48 hours there was a 114% increase in the amount of PHB secreted by cells that contain pSB1C3-phaCAB-Phasin-HlyA Tag compared to cells that contain pSB1C3-phaCAB only. However, there is very little difference between the two groups at 24 hours (Figure 3). Therefore"

Their parts reduced our time spent on plasmid construction and improved our efficiency in signal transformation (from the target DNA concentration to luminescence). Besides, they gave us suggestions in the improvements of our split T7 report system and the design of our kit. Also, their team is very interested in our split T7 system, certifies the potential of it, and connects this system to their frontier studies. In general, we had an exchange in material and a pleasant communication with team NUDT-China.

Since our team members come from all parts of China, it is difficult for our team to make progression for our experiments in schooldays due to the distance. Team SDU-China shares the laboratory with one team member living in the same city and facilitates the experimental progress. By sharing the laboratory with SDU-China, our team transforms the plasmid sHRPN-dcas9 and sHRPC-dcas9 into competent cell DH5α, cultures the bacteria, and harvests the plasmid of larger amount. Also, we exchanged our ideas about some potential improvements in each other’s project and design."

LB media preperation (starter pack)
Introduction
Note: This protocol makes 500mL of broth or ~25 plates.
In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. LB, also known as Lysogeny broth, is a nutrient rich broth that is a standard for culturing Escherichia coli, as it allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore, the proper preparation of LB will be crucial to maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to LB broth creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri dishes.

Short Summary
Intense mining in Germany causes mine drainage with high potential to contaminate fresh water. We cooperated with leading experts including environmental coordinators, Germany’s biggest mining company (RAG), water quality specialists, and environmental chemists. While exploring solutions, we identified mine drainage as a rich source of valuable metals. Due to dwindling resources and increasing demand we engineered bacteria for ecofriendly recycling of these metals and scavenging into nanoparticles. A NASA associate pointed us towards ferritin, a metal binding protein. Collaborating with the RAG during our project, we discussed the impact of iron and copper on fresh water quality as well as requirements for a device capable of filtering mine drainage. In close contact with an expert on copper biochemistry, we developed a functional system for copper uptake – unprecedented in the iGEM community. Through continuous discussions with various stakeholders, we identified printing acquired metals as a promising application.
Ruhrkohle AG (RAG)
Searching for a possible source of metal ions we contacted the Ruhrkohle AG (RAG) which is Germany's biggest coal mining corporation. The RAG is responsible for many coal mines stretch over great areas underneath the state of Saarland and North Rhine Westphalia where our University is located.  One of the major tasks of the RAG is to pump up mine drainage which is caused by ground water seeping through different layers of rock and flooding the coal mines. This water is getting contaminated with heavy metals and threatens to pollute water supplies if it is not pumped out before rising into the groundwater bearing layers. The water has a temperature of approximately"

Public Engagement
In order to make the public familiarize with genetic engineer and synthetic biology, we organized many innovative activities, helping people other than scientists learn biotechnology. To make the public feel a sense of belonging, we organized a street science exhibition of DNA extraction from fruit. Our audience were able to extract the molecule under our instructions; to popularize the idea of genetically modified food and synthetic biology, we shot a video and published a magazine article that were popularized through our collaboration with school media as well as the internet; and to capture the resulted interest from students in our school towards synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a student organization, giving them lectures and basic experiments, enriching their biotechnology knowledge. With the diversity of activities that we conducted, many people without any inclination science were engaged in biotechnology and synthetic biology, making synthetic biology approachable.
Poll: people’s attitude on Genetically Modified (GM) food
We posted a questionnaire on social media to investigate people’s attitudes toward GM food and how they get the information about GM products.
Fig. 1 People’s attitude towards GM food
Fig. 2 Source Reliability
The results indicate only 8.2% of people acquire their knowledge of GMO from very credible sources, suggesting to us that it is necessary to further promote the concept of synthetic biology and GM products.
Yili, Diary Enterprise
We visited Yili dairy enterprise, one of the biggest diary companies in China, to learn about the openness of the government’s attitude towards GM food, especially GM probiotics. The Yili representative, however, suggests the government currently has an unfriendly policy towards GM probiotics. This response demonstrates the importance of further promoting GM probiotics.
Media
School Student Television Station
In order to introduce iGEM and GM food to more students in our school, we collaborated with Student Television Station (STS), the most influential and dependable news media of our high school. We incorporated interviews on the subject of GM food with teachers and students, the general public’s attitude toward GM food, a brief introduction of iGEM and our team by Zhongxiu Hu, and a short segment about biology experiments in the video.

1st Idea – Trapping Metals by Mathew R and Craig
Does Bacillus subtilis have a lot of space in periplasm?
Why 90% and 10%?
We don’t need to make a Biobrick for sporulation. B.subtilis already have sporulation mutants, therefore those mutants could be used for population growth.
How do we get the metal into the spore?
Where is the opportunity for modelling?
2nd Idea – Skin Repairer by Hanny and Jessica
Why do you need a GFP reporter? (Answer – to make itself known)
Does the production of these compounds (hyaluron synthase) require a cascade of enzymes?
Is there any data collected/research done on collagen and HS levels in Bacillus subtilis?
Do you know the threshold level of collagen for wound healing?
Are there any antibiotics involved here? What about Quorum Sensing Molecules?
Why don’t you just put a plaster in hyaluronic acid and stick it on the patient? (I.e. what advantages does this idea have?)

Additionally, by comparing the light intensity of different types of GFP, part B would be proved to be sensitive to embody its working status, which is helpful for our system to handle the upstream information, also convenient when manipulators want to analyze the situation of system.
The second part was designed to measure the growth and green fluorescence of cells under time span, in order to coordinate with data and curve from other parts in our experiment, the graph we drew based on collected data would help us find out the characteristic and change of expression of STAR during a long period. Then FL/ABS is calculated likewise to give a clear expression of how the expression of a single bacterium varies from 0 to 15h.
Result
By analyzing these graphs below, the result shows that the GFP used in part B is an enhanced GFP whose intensity is nearly 10 times as the control group, which proves to be greatly sensitive. Meanwhile, this experiment proved part B works and creates a brighter image when observing under fluorescence microscope.

Idonnya Aghoghogbe
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I obtained my Bsc in Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am deeply interested in biomedical studies and medicine. During the AIV’s first year master programme, I was afforded the opportunity to study synthetic, computational and systems biology. This allowed me to discover that new approaches in medicine can be taken using the principles of synthetic and systems biology. Such approaches are evident in our iGEM project, which I am very excited to be a part of.  Using synthetic biology, we are trying to address an age old medical problem in an innovative yet plausible way.
Iva Atanasković
1st year in Molecular biology and physiology, University of Belgrade - Faculty of Biology
I'm doing a Bachelor in biology in Serbia, and I came to Paris to do my summer internship in iGEM. In Serbia I work as an advisor in Petnica Science Center. There we are going to form a new iGEM team next year, so all the experiences from this internship will be very helpful. In Petnica I did several projects in microbiology, mostly regarding bioremediation technologies. I didn't have much chance to do any molecular or cellular biology, so I'm highly interested in learning new methods in this field. I also enjoy doing street art and martial arts.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#project description_-_-_TEXT.html," induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms, it may form an embolism, which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic[14]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death[4].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection.
Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [12, 13, 17].
What is currently needed is a simple detection method which could be used on site without specialised equipment. To fulfil this need we aim to develop a detection method that can be applied to pastures in order to prevent infection to begin with!
Preventing an Infection
After infestation, the window of opportunity for treatment is comparatively small, as the large strongyle spends most of its life cycle in the blood stream, where the treatment is ineffective. It is therefore important for the farmer to know what levels of infestation are present in the pastures and whether these are safe for their animals to graze on. We aim to develop a tool which allows quantitative measurement of such infestation of pastures, which would decrease the occurrence of infection.
Creating the Worm Buster
A step by step guide
How will we achieve this?
The first thing is to define the desired characteristics of each worm buster. To face the problem the team need to develop bacteria with two different functions. The two different bacteria we will be described below
The Small Worm Buster
One method is to engineer a bacteria that lives in the intestinal tracts of horses and report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces. The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment                                  depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
The Large Worm Buster
Another method is to engineer a bacteria that can be applied to pasture samples and report the amount of large strongyles in pastures. By detecting large strongyles in pasture the large strongyle “buster” can help horse owners prevent their"

3)  Sequence View I
Now that  we've got it everything looking spiffy, let's try out one of the main view of  the tool - the Sequence View.  On the  main toolbar select ""Sequence View"" from the View drop down menu.  This should bring up the Sequence View  window.  From here you have many options  - you can load a sequence from a GenBank or FASTA file, drag in a sequence from  another connection, copy and paste your chosen sequence, or enter it  manually.  Let's try opening a GenBank  file ( like this one , for  example).  Go to File, and select 'Load  Sequence File' - this should bring up a window allowing you to choose what file  you want to open.  Go to the directory  you saved the file to, select it, and click open (if the directory has many  files in it, you can go to the 'Files of Type' drop down menu and filter it to  only show GenBank or FASTA files).  This  will load the sequence into the current Sequence View window.  From here, you can edit the sequence or  perform a number of operations on it.   But first, let's try adding some informative highlights to this plain  text sequence.  Go to the Highlighting menu,  and select ""Open Feature Library Connection"".

BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and last, steady for test. We solve this problem by adding an ROS sensor, which has a suitable                         sensing threshold so that it can maintain the balancing between the high level of ROS in living                         cell and survival rate of cells.
Output
Last but not least, the part of characterizing residual amount of intracellular ROS.
Different from chemical detecting methods, our signal output substance must be:
● simpler for users to detect.
● harmless to cells.
● accurate and sensitive enough to reflect the intracellular ROS content.
● Reversible so we can get real-time data.
To meet those needs, chemical redox probe has been out of our consideration, even though they                         have characteristic of extreme-high sensitivity, still they are irreversibility and unstable.                         We prefer a kind of characterization which can exist in living cell also in a consist level for                         stable measurement.

NJAU_China,2015,Team:NJAU China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," achieve biological computer. We will have to pay the great efforts in the biological interface circuit components, biological self-organization and bio logical operations, even if it is just a simple imitation of von Neumann type computer. Therefore, we discuss to make another “virtual interview”. We were divided into several groups, accessing to relevant information about the biological logic element, cell differentiation and cell signaling information group. And communicate with the pioneer scientists in these areas via email, try to understand the progress in these fields and the potential contribution which can be made by the development in order to realize the computer.
Compared with Normal Computers……
E
xploring into microorganism’s amazing features, we find two potential improvement that our device may achieve in comparison to traditional computers.
1. Environmental Limitation
Nowadays, electronic components are supposed to work under certain environment. However, biologists have already found that microbial life has an amazing flexibility for surviving in extreme environments — niches that are extraordinarily hot, or acidic and et cetera. Thanks to synthetic biology, we now have the ability to gather wonder features into one cell which indicates that microorganisms are very promising to be strong enough to adapt to extreme conditions.
2. Voltage Limitation
In a traditional computer, 1 & 0 is recognized according to high/ low voltage. But as our hardware reads and transforms fluorescence intensity to digital signals, we are able to divide signals to more subtle degrees such as 0-8. This may be an advantage.    (Prepared by SUN Libo and ZHANG Xun)
Wire of Arithmetic Logical Unit……
T
he ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) of electronic computer is based on logical gates and modern electronic computer utilizes electrical elements to make logical gates      come true. On the other hand, the capability of computer is determined by the type of electrical elements. From radio tube to transistor, from discrete component to integrated circuit even      microprocessor, every progress of electrical element will make huge developments in computer area. Modern silicon based computer uses binary system and actualizes logical operation through      Boolean logic system. The logical gate is the algorithm to realize those operations. Meantime, these logical operation can also be achieved by biological molecules. At the molecular level, proteins will make self-modification when receive different chemical signals and self-modification can be regarded as output signals sometimes. In fact, the human body itself is a powerful super computer and make logical operations all the time. Thus, biological molecules are potential to be the great substitute for electrical elements in creating powerful bio-computer. Nowadays, people have attempted to use many biomaterial"

Problem             Statement
Our team""s             goal is to develop an organism that is capable of degrading a toxic compound, which is primarily highly abundant in Martian soil. Up to one percent of the             Martian soil contains perchlorate , a toxic compound that inhibits             Thyroid activity in humans. Crops to be grown on Martian soil will accumulate             perchlorate, rendering sustainable colonization of Mars impossible. NASA is             aware of this issue. They have hosted a conference about the presence of             perchlorate, and have begged scientists to find a solution for it.
In 2025,             humans will land on Mars for the first time. Considering the toxicity of Mars"" soil,             these humans will need to be supplied externally. One option is to periodically             send spacecrafts carrying food to Mars. Such a journey             takes a spacecraft 150-300 days 1 and costs             $500M. 2 These             travelling times and costs might decrease in the future, due to scientific             improvements, as well as the competition between privately-held space-travel             companies. Even so, for a sustainable habitation on Mars, certain supplies             would have to be produced on Mars. Water can be recycled, but food cannot. As             such, substances that can produce reasonable amounts of food, and are             unchallenging to transport have to be used. The most logical solution is the             cultivation of plants. A seed is easy to carry in a spacecraft, and the soil it             can grow in is already on Mars. Scientist from Wageningen University have             already demonstrated that Martian soil contains enough nutrients for plants to             grow. They used Martian soil simulant -that does not contain perchlorate- for             their experiments. The conclusion is that Mars-grown vegetables are edible, if             one removes the perchlorate they contain. This gives us our target product: a             (biological) device that is able to break down not just filter- perchlorate on             Mars.
Product Design
Through             arduous study of biochemistry, we have managed to develop our final,             preliminary designs for our product. On our page ""Bioreactor"", we give a very             thorough description of the exact working and composition of the bioreactor.             For now, it is important to note, that we enhance the performance of our             bacteria, by placing             them in a bioreactor.
Figure 1: The designs for our bioreactor"
Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#Biological Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," evidenced by in the increased growth of the second wild type flask in the Optical Density data. - The response curve for the coefficient of saturation for the mutant due to changes in light intensity was modeled  as an inverse exponential form.  In other words, the system reacts to increasing light intensity by exponentially  tapering the coefficient of saturation.
Wild Type vs. Mutant Photobioreactor Simulation
The sequence of figures above shows the behavior of the static wild type saturation curve and the mutant variable saturation curve in response to incident light intensity.  The dotted lines indicate the point of incident intensity and the associated absorbance with that point.  The center stacked bar graph shows the accumulation of optical density given by the absorbance readings from the saturation curve.  Recall that the mutant curve includes only LH2 adaptation, while the curve on the left is the total of LH1 and LH2 contributions to absorbance.  Throughout the entire five layers of the bioreactor, it is evident from the simulation that the mutant achieved higher overall growth as indicated by OD.  Also, the mean OD for the mutant exceeds that of wild type, and there is less variation in the levels about the mean (indicated by standard deviation).
