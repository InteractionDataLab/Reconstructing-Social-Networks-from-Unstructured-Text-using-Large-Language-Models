those minipreps labeled with white stickers are stored in the -20 degree freezer in a box with date 14-09-2010
A back-up preparation of the transformants has also been made. 2x2mL of cells have been centrifuged and the cell residue is kept in the -20 degree freezer (white stickers: date, biobrick/plasmid #, 'cells') This will make it easier to prepare a new mini-prep since we don't have to grow overnight cultures first.
a gel of minipreps has been run and I took a picture. Seems like the mini-preps went well since a band is visible in all of the wells.
Glycerol stocks of transformant cells have been done and stored in the -80 degree freezer
OBS they reorganized the freezer > look into lab book ""freezer box location""
Malthe has resuspended our primers, which arrived today :-)
One primer is still missing, Malthe wrote an email to ask for primer IGT02

There are different ways to get more supplies:
Look for a big 2 L box in the fume hood in our lab next to the sterile bank. It´s refilled by Bjarne.
Go downstairs to room 162 on the 2th floor with a min. 1L bottle. The room is on the right side, go to opposite room, get keys and book from cupboard right to the door. Write in the book, how much you have taken.
Organisation:
to repressor group:
I finished the A3sized paper Maya started yesterday, so Maya maybe you can have a second look at it, feel free to add or change, of course :-)
Plasmids:
to repressor group
With regard to our plasmid pSB4A5, pSB2K3 and others:
I suggest that we make our own linearized plasmid, so we don´t have to worry whether the insert is cut out or not. This is done by using primers IG206 and IG207. These primers have been ordered by Thomas, so there is no time delay, when using this approach.
For further information see parts registry help > protocols > linearized backbones.
Please think about how we can purify our biobrick I_13507 from gel, to get rid of the plasmid, we don´t need. - we just do an ordinary BB transformation

Grow up DH5α
Review S. aureus Cas9 sequence
Results:
All cells save 2 lines from the previous day did not grow. The most likely reason for the transformation failure is a typo on the iGEM website. The procedure said to resuspend the DNA in 100 uL of water, but the instructions most likely meant 10 uL. We believe the excess DNA over-stressed the competent cells.

Frost: No technique used because it is too expensive and requires a large amount of water.However, they have a reserve system. They produce every year a surplus which is used for the next year in case of insufficient harvest because of drastic climate changes.
Drought: There are no  used techniques. Irrigation is forbidden in champagne vineyards because of AOC / AOP appellations.
Impact on the wine quality
The high temperatures will create a situation of water stress and the leaves will not support (burn). There will be a smaller amount of juice and the quality of the wine will decreases considerably.
Support the use of GMOs to mitigate  the impact of climate changes
Yes but before our solution must demonstrate any impact on the health and the environment.
Opinion and advices about our project
Nowaday, there is a communication problem regarding GMOs. Winegrowers are suspicious of technologies because they are afraid that scientists are hiding their data concerning the negative impacts of GMOs in health or for the environment. Our project is suitable for its expectations however it must be accepted by the specifications of champagnes.
Domaine Les Luquettes - Ludovic Lafoucarde - La cadiere d’azur - France
Temperature changes
In Provence, the weather was warmer early in the year. This resulted in a weak flowering and therefore a poor harvest this year. Harvests were made earlier this year ( end of july/ august).
Some data
2017: 10% of vines lost due to spring frosts in his vineyard
2017: 60% vines lost due to spring frosts in average in the region of Provence
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Drought:
There are no  used techniques. Irrigation is forbidden in this region because water is a rare resource.
Frost:
No problems encountered.
Opinion and advices about our project
Mr Lafoucade found our project interesting but he gave us some advices concerning the possibility of changing the microbiota by added a new microorganism. If our solution will change the microbiota of the plants then it will not be interesting for the wine producer because it will change the specificity of the wine.

It is hard to see, but the UBP_target fragment is a little bit longer         than the restriction fragment of mutC.The UBP_target annealings are not unexpected digested, indicating that the UBP prevents sequence recognition of the tested restriction enzymes. This proofs that the M.A.X restriction system is a          good detection system for UBP retention and mutation event analysis in selected DNA sequences.
PCR with UBPs
Based on Sismour et al. (2005) and Johnson et al. (2004), we designed a novel protocol for PCR with the unnatural base pair isoG and isoCm. We first started to reproduce positive results with Titanium Taq (TiTaq) polymerase . While Johnson et al. presented an efficiency of 96 % ± 3 %, Sismour et al. showed a reduced fidelity using the Klenow fragment of TiTaq polymerase. Without thymidine analogues, the fidelity per round PCR decreases rapidly to less than 60 % after 20 rounds of PCR.
For endpoint determination, we performed PCR reactions with 30 rounds to find out if there is any polymerase activity with template DNA containing the unnatural bases isoG and isoCm.
The PCR templates were prepared by ligating each of the annealed 80 bp M.A.X targets mutA, mutT, mutG and mutC into pSB1C3_RuBisCo (BBa_K1465202) . For this purpose, the plasmid backbone was linearized by digestion with BmtI and XbaI. For complementary sticky ends, the annealed oligos were digested with BmtI and SpeI. After ligation, subsequent digestion with XbaI, lambda exonuclease and exonuclease I  was performed to reduce the amount of unintended DNA template.

Each construct contains a different M.A.X target insert (mutA, muT, mutG, mutC) or UBP_target and is 351 bp long.
To increase the possibility of the insertion of the unnatural bases, we used 100 µM dNTPs and 200 µM iso"

Arc PNCs as a Transfection Agent
mRNA delivery is a promising avenue for the application of novel gene therapies. The expression of therapeutic proteins from exogenous DNA requires transport of these constructs to the nucleus for transcription, complicating the route to expression. Additionally, current methods of DNA delivery, such as lentiviral vectors, come with the risk of random genome integration which can induce dangerous mutations in transduced cells.
Delivering therapeutic proteins encoded in mRNA is not without drawbacks. Cell cultures treated with untreated mRNA exhibit an inflammatory response when compared to cells treated with encapsulated mRNA (Uchida et al., 2013). We think V.I.N.C.En.T. could help with this!
In order to show the capacity for delivery of mRNA of one of our most interesting PNCs, we attempted to deliver an mRNA encoding a green fluorescent protein called Clover to cultures of HT22 neuronal cells using our minimal Arc Gag particles. This protein was designed by selecting the region of the Arc coding sequence with the highest homology to the HIV-1 Gag protein. It has been theorized that the stem loops in the RNA sequence encoding the N-lobe of the HIV-1 Gag protein play a role in regulating the uptake of RNA into the Gag complex, so we also investigated the effect of adding this sequence to the 3’ untranslated region of the Clover mRNA.
Experimental Protocol
Overexpressed the ArcMin protein in E. coli
Purified minimal Arc Gag, suspended in PBS (147µg/ml or 147 ng/µl)
Added Arc Gag N-lobe homology sequence to 3’ UTR of mRNA encoding Clover fluorescent protein
Produced mRNAs encoding Clover with and without the 3’UTR via in-vitro transcription (100 ng/µl in water)
Mix 50 µl ArcMin solution (7350 ng) with 10 µl RNA (1000 ng)
2 groups of encapsulation approaches: Mixed protein and RNA, heated to 55℃ for 10 mins, Vortexed Arc protein, added RNA and mixed by flicking tube

Northwestern,2013,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we will prepare for the longer ligation today. In addition, we minipreped pSB4A5 and got  surprisingly high concentration of DNA. Other lab work includes making plates and transforming new cells.
Day 34, August 1
The team finished the ligation protocol and transformed our cells with the products. We will see the results tomorrow. In addition, we started a digestion and ligation cycle of the same parts (ASR-RBS, LPP-RBS, GadA-RBS) today. These are duplicates of the ligation we performed today. We will complete the protocol tomorrow. Lastly, we PCRed all of the primers we have (including new primers that just came in today).
Day 34, August 2
The cells grew! This means the ligation worked since our negative control worked relatively well. We also minipreped these cells to prepare for sequencing. The duplicate ligation prtocol is also completed along with the transformation. The PCR products are also PCR purified.

We completed digestions, ligations, and 12-hr transformations from the weekend. Counted cells for the Lpp-RBS ligations and compared them with the negative control’s. Performed inoculations on 3 colonies from the plate with best ratios, which were 6:1 asr-RBS, 6:1 gadA-RBS, and 1:1 Lpp-RBS.
Day 36, August 5
We miniprepped the inoculations from 8/4. Jessica discussed with us tips to increasing miniprep yields and concentration requirements for sequencing. Samson and Simon completed digestion and gel purification of PCR products from 8/1. Kevin made different acids and buffers for fluorescence assays. Simon made media to make AMP plates.

Bacterial killers from a genetic construction kit
English back
Under supervision of Prof. Dr. Roland Eils, a team of undergraduate students develops a biological machine that can detect and kill pathogens or even cancer cells – 84 teams from all over the world participate in the Synthetic Biology iGEM competition.
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines Competition) is a competition organized by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA, since 2005 and has become one of the largest international competitions in the field of science. This year 84 teams of undergraduate students compete against each other, and for the first time three teams from Germany join the competition. The project of the Heidelberg team is directed by Prof. Dr. Roland Eils from University of Heidelberg and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).
Synthetic Biology is a young field in science, which combines classic gene technology with an engineering approach. Similar to the construction of an airplane, Synthetic Biology uses simple gene building blocks for the construction of new complex systems with distinct functions. These gene building blocks are collected in a database by iGEM and can be used by all participants of the competition. So far, the collection contains more than 1000 gene building blocks, due to the continuous development of new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed projects which"

The pie-chart below showed that more than 85% of the student attendees agreed that our introduction enhance their understanding of synthetic biology; and the results of doctors are even higher (92%). Compared with the results of question1-3, it was obvious that one of the goal of human practice, outreach of synthetic biology, was successfully achieved.
5.After our introduction, you were interest in the application of synthetic biology to medical research, and were willing to participate in.
The results showed that compared to question 4, less percentage of doctor and student attendees agreed that our introduction improved their interest in applying synthetic biology on medical research. And this phenomenon was much more apparent among student than doctors. One reason was the low experience and participation rate for medical students doing lab.
6.You would like to use or know more about synthetic biology-related medical products in the future.
The pie-chart below showed that most of the doctor and student attendees had positive attitude toward synthetic biology-related medical products. But surprisingly, students were less interested in this issue. This might due to the safety issues about medical application. And it would definitely be a main concern for the public as well. It became clear that we should focus more on the negative aspect of synthetic biology in regards to its implication and progression, and what the practice synthetic biology required, in order to convince the public that synthetic biology was safe.
7.You think it is worth paying attention to health, environmental issues and research regarding synthetic biology.
The results showed that all the doctor attendees would like to know further information in regards to synthetic biology, while there was nearly 90% students had the same point of view.
8.We are now working on setting an information platform of synthetic biology research. Would you like to take a look?
About a quarter of the attendees had neutral attitude toward following our works. Again, doctors were sightly more interested in our project. We thought that low lab experience might play an important role in this phenomenon.

We substitue this in the above equations, to obtain two nonlinear equations for mRNA production.        \begin{align}        \frac{dm_a}{dt} &= \frac{n_a b_a (1+\alpha c_a a^2)}{(1 + c_a a^2)(1+ 2c_r r^4 + {c_r}^2 r^8)} - \gamma_{m_a} m_a \\        \frac{dm_r}{dt} &= \frac{n_r b_r(1+\alpha c_a a^2)}{(1 + c_a a^2)(1+2c_rr^4 + c_r^2 r^8)} - \gamma_{m_r} m_r \\        \end{align}        However, these equations are not sufficient to model the entire system of the oscillator. As remarked by Stricker et al. (2008) in their paper, delay in intermediate steps is an important factor in getting sustained oscillations. One important assumption in our model till now has been that the dimerisation and tetramerisation reactions attain equilibrium instanteneously. We relax this assumption by adding a delay term. We assume that the dimerisation of AraC takes time $\tau_a = 2 min$ and tetramerisation of LacI takes time $\tau_r = 3 min$. The justification for differential delay is that tetramerisation of LacI takes more time than dimerisation of AraC. Hence, mRNA production at time t depends on time $t"

They turned out to be quite interested in our project and our    detection scheme of proteins, so that in October one of their representatives    came to EPFL to meet with one of our team members and discuss our diagnostics    tool in more detail. After two hours of discussion, Medisupport told us they    would want to put us in contact with one of their geneticists. Hence, the    subsequent week, we had a second meeting and they gave us more details about    the outlook’s project and how to improve our project.
Meeting with a scientist from Medisupport
The found the general idea quite ambitious and new, which was one of our goal.    However, as they perfectly know the diagnostic world, they told us that it is    really difficult to implement a new tool because of the trust that we must have    in the results given by the diagnostic tool. Hence, it requires a huge series of    tests that we couldn’t achieve considering the time and ressources that we had.    Thus, one anther field to reach was the food industry as the tests are less advanced.    Concerning the diagnostic field, Aptasense could have a future in liquid biospy for    detecting tumoral DNA in blood or detecting bacterial markers/activity as the methods    used nowadays are quite expensive. To conclude, it was a great opportunity to meet    them and to have the possibility to implement their advices.

She is our Tinkerbell: have a problem, ask for help and as soon as she gets involved, magic happens! Seemingly reserved at first, Barbora was always very invested in our progress. She makes sure you’re doing things correctly and that you understand what you’re doing, which is no small feat with this team.

As shown in Figures 9A and 9B, pure glyphosate and Roundup® Alphee killed the B. subtilis wild type strain and the strain lacking the low-affinity glutamate transporter GltP already at a concentration of 2 mM. By contrast, all strains lacking the high-affinity transporter GltT grew in the presence of 2 - 6 mM glyphosate that is present in Roundup. Thus, the unknown surfactant that is present in the commercially available Roundup® solution does not seem to affect growth of B. subtilis. Moreover, it is worth to mention that the glyphosate present in the Roundup® solution is rather cheap: 7.2 g of glyphosate would make more than 3 k€ @ Merck !

We also performed a complementation experiment to provide further evidence that GltT is the major glyphosate transporter in B. subtilis. For this purpose, we fused the artificial Palf4 promoter (12) together with the gapA ribosome-binding site to the gltT gene and integrated the construct into the amyE locus of the gltT mutant (Figure 10A). Next, we propagated the strains BP233 (gltT) and BP237 (gltT Palf4-gltT) together with the wild type strain 168 on agar plates without and with glyphosate (Figure 10B). As expected, all strains grew in the absence of glyphosate. By contrast, only the gltT mutant strain BP233 grew with glyphosate. Thus, like"

NWU-China,2018,Team:NWU-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucleic acid: TRNA refers to a small class of RNA carrying and transporting amino acids. Most tRNAs consist of short clover-shaped strands of more than 70 to 90 nucleotides folded into ribosomes. The main function of tRNA is to carry amino acids into ribosomes and synthesize proteins under the guidance of mRNA. In other words, they translate the sequence of coding nucleotides into the sequence of amino acids in proteins using mRNA as a template. TRNA and mRNA are interacted by anticodon and codons. In the process of peptide chain formation, the first tRNA that enters the ribosome to bind to the mRNA initiation codon is called the initiation tRNA and the remaining tRNA that is involved in the peptide chain extension is called the extension tRNA. According to the sequence of codons on the mRNA, the tRNA carrying specific amino acids enters the ribosome in turn. After forming the peptide chain, tRNA is released from ribosomes. The whole process is called the tRNA cycle. A tRNA can carry one amino acid, such as alanine tRNA, but an amino acid can be carried by more than one tRNA.
aaRS
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: Amino acid activator is an enzyme for the synthesis of aminoacyl tRNA. 20 natural amino acids have their specific specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. It is generally believed to participate in the two-step reaction shown below, activating amino acids in the presence of ATP and binding to the - CCA - OH terminal of tRNA. Then, with the help of various translation factors and combinations, it enters the active sites between ribosome size subunits, forms peptide bonds with the last amino acid, and encodes them into proteins. This enzyme can identify the side chains and tRNA of amino acids. Because enzymes have such a highly specific substrate, the genetic information of the mRNA can be accurately reflected in the amino acid sequence of the protein.
Alr
Alanine racemase: Racemase is a kind of isomerase. It can catalyze the transformation between optical isomers containing an asymmetric carbon atom compound. Because the amino acid is alanine, it is called alanine racemase. In our project, it was used to introduce D-alanine into bacteria. Bacteria can't form D-alanine in the body in normal circumstances, but it can convert L-alanine to D-alanine for the purpose.

sgRNA woth switchable crRNA sequence and RFP reporter       Bba_K2654002 in pSB1C3
This biobrick was created to ease the creation of new sgRNA of your design. The invariant tracRNA is already in there, all you have to do is cut with the restriction enzyme BaeI and incorporate the nucleotide (crRNA) of your           design. The clones whit your new sgRNA will appear white and the others red (because of the RFP).
Strong promoter J23119 Bba_R0010 : This promoter is the strongest from a big combinatorial family : (J23100:J23119).
Strong RBS B0034 : Strongest RBS from the family B0030:B0034
Modified mRFP E1010 : Engineered mutant of the red fluorescent protein of Discosoma striata. We performed two silent mutations to avoid two forbidden restriction sites in the RFP               gene: the codon 197-199 TAC was mutated in a TAT, and the codon 527-529 GAA was mutated into a GAG. After those mutations we verified that the RFP was still expressed and that there was no effect on fluorescence.
TracRNA: We based the sequence of these gene on a review (Jiang et al., 2015), this sequence is considered mostly invariable.

Where does this biobrick come from and how to use it:
The idea was to make a Biobrick where the variable region of the sgRNA could easily be modified by an assembly with two oligonucleotides. The next step would be to assemble multiple modified biobricks to obtain an multiplex of sgRNA’s in           a cloning vector. Finally, this cassette can"

The sequence in the hairpin added after the start codon was also screened for the presence of stop codons, as they would prematurely terminate translation of the gene of interest when the riboregulator was activated. We employed a 12 nt Toehold domain at the 50 end of the hairpin to initiate its interaction with the cognate trigger strand. The trigger RNA contains a 30 nt single-stranded RNA sequence that is complementary to the toehold and stem of the switch RNA.

Autofluorescence level measured from induced cells not bearing a GFP-expressing plasmid.(D) GFP mode fluorescence levels measured for switches in their ON and OFF states in comparison to positive control constructs and autofluorescence.

In order to perform this experiment, we designed a series of BioBricks (see Parts ) where our promoters coupled to GFP. As the Pr promoter is constitutive, its GFP BioBrick was pretty simple. However, as Pu requires the XylR/Toluene complex to be activated, we modified our biosensor so it produces GFP instead of luciferase. The cells were then induced with toluene prior manipulation, in order to trigger GFP expression.
To determine the RPU of a promoter, the GFP expression has to be calculate cells per cells. Therefore, we  collaborate with Paris Bettencourt iGEM team that kindly give us access to a flow cytometer. Experiments were realized according to the Cello protocol described in article ""Genetic circuit design automation"" published in Science in 2016.[1] The test device 1 from this year interlab study was used as the reference as this device contains the reference promoter BBa_J23101, a RBS (BBa_B0034), the GFP (BBa_E0040) and the terminator BBa_B0015.
We used the following parameters to set up the flow cytometer : FSC voltage of 437 V, SSC voltage of 289 V, and a green laser (488 nm) voltage of 425 V. An SSC and FSC threshold of >200 was used to limit collection to cell-sized particles. We analyzed 50,000 events for each sample. GFP intensity and OD600 values were determine four times.
The fluorescence of several bacterial culture was determine :
DH5a transformed with the test device 1
DH5a transformed with Pr-GFP
DH5a transformed with XylR coding device-Pu-GFP in presence of toluene 1 mg/L
DH5a transformed with XylR coding device-Pu-GFP in presence of toluene 10 mg/L
Several negative controls were realized :
DH5a transformed a plasmid made of GFP-Term
DH5a with BBa_K2023015 without toluene addition
At a OD600= 0.2, the several cells culture were pelleted and resuspended into PBS. Samples were then transfered to flow cytometer tubes and the fluorescence of each cells was assessed.
We obtain the following results:

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Interlab
This year, the iGEM Team TecMonterrey_GDL decided to contribute to the Interlab study measurements. The main goal of the study was to achieve a way to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements through the normalization of absolute cell count or colony forming units.
The approaches taken were indicated by the iGEM measurement team:
1. Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of microsphere silica beads
2. Counting colony-forming units (CFU) from the samples
The team followed a series of protocols created to help standardize the measurement of GFP (green fluorescent protein), which is widely used as a  measurement marker.
Specifications
The equipment we used was Cytation 3 by Biotek. It can measure both absorbance and fluorescence. About the conditions, pathlength correction was disabled and the measurements were conducted at room temperature.
Calibration Protocol 1:
-OD600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
The first protocol’s goal was to obtain a conversion factor between the measured absorbance and the OD600 measurement as it occurs in spectrophotometry measurements. This was made with the provided kit LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) provided by iGEM and sterile milli Q water. The reactants were added accordingly to the protocol and the obtained results are shown in the next table (Table 1):
Table 1. Calibration Protocol 1: OD(600) Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
The corrected absorbance was calculated by subtracting the milli Q water reading. The reference OD600 was provided to the team by iGEM. The correction factor was obtained by dividing the reference OD600 by the corrected Abs600 .
Calibration Protocol 2:
-Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
Silica microspheres were provided inthe iGEM kit,  which were meant to simulate cells in a dilution, and thus the protocol stated to make serial dilutions of the microsphere suspension"

Unfortunately TTHL couldn´t be indentified correctly via MALDI yet so that we will have to wait with further characterizing until we get the go through the MALDI results.
And another big suprise was the activity test of BPUL . After Team cultivation fermented it in a 6 L fermentation and purified our lovely enzyme, we did the standardized activity measurement protocol overnight. And have a look at our great results in fig. 6! We clearly have a good activity of BPUL reaching its saturation after half an hour. A fast reaction like this is comparable to the store bought laccase TVEL0. We are happy and will rebuffer as much as we can from fraction 4 which seems to have most of the Protein. Also we are going to determine the protein concentration. This is going to be awesome!
Fig. 2: Activity measurements of BPUL via OD420. Different fractions from Team Cultivations purification were analyzed and they all showed activity.
Team Substrate Anayltics:
We analyze Ethin estradiol and estradiol degradation with the Spectrofluorophotometer. The measure showed that the degradation product are detectable but the results weren't clear. We decide to do this measurement again to have better results so a new degradation of the two substrates were set.
Team Immobilization
Got on with immobilization of ECOL, BPUL and TVEL0. Incubation time of laccase solution: 18 hours. Measurement of protein concentration in supernatant with Roti-Nanoquant .

One of them was added with extraction buffer but not underwent the extraction protocol, and the other was added with extraction buffer but underwent the extraction process. The result (Fig. 6) showed only the sample which underwent the extraction process was able to be detected, which represented our sensor had strong specificity to curcumin. Moreover, our curcumin bio-sensor would not be disturbed even if taking the whole turmeric content to detect.
Figure 6: Detection of real samples from turmeric root.
3. Create a New Method to Detect Curcumin in Time
     In order to feedback our productivity model in time and make it more accurately, we want to find a way to detect curcumin instantly. We supposed that turmeric can also detect curcumin as well as the rhizome and other parts of turmeric.
     According to Plant Science, photosynthesis aids in the production of curcumin[3], so we selected the leaves as the test samples and detected it by DPV. Our sample divided into five groups: negative control, normal leaves, and turmeric leaves in three different areas. After estimating the turmeric concentration by using the standard curve formula obtained before, we got the result in the figure below (Fig. 7).
     From this result, obviously, we can see the negative control--normal leaves contain no curcumin. On the other hand, tumeric grown in area 1, 2 and 3 shows curcumin content. It means that we can use turmeric leaves to detect curcumin instead of using curcumin rhizome, and each sample of the curcumin concentration is different. Thus, we can reasonably speculate that the curcumin concentration of the turmeric rhizome is relative with the curcumin concentration of turmeric leaves. Next, we must start a large number of experiments with curcumin in the same turmeric leaves and rhizome to create a new model to improve the feedback system of the entire productivity model. This is what we want to achieve in the future.
Figure 7: Detection of curcumin content in turmeric leaf samples from different areas.
Conclusion
     In our conclusion, we use the electrochemistry method, DPV, to prove that we can detect curcumin if we use the gold chips to connect with αS1-casein as biosensor. We also created a standard curve and generated an accurate formula to support the prediction of curcumin concentration in real samples. Moreover, we certify the specificity is perfect in real samples. Finally, we successfully"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," ferritin (Butts et al., 2008). This restriction is desirable for various applications (Castro et al., 2014).
The wildtype ferritin has reactive amino acids on the outside and inside of the protein shell, causing nanoparticle synthesis at both surfaces. An optimization of the wildtype human ferritin towards a nanoparticle syntheses mainly in the interior can therefore favor a unified production of different nanoparticles (Butts et al., 2008).
Improved Human Ferritin: BBa_K2638999
To improve the ferritins capability to direct metal ions to its inside and to increase its ability to form gold and silver nanoparticles, we constructed a mutated version of the human ferritin heavy chain (HUHF) ( BBa_K2638999 ). Following Christopher A. Butts et al. (2008) we removed reactive cysteine and histidine residues from exterior of the HUHF and added additional cysteine residues at the interior. This way the production of nanoparticles at the exterior surface is prevented or at least decreased.
Figure 2: Alignment of the protein sequences of the wildtype and the mutated human ferritin heavy chain. The Alignment was produced with Clustal Omega (Goujon et al., 2010, Sievers et al., 2011).
In Figure 2 the amino acid sequence alignment of the wildtype human ferritin and the mutated human ferritin is shown. The exterior residues C91R, C103A, C131S, H14D and H106Q, and the interior residues E65C, E141C, E148C, K87Q and K144C were mutated. The mutations have no influence on the structure of the ferritin as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Protein structures of the wildtype human ferritin (A, RCSB ID 4oYN) and the mutated human ferritin (B, RCSB ID 3ES3). Despite the mutations of ten amino acids the ferritin retains its shape. The protein structeres were generated with Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004).
We ordered the CDS for the Human Ferritin Heavy Chain (HUHF) as gBlock from IDT. Due to the complications of the synthesis of HUHF l, we had to split the protein into three parts with 50 basepairs overlapping sequences to each other and to the backbone pSB1C3. This enables combined cloning of all three HUHF-gBlocks by Gibson Assembly into the plasmid backbone of pSB1C3, thus creating the basic"

Tomorrow we will look at the parts we pcr'd and then see how the bp length matches. If nothing happens its probably a pipetting error. If too many bands it may be an annealing issue.
We will also look at the cells we plated of the various transformed parts, 3A, 5A, 7A, and see again if any of the colonies grew.

Tonight we tested the hypothesis that the plasmid did not code for the antibiotic resistance/that we did not use enough DNA.  A Restriction Digest reaction was set up on the ligation reactions completed on June 7.  The reactions were cut with EcoR1 and Pst1.  The reactions were allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C for one and a half hours.  The digests were then ran on a electrophoresis gel.  No DNA was present as there was not enough DNA, thus proving Duke's hypothesis.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

A Paradigm Designed for future iGEMers to
Analyse Ethical Problems in Synthetic Biology
by Li Fuyao
College of Economics and Management, HZAU
In this part we:
Developed a Theoretical 3-D Mapping of Ethical Concerns in Synthetic biology;
A Three-stage Classification Method of Ethical Concerns;
A Demonstration of How to Use this Paradigm: When ""Rewire"" goes Haywire---Ethical Concerns of our Project.
1. 3-D
Imagine the scope of ethical issues as we perceive in synthetic biology as a patch. A keyword is a dot, the development of this dot is a thread, any kind of relationship between two keywords is a thread, too.
     The intertwining of many threads of topics become such a patch.
     Then imagine this patch growing to be a 3-D one, with some dots and thread at the surface, some dots and threads down the surface, some threads start from the bottom and extends to the surface. This means, some issues are latent, not perceived, but have influence on the issues on the surface.
     On the surface is the plane that we deal with directly, the plane of immediate benefit and tradeoffs.
     Down this plane would be the plane of judgement and beliefs.
     Down the plane of judgement would be the plane of perceivable emotions, or attitudes.
     At the bottom would be the plane of reasons for these emotions or attitudes, which encompass much irrationality.
     A surface topic can have various root topics that give rise to it,"

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

(13:00 pm) Finished photographing all colony plates as the camera was charged.
(13:30 pm) The next stage was to make new plates which have polystyrene as the sole carbon source in an attempt to isolate microbes that use polystyrene from among the many normal non-PS using colonies: it's a way of purifying our colonies. This may take a while for the colonies to grow so our computer scientist will run simulations of what the degradation would look like over a period of time that exceeds the running time of our project.

Modeling Results
In the simulation, we tried different values of undetermined parameters which were possible to change in experiments, to see how they influenced the pattern. Generally, we can vary the  parameters of cell growth and cell motility which, in experiments, are easy to  change. So we list the  results of varying several parameters in the cell growth part and cell motility  part.
Cell Growth
Maximum growth rate γ0
Initial nutrient concentration n i
κ
k
Cell movement
Multiple initial Spots
1. Cell Growth
In the cell growth term, we  considered the growth rate was related to nutrient concentration. When the  nutrient was consumed by the cell, the grow rate of the cell would decrease  ( Fig. 7 ). There was a maximum growth rate γ0,  when the nutrient was rich. The parameter κ described the sharp of this curve( Fig. 7 ). The larger κ gave us more smooth increasing curve. And we made an assumption  that one unit of nutrient would change to cell number with a ratio k. Also in  the initial condition, the nutrient concentration ni can influence  the patterns. Therefore, the effects of all the four parameters were studied in  our model.
Above reuslts indicated that, the  faster cell growth (larger γ0 and  smaller doubling time) formed a smaller and a little more unclear ring pattern.  And the inner ring diameter would become a litter more large when the growth  rate increased.
From  above figures, it was found that the initial nutrient concentration ni had  little influence to the pattern, especially when it was large. The only effect  we observed was that smaller initial nutrient concentration ni  made the ring slightly wider and more clear.
Here,  the value of κ was related to the  initial nutrient concentration ni . When initial nutrient  concentration ni was fixed, a smaller κ parameter gave us the similar results with that of faster cell  growth.
When  we increased the value of k, the  patterns did not change a lot, but only became a little more clearly.
In conclusion, the simulation  results showed that the parameters of maximum growth rate γoand κ had a more important role on the ring-like pattern. And the other two parameters k and ni did not influence the  pattern much.

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Aspects#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man, which have very small populations, yet sit at the table with the devolved administrations and the UK government as equals. It’s similar to the European Union (EU) inter-governmental system, the big decisions are taken in the council, by the member state governments, and they each have permanent representation in Brussels, and civil servants who are working there all the time. The UK has about 200 civil servants looking after its interests in the EU, maybe not as much as that, Ireland is a small country around a tenth the size of the UK, maybe less, it has about 100 civil servants working in Europe. What I’m saying is that there are other models of co-operation that don’t involve you having to send your MPs to Westminster, where we are always outvoted, and where we get governments we didn’t elect.
A: How would it work with Scotland becoming independent and having to join the EU again?
JE: That has been an issue of some contention; some people have said that because we would be an applicant nation, we would have to take our place at the end of the queue. I don’t think that that is realistic. Scotland has been a member, albeit as part of a larger member state, for 40 years, the idea that we would be rejected is… it’s actually very difficult the leave the EU, even if you want to, as Greenland found out, so there is no precedent for expulsion of a member state, or part of a member state. The truth is, yes, we would have to negotiate our terms of entry, but we would be doing that from within the EU. The problem is that we are in an independence debate where no side want to give the impression that this will be very difficult, that there will be obstacles and barriers to be overcome. The reality is that Scotland has two very important negotiating or bargaining counters, one is fishing, one is energy. Our contribution to energy supply in Europe is significant because of North Sea oil and gas, and the fishing grounds that Scotland has which are currently part of the common fisheries policy, mean that, for example, Spanish fishing can fish pretty much right up to the Scottish coastline. They’re not going to want to sacrifice that, and that’s why you won’t find the Spanish Government saying anything against Scottish Independence, despite the fact that they have their own independence movements that they’re keen not to push. They’re not taking a formal position before the vote, and that’s exactly as it should be.
What’s really positive is that the Scottish and UK governments have"

This biobrick basically uses the cell metabolism to transforming fatty aldehydes into alkanes. This also means that there is no need to supplement the medium with any other substance.
Following up the cell's growth, we then had to analyze them to check whether it was really working or not.
The chosen method for analysis ended up being the Gas Chromatography, in which we used a 5% polar column. The cell suspension was splitless injected with N2 at 250ºC. After that, the initial temperature was kept at 120ºC for 0,5min and increased to 280ºC at a 3ºC/min rate. The sample was then incubated for 6.17min.
Unfortunately, we had no way to make a standard curve and no access to a mass spectrophotometer whatsoever.
Gas chromatography results. Source:Personal archive.
Due to our limitations, we can't give a bulletproof grantee, but we strongly believe that some of these peaks are the desired alkanes we were looking for, once all the substances that came out are definitely long-chained carbons. Our lack of time resulted in the analysis official inconclusiveness.Therefore, we agreed to use parts of the petrobrick in our project, since it worked fine for us. We went on to use the BBa_K590031 biobrick.

Although we had this initial success, the mammalian cells did not sustain themselves in the cell trap for long.
We decided with the MIT team to continue this collaboration in an effort to successfully culture and sustain mammalian cells in a microfluidic chip. Our goals are to iterate over new microfluidic designs and to practice better methods of inserting the cells into the chip. We are currently still in collaboration with the MIT iGEM team.
MORE ON MIT COLLABORATION
NEU Collaboration
Our second big collaboration was with the NEU iGEM team in designing a microfluidic gradient generator for a cell culture system. The idea is as follows: the NEU team wanted to test a hypothetical genetic circuit and its performance under variable levels of environmental stress. Namely, they were interested in seeing how the expression of certain circuit outputs varied when the bacterial cells received a variable amount of nutrients from the environment.
The NEU team wanted a microfluidic device with the following function: The device would take two fluid inputs, one fluid with a concentrated nutrient solution, and the other input with water. The microfluidic device would contain ten cell traps, each cell trap would contain an individual cell culture. The function of the microfluidic chip would be to generate a gradient of nutrient solution such that the first cell trap receives the full concentration of solution, the second cell trap receives a little less solution, the third even less and so forth. The final cell trap would have no nutrient solution. Thus this chip would generate a gradient of nutrients for all the cells, and then the NEU team would be able to easily analyze the expression of their circuit under variable nutrient inputs. The design schematic was as follows:
This clearly was a much more complicated microfluidic to design, so we considered it a strong test bench for Neptune’s back-end algorithms. We attempted to generate this chip using the gradient generator primitive that was built into MINT. We iterated over several design attempts with MINT.
We ultimately found that MINT’s gradient generator primitive has a few limitations and bugs, which we have since proceeded to work out. Our collaboration with NEU unfortunately was put on hold because the NEU team informed us that they could not realize their hypothetical genetic circuit, so they had no need for our device. We have not given up though! Our goal is to update and iron out any bugs"

Scientist - Community Interactions
Outside of the wetlab, our research-driven approach in this year’s project hopes to combat the growing stigma of science in the public. Through media propaganda and general lack of knowledge of the subject, biotechnology is generally looked upon as inaccessible, ""elitist,"" and “secretive.” The questions we challenged ourselves with were: ""How do these biases arise?"" and ""How can we, as researchers, dispel these myths and better interact with the public concerning our science?"". In the philosophy of iGEM, the UCSF/UCB team made it a primary goal this year to act as a bridge between the community and scientists to make science more accessible, transparent, and publicly involved.
In addition, our human practices were designed primarily to educate the public about synthetic biology in hopes of dispelling detrimental myths and creating awareness about the helpful applications of science in their daily lives. To do so, we presented a public outreach event at the Exploratorium and educated the public on the topic of “fact and fiction” in synthetic biology. Through a creative spin of superheroes on the matter, our team excited the public with the potential of synthetic biology, while promoting public involvement in science. Following this event, we have adapted our presentation into a curriculum and lesson packet capable of introducing middle school and high school students to synthetic biology, in hopes of furthering science education. Toward this end, our team also met with San Francisco City Supervisors (pictured on the right) to discuss our project this year, garnering public support and advocating higher science education at the public school level. Through our project and public interactions this summer, we are optimistic in our approach to move science towards a transparent, exciting, and involved field.
Open Source Science
As part of this year’s West Coast iGEM Meetup , the teams present participated in an ethics forum organized by UCSC (pictured on the right). A panel of faculty members in science, policy, and ethics moderated the discussion and provided perspective to team questions and concerns.
Of particular interest was discussion about the question of whether or not to make all research data freely available to the public. There are many arguments for (e.g. providing tax-payer access to data resulting from their investment, increasing speed of progress and development, reducing barriers) and against (e.g. knowledge could be repurposed for malicious intents or marketed) open access data sharing. This is a complex issue, and there are no right or wrong answers."
Peking,2014,Team:Peking#KillingImprovements_-_-_TEXT.html," a kind of   truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INPNC) to display microvirin (MVN) on the surface of our E. coli. We also   used GFP as a reporter to make the binding effect ""visible"".
INPNC is a kind of modified INP with truncation of the entire internal repeating domain. We chose to work   with INPNC because it has been reported to be an excellent surface display system used in E. coli in recent   years. [2,3] INPNC can be be expressed on the cell surface at a high level, without affecting the cell   membrane structure and cell proliferation, which is really crucial in our case. Also, the size and structure of MVN   are both proper for the INP display system. [2]
The plasmid containing INPNC coding sequence that we used came from the iGEM distribution 2014 ( BBa_K523013 ).
Figure 1. Schema of the surface display system using INP and INPNC. INP N-  domain, which is relatively hydrophobic, anchors INP in the OM (outer membrane). INP C-domain is hydrophilic and exposed to   the medium, which can be used to link the passenger protein on its C-terminus. The internal repeating domains serve   as the template for ice nucleation, and are not necessary for protein display. Depicted are the (a) full-  length INP with no truncation and (b) INP with truncation of the internal repeating domains.
MVN is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806. It is an 108 aa   protein that consists of 2 domains. According to a carbohydrate microarray carried out previously, MVN binds to   carbohydrate and the highest signals are observed with structures that contain α(1 → 2) linked mannose   residues. [1] A binding partner of MVN was identified in the lipopolysaccharide fraction of M.   aeruginosa PCC7806 and it possibly represents the O-antigen of a LPS. [1] MVN has been previously expressed in E.   coli and its binding effect to cyanobacteria cells is highly species-specific. [1] The availability   and specificity are the reasons why we chose MVN in our project.
We optimized the gene sequence of MVN at first and de novo synthesized this gene from commercial company   (Genscript, Nanjing, China).

""In a society that is all about achievements, the ReCoBrain product lets us imagine a world of complete self-control and peak performances. This handy tool that sounds great in the advertisement serves as a disguise for a horrible vision where man becomes machine and leaves the borders of his own brain behind.""
Laura-Nadine Schuhmacher, Lorenz Adlung, Phillip Bayer
Product Description
After one simple injection, ReCoBrain transports you to your own personal paradise! Boring and stressful chores will be executed by your body while you are fast asleep. Just plug in your earphones, press play, sit back and relax. The personalized melodies will tell your brain which program to run – be it anything from washing the dishes, mowing the lawn, or exercising. After the program is completed, the wake-up music will slowly bring you back from your dreams, feeling fully rested and relaxed. You will then have all the free time you ever wanted, and enough time to spend it with family and friends! Indulge in activities you could not find time for before the ReCoBrain technology changed your life.
This procedure can be partially refunded by your health insurance if you suffer from stress-induced disorders like burn-out-syndrome. Please contact your insurance company for further information. Not for children under 18 years of age.
Technical Description
The ReCoBrain technology is based on the injection of a synthetic neuronal network that attaches to the brain’s motor cortex and auditory cortex, and induces the formation of new synapses. Neuronal activity patterns in these brain areas are recorded by the ReCoBrain network and can be linked. Simply by listening to a specific, personalized melody while asleep, ReCoBrain is activated and repeats the corresponding activity patterns of the brain, causing the body to react to these stimuli by executing the programmed task.

Higher excretion is detected in bulls, pen raised cattle, and certain breeds with a seasonal peak between late spring and early fall. Preharvest detection of pathogenic E. coli decreases cross contamination during meat processing.
Shiga toxin 1 and 2 have 55% homology and are composed of 5 identical highly conserved B subunits that bind to the Gb3 host receptor cells and a single A subunit which enters the host target cell and cleaves rRNA. Cattle do not have Gb3, consequently, O157:H7 infected cattle are asymptomatic and difficult to detect. More than 200 serotypes of E.coli contain Stx, of these, some have LEE (locus of enterocyte) which does not directly indicate pathogenicity. Other strains of pathogenic shiga toxin producing E. coli recognized by the USDA as harmful are: O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:H8, O118:H16, O121:H19, and O145:H28 (USDA  Laboratory Guidebook, 2012). These strains are also known as the Big Six. Currently, the USDA targets both the eae and stx genes in the PCR. When these genes are being used in identification, if the sample tests positive for both eae and stx, the sample undergoes further testing. If it only has one or neither of the genes, the sample is considered safe and testing stops (USDA  Laboratory Guidebook, 2012).
Regarding our TALE construct, we compared 2 standard construction strategies for multiple DNA fragments: Golden Gate and Gibson Assembly. Gibson Assembly is a one-step isothermal reaction involving an exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase. All enzymes are put together in one reaction along with DNA fragments and the vector and incubated at 50°C for 15 to 60 min. (Gibson et al., 2009)

A: I do believe that such cutting edge technology can do great benefits to people once it grows fully mature. But we have to make sure it's safe before we take a closer look at its effectiveness.
Q: Is drug administered more strictly than technologies?
A: Yes. You always keep exploring and making adjustments to a technology, but the drugs have certain standards and problems like duration of validity.
Q: It seems to me that most regulations or administrations are more focused on the final examination before entering the market, while there is less supervision in the actual process of production and the purpose of the drug. Is that true?
A: Well, not necessarily. We do have some technological guidelines and principles that are required to be follow during the process. They are guidelines rather than regulation, which means they might not always be mandatory. But scientists and companies still have to follow some basic rules and natural laws in order to carry out the whole process successfully.
Q: Well, then what if some scientists or organisations with illegal intensions take advantage of some potentially dangerous or unethical practice in the process despite the fact that their final products do fit in the requirements?
A: We certainly would get control of that.
Q: We actually know that most biological technology companies these days get orders to synthesize a sequence of DNA. They usually take the orders without examining the purpose or potential usage of the sequence of DNA. Aren't there any controls or regulation concerning that problem?
A: Well, I do know that there is related administration, but I'm not familiar with the specific rules and terms. But as the Drug Administration Department, we basically just work on the registered cases.
Q: Are there any administrations for ethical issues in lab practice in China?
A: Our most basic and important ethical issue now is the drug trials on humans. We usually check if the trial is approved by the ethical committee previously, and then we go to the site to see if they are carrying out the trial as the stated in the proposal. But the only prerequisite is that the case has been registered here, otherwise, we have no legal responsibility to look after that.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," this time we added extra ATP to the mix and used a decreasing temperature gradient for ligation. With the new competent NEB5α, we finally succeeded in transforming the ligated constructs pSB1C3-Intein, pSB1C3-NAGA, pSB1C3-Intein-NAGA, pSB1C3-aGal and pSB1C3-Intein-EABase. Furthermore we modified our chosen expression vector (pETBlue-1), by ligating it with annealed oligonucleotides.
Week 5 --- 01.09.14 - 05.09.14
Minipreparation and subsequent control restriction of the following constructs in pSB1C3 confirmed last week’s transformations: aGal, NAGA and EABase each with Spy and SNAP-NAGA, SNAP-EABAse. We also confirmed the modified pETBlue-1, named pETue1.1 by control restriction and transformed NEB5a with it. pETue1.1 was purified and used for ligation with our one-part and two-part-inserts. However, the transformation of the ligation constructs in NEB5α did not work. Apart from that, we aliquoted our pSB1C3-constructs, that had previously been confirmed by digestion and gel electrophoresis, to send them to GATC-biotech for sequencing. Results were in the next day, with confirmation of correct inserts. Although sequencing did not cover the whole insert, one could see that the parts were ligated correctly.
Week 6 --- 08.09.14 - 12.09.14
In the sixth week of lab work we decided to retry ligation into the pETue1.1 expression vector with all available constructs in pSB1C3. Ligations were then transformed into NEB5α for amplification. After miniprep, we checked the plasmid by control digestion and proceeded to retransform BL21DE3 with our constructs. We also managed to successfully construct pSB1C3-SNAP-EABase in NEB5α via three part ligation. It was later confirmed by digestion with EcoRI and PstI. Work on the synthetic peptides, which were to be used with our tags for immobilisation also began this week. The “invariable part”, which was the same for both C-Intein and Spy-Tag was synthesized manually. It contains a cystein residue for immobilisation with the SulfoLink and a Fluorescin labelled lys"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," and quantify the surface display of the cargo domain [26] . Further downstream of this affinity tag we fused the BioBrick for the EspP autotransporter from E. coli [27] [28] which is then followed by a bacterial terminator. For the termination we again chose a well working terminator from the distribution plate (""double terminator""; BBa_B0010 - BBa_B0012 ).
But this was just the DNA-part. What is expected to happens on a protein level? The construct constantly produces Tet-repressor that binds to thet Tet-Operator and repressed the promoter activity of the autotransporter gene. As soon as the inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added to the culture, it binds to the Tet-repressor that can't bind any more to the Tet-operator and thus the expression of the autotransporter can be regulated. Although the TetR-system is known to be a tight promoter system there is always a certain background expression with most promoters. If the protein expression of the autotransporter is induced using aTc the autotransporter is transcribed and translated. Due to the bacterial signal peptide the protein is secreted into the bacterial periplasm (the space between the two bacterial membranes of gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli). When present in the bacteria periplasm the autotransporter diffused to the outer membrane and inserts into the membrane. After the integration into the outer membrane the protein cargo is transportet through the beta-barrel of the autotransporter and is pre sented on the bacterial surface. We are sure that this BioBrick will be a valuable contribution to the Parts Registry as it allows future teams to display small protein domains on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.
Results: Testing the bacterial autotransporter system
For the testing of our autotransporter constructs we transformed all three autotransporter constructs together with a secreted NanoLuc luciferase, which served as a control, into E. coli JK321 [29] . Transformed cells were grown in LB-medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (pSB1C3-vector) at 30°C and 180 RPM. In the morning a stationary over night culture was used to inoculate 50 mL fresh medium with 1 mL of culture. The cultures were grown to OD550 = 0.5 and then the induction of the protein production was started using aTc: ""non"" = non-induced; ""low"" = 25 ng/mL aTc; """

        Although we observed periodic oscillation, it became unstable gradually due to the increase of bacteria quantity and the accumulation of AHL.         We designed the microfluidics device to solve this problem and repeated our experiment. We took pictures every 5 minutes and supervised the change of fluorescence intensity in each chamber. Following is the result (fig4a).
Figure 4a
        We then could observe a stable oscillation, and the period was about 3h. We used image to measure the fluorescence intensity and drew the oscillation curve (fig4b). Seeing from the figure, we could find the oscillation was stable enough.
Figure 4b
        After the single-period oscillation was proved, we tried to test the double-period oscillation system. We inserted double-period oscillation system into MG1655. After being cultivated for a whole night, the co-transformation bacteria was transferred into the 100 ml LB medium with the proportion of 1:1000. When reaching OD0.1, we took out 1ml sample every 10 minutes, diluting to the same OD value and measuring the fluorescence intensify. Following is the result (fig5).
Figure 5
        Due to the limited time, we did not realize double-period oscillation. However, after comparing our data of these two oscillation systems without microfluidics condition, we can speculate that in the microfluidics chip, the stable double-period oscillation can be realized.         
Future work:
        1.Realize the double-period oscillation system in the microfluidics chip. And then couple these systems together: the light-induced system, the logic gate system, and the oscillation system.         2.Decrease the device’s scale in order to get a more stable oscillation. Also, find solutions to solve the accumulation of bacteria and other unexpected problems.         3.Explore the relationship between velocity of flow and the length of each period.         
Notes:
        1.When measuring fluorescence intensity, the first step is to do re-suspension. Otherwise, LB will affect our results.         2.AHL uses DMSO as solvent which is poisonous. We should improve the concentration of AHL and decrease the quantity of DMSO. When the volume fraction falls below 10%, we did not observe obvious differences.         3.When using microfluidics device, don’t forget to add Tween20 of 0.075% in the medium to avoid bacteria being stuck in"

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," and “Synthetic Biology: a new economic world”. The aim of these roundtables was to make everyone learn more about Synthetic Biology straight from professionals, along with knowing more about what they could do once the iGEM is over, how they can transform their project into a professional activity. This was also for us the occasion to host professionally an international-class event: we took that in consideration and organized a special VIP cocktail area where we were able to meet them after the roundtables.
We also decided to ask all the teams to come with a poster, and to be able to present their project to everyone. This would be very useful as a training fort the Boston Jamboree, and would allow every European team to meet and discover each other’s projects.
Thanks to the IONIS Education group, we were able to find the perfect place where to host our event. We also managed to get a discount on a local hotel and provide a cheap housing for every team who wanted one. This way, we would be able to host as much teams as possible, in the same place! After sending our invitations, we got a confirmation from 30 teams scattered all around Europe, coming from 11 different countries.
We also wanted this event to be fun for all iGEMers, along with an opportunity for them to discover Paris and the French culture. For this reason, visits and activities in Paris were planned for the second day. We also managed to get a partnership with Paul, allowing everyone to discover French breads and pastries.
The whole event was really amazing all along, whether when we were preparing it (announcing it and receiving messages from people all across Europe was a blast), or when we were living it: we finally got to see all of the teams we have been in contact with, and meeting everyone in such an atmosphere was very exciting!
We also had the occasion to communicate with teams, through communication tools like Twitter and Facebook, and also through a dedicated app the iGEM IONIS team developed: this « companion app » was the perfect road book  a map of the event, a schedule with every major event planned, and even a selection of nearby restaurants and places to eat.
The whole event turned out very well and we received tons of positive feedbacks, which really comforts us in our idea of making it a periodic event. With the Evry Team, we created a common association, called iGEM ESOC (European Symposium Organisation Committee), and are hoping that in next years some teams will choose to organize it again!

Site-directed mutagenesis of actin gene
27.08.2013
We designed special primers that induced a point mutation to remove the xba1 restriction site. Quick Change Lightning kit was used to QC-PCR of p-Jet with actin gene. Then the PCR products was digested with Dpn1 to cut off methylated sites.
Work in progress
26.08.2013
Performed some more Gibson assemblies and tried to ligate DH and MT together in the same vector. Made chemically competent cells and the primers for our mini-genes arrived.

We works really hard to participate and organize iGEM activities and now deserve a rainy BBQ as the end of a busy communication day. It is not only about eating, we are actually talking about science mainly.
Microscopic pictures of actin cytoskeleton
23.08.2013
From the actin GFP fusion pictures were made under a fluorescent microscope. Beforehand the A.niger transformantss were grown under different conditions in an 8-well plate specially designed for microscopy.
Gibson assembly
22.08.2013
The colony PCR’s of DH, MT, ACP and eforRed are successful. Performed another Gibson assembly with KS.
Ligation of proton-ATPase gene into in-house brick
22.08.2013
Finally we managed to ligate the proton-ATPase used for the visualization of the septa into an in-house brick containing an n-terminal GP fusion.
Improving the A. terreus model
21.08.2013
As it turns out, the lovastatin pathway in the published A. terreus model is not balanced and optimization for its production is therefore impossible. This is actually an interesting finding, since it implies that we can now improve the current model by adding the detailed lovastatin biosynthesis pathway that is balanced and allows for optimization of lovastatin production.
Gibson assembly
21.08.2013
Today we did our first Gibson assemblies of DH, MT, ACP, eforRed and ATP. Including transformations.

Ag43 is mainly known to induce cell-to-cell aggregation and be involved in biofilm formation. However, as the necessary information required for auto transportation resides in the protein itself (Kj\aergaard et al., 2002), the main of our project was to use it as a platform for displaying specific peptides on the surface of E. coli. To accomplish this aim, we have modularized and characterized Biobrick BBa_K759001.

2. Aim
To eliminate unwanted PstI sites from a pre-existing, non-compliant Ag43 BioBrick (BBa_K759001)
3. Methods and Results
a. Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Synonymous mutations at the 6 additional PstI sites were thus introduced through PCR-based Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Agilent Lightning Quik-Change mutagenesis kit) in the BBa_K759001 sequence, by using the following set of primers:
Highlighted nucleotides represent the synonymous mutations introduced within the coding region of Ag43, to remove the PstI sites. For primer pairs 1,2,3,4 and 6, the restriction site for the PstI site (CTGCA^G) has been converted to CTGCAA. The amino acid glutamine was therefore preserved in the open reading frame of the sequence and has been selected according to the higher frequency of codon usage in E. coli. For primer pair 5, CTGCA^G has been changed to CTGCGG, to maintain the open reading frame of Ag43. By changing GCA TO GCC, alanine was conserved within the sequence.
b.  Restriction digest and gel electrophoresis
Escherichia coli bacterial cultures containing both plasmids BBa_K759001 and BBa_K1352000 were inoculated overnight in LB-chloramphenicol medium in a shaking water bath at 37oC. Plasmid mini preps were conducted with a Qiagen plasmid mini prep kit. Single and double restriction digests were carried out accordingly:
Restriction digests with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI was performed to"

Modeling for Human Practices: The secret files
Students from our Human Practices subteam found out that two years before releasing their last product, the Talking Life Device, Talking Life Technologies started to carry out a high number of secret experiments regarding the safety of their uprising new sensing-bacteria. These controversial results have just been released two days ago! Click on the image below or in this link to read the complete version of their report!
After analyzing it, we realized that these equations and the parameters used belong to previous studies done in 2010 (1). Since we wanted to test whether these results were true, we have also carried out our own experiments (Table 1) to determine the best data to use and check the possible outcomes. Let’s model Human Practices!
Table 1. Data from different sources used to modelllize the population dynamics.
*Data obtained after several experiments with a cheating plasmid and with no plasmid at all.
After using our own data the population dynamics we obtained is similar to those from Talking Life Technologies (Figure 4), confirming the worst-case scenario:
Figure 4. The evolution of both cheater and secretor (""honest"") populations
using our own data.
So, how could this big company have done something like that? Is our health under their control?
Experimental evolution prediction from the model
With the model proposed by Frank [1], with some changes to meet our experimental setup, we obtained the folowing system of ODEs
And after the parametric identification of the system with SSm algorithm, with data from the experimental evolution , we get values for the model parameters.
Then we made a simulation experiment to see what happens when we start with no cheaters. In figure 5, we can see the predicted time evolution of the Bac2 and cheaters population.

Model prediction of Bac2 and cheaters evolution.
