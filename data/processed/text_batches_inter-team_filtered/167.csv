Figure 24: Colony PCR for YFP. The colonies here is the same as in Fig. 23. The ladder used was 1kb+ from Thermo Fisher Scientific©. The negative control is carried out with water as template. For the PCR conditions see the protocol section. The positive was taken from the synthetic gene from IDT.
Figure 25: Colony PCR for PhaB for the second round of Gibson performed. Bands were observed for all colonies, however none of the bands correspond to the PhaB. The ladder used was 1kb+ from Thermo Fisher Scientific©. For the PCR conditions see the protocol section.
After several tries, Gibson still did not work out and we concluded that it was not possible to do the Gibson within the timeframe of this project. One possible way to have optimized it, was to design new primers to get better overhangs between the genes. Also, it might be worth looking into adding other tags than the fluorescence, like His or Myc tag. In that the constructs will be smaller and maybe easier to work with. Another reason why it did not work out was that the Gibson MasterMix used expired one year ago. However, when a new one was bought, it did not work either, suggesting that one of the two suggesting above might have been the reason why it did not work out for us. Instead, we looked into doing conventional cloning on PhaA and PhaB.
Journal reference:
Question:Was PHaA-CFP successfully cloned in pHT254?
Experiment:PCR amplification was done on PHaA-CFP to introduce XbaI and BamHI restriction sites and the gel-purified amplicon was then digested with mentioned restriction enzymes. Plasmid was also linearized using XbaI and BamHI restriction enzyme. The enzymes were inactivated by incubating at 65 C for 20 min. A ligation reaction containing PHaA-CFP and linearized  pHT254 was carried out at 30 C at overnight. NEB10 E. coli cells were heat shock transformed with the ligation product, plated on 100µg/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37C.
Results:Two small colonies of transformed E. coli with ligation product were detected after overnight incubation at 37C and were subjected to colony PCR to detect presence of PHaA-CFP. Both the colonies showed the presence of PHaA-CFP at an expected size around 1,"

Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
Guidelines for the surveillance of laboratory workers handling microorganisms at Biosafety Level 1
Historical evidence indicates that the microorganisms handled at this level are unlikely to cause human disease or animal disease of veterinary importance. Ideally,however, all laboratory workers should undergo a pre-employment health check at which their medical history is recorded. Prompt reporting of illnesses or laboratory accidents is desirable and all staff members should be made aware of the importance of masintaining GMT.
Guidelines for the surveillance of laboratory workers handling microorganisms at Biosafety Level 2
1. A pre-employment or preplacement health check is necessary. The person’s medical history should be recorded and a targeted occupational health assessment performed.
2. Records of illness and absence should be kept by the laboratory management.
3. Women of childbearing age should be made aware of the risk to an unborn child of occupational exposure to certain microorganisms, e.g. rubella virus. The precise steps taken to protect the fetus will vary, depending on the microorganisms to which the women may be exposed.
Biological Safety Cabinets
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:</p> <p>
Biological safety cabinets (BSCs) are designed to protect the operator, the laboratory environment and work materials from exposure to infectious aerosols and splashes that may be generated when manipulating materials containing infectious agents, such as primary cultures, stocks and diagnostic specimens. Aerosol particles are created by any activity that imparts energy into a liquid or semiliquid material, such as shaking, pouring, stirring or dropping liquid onto a surface or into another liquid. Other laboratory activities, such as streaking agar plates, inoculating cell culture flasks with a pipette, using a multichannel pipette to dispense liquid suspensions of infectious agents into microculture plates, homogenizing and vortexing infectious materials, and centrifugation of infectious liquids, or working with animals, can generate infectious aerosols. Aerosol particles of less than 5 μm in diameter and small droplets of 5?100 μm in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. The laboratory worker is generally not aware that such particles are being generated and may be inhaled or may crosscontaminate work surface materials. BSCs, when properly used, have been shown to be highly effective in reducing laboratory-acquired infections and cross-contaminations of cultures due to aerosol exposures. BSCs also protect the environment.

Human Practice
Idea
The main idea of our human practice project is to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology to outsiders. Let people             who have never stepped into synthetic biology get interested in and know about it. Many elements of the human practice game were inspired by the concept of our project--""search"". And our human practice project is also an extension of our main project.
Initial plan
At first, we planned to develop a virtual laboratory. We have visited USTC team’s laboratory and let them show             us some professional equipment. Thanks to the enthusiastic receiving of USTC, we documented the equipment’s detailed             appearance and its usage in order to build the virtual model in the VR lab. Moreover, the plan of developing a virtual lab wonders away from our project.
Change of plan
Although we have come up with an excellent plan of the virtual lab, it wonders away from our initial idea. Few             people but biologists know about how to operate in the virtual lab. As for those who has never touched synthetic             biology, it is too difficult to play around in the virtual lab. Thus we would fail to generalize synthetic biology             to the non-professionals if we had kept the VR lab. Finally, we decided to change the plan and to develop a VR             game.
Gene War Game
The name of this game is VR Shooting - Gene War. Players are supposed to control a BioBrick container in their             hands to store gene chains and shoot bullets to attack the enemy in front of them. In the meantime players should             avoid being shot by bullets from enemies. There are a variety of enemies, whose blood volume, flying speed of             bullets, movement patterns and scores are different. In the fifth section, there is a “Final BOSS” which is quite             hard to deal with. A tool aiming at supplying blood for players is set in this game. A large number of BioBricks             are randomly generated around the player. When the BioBricks are touched by the handle, a system which provides             skills to players will start. The system will automatically select"

Introductory Lab session: 3rd July 2009
Jane and Jess preparing serial dilutions
Today we were transforming DNA using Phil's protocol, however we used the following changes:
We added 3µl of DNA to our cells.
We plated out 100µl of our dilutions.
We incubated our transformed cells for the full 60 mins.
We used the ampicillin resistance plasmid '435'
Procedure
We followed the protocol using sterile technique where possible, as well as wearing gloves to prevent contamination of the DNA.
Glass tops such as LB jars can be run under the flame, however plastic eppendorfs cannot so working around the flame is sufficient.
We found it easier if the person pipetting held the eppendorf as they can see what they're doing better.
Prof. Aldridges lab uses sterile beads to plate ourt rather than plastic spreaders, these are a bit fiddly so it may take a while to get used to tipping the right amount out!!
Our serial dilutions were prepared as follows:
Spreading the diluted cells across the agar surface using sterile glass beads
Using the waiting times within our procedure we set up 6 labelled eppendorf tubes with 900µl of LB, ready for the series dilution.
We took 100µl of our incubated cells and put them in tube 1, mixed the solution briefly and then proceded to take 100µl of the diluted cells and tranfer them along the line of eppendorfs, resulting in eppendorfs containing 10-1 to 10-5 solutions for both the control and 'transformed' cells.
We plated all 6 transformed E.coli solutions"

PROJECT
This year the Georgia State iGEM team reached out and attended the 2016 Maker Faire. The team volunteered with Lambert High School iGEM team in promoting and informing people about synthetic biology. Our team and Lambert High School’s team exchanged project ideas and we were very interested in their CRISP-Cas9 system inspired by Georgia Tech. Not only promoting one idea, but our team was able to survey about 40+ people on Cannibidiol oil. The Maker Faire allowed us to answer questions that people in our community had about science, while also educating them on CBD oil and how it's used. We were able to survey people's knowledge of CBD oil and then in turn provide more information on it as the survey takers became curious. Our team took part in several science oriented events that allowed us to share our knowledge with those who might not otherwise be exposed to such information.
Survey Results
Atlanta Science Fair.
We were requested to come back to ASF for 2016 due to how successful our BioBrick activity was last year. This year we educated many students and parents on synthetic biology and how to create a BioBrick construct using legos.
Next Generation Men
Our team connected with our local high schools by bringing them into the lab and to provide them a deeper understanding of what we do as an iGEM team. We partner with Next Generation Men Inc., a non profit that was established by former high school students to provide underrepresented students with professional exposure, leadership development, community service and personal support. This experience allowed the students to get exposure to college and how life is working in a lab. We provided a brief tour for students of the iGem lab spaces by showing them our lab equipment and their basic usage. Students learned about iGem and what synthetic biology is.  Students got an opportunity to learn about molecular techniques. We educated students on PCR and gave them an opportunity to run PCR and conduct gel electrophoresis. Many of the students who attended were either interested in non-science majors and or undecided. Their experience in the lab allowed them to explore and"

Fig.9 The concentration of inhibitor expressed by PBAD changes with different concentrations of inducer.
From this curve, we can clearly see the concentration of arabinose have positive relationship with protein intensity in a proper range.
The point of inducer’s concentration (0.003%) can cast on the protein intensity coordinate axis, and the corresponding intensity is about 24.42 units.
From all these, we can get the conclusion：Since the concentration of arabinose can affect the expression of inhibitor positively, and the concentration of inhibitor can decide the ""in-promoter's"" activity, we can say that by adding different concentrations of inducer could model the environments with different concentrations of inhibitor. Also the different concentration of the inhibitor will change the condition of ""in-promoter"" in the end.
·APPLICATION part·
Aim
To model the application situation of plasmid numbers losing on different levels and the relationship between the plasmids and ""in-promoter"".                                 Find out the threshold of plasmids number which can decide whether the killer gene expresses or not.
In the plasmids sensing system, in order to model the situation of plasmid losing on different levels, we need to simulate the change of substances under different conditions of plasmid numbers. In this system, a constitutive promoter is used to express the inhibitor under different plasmid numbers. Then the ""in-promoter"" will also be repressed by the inhibitor protein. The killer gene has been replaced by RFP (Fig. 1).
Fig.1 The circuit constructed to model the situation of plasmid numbers losing on different levels.
The concentration of inhibitors is positively correlated to the plasmid numbers since the constitutive promoter has a stable strength. Main considerations includes the processes of transcription, translation, repression, the effects of products and the number of plasmids. We also considered reversible reactions as well as the production and degradation of substances.
Fig.2 The inhibitor protein will repressor the expression of ""in-promoter"" and RFP.
The assumptions we made are:
(1) The constitutive promoter can constitutively express the inhibitor
(2) The expression of DNA sequence is directly proportional to the plasmid numbers in a specific range
(3) In a single cell, when the concentration of killer protein reaches a threshold, the cell will be eliminated
(4) Too many plasmids will cause the RNA polymerase and the ribosome overloaded.
(5) Because the rate of transcription is much faster than the rate of the translation, we think the rate-limiting step is"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#TimeControl_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 Non-Cooperativity Approximation
Because modelling the eﬀects of cooperativity of the two binding sites on pcI would add signiﬁcant complexity to the model, we decided to ignore it and simply treat the binding reactions as independent from each other. That is, the binding of cI to a site of pcI has the same rate regardless of whether the other site has a cI bound.
Thus, under this simpliﬁcation, the percentage of unbound pcI simply becomes the product of the unbound percentages of both types.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied the approximations as stated.
4.1 Control without Time Control
Fig. 1 Control setting where Cre is directly induced
As can be seen, from a high AHL concentration produced by the Sensing module, Cre saturates quite quickly and already reaches 80% of its maximal level at around 50 minutes.
Because we want to allow the Sensing module to reach suﬃciently high levels of AHL before activating the recombinase production, it is then necessary to add a Time Control module. As can be seen in the Sensing module simulation, it takes about 200 minutes to reach 80% of maximal AHL concentration levels.
4.2 Adding Time Control
Fig. 2 Time Delay response without AHL induction
Fig. 3 Time Delay response with AHL induction
Above is the simulation result of the Time Control module and a control where Cre is directly induced.
On the left, we have a simulation of the module without any initial AHL. As can be seen from the graph, the concentration of cI2 and Cre do not increase from 0 as desired, while the concentration of PhlF remains high, continuously repressing Cre. This shows that if the Sensing module does not produce AHL, then there will be no production of Cre as desired
On the right, the initial AHL is at the maximal level, and cI2 is constitutively produced. The concentration of cI2 increases quickly which then represses PhlF and causes its concentration to fall. When PhlF has a suﬃciently low concentration, Cre begins to be produced. Compared to the control without our Time Control module, the Cre takes about 150 minutes longer to reach 80% of maximum Cre levels. This should allow the Sensing module more time to produce AHL and aid in eﬃcient quorum sensing activation of surrounding cells.

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html,"?)
Tito : I think iGEM Teams are the best -- they understand that biology should be engineered. Those interested in synthetic biology are usually pretty open to the idea of DIYbio.
Jason : Junior High/Secondary or equivalent level of knowledge is sufficient to engage in DIYbio.
Q.  Which of the following are the most important factors when deciding to carry out an experiment?
Jason :
Venue / budget / availability of reagents & equipment
Safety / level of training / familiarity with techniques
Complexity / duration (of experiment)
Manpower / interest level
Q. What do you feel is the minimum level of safety measures that DIYBioers should practice?
(e.g. We found DIYbioNYC telling readers that E.Coli K-12 is so harmless that you can even drink it without ill effects. While this definitely makes DIYbio sound relatively safe, will inexperienced readers get the wrong idea and disregard other safety issues as well?)
Tito : It definitely depends on the type of work you're doing. However, common sense guidelines such as DIY Safety Manual at DIYbio OpenWetWare are useful.
Q. If people could really equip a room to have lab conditions [eg negative pressure, biohoods etc], then would it still be considered DIYBio?
The question here is whether DIYBio refers to the time/money commitment or the expertise of the experimenters?
Tito : DIYbio depends wholly on ""doing"". It doesn't matter how much equipment or expertise or ideas you have. The focus is on ""doing"".
Q.  What is your typical protocol procedure?
Jason : A combination of both common established protocol & guidelines AND experimental approaches that may be better in some way.
Q. Have you ever considered the impact of your experimentation on society?
Jason : Yes.
Q. What do you feel is the potential for misuse? Is there sufficient cause to worry?
Tito : There are certainly risks involved in amateur biology, including waste disposal and sample management. I advocate for community labs because of this.
Q. If there is cause to worry, what overriding factors made you believe a website like DIYBio could do more good than harm?
Tito : DIYbio is successful because it is a community of people, from a wide range of backgrounds. A website, a mailing list, and other tools make this possible, by bringing groups together. Then those groups are better at making decisions than individuals.
Q. If DIY Bio becomes more mainstream, is it not harder to control/contain lab experiments gone wrong? How can we alleviate this situation?
Tito : Community"

①When the TEV protease concentration reaches the threshold, the inhibition of the downstream gene by the TetR could be released. Then, the recombinase recognizes the attB and attP sites, reverses the sequence between attB and attP, and generates new attL and attR sites. The recombinase-RDF and RFP protein can be expressed after the reversal. But the recombinase-RDF loses function by binding with the inhibitor produced upstream. The RFP concentration continues to rise.
②When the external signal weakens and the intracellular TEV protein concentration falls below the threshold, the TetR re-block the expression of recombinase and the inhibitor. Then recombinase-RDF recognizes the attL and attR sites and shuts down the expression of RFP protein.
Based on the above design , we call it the resettable exact ""0/1"" switch

More pAK13D was grown to acquire more DNA to be miniprepped tomorrow.  Nupur performed colony PCR and made cultures of transformants from yesterday. All transformations appeared to have very low efficiency--perhaps an issue with heat shock stocks?  Transformations of AI-AL (mRFP cds and lox site parts) all yielded colonies, though at really low efficiencies compared to most transformations off of kit plates. These were screened by colony PCR to verify.  Ligations into pC13P all yielded colonies, but at very low efficiencies. These were pC13E (T7 pol), pCp13X (bar), and pC13Z. All were screened by colony PCR as well.  Taq was used to perform 5 colony PCRs, then all colony PCRs were run on a gel.  Also, pCg13S (nptIIBB)was digested with XbaI, PstI, ApaLI, and SacI for later ligation to pC13P, which had been previously digested with SpeI and PstI, column purified, and dephosphorylated.

Comparative Functional Analysis of BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002 for Device Sensitivity and Specificity
We investigated specificity and sensitivity of BBa_K1127008 against gold and cupper ion by conducting Chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) assay. We compared the results of our devices BBa_K2048001 and BBa_K2048002 against BBa_K1127008, which is the currently available functional device in the registry for gold sensing.
Results:
Figure 1: CPRG assay results after 12 hours of incubation
Image shown in Figure 1 was obtained after 12 hours of incubation. Lanes A to D contained copper(II) metals according to the uM concentration shown on the left hand side whereas lanes E to F contained corresponding gold(III) metal ions. Control groups: Untransformed DH10B cells containing the metal ion of interest (Lanes D and I) Experiment groups: BioBricks BBa_K2048001 labelled as GolS in lanes C and G, BBa_K2048002 labelled as P118A in lanes B and F and BBa_K1127008 labelled as York in lanes A and E.
Dark red color was observed in the presence of DH10B cells transformed with BBa_K2048001 in the presence of gold(III) metal ions. Although the expression was sensitive to the gold ions, it was not particularly specific to gold ion. Red-orange expression levels were also observed in the presence of copper(II) ions. Cells transformed with BBa_K2048002 were found to be specific to presence of gold(III) ions. Minimum to no activity was observed in the presence of copper(II) ions. However, complete color development required more than 12 hours. Cells transformed with BBa_K1127008 showed orange color development in the presence of both gold(III) and copper(II) ions. Color observed in the presence of gold was darker than the one in the presence of copper ions. Most importantly, circuit expression was observed for BBa_K1127008 and BBa_K2048001"

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," long time in high cell density without adding fresh media will inherently lead to low welfare, low transcription and protein synthesis rate and poor response to the light stimuli. In other words, the 23 hour incubation is clearly too long and leads to bad sample quality.
GFP Fluorescence of Our Light Response Element Compared to Constitutive GFP Producing Strain and Non-Fluorescent Strain
We designed new experiments based on the previous results. First of all, we need to address how positive and negative control respond to light. We need to address the possibility that some of the effects are due to warming effects of the LED lights. Moreover, we need to measure the light response of bacterial cultures in logarithmic growth state with lower cell density. These experiments were carried out in transparent minimal medium to avoid fluorescent bias by LB medium. In the beginning of the experiment, all the cells were diluted to OD600 of 0.5.
We prepared three different samples (light response element, positive control and negative control) and placed them under five different intensities of blue light ( ). The lowest intensity is actually a well without a led light, that is,near-zero intensity. However, we designate this intensity with parameter value of 1 instead of zero (which would translate to -infinity on the logarithmic scale). We had duplicate samples of our light response element and we measured the their average fluorescence in this experiment.
.: Different light intensity parameters and corresponding log10 values used in this experiment.
We aimed to measure the GFP fluorescence regularly, once per hour throughout the experiment. The experiments lasted for approximately six hours yielding six different time points. This means 30 data points per sample. However, as the fluorometer was reserved at times, the timepoints are not exactly regular. In addition, we noticed that between our 4th and 5th measurement, the batteries of our LED rig had died and the LED intensities had all dimmed significantly. At this point, the batteries were immediately changed to fully charged ones.
.: GFP fluorescence of our light response element at different intensities in different times (upper figure). The perceived intensity is a 10 base logarithm of the parameter values, given in and the fluorescence is an average of two different samples. Negative control was calculated as the average of all the time points at the given intensity. The legend is in the figure below. The positive control is in the , and the intensity values are in the . The times indicated are times of the day, not incubation times.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"enta and Yellow for pigments. This is because light and pigment mix differently; light is additive and pigment is subtractive:
Light and pigment produce colour in different ways. While coloured light has a peak wavelength corresponding to its colour, coloured pigment absorbs all wavelengths that do not correspond to its colour and so reflect the corresponding coloured light:
In this system, red light is the opposite of cyan pigment, green light is the opposite of magenta pigment, and blue light is the opposite of yellow pigment. Hence our choice of sensors and pigments.
It must be noted that while RGB light give a full spectrum of colour and tone, CMY is a simplified version of the CYMK colour system used in printing. This was done because to engineer the pathways for CYMK colour system outputs is too complex (see logic gates below). However, as CMY is subtractive there will be tone as Cyan + Magenta + Yellow will approximate black.
This shows the logic gates required if we included a black pigment (K). Not very simple, and near impossible to input into an E. coli! However, when the black pigment is removed, the logic gates simplify down very neatly...
This system shows red light suppressing the production of our cyan pigment, green light suppressing the magenta pigment and blue light supressing the yellow pigment.
The Biology
The focus of our wet work is the creation of three independent 'light to output' pathways in E. coli. Each pathway will control the transcription of selected genes using Red, Green or Blue light. Incident light will prevent the transcription of the selected gene.
In our bio-camera the controlled genes will be those that code for the production of cyan, magenta and yellow pigments:
Red light prevents the production of Cyan pigment
Green light prevents the production of Magenta pigment
Blue light prevents the production of Yellow pigment
Each sensor prevents the production of its opposing pigment, producing the pigment which is the same colour of light that the light sensor detects. The mix of pigments will reproduce the colour of light incident on the bacteria.
If you'd like to have a go at mixing pigments and lights for yourself, why not play the colour mixing game at the bottom of our Notebook page? More difficult than you'd think!
Red light pathway
This pathway uses the well characterised Cph8 red light sensor (composing of Cph1 and Envz). When there is no red light present, this protein causes the phosphorylation of OmpR, to OmpR-P. This then diffuses away from the red light sensor, and can bind to a specialised OmpF promoter sequence which is upstream of"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," inform people and companies as to the toxicity of their water.
Future Generation Products
Future generation products will include measurement sensors for specific toxic compounds such as naphthenic acids and hydrocarbons. These sensors will report to the user on the type and amount of that compound present.
Product Design
The technology contains two components: disposable cartridges that will hold the sample and “sensing” bacteria, and the detector (Figure 1). The cartridges will contain microorganisms designed to demonstrate detection of toxins by producing enzymes capable of changing analyte compounds so that they can be detected electrochemically (Figure 2).  The detector device contains all of the circuitry necessary to read the electrochemical output from the bacterial strain and transmit it to a computer.
Figure 1: Overview of our technology
Data can be collected through a variety of inputs whether direct connections on site (USB) or wirelessly through cellular and existing data networks on-site.  Additionally, measurements can be linked to specific geospatial positions using GPS technology. Bringing it all together we envision our system integrating within current data management systems already in use in the oil sands in addition to providing our own cloud computing based system.
To date, we have generated a microbial strain that is able to detect three relevant oil sands toxins: naphthenic acids, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene. We are marketing this as a biosensor for general toxicity. We have demonstrated the output of the detector as being able to alter analyte compounds so that they may be detected electrochemically. Furthermore we are working to demonstrate that we can detect simultaneously active output signals, where more than one compound can be detected at a time. We currently have a proof-of-concept technology for detecting oil sands toxins.
As we are refining the techniques to optimally detect toxins with the microbial strain, we are developing a prototype of the system that will be sold commercially and will ultimately be used by clients for field tests. On this front we are working closely with manufacturers to design our final product.
Detailed Description of the Technology
Sensing Microorganism:
To obtain an organism that may respond to petroleum toxins, we performed a transposon screen. This biological screen inserts the genetic sequence of a reporting protein (the enzyme β-galactosidase) into random locations of the test organism's DNA. The purpose is to put the reporter in a region that the host organism uses to survive the toxicity of petroleum toxins because this way it would ""tell us"" that those chemicals are present (Figure 2).

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#TimeControl_-_-_TEXT.html," one site will increase the rate at which cI2 binds to the other site. It will only produce PhlF when both sites are not bound to cI2.
The promoter pPhlF is another promoter needed repressed by PhlF for the translation of Cre. It will only produce Cre when it is not bound and repressed by PhlF.
Under no induction, only the mRNA transcript for PhlF production is produced. Upon receiving (LuxR_AHL)2 inducer, the mRNA transcript is translated to produce cI molecules. Under induction, however, cI will be translated from the mRNA transcript and will inhibit pcI in its dimer form cI2 . This will lead to decreased production of PhlF and this in turn will allow pPhlF to produce Cre.
PhlF repressor repressing pPhlfp promoter. There will be no Cre recombinase produced here
Upon an induction, cI inhibits pcI in its dimer form. There will be Cre recombinase production here
2 System of Reactions
We can describe the Sensing module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
Note that in this simulation, since pLuxR is treated as being induced at its maximum level, we simply use its induced transcription rate as its transcription rate.
Reactions which we treat as a regular ﬁrst order reaction are represented with a one-way arrow ( → ), while those that we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation to are represented with a two-way arrow ( ←→ ).
3 Approximations
3.1 Quasi-Steady-State Approximation
To simplify our model, we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). Because the rate of binding and dissociation are much faster than the rate of transcription and translation, we can simplify the set of reactions by treating some reactions as being in steady-state equilibrium.
We apply this approximation to the following reactions:
pcI and cI
PhlF and pPhlF
Furthermore, we also make the approximation that the promoters are much fewer than the number of repressors, so we make the approximation that reaction of a repressor binding to a promoter does not reduce the repressor’s concentration. We can make this approximation because the number of promoters is equal to the plasmid copy number while the number of repressor is usually much higher for any signiﬁcant concentration.
3.2 Non-Cooperativity Approximation
Because modelling the eﬀects of cooperativity of the two binding sites on pcI would add"

Cost analysis
Our test is much cheaper than existing solutions, especially when you consider the final product will be a multiplexing assay which will test for many diseases simultaneously.
Qiagen PAXgene blood RNA tube: 1 @ £752 / 100 kits [11]
£7.52
Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit: 1 @ £1115 / 250 kits [12]
£4.46
Taking a blood sample inc. labour [13]
£3.42
Medical lab technician’s time: 15 minutes @ £8.45 / hour [14]
£2.11
Paper-based toehold switch biosensor: 50 @ 1.7p / 1 μl switch [15]
£0.85
Other lab equipment e.g. sterilisation: tubes: gloves (approx) [13]
£0.30
Total
£18.66
We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:

They were then divided up into teams with the aim of devising and presenting their own iGEM project, an iGEMmer from the current team guided their mindmapping. Advisors acted as judges and awarded prizes to the most original or innovative ideas.
1. Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
For our Human Practices the team approached several people to obtain feedback on our project to help guide the improvement of the device. Dr Simon Rushton, a politics lecturer, helped us identify potential stakeholders. Dave Ogelsby is a member of the UK government Rapid Diagnostics Steering Committee that surveys implementation of the antimicrobial resistance five-year strategy plan; he pointed out that our device would help prevent doctors prescribing antibiotics to viral infections. In order to understand the doctor and hospital end users, we talked to Mrs Thompson. From these interactions, we assessed that our test needed to be shorter than 2 hours, and our device needed to operate with small volumes of blood. This is because blood tests are only allowed in lab hospitals. For the full story of our Practice, and how they have influenced the design of our project, please visit:

2. Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
Sheffield 2016 has improved the function of the
BBa_J23100
part, by adding an RBS site downstream of the promoter (
BBa_K2016005
). BBa_J23100 was originally submitted to the Registry by Berkeley 2006. Our team has also improved the characterisation of both
BBa_J23100
and
BBa_J23106
. These parts are a strong and medium promoter respectively, that we have used to design our iron detecting device. We have experimentally validated through fluorometry that there is indeed a significant difference between expression levels of GFP coupled to the strong and medium promoters. Comparative analysis of promoter strengths can be directly interpreted from the data we obtained. This data can be found both on the original part experience pages of
BBa_J23100
and

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#Other assembly systems_-_-_TEXT.html," the restriction recognition sites of four restriction enzymes; EcoRI and XbaI should be located upstream of the BioBrick and SpeI and PstI downstream of the BioBrick. The BioBricks can not contain the four mentioned restriction recognition sites. These restriction recognition sites are used to cut the BioBrick to be inserted obtain sticky ends and open the second receiving plasmid also obtaining sticky ends.
The resulting insert and open vector must be purified so unwanted and unspecified parts can be removed. The inserted and cut plasmids are mixed and under the right conditions, making the sticky ends to form hybridization. Subsequently, a ligation is performed to re-ligate in order  to form a plasmid that can be transformed into E. coli cells. [1] .
Difference between Plug'n Play assembly and Standard Assembly
A major disadvantage of the Standard assembly is the need for restriction digestions, ligations and the need for site-directed mutagenesis if more restriction recognition sites are present on the plasmid. The limitation in only assembling two parts at the time, makes the Standard assembly much more time consuming. Furthermore, the scars made by the assembling make it impossible to create fusion proteins by the Standard assembly.
3A assembly
3A (3 antibiotic) is a method for assembling two BioBrick parts at the time. 3A assembly relies on three way ligation (between the two parts and the backbone vector), thereby it differs from Standard Assembly, which uses two way ligation between a part and a part + vector. The 3A assembly was designed to make the gel purification of the digested parts unnecessary. Furthermore, antibiotic selection is used to eliminate unwanted background. The assembled parts can either be in two plasmids or generated by PCR.
The way it's done
The process of assembly with 3A resembles the Standard Assembly method. The 3A assembly uses, just like the Standard Assembly, the restriction recognition sites of EcoRI, SpeI, Xbal and PstI for flanking the BioBricks and destination vector.
Digestion of the two parts and the destination plasmid are performed so sticky ends are compatible with the wanted assembly of the vector. The restriction digestion and ligation has to be executed in two separate steps. After transformation in E. coli cells, positive/negative selection is performed. [2] .

Overview
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada
(http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/permits/inspection/index-eng.php)
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge is equip with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eye wash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.

Toggle switch is a gene synthetic network that was discovered and constructed in Escherichia coli by Tim Gerdner, Charles Cantor, and Jim Collins. Naturally, toggle switch gene synthetic network found in lambda bacteriophage for regulate its lytic and lysogenic cycle. In synthetic biology, toggle switch use for regulating bistability of two expression system by orientating to one expression system depends on strength of the promoter and inducer or repressor concentration.
Logic for toggle switch gene synthetic network was described in picture below.

Brown,2008,Team:Brown#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," applications for our electrical reporting system and our auto-lysis cassette:
The electrical reporting system could provide a new and accurate means of measuring degree of protein expression.  The relative change in current would directly correlate to the amount of protein expression.  Unlike GFP, for example, which is a more boolean reporter of protein expression, our novel reporting system would be a quantitative and thus more specific method of reporting.
The auto-lysis device could have several applications, some of which are listed below:
Use as a ""kill-switch""
Keep all or certain cells engineered with the lysis cassette under an inducible promoter (ex. pBAD) so that if protein expression begins going out of control in a system, some arabinose can be added to the cells and they will kill themselves.
Use as an antibiotic
Bacterial cells can be engineered to produce constitutively lysozyme and also engineered with the lysis cassette under an inducible promoter.  When the cells are induced to lyse, they will release lysozyme into the surrounding solution, killing other bacteria.
Possible use in biofilms

Goettingen,2015,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and restricted with KpnI and SacI.
To build a component for our Flexosome, we decided to fuse pBAD_RFP with the ACEL (Acetivibrio cellulolyticus) dockerin. Both components, restricted with KpnI and SacI and purified with the PEQLAB peqGOLD Gel Extraction Kit were ligated by the T4 ligation system. After transformation into E.coli TOP10 and over-night incubation colonies were picked, plasmids extracted with the QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, restricted with EcoRI and examined in a gel (Fig.3).
Fig.3) Once restriction control showed the correct band height, pBAD_RFP_ACEL was sent for sequencing by the G2L laboratory.
 
RESULTS
Sanger sequencing showed correct sequences for the Flexosome bit pBAD_RFP_ACEL.
 
MICROSCOPY
To check the activity of RFP, an induction series with 0,2%, 2% and 5% L-Arabinose in the cell culture medium was prepared. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with the RFP DsRed filter (excitation at 536 nm, emission at 582 nm). Unfortunately no fluorescence could be detected throughout the whole project with different constructs. Neither in the pJET_RFP_3, nor in the pBAD constructs (pBAD_RFP_3 and pBAD_RFP_ACEL) induced with 0,2%, 2% and 5% L-Arabinose in the medium. Since the DNA sequences have been confirmed to be correct by Sanger sequencing it might be a problem of expression.
 
FUTURE PLANS
In future we want to exchange our vector system (pET100 instead of pBAD) to ensure that pBAD is not somehow interfering with our chosen E. coli strain.
Esterase and Phosphatase
Phosphatase and Esterase
Esterase was amplified from pET101_E064 and phosphatase from pTOPOXL_PLP07 by PCR for each enzyme (Fig.1). Both plasmids were given to us by the Applied     and Genomic Microbiology department. Primers contained restriction sites KpnI and SacI for esterase and XhoI and PstI for the phosphatase in order to make     them compatible for insertion into the multiple cloning site of the pBAD vector. The genes for these two enzymes had been found in screenings of     metagenomic"

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#EColi_-_-_TEXT.html," our design and confirms that the cellulose production operon has been successfully refactored and transferred into Escherichia coli.
In order to gain a better understanding of the activity of the Acs elements in Escherichia coli, it was of interest to explore whether the AcsAB element alone would be enough to achieve cellulose production. AcsAB is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and transports the growing polymer through the membrane as it attaches the glucose monomers in the cytoplasm.  In the absence of AcsC and AcsD, no cellulose can be secreted into the environment and as a result, it was assumed that it would instead become accumulated in the cell’s periplasm. For this reason, during characterization we required sonication in order to get the cellulose (if any at all) out of the cells.
To widen our screening, we set up induced samples and uninduced controls and assayed samples at different temperatures (30°C versus 37°C) and different conditions (shaking versus static) in the presence or absence of 1% D-Glucose. Furthermore, 2 Biological replicates were assayed, and technical triplicates were also set up during plate reading to support any statistically relevant findings. Although we expected no cellulose to be accumulating in the medium, we still analysed all fractions originating throughout the procedure: LB fractions, soluble fractions and non-soluble fractions (called membrane fractions throughout this study).
All fractions were incubated in the presence of Congo Red (as described in Materials and Methods) and were later inoculated into a 96-well plate for absorbance measurements at 490nm. Free Congo Red has a maximal absorption at such wavelength. By setting up a control sample, containing solvent (PBS)+ Congo Red, it is possible to measure the total absorbance of the molecule whilst free in solution. When cellulolytic samples are incubated in the presence of Congo Red, less azodye molecules becomes available in the medium due to binding, hence absorbance levels will decrease. The total Congo Red bound will equal the absorbance of Congo Red Control minus the absorbance of our samples of interest. This approach gives you an idea of the amount of Congo Red that may have bound to the cellulositic fibres, but it does not provide exact values of cellulose present.
Figure 17: LB fraction - Congo Red Binding
As expected, LB fractions all presented similar, non-cellulolytic composition and hence displayed no changes in absorbance, indicating no CR binding.

    We have acknowledged that one Ab with wAg + one Ag coming into one Ab with Ag and one wAg is irreversible and the amount of this kind of changes is related to the amount of Ab with wAg(x2) , the amount of Ag (x1) and time.
According to Volterra Model,we can know that ‘dx1/dt=dx2/dt=-k*x1*x2’.
k is a regular value which is related to affinity(f) between one Ab with wAg and one Ag which is defined as p,so we can attain an another equation:’k=pf’.
According to the first equation above,we can know that ‘x2=x1+m’.
We assume that the inchoate value of x1 is x0.
‘dx1/dt=dx2/dt=-k*x1*x2’
’k=pf’
‘x2=x1+m’
‘x1(0)=x0’
And the program code of matlab is:
dsolve('Dx1=-p*f*x1*(x1+m)','x1(0)=x0','t')
ans =
m/(exp(m*(log((m + x0)/x0)/m + f*p*t)) - 1)
x1= m/(exp(m*(log((m + x0)/x0)/m + f*p*t)) - 1)
We can define the extend of combination as E.
‘E=(x0-x1)/x1’ which is simplified as ‘E=1- m/((exp(m*(log((m + x0)/x0)/m + f*p*t)) - 1)*x0)’

Future Directions
Once we have created enough unique origins of replications, we can use the arsenal of reporters we have in our kit, which include Blue Chromoprotein (BCP), Pink Chromoprotein (PiCP), Purple Chromoprotein (PCP), Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), E2 Crimson (E2C), Red Chromoprotein (RCP), and Green Chromoprotein (GCP). In theory, we could test 7 different origins of replication in parallel in our organism of interest and be able to visually screen for which ORI(s) work with the host's cellular machinery.

S. pneumoniae σx Promoters Module
Overview
The activity of Com-Box promoter is turned on by a specific sigma factor that is produced by a regulatory gene comX. The σx will bind to the Com-Box promoter region and activate gene expression. σx serve as an inducer with high specificity as it binds to an area of several specific 8 base pairs (TACGAATA) on the Com-Box promoter. This σx-Com-Box system could be used as a highly specific reporting system in our S.pneumonia detection platform. However in nature, ComX protein will be degraded by ClpXP enzyme which exists in E. coli and some other bacteria. Hence, to ensure the induction of Com-Box promoter by σx, ComW protein is needed as it functions to protect σx from being degraded by ClpXP. ComW protein will be degraded instead, increasing the amount of σx produced.
Construct
The three main components of the construct are comX gene, comW gene, and Com-Box promoter. We assembled comX and Com-Box promoter in one vector plasmid, while comW in a different plasmid. The system will be fused with a tagging protein and a reporting protein. Tagging protein is essential for detecting the σx and ComW protein expression by means of western blot. Reporting protein which is fluorescence protein is needed for reporting purpose, hence σx-Com-Box system could serve as a specific reporting system that will be useful for many synthetic constructs. σx generator and Com-Box promoter construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one plasmid.
σx Generator construct ( BBa_K1379006 ) and comW construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for σx generator construct and comW construct"

Our iGEM project is the result of seven months of team effort. Every member of our team has different qualities, which lead to division of the tasks. After finishing different subjects everything was discussed plenary, so everybody's point of view was integrated. We decided to do as much as possible with the team and minimally rely help from non-members of the team. The research that we conducted was based on previous findings of the Molecular Microbial Physiology Lab. In the table below the different subject are displayed with the members who were responsible for this and at the bottom of the page are some people we want to thank.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Press_-_-_TEXT.html," on, but most bioprinting materials, or bio-inks, aren’t strong enough to hold their structures without support. A team formed from students at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich and the Technical University of Munich, however, has developed what they hope will be a breakthrough in bioprinting. Team biotINK, formed for the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), didn’t even require special machinery for their biotINK printing process – just a simple Ultimaker 2+ 3D printer.
The biotINK team hacked their Ultimaker printer by replacing the extruder with a 3D printed syringe pump and programming it to extrude cells with millimeter-level precision. Just about any desktop printer can be inexpensively modified with their method, the team says (you can find detailed instructions on how to do so on Hackaday). Once they had a working bioprinter, the team set about developing a bio-ink that was not only strong enough to grow without a scaffold, but had the properties necessary for the creation of complex tissues with precisely positioned cells and multiple cell types.
The material was devised by combining biotin, also known as vitamin B7, with streptavidin, a protein naturally attracted to biotin molecules that acts as a super-strong binding agent.
The idea is for the streptavidin and biotin to polymerize and form a 3D cellular structure without the need for a scaffold of any kind. Eliminating the scaffold, not to mention being able to use a standard desktop printer to extrude the material, could make 3D bioprinting dramatically less expensive than it is now, as well as faster and simpler.
Of course, no form of 3D bioprinting is exactly simple, but the students have carried out a number of experiments with their Ultimaker-turned-bioprinter and biotin/streptavidin ink, and have gotten some very promising results. One discovery they made was that the viability of cells printed with their technology was close to 100%, as opposed to about 85% with standard inkjet bioprinters and 40-80% with microextrusion bioprinters. After the iGEM competition, which culminates today in a massive showcase of the work of over 300 teams, the biotINK team hopes to meet with investors to discuss a possible new business venture. Armed with a functional prototype and a business plan, the team believes that they could make a real impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Discuss"

We will begin manipulating the Aspen Plus model and Economic analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) .
Plan for continuing codon optimization project is supported by the advisers. Clay updated notebook online as well as the document diagramming the design process of the project.More RBS calculations run. Problem with RBS library calculator at this point is that using no initial condition (only N's in the  constraints field, followed by Pst1) the calculator does not mutate the Pst1 site that needs to be part of the dRBS, but yields very low TIR. Using a strong initial condition, followed by Pst1, the calculator yields acceptable TIR but mutates Pst1. Inserting Pst1 into these calculations after the fact, and then using the ""evaluate"" function of the calculator shows that TIR drops precipitously. Calculations were run in single RBS forward engineering mode to determine max TIR that can be found using only N's and Pst1. Culture of pFTV harboring cells inoculated.

Ashlee performed a transformation of Plasmid 1 into DH10B Escherichia coli electrocompetent cells via electroporation and plated this on Kanamycin plates. This was done to regenerate our Plasmid 1 so we can digest it and insert the dCas9 and Lambda Red Recombinase systems. She updated the Notebook and Project pages, and is constructing figures for her design process. She is having trouble with ""div"" functions in HTML and is consequently frustrated. We met with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard for our biweekly iGEM meeting and Ashlee presented the work on the website, presentation and Emily's demonstration idea for the Center for Science and the Schools, and current progress on the project.
Culture of pFTV harboring cells plasmid harvested, much better concentration of pFTV measured than before. Inverse PCR conducted again, this time using optimized protocol and 3 tubes. Lab meeting. Sam did gel extraction, purification. Seems like strong bands were observed, and at the correct places. This is a big success.

Investigated and Researched Systems
Dormancy System
Utilised by the energy storing unit, the dormancy system can reduce metabolism during times of the day with no solar energy available, e.g. at nighttime. We encountered a few challenges during the assembly and optimisation of the dormancy system. However, through modeling we obtained vital knowledge on how to regulate the system. If you are interested, you can read more about the work performed on the light-dependent dormancy system .
Carbon Fixation
We received the required parts from the Bielefeld 2014 iGEM team and began assembling the parts into one fully functional BioBrick.  However, we encountered some trouble cloning these parts. You can give it a go anyways, or maybe even try to redo the carbon fixation by using a system from a different organism. Regrettably, we eventually had to let go of this system, so we could focus on other components of the PowerLeaf. If you are interested, you can read more about the work we did regarding the carbon fixation .
Cellulose Biosynthesis and Secretion
These parts were retrieved from the 2014 Imperial College iGEM team . Assembly of these long BioBricks emerged to be troublesome, which regularly occurs when cloning long sequences of DNA. Thus, this part could be the very thing to improve, as it is a rather central part of the system. If you are interested, you can read more about our work on the cellulose biosynthesis and secretion .
Cellulose Breakdown
Employed by the energy converting unit, this system degrades cellulose to glucose, from which electrons could be retrieved. After extensive work the system showed promising results as our bacteria were able to grow on cellobiose. If you are interested, you can read more about the work we did regarding the cellulases .

With better equipment and well-experienced crew members in our lab, we helped them do the measurement and obtained fantastic experimental results for their thermosensors in vitro.
Ten plasmids sent to us were expressed in vitro under three temperature conditions: 29°C, 37°C and 42°C. Using microplate reader, we read the relative fluorescence intensity of each group of expressed protein, and received protein expression quantity under each temperature conditions for each plasmid according to the standard curve of concentration-fluorescence intensity. Eventually, we drew the relative fluorescence intensity-temperature plots of different plasmids, and the protein expression quantity-temperature plots of different plasmids. According to these data, we concluded that these ten plasmids have a relatively good expressing condition in vitro. With the rising of environment temperature, some of these plasmids showed the elevated protein expression level as expected.

MOOC
Impressed by the quick development and popularity of MOOCs, we decided to have a further look at this modern massive education tool.
Key elements of MOOCs
What is a MOOC ?
The word was coined in 2008 in the United States after the first experiment with a course on “connectivism and connective knowledge” given by George Siemens and Stephen Downes.
MOOC is the acronym for Massive Open Online Course. It is a modern e-learning method where attendants register to online classes provided by a teacher to a community of students.
MOOCs are “Massive” because of the unlimited number of attendants who can potentially attend the Course. The first MOOC of wide scale dates back to 2011 by Sebastian Thrun, teacher at Stanford and gathered 160 000 participants.
According to a book written by Jean Charles Pomerol, Yves Epelbon and Claire Thoury, MOOCs are “Open” because there are no pre-requirements to follow a MOOC and anyone with an internet access could have access to MOOCs. However, “Open” doesn’t mean that MOOCs are always free nor “Open source”. A MOOC can be proposed to online participants while they cannot download the content or software.
What differentiate MOOCs from previous learning methods, such as online videos ?
The key element is the live interaction between the teacher and participants. Thanks to this component, the teacher can incorporate to his speech questions received from his online students as if it took place in a conventional classroom.
A quick development
MOOCs is thus a new way of spreading"
SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html," which they have the chance to perform sooner or later, such as helping to terminate starvation in the third world, or for instance – like the project Team SDU is working on – simply ensuring people a healthier, better life. It would be very easy to argue about the statutory assessment of genetic engineering simply from a rational, economist point of view, to compare the benefits and costs (in this case the risks) and afterwards decide whether it should be allowed to use these techniques and products or not.  Reality is a bit more complicated, we have to deal with the ethical questions and consequences of genetic engineering, which is the other very important field of criticism towards GMOs. This paper will demonstrate the current legislation on GMOs in the European Union in a mostly practical way to show the actual difficulties that a GMO producer has to deal with compared to the general attitude of legislation in the United States without being detailed about the ethical issues because of the boundaries of length and topic of this paper. However, I do have to mention the connection between law and ethics, which mainly belong to the fields of Philosophy of Law, and therefore is not subject of the following pages. To briefly demonstrate this connection, I would like to recall the legal positivist Jellinek’s definition of law: “Das Recht ist nichts anderes als das ethische Minimum.”  which means law is nothing else, but the ethical minimum (standard). Of course, he did not mean it in the way that laws would reflect the ethical standards of legislators, and neither do I intend to express such a meaning. However, this quote can give the reader a good starting point of view to think about the questions discussed below.
2. General attitudes towards GMOs
For the better understanding of current rules, a quick look should be taken at the history of jurisdiction on GMOs, environmental and health risks. Vogel and Lynch gave a complex overview on this context in 2001.  They demonstrated that a grave change can be recognized in the approach towards these techniques both in the US and the EU in the 1980s, but the difference between their directions did not disappear, in fact they almost replaced each other. As they write about the 1960s and 1970s: “As a general rule American regulatory politics tended to be more contentious, confrontational and adversarial than in Europe. There was less public trust in government officials and more widespread public skepticism about the benefits of new technologies.”  Nowadays the situation seems to be the exact opposite: there is a lot stricter and more restrictive jurisdiction in Europe, while the American rules along with the public opinion tend to"
UPF_CRG_Barcelona,2018,Team:UPF CRG Barcelona#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we attended the MeetUP held by the Madrid-OLM iGEM team. There we had the           opportunity to attend to well-known scientist speeches such as Victor de Lorenzo. We also did some           sight-seeing around the city and share experiences between the teams.
Mediterrenean MeetUp organized by Aix-Marseille
From the 9th to 10th August we went to Marseille to attempt to the Summer Mediterranean MeetUp. It was a fantastic experience where we could share our projects with other French teams, prepared ourselves for the           Giant Jamboree and talk with professors from the Aix-Marseille university. The MeetUp included an elevator           pitch, a poster presentation and also an after-igem workshop.
Other Collborations
Collaborating with Madrid-OLM
As our neighbour team, we have been collaborating often with OLM-Madrid iGEM team. They attempt to our           MeetUp ant there they held a very interesting workshop. The idea was to share and discuss about the problems           and inconvenients all the igem teams have suffered in Spain. Therefore, this guide could be useful for future           iGEM generations in order to know in advanced what they will face and, in this way, find an easier way to           solve it.
In order to build this guide, OLM-Madrid team prepared a previous outline that was discussed with the rest           of the teams. Afterwards, we split every point of the outline in a glass and every team could write their           contribution using different colored pens. This was a visual way to share experiences and doubts that every           iGEM team had suffered and a great opportunity to find a way to solve them all together.
On the other hand, they also helped us providing with some DNA constructs and we attempt to their MeetUp           sharing experiences and having the opportunity to listen to great scientists, for example Victor De Lorenzo.
Collaborating with BioIQS-Barcelona
This year Barcelona is presenting two teams to iGEM: our team formed by undergraduate students and the           Bio-IQS team, formed by Master students. Following the iGEM spirit we collaborate together. First of all,           they helped us giving us the transformed bacteria for the interLab study because we had some issues when           growing them. They also attended our spanish MeetUp. Finally, we helped them performing PCRs with the           saliva of a celiac person in order to have more data for their project and test the reproducibility of their            protocol.

Background
Despite the science involved in iGEM, our team also recognized the human practices portion as well. Members of our team participated in a variety of activities to both gain awareness from our community by sharing about our project, and also to gain insight from various individuals. This information guided the next steps that were taken in our project.
Members of our team worked in a variety of activities including public engagement, a survey, and conducting interviews. We also recognized that since our idea of increasing the efficiency of blood coagulation has never before been attempted by any other iGEM team before, to create a ""Best Blood Practices"" with the hopes of assisting future iGEM teams. The knowledge gained from working with the blood will be invaluable to future generations of iGEMers."

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#TALEsJournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"ALEs demonstrate polarity. In other words, they interact more strongly with DNA at the N terminus compared to the C terminus (Meckler et al., 2013). Secondly, the Thymidine nucleotide at the zero repeat is very important to the binding affinity of the TALE (Meckler et al., 2013). Thirdly, the binding affinity of TALE varies based on the types of the nucleotides present in its target site. The relative affinities are: NG(1)>NN (0.18)!HD (0.16) "" NI (0.0016)>NK (0.00016) (Meckler et al., 2013). All these points must be carefully considered while designing the TALE to maximize its binding affinity and specificity.
The four TALEs designed by Slovenia 2012 iGEM team, were ordered from the registry (TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) and TALE D ( BBa_K782005 )). Primers were designed to incorporate the the target sequences of TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) ([A] and [B]) in the RFP generator. This plasmid will be used as a target sequence. Primers were also designed that incorporate selected point mutations of [A] and [B] into a biobrick. Once these plasmids are made they will be used to determine how the TALEs affinity is altered by mutations. In addition, two other TALEs were ordered from the the authors of the Meckler et al. 2013 paper.
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
We continued our literature search for a unique and stable pathogenic E. coli marker for the TALEs to bind to. Potential pathogenic O157:H7 E. coli markers: stx1, stx2 (Yoshitomi et al., 2012), uidA (Yoshitomi et al., 2003 and Feng et al., 1994), eaeA, hly, rbfE (Fortin et al., 2000), and Z3276 (Li & Chen, 2012). However, BLAST searches determined that the use of only one 18 bp sequence is not sufficiently specific and sensitive to detect pathogenic markers. Should we continue to search for only one marker or more than one or expand the detection to any toxic Shiga producing strains?

Model
Biological modelling is a major component in synthetic biology that uses experimental data to visually communicate efficiency and yields of the system in question. This is especially important in modified systems, such as our photosynthetic, hydrogen producing E. coli.
The first steps to engineering an eco-friendly, sustainable hydrogen fuel cell was to genetically modify the chlorophyll a pathway, which could be used by photosystem II (PSII) to absorb energy from sunlight and transfer it to a hydrogenase for hydrogen production in E. coli.
Fig 1. Project overview: PPIX precursor showing the changes undergone to form final product of the first pathway; chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a absorbs photons from sunlight, providing energy to photosystem II to split water molecules to release O2, hydrogen ions and electrons. The latter two products are then diverged from photosystem I to a hydrogenase that then uses this energy to create hydrogen gas.
The model we created was based off enzyme kinetic data found in literature, and from previous Macquarie iGEM wiki’s. The enzyme kinetic model developed by the 2015 Macquarie iGEM team took the 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) precursor and modelled the pathway of its intermediates up to the production of protoporphyrinogen IX (PPIX). This year, the 2016 Macquarie iGem team have furthered this model and taken it through to the production of chlorophyll a (see figure 1). Matlab was the program chosen to create our model. Further models  could enable us to optimise the hydrogen production yield."
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Inhibitor_-_-_TEXT.html," Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of LacI which can express a lot of LacI inhibitor to repress the lac promoter completely and has a low or zero background expression levels. Thus using lacIq as inhibitor is a more efficient way to control the expression. Tac promoter is a functional hybrid promoter composed of different promoters from trp and lac operons and could only be regulated by lacI inhibitor.
CI-pR
CI inhibitor found in the phage lambda is a notable example of the level of control possible over gene expression by a very simple system. In the phage lambda, the lambda repressor is a self-assembling dimer also known as the CI protein.
The key regulator in the λ genetic switch is the CI protein, which binds to the OR and OL regions of the λ genome to repress the lytic promoters during lysogeny. Cooperative binding of a pair of CI dimers at two of the three CI operators at OR (OR1 and OR2) represses PR, and similar binding at two of the three operators at OL (OL1 and OL2) represses the PL promoter. Binding of CI to OR2 also stimulates the intrinsically weak promoter for the cI gene, PRM, so that in the lysogenic state CI positively regulates its own synthesis and the presence of CI is maintained. Switching from lysogeny to lytic development, called lysogenic induction or prophage induction, occurs on activation of the host SOS system in response to DNA damage.
TetR-pTet
Tetracycline (tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance.
Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial ribosome and halting protein synthesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the expression of resistance to tetracycline (tc) gene is regulated by Tet Repressor Protein, call tetR. Regulation of expression of the ptet is mediated by Tet repressor, which binds to two operator (tetO) sites. TetR is used in artificially engineered gene regulatory networks because of its capacity for fine regulation. In the absence of tc, basal expression of TetR is very low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc through a positive feedback mechanism.
Application in our project
In order to sense the number of plasmids, we use different kinds of inhibitor as the signal. In host cells, the concentration of inhibitor increases while plasmids’ number rises. Once the number of plasmids"

Dongyu Fan
Moring Dr. Jiang, thank you for accept our interview. We all know that, in recent years, bio-pharmaceutical security has been subject to the general interest. We've learned that the Experimental Animal Center are already passed the identification of United States AAALAC Certification Center on safety evaluation of drugs. So we hope we can gain an objective and comprehensive assessment of our project and are eager for valuable advice through this interview.
Lingyun Zhu
Moring Dr. Jiang! First of all, I would like to introduce our project. What we are actually doing is using synthetic biology to build a DNA support system. This system is in microorganisms so that we can increase efficiency of regionalization reaction through metabolic engineering of multi-enzymatic reaction.
As far as I understand, metabolic engineering is similar with biochemical reactions.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
Could you evaluate the safety of our reconstruction project of the microbial?
Our security assessment is mainly for drugs, such as the safety of medicines produced by the bioactive enzymes, which means we need a specific bioactive substance such as enzymes to conduct the safety assessment. Your project is more like a methodology study which does not have direct relation to medicine, so I can only make a safety assessment of potential safety hazard instead of a detailed one.

What"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"ells are then reintroduced into the patient to recognize and kill cancer cells. . If a suitable scaffold receptor exists in bacteria it may be possible to develop a family of Bacterial antigen receptors (BARs). BARs would not be a treatment but a detection system for biomarkers in blood or urine samples.
In prokaryotes, two-component regulatory systems are a common mechanism for signal transduction through the membrane. Most often, a membrane-bound histidine kinase activates in response to changes in the environment. This activates response regulators by phosphorylation. One such system in Escherichia coli is the receptor EnvZ and its response regulator OmpR. The EnvZ/OmpR system regulates different expression of the outer membrane porin proteins OmpF and OmpC.
EnvZ as scaffold for chimeric receptors
The function of the periplasmic region of EnvZ is poorly understood and its ligand is not known. However, the region responsible for signal transduction has been characterized and is located between the transmembrane helix and the histidine kinase domain. This region, known as the HAMP-domain, is present in many two-component regulatory system receptors. . EnvZ stood out as an interesting candidate for BAR since it has been used for chimeric receptors before. Most successful examples are chimeras of receptors that both have HAMP domains, but in at least one case this was not required for signal transduction. In 2005, Christopher A. Voigt et al. made a light sensitive EnvZ fusion with the photoreceptor cph1 which does not contain a HAMP domain, proving that such chimeras are possible.
A common strategy for chimeric receptors is to characterize many possible constructs.  While it is difficult to find a functioning construct, recent research by Roger Draheim et al. has shown that receptors with the HAMP-domain can be tuned by moving aromatic residues next to the HAMP domain. By using this “aromatic tuning” it is sometimes possible to find a sweet spot where conformational change in the binding domain results in signal transduction. This recent research points towards EnvZ as a good candidate for chimeric receptors in synthetic biology.
Using Affibody Molecules to bind biomarkers
To use EnvZ to recognize protein biomarkers we had to find a suitable binding domain. Both the C and N terminals of EnvZ are located in the cytoplasm, so a binding domain could not just be fused to the end of EnvZ. This meant that we needed to find a binding domain that was likely to be stable, fold well and"

Meet Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).

Introduction
Needless to say, in research, we have to cooperate with others materially and informationally. Otherwise, we cannot expect any development in our research, because working alone only leads us to a deadlock.  This is also true to our iGEM activities. However, since iGEM is an organization by only undergraduates, it is difficult to collaborate with the exterior, compared with the general laboratories which have relation with academic meetings. Therefore we face some difficulties which arise when managing the laboratory only by undergraduates. Moreover, we often face difficulties caused by lack of sufficient experience. Because of these special situations, it is difficult for iGEM teams to ask for help to other organizations. However, problems peculiar to iGEM teams are easy to be understood by other teams. Therefore, we iGEM teams have to connect with each other positively. By asking other teams for help, we can smoothly carry out our research, and by helping out other teams, we can reconfirm some problems. Cooperating with other iGEM teams carrying the same problem leads to a hiring the quality of our research.
Support
iGEM has been developing and the number of the teams participating in iGEM has been increasing. There are new teams from many countries every year. The more teams in iGEM, the more viewpoints we get.  By helping each other, we can get out of experimental difficulties and our projects can reach a higher degree of perfection.
However, managing a team by only undergraduates is not easy, because we have to operate the laboratories by ourselves regardless of our knowledge. So, newly joining is very difficult without other team’s help.  Therefore, this year, iGEM Kyoto helped Biwako_Nagahama to establish their team, and succeeded in increasing the number of iGEM teams. We have helped this new team in the ways listed below.

    The following is our main menu for game pattern. By choosing ‘One Player’ you can play with the virtual player AI (artificial intelligence). We have designed smart algorithm to help you computer think up game strategies like we human do and AI can initialize its bacteria after your action at once. If you choose ‘Two Players’, then you can play with your friends or initialize both sides yourself.
    Each battalion has the same amount of bacteria.You can initialize your bacterial camp at the beginning of the game before you click the button ’start’.
    By click on different bacteria characters you can initialize them on the round Petri dishes. Different colors represent different kind of bacteria and the green box around the farmers surround the area of nutrition they can support so don’t put your bacteria out of green boxes.
    The number following ‘total’ tells us the amount of live bacteria in each bacteria troop. At the bottom of the picture we can see the ‘remaining chances’ we have to initialize bacteria. The days which bacteria have growing for and the coordinate point of where you mouse click are at the upper right corner.
    Now we can learn more about the toolbar.
    After you finish initializing all the bacteria, clicking the ‘start’ button can run the game. If you click on the button ‘restart’, all the progress can be cleared. By clicking the button ‘model’, you can choose again whether you want to play with AI or not. Now let us click the button ‘setting’ and we can see the following pop-up:
    The first option line is for setting background music volume. The middle line decides the volume of bacteria actor's lines and after you click on each character, you can hear them speaking. By dragging the last line’s option button you can change the amount of bacteria of each side.

NTU-Singapore,2018,Team:NTU-Singapore#RNA_-_-_TEXT.html,"7) have demonstrated its consistently robust knockdown of mRNA in mammalian cell and engineered a dCas13b-ADAR2DD fusion protein to achieve effective site-specific A-to-I editing on mRNA, called the REPAIR (RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement) system. We find their work a great inspiration for our project and we decided to characterize this construct further. 
With a basis of comparison established with the REPAIR system, we were also curious about the recently identified Cas13d system (Konermann. et. Al, 2018). With the average size of just 930 amino acids, it is the smallest Class 2 CRISPR effector ever being characterized in mammalian cells. Despite its small size, one nuclease-dead variant derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002 (also known as CasRx)  has demonstrated alternative splicing modulation in vivo with high efficiency and specificity. Hence, we believe it would be interesting and meaningful to compare its A-to-I editing activities when Cas13d is fused with the same ADAR2DD domain with that of REPAIR.
Experimental Design
Based on Zhang et. al., 2017, we have developed two methods to characterize the functionality and important parameters in designing its guide RNA in mediating A-to-I editing activities, namely by a luciferase reporter assay and sequencing of mRNA of the endogenous target. In both of our experiments, plasmids coding for dPspCas13b-ADAR2DD and dCas13d-ADAR2DD fusion proteins and different RNA guides to investigate the different targeting parameters were cloned into mammalian expression vectors and transfected into HEK293FT cells. Other important sequences for their functions like the nuclear export signals (NES) were also cloned together with the construct.
 Luciferase Reporter Assay
In the luciferase reporter assay, plasmid coding for a modified Renilla luciferase was constructed, where a guanosine is replaced by an adenosine at the codon of a key residue, resulting in a nonsense mutation. As such, A-to I editing activities on the mRNA transcript by the dCas-ADAR2DD constructs will functionally restore the sequence and restores the luciferase protein back to the wildtype and allow for the quantification of editing activity by the Rluc luminescence. In our experiment, two parameters, namely spacer length and regions of coverage on the target were characterized in mediating A-to-I RNA editing.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," each bucket to find out the result.
     There are also games to attract more people. It’s a shame that we weren’t able to elaborate the process of our project to every participant due to the chaos, but, it is sure that we’ve not only increased public’s attention on both our project and IGEM but also successfully introduced more people into the domain of gene engineering. 
Here's the result:
Here are the two opinions after the events :
Student A :
This time, the member of Mingdao iGEM 2017 hold a activity - drink sampling, which done the survey and the endorsement at the same time. I think the activity is great because the main goal of iGEM is to satisfied people's requirements after finding it, and the objective of genetic engineering is to make people's life more convenient. By the way, the drink taste better with sugar in most people's opinion.
Student B :
Although I’m not one of the members of the IGEM team, I still learn a lot from the course concerning this project. During the preparation, I saw some previous souvenir, which makes me wonder what kind of surprise they will bring us this time. First, they asked us to drink some beverages. Some were normal and some were sugar-free. This really confused me. Then, they asked us which one we preferred. I thought that they were doing some research to study the dietary habit of Mingdao students. Though didn’t participate in the game they play later on, I could surely feel the hard work they put into carrying out this project. You guys really did a good job. I sincerely hope that this activity can benefit your experiment. But, I suggest that next time the activity could be more simplified, or you can try walking instead of standing at a particular place!

Testing Done by William and Mary
In return for the testing conducted by our team, William and Mary agreed to alter our copper biosensor part (BBa_K2477013) for use with their mf-Lon protease system. After sending our part to them, William and Mary created several variations on the biosensor by adding different protein degradation tags onto the end of the RFP gene. These protein degradation tags are termed A through F. By incorporating these modified parts into cells along with their mf-Lon system, they were able to show that gene expression speed could be altered. The results for the different tags they tested with our part can be seen in the graphs below.
Normalized Fluorescence of Protein Degradation Tagged Copper Biosensor Collected Using FACS. Time course assay of Copper Sensor pdt parts, values are steady state normalized geometric means of three biological replicates taken on the FL3 channel. Shaded region represents one geometric std above and below mean.
Fluorescence of Protein Degradation Tagged Copper Biosensor Collected Using Plate Reader. Functional plate reader assay of Copper Sensor pdt parts, values are geometric means of the fluorescence/OD600 of three biological replicates, excitation/emission 584/612.
The first graph above shows that, when induced with 1 mM copper, the modified copper biosensor constructs are capable of reaching steady protein levels at a faster rate than the original copper biosensor. While the increase in speed/stability is not drastic, it should be enough to improve the part in terms its original purpose. With the system being somewhat faster and more consistent, it will allow the part to be used in an educational setting where it can serve as a demonstration of synthetic biology's potential. For more on the potential uses of our copper biosensor, please refer to our metal detection page.
The second figure above consists of the plate reader data from a fluorescence time course of the modified copper biosensors induced with .5 mM copper and .01 mM IPTG to induce mf-Lon expression. Copper induction occurred about 240 minutes into the time course while IPTG induction occurred around 360 minutes into the time course. It can be seen that all variants reached steady state approximately 120-150 minutes after this. The final fluorescence levels vary across the different constructs showing the versatility of the system.
Collaboration Conclusions
Overall, the collaboration between the UMaryland and William and Mary iGEM teams has been very successful. We were able to help characterize their project while they were able to improve the function of one of our parts. This mutually beneficial relationship helped to further"
