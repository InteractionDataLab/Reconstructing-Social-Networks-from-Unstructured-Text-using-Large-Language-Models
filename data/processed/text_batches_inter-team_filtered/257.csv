Overview
 In Amazon, mercury (Hg) is broadly used in mines during gold amalgamation, and it’s considered one of the major pollutants on this region. On amazon rives, there is about 3.000 tons of mercury and can be found in it different forms. This metal has as main toxic characteristic bioaccumulation. This can be explained by metal attraction to organic groups which cause the element conversion to its most toxic form: methylmercury.  Considering that riverine population has as main protein source, fish consumption, they are exposed to high Hg concentration, having several effects on health as: abdominal pain, diarrhea, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative and kidney diseases, as well as psychological and psychomotor impairments. (Biondo, 2008)
 On environment, the successive transformations on Hg forms, represent risks not just to “superior” but also to microorganisms (Neves Pinto, 2004). However, it is known that some bacteria have resistance to mercury, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas putida, Cupriavidus metallidurans and Entereobacter (Giovanella et al., 2010). Those bacteria present bioremediation characteristics, by convertion of Hg2+ and CH3Hg available on aquatic environments, into Hg0, less toxic form of this metal (volatile at room temperature). (Biondo, 2008).
 To reduce environmental problems caused by mercury, this project aims to use those bacteria skills, to construct a treatment station for effluents contaminated with Hg, through synthetic biology. The system will be composed by four tanks, with bacteria capable of: on tank 1, to detect Hg; on tank 2, for Hg bioaccumulation; on tank 3, to volatilize Hg (that will be captured and precipitated after); and finally on tank 4, will again detect Hg to analyze the system yield. In case that the effluent still contaminated, it will return to"
WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#index_-_-_TEXT.html," that has many genetic tools, Escherichia coli, so that we can learn how to give single cell organisms, and eventually chloroplasts the ability to create their own nitrogen fertilizer.                              Diazotrophic (organisms that fix nitrogen) cyanobacteria such Nostoc Punctiforme or Anabaena use heterocysts (specialized nitrogen fixing cells) to create a mini-anaerobic environment to aid nitrogen fixation. However, Cyanothece 51142, a non-heterocyst, fixes nitrogen in the same cell as photosynthesis by relying on a circadian metabolic process, when there is less oxygen byproduct from photosynthesis. This process is both fascinating and necessary since the key enzyme in nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase, is poisoned by oxygen. Our goal this summer is to engineer the regulation of the proteins necessary for nitrogen fixation so that they are highly repressed when activated by broad spectrum light (such as the sun), and are highly active when there is no light around, mimicking the cycle where photosynthesis occurs during the day and nitrogen fixation occurs at night.

They said that the largest benefit of the production of protein in cell-free system is that purifying produced protein is much easier than protein produced in vivo such as in E.coli. Also, they taught us how to meet criteria for iGEM, since this is the second time for us to participate in iGEM Jamboree and we were not so sure about the criteria. On the other hand, we introduced our project to them and gave advice about the methods of efficient cloning.
PI of iGEM Gifu, Prof. Iwahashi was once studying nitrogen fixation. So, they offered us a scientific article written by him. Referring to that paper, we discussed our project, including nitrogenase, culture conditions, cloning methods with them. It was very meaningful and productive collaboration. Thanks! iGEM Gifu!

With Street Bio at EMW (East Meets West - a hub for technology, arts, and                             activism), we explore the interface between engineered biology and the street—the people,                             culture, and products that will shape how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday                             lives.                             The concept was conceived in Summer 2015 by Dr. David Kong, a graduate of the MIT Media Lab                             who                             currently conducts synthetic biology, microfluidics, and digital fabrication research at                             MIT’s                             Lincoln Laboratory. Over the year students and professionals have joined the movement to                             create                             a biohacking space that was much needed in Cambridge.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," concerning health and safety. Additionally there was a tour of our own and adjacent labs with a supervisor. Instructions were given by a supervisor when using new equipment and techniques. Hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals and substances were avoided whenever possible. In this case these chemicals could not be substituted, safety equipment such as special gloves were used. Furthermore, to prevent any risk, the team members worked exclusively in groups of at least two members.
Sterile Work
To keep our lab sterile, working spaces and necessary equipment were cleaned with 70 % ethanol. Ethanol is easily flammable and was therefore used carefully and only for small areas. To avoid contamination of our cultures and for selection, antibiotics were added to the used media with the note that they can cause health problems in large amounts. Furthermore, they can cause undesirable resistances in bacteria and thus were used only if necessary. Ethidium bromide was used for gel electrophoresis with special care because of its DNA-intercalating and cancerogenic properties. Use of UV-light was necessary for visualization of DNA in agarose gels.
Bioethics
Bioethics was a very important topic for the team. Working with bacteria as chassis for recombinant protein production is common in science and generally accepted in society. Therefore, no bioethical questions were expected to arise in this matter. In case our project is turned into reality and cows are provided with our E. cowli strain we expect a lot of bioethical questions from the public. People are expected to react sceptically due to our planned use of recombinant organisms in animals intended for food production, which, in fact, is reasonable. The work on animals probably has to be handled in a more sensitive way than the work on other, simpler organisms such as bacteria. It has to be questioned whether the advantages for climate change resulting from the use of E. cowli can compensate the risk every recombinant organism brings up in the environment. Alternatively we planned to design a barn filter provided with a methane filter system based on E. cowli. This technology would render it possible to decrease methane emission without providing animals directly with a recombinant organism. Therefore, ethical problems are minimised as well.
Environmental Impacts
In case our project will be realized in cows, it is necessary to reconsider every possible risk recombinant organisms bring to nature and environment. Although there is no possible use of our project regarding national issues and although no toxins or pathogenic substances are expressed, it would be important to question as many risks as possible. Under these circumstances E. cowli will be justifiable due to the positive"

Soil survey
The breadth and efficiency of the project are our top priorities. We hope that we can grasp the basic conditions of China's TCP pollution, in order to evaluate, the environmental complexity forour super plants.
We recruited 61 volunteers in 57 districts and collected hundreds of local soil samples from their hometowns. Then we examined each and every one of them.
The results show that there are TCP contamination in Gansu Province, Hebei Province and some parts of Sichuan Province (Panzhihua, etc.), and there is no TCP in Guizhou, Anhui, Liaoning and Shandong provinces.

Lab session: 24th July
Introduction
As far as the introductory lab sessions go, we have completed one half of the ethanol precipitation procedure; once completed the procedure will see the plasmid pSB1A2 (containing GFP) and the plasmid pSB1AT3 (containing RFP) free from ethanol. This means they can be loaded onto gel and analysed appropriately (i.e. DNA gel electrophoresis)
Practical Outline
Remove the Eppendorf tubes from fridge and resume the rest of the ethanol precipitation protocol.
Ethanol Precipitation continued
So far we have added sodium acetate to the 2 DNA samples and also added ethanol. The team have also divided the samples into Eppendorf tubes and stored them in the fridge overnight (a replacement for the15 minute incubation-on-ice step). The following was carried out:
The 16 Eppendorf tubes (8 containing GFP and 8 containing RFP) were spun down for 20 minutes at 13,000 rpm.
With the supernatant removed the 16 samples were rinsed in 70% ethanol and spun for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded (making sure that the DNA pellet was it disturbed) and the tube dried using the Speed Vac machine.
The DNA pellets were then resuspended in 50ul of distilled water and stored away in the -80ºC freezer.
Conclusion
Both the pSB1A2 plasmid containing GFP and the pSB1AT3 plasmid containing RFP will be analysed by DNA gel electrophoresis on next Monday’s lab session.

""This year, 273 teams coming from 6 continents attended the iGEM Giant Jamboree. The energy was electrifying as students buzzed around, setting up their posters, stressing about their presentations, and forging friendships across nationalities that will last a lifetime!
iGEM, for international Genetically Engineered Machine, is the premier global synthetic biology competition. Started in 2004, iGEM brings together teams of 2-20 students from across the world who spend the entire summer building a synthetic biology project that will save the world. These teams construct and assemble specific gene sequences called biobricks that code for particular traits into genetic circuits that cause the cell to perform some novel function.
A classic example is to create an arsenic biosensor by assembling the gene that detects arsenic with the gene that fluoresces and uploading that into the cell, so whenever the cell detects arsenic it will light up. Biosensors are just one example, however; these teams build projects that span the gamut of industries and applications, including within health, energy, architecture, and much more. All the iGEM tracks are listed here.
For 3 days straight, these teams are presenting their projects to a panel of 6 judges who will score them based on their presentation, their posters, and their wikis (the online repository of the team’s entire project). Every year, these projects become more robust, more creative, and more impressive. Furthermore, you start to see themes starting to emerge within the projects; in 2013, CRISPR was all the rage!
This year, however, I began to see a couple teams focusing on audiogenetics, or the ability to induce signal transduction using sound. Two teams, Slovenia and SUSTech Shenzhen, engineered proteins that detected pressure into the cell so that the cells could respond to ultrasound. Imagine delivering a payload of these cells into your bloodstream and being able to activate them in very specific regions of your body just by focusing an ultrasound on that particular region. This could become a powerful tool in targeted drug delivery.
The three winners for this year’s competition were HSi Taiwan for the High School track, Imperial College for the Undergraduate track, and LMU-TUM Munich for the Overgraduate track.

When Tn5 was added All bands are missing, which could be the result of two possible reasonings. First, our Tn5 protein might be contaminated with DNase, degrading all of our DNA. Second, our Tn5 might be really active that it degrade our DNA to very small pieces that already ran off the gel.

Tn5 functionality testing: Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
Since the Tn5 integration assay has been showing inconsistent result. We took a step further and first focus on checking whether our Tn5 is able to load the adapter DNA. EMSA was performed to test this.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

Complete Version of Activities
This morning, I completed the restriction digest activity in its general form. Now, I have to rename materials so they are no longer general and add the notecards to be given to avatars to each object in the activity and set it so that you cannot read what is within the notecard, which will be compared to a master notecard within the sequencer at the end of the activity. This prevents anyone from just renaming objects in their inventory (“cheating”). I am in the process of modifying the notecard reader script for use within the sequencer and depending on how complicated it ends up being I may incorporate it into the rest of the restriction digest activity and check all notecards for every step if possible. My restriction digest notecard has also been completed to the best of my ability, which will be sent to Mandy this week.
I am now working on bacterial transformation, which I would like to be slightly different from PCR/Gel Electrophoresis and Restriction digest, which have functions different from one another as well (for example, order is important for one). So, I believe this activity will ask the user questions to assure they have some idea of what they are doing, which once again also serves the secondary purpose of preventing people from just renaming objects and being able to complete the activity.
I have created an object that has the ability to create the bacteria avatars by touching it.  Problem: Mandy pointed out that the attach avatar permission only worked for me, which I determined was because I am the owner of the object when it is rezzed. So instead of rezzing the object I decided to give the object to people so that they will become the owner. This means they will now have to take it out of their inventory by attaching it to themselves from their inventory. So it is working, just not the way I would prefer it. There is also varying levels of brightness for the bacteria, which I am unsure of whether to keep or just have it glow when there is enough bacteria.
Tomorrow I will modify the PCR script so that the items for each activity are more specific to that single activity as well as scientifically accurate, including the names for each specific PCR. I will be completing"

This makes the organism inside inaccessible to both the user and the environment. This type of design serves two purposes. Not only does his design isolate our organism, but it also helps to protect our intellectual property, particularly if we continue to pursue a trade secret IP strategy.
Our design of all of these components were directly influenced by our conversations with investors, industry and potential end users. Through talking to a variety of individuals, we have determined that this seems like a feasible and necessary plan in order to ensure safety for our user, the environment and even ourselves. This will increase the likelihood of our technology being adopted in our market place as well as our intellectual property being protected.
To ensure that our organism performs the sensing task and nothing else we have engineered a bleach system into our final designs. This accomplishes two tasks in our product. Primarily, it ensures that the bacteria used in the testing does not live past it's usefulness, but it also accomplishes a secondary goal of making our product disposable in everyday waste by removing any potential biohazard. This decreases the costs associated with disposal of our product, ensuring safety and lowering costs.
Outreach and Community Development
Our team has aided in developing a synthetic biology community here in Alberta in a number of ways. Through our various networking events, we got  chance to not only receive valuable feedback that has helped to shape our project, but we also got to present our Synthetic Biology ideas in a number of ways. We shared with professional engineers in Alberta at the CPCGE talk we gave, we shared with the Alberta biotech community at the BioAlberta Gala and we shared with industry players in Alberta at the AITF summit to name a few. In addition, we collaborated with the Calgary collegiate team in helping establish the Consort Alberta high school iGEM team. Through frequent Skype chats and workshops held both in Calgary and in Consort, we helped them establish their team and develop their project ideas. With their hard work, they were able to take home the award for best human practices at their first jamboree. We hope that by encouraging future synthetic biologists we can sow the seeds for a thriving biotechnology business in Canada.

At 1pm overnight bacterial culture was split and IPTG induction begun. Did 1 in 10 dilution (5mL cells into 50ml 2xYT with amp). One was IPTG induced with 10 mMol, .238 g for 100 mL culture. One culture was not IPTG induced. There was another culture that was not from frozen stock but was from plate. PDCE plasmid that was from an Ecoli transformation plate with amp resistance as a negative control, not expressing luciferase. That was into 70 mL YT with 70uL amp. That has been growing for 7+ hours as well. Overnight inoculations had been done at 11pm.  Yeast—two 2mL cultures growing, one with DMSO, 50 uMol (40uL of 100x PCB stock, which we assume to be 50uMol final concentration, we assume majority is Phycocyanobilin). That was inoculated last night at 1030pm. Still in the incubator at 30 degrees in the dark. They have been in there for 22 hours. 16 hours in PCB is recommended.  It is probably a very saturated culture, not growing well though. That is the problem.  Ideally we should split those cells and let them recover for a while…how crucial is that? We will do it tonight and again tomorrow. We have yeast that have been recovering for 2 hours (washed). We could throw them all together—Oliver was going to do a laser timecourse. For the laser timecourse,  Because it got too late we eneded up not doing this experiment on the night of Aug 4, we are going to actually do it on Aug 5.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus, our"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Lecture
A series of Human Practice by Tsinghua-E
2013 Tsinghua-E has explored a innovate series as human practice outreach. Traditional way of delivering a lecture is necessary in building a fundamental knowledge about synthetic biology and IGEM; however, it can hardly leave a deep impression to others, especially to those who have never heard the concept. Thus, we conducted a series of activities to lead ordinary students first to perceive, to try, and then to hear and to know.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," is safety? In our case, safety is the condition of a technology  that makes the user, the environment or any other individual free from any risk of being harmed. But how can one determine how safe a technology is? In other words, how can one determine the risk associated with a technology? There are two different approaches.
On one hand, we can use a risk analysis, which studies the known risks and their probability under specific circumstances. On the other hand,  risk perception is a more subjective approach based on the perception of individuals and the factors influencing this perception. Risk analysis and risk perception are related but show two different aspects of risk: objectivity versus subjectivity, respectively. Another question that we can ask is: How safe must a technology be in order to be used? To answer this question, we need to consider the benefit that the technology offers as well as the risk it poses. A population will consider using a technology after making their judgment. This judgment is based on a comparison between the benefits offered and the risks posed by the technology. The balance between risk and benefit is reflected in the laws through the limits of acceptability. Therefore, a technology does not have to be completely free of risk for it to be used by the population, but it has to be acceptably safe.
There are many factors affecting risk perception (a summary of factors affecting our device is depicted in Figure 1). However, there is still no consensus on if risk perception is mainly due to social factors, personal factors or technological factors. In our opinion, two related factors are important: moral acceptability and the attitude towards the technology. These are linked directly to the subjective perception of the technology and not only to the perception of the risk itself. The differences in the moral acceptability and the attitude among populations highlight an important detail: people have different perceptions of reality. This is an important consideration, as the risk measured in risk analysis is considered to be the ""real"" risk by the scientific community. The clash of reality perceptions could be observed in the battle against the Ebola breakout: while the health authorities insisted that the corpses had to be burned, the local families saw this as an offense to their gods, which would cause the deceased to not be able to reach the life after death. Consequently, distrust was generated against the health authorities which made control of the disease more difficult. It is important to keep in mind that for the local families, the risk of not seeing their loved ones in the afterlife was more important than the risk of getting infected (read more here ). So we can conclude that talking about ""real risk"" can be misleading when debating"

What’s more, they have a project to produce a book for pedagogical meaning, which might be more suitable for high school level, and we could help them as adviser. Finally we gave them some aid of instructional significance on how to edit their wiki web page.
Biology Companies
We interviewed several biology companies so that our project can fit the social needs more properly.                       The industrial explorers all gave us their unique suggestions on both biology industry development and our software.
Bluepha
Bluepha is a company that devoted to applying synthetic biology technology to industrial biological manufacturing.                         One of their co-founders, Doc. Haoqian Zhang accepted our interview and discussed the present situation of synthetic biology industry in China based on our iGEM topic.                         We managed to know about synthetic biology more completely, both theoretical and practical.
Yaoyanshe
Yaoyanshe APP is the first platform of pharmaceutical research and development industry and value sharing and trading.                         The founder of Yaoyanshe gave advice on the future industry development in Biology and helped us to polish the idea of our software.
Novelbio Technology Company
Novelbio technology company is a company mainly focused on biological cloud computing. The founder of Novelbio Technology Company,                         Jie Zong, analyzed the potential of biology software for us and upon his analysis we justified our project’s function to meet the future sector demand.
These people are deeply involved in biological industry and their views are quite different from us undergraduates,                       so they can provide inspiring ideas and largely improve our project.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," we display a more graceful style:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{U_n}{n}=\frac{2c\delta_n}{c\delta_n-\delta^2_d}\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}+\frac{2(c\delta_n+\delta_d^2)}{c\delta_n-\delta_d^2}\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}
\end{align}
$$
For more derivation, we suppose that the distance between any fringes is a constant because the density of fringes is enough. So, we would get:
$$\delta_d\approx\Delta d\cdot\delta_n$$
In the formula, $\Delta d$is the distance between fringes. Continuly, we would get:
$$
\begin{align}
\delta_d^2 & =(\Delta d\cdot\delta_n)^2 \\
& = c\delta^2_n\cdot(\sqrt{n+1}-\sqrt{n})^2 \\
\end{align}
$$
Because the density of fringes is enough, the value of $n$ would be large. As a result, we could get $\sqrt{n+1}\approx\sqrt{n}$, so, the $(7)$ means:
$$\delta_d^2\lt\lt c\delta_n$$
So, we could simpilfy the $(5)$ and we could get:
$$\frac{U_n}{n}=2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}+2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}$$
Based on The Most Uncertainty and The Average of Principle of Uncertainty, if we want to $\frac{U_n}{n}\le 5\%$, we would assure that $2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_n}}{\delta_n}\le 2.5\%$ and $2\cdot\frac{U_{\delta_d}}{\delta_d}\le 2.5\%$, that's to say:
$$
\begin{align}
U_{\delta_n}\le 2\cdot2.5\%\delta_n \\
U_{\delta_d}\le 2\cdot2.5\%\delta_d \\

However, we find that the intracellular GltC concentration is basically equivalent in different cells because of its self-negative feedback network. So is reasonable to assume that the concentration of GltC-Glu complex is only affected by different intracellular glutamate concentrations. The reaction equilibrium constant in Equation (9) is
, so the concentration of GltC-Glu complex is proportional to glutamate concentration. Define its proportional coefficient
.
Simulate Biosynthetic Performance by Biophysical Model
We assume that the intracellular glutamate concentration is normally distributed between 20∼200 mM, which is from the result of our lab's previous work. See Figure 4:
Figure 4: Bacteria distribution with different intracellular glutamate concentrations. Data was obtained from 50000 cells by assuming a normal distribution of intracellular glutamate concentration.Data was obtained from 50000 cells by assuming a normal distribution of intracellular glutamate concentration using MATLAB R2014(a).
The complex GltC-Glu achieves transcriptional regulation by altering the probability of RNA polymerase binding to the PgltAB promoter. We model this process and assume that the probability of binding of RNA polymerase to the tetA promoter is linear to the tetA mRNA transcription level.
Total partition function:
(16)
where Z(P, R; NNS) refers to the partition function of P polymerase and R complex GltC-Glu binding to NNS non-specific sites (Dividing DNA sites into promoters and non-specific binding sites,which is approximately equal to 4×106 in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.) β=KBT. Here we assume that RNA polymerase is randomly collided onto DNA. Therefore, the probability of a promoter occupied by RNA polymerase is:
(17)
Because the number of polymerase and GltC-Glu complexes is negligible relative to the number of effective binding sites, so:
(18)
Substituting Equation (17) into Equation (18):
(19)
We define the degree of deterrence(D) as the ratio of the probability that the promoter is occupied by RNA polymerase in the absence of a complex GltC-Glu to the probability of having a complex GltC-Glu:

For weak promotors:

Define the expression level of PgltAB as 1 when glutamate concentration is 0, so the relative expression level of PgltAB is:

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," and Iran, we started out by giving a rough overview of the synthetic life sciences and introducing them to the iGEM competition in German. We were impressed by their language skills as all of them already spoke and understood German quite well. We only had to explain a few key words.  Our guests expressed great interest and many questions came up, which we answered with pleasure. After the discussion a small but interesting experiment followed. With normal household utensils we extracted DNA from a pepper. Everyone was amazed when they saw the extracted DNA in front of their eyes and even we, who work with DNA every day, were impressed. In the end we gave a tour through our laboratories. All the unknown equipment and samples in the incubators looked very strange to them at first, but after some explanations everyone was excited to learn more. The light cabinets in which we cultivate the cyanobacteria found a lot of admiration.
All in all, not only did our guests learn a lot from us but we also learned from them. They were highly motivated to continue their work or their studies after coming to Germany. We are very happy to be able to give them an insight into our work and wish them the best of luck for their future.
Heine meets Huxley
On July 16 we took part in the first event of  “Heine meets Huxley” - a project brought into the world by the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf based on the dystopian novel “Brave New World” written by Aldous Huxley.  During the introductional event “Brave New World - cloned babies and super plants” aspects of genetic engineering were introduced and discussed which was a great opportunity for us to educate people about iGEM, synthetic biology and to still unfounded fears.
In his novel Huxley describes an dystopian world in 2540, where cloned babies are being genetically modified and assigned into classes based on their intelligence and labor.  Written in 1931 and published a year after, Huxley expected huge scientific advances in future society but also a large number of sinister applications for them.
Already in the first chapter - which was read out to the filled room - we were introduced to a world of artificial wombs, excessive cloning and the manipulation of intelligence through different oxygen concentrations given to fetuses determining their future social class. A quite disturbing beginning.
The first talk given by Prof. Dr. Maria von Korff Schmising underlined different methods of genetic modifications used in plants and the effects - a bigger variety in foods - on the market.

In modern fermentation process, cooling system, aiming at keeping the cells in a good condition, plays an important role. However, that results in a great consumption of energy. According to a research carried by COFCO, the leader of bio-industry in China, once the fermentation temperature limit can be risen by 1 centidegree, 100 million degrees of electricity can be saved all around China. Moreover, thermal electric generation accounts for a large proportion in China. Let’s do a calculation about the effectiveness (Figure 1). The result is striking and the emission brought an enormous impact on environment such as acid rain, global warming and so on.
Figure 1: if the temperature of fermentation raise 1℃，all fermentation industry in China can save nearly 1 billion yuan per year. According to the electric price of industry，1 billion equal to 173310225(kW•h) power. In China, 78% electric energy was produced with coal in 2012. That means we can save 135181975(kW•h) power which made by coal every year. To generate those electricity need consume 50017 tuns of coal! That is a big number! So we can shrift those coal and we can reduce 134776 tuns of carbon dioxide emissions per year.

Introduction
In order to characterize our new antibiotic we wanted to answer three questions:
1. Is our substance active against bacteria and ideally against MRSA?
2. What is the mode of action behind the antibiotic effect?
3. Will it be active against Gyrase inhibitor resistant S.aureus?
The first question can be easily examined by performing agar-diffusion assays with different bacteria. To avoid using  MRSA we decided to clone the resistance providing genes into E.coli. This was accomplished by cloning SHV-1 into a vector with a L-rhamnose inducible promoter.  The second question is harder to answer. Clorobiocin acts by inhibiting the ATP binding to Gyrase B. As this will most probably be also the mode of action of our new antibiotic, we cloned an aminocoumarin resistant GyrB variant from E.coli into vectors for inducible expression to use in agar-diffusion assays. The most straightforward way to test the mode of action is to purify the Gyrase and add it together with ATP to supercoiled plasmid DNA. Normally the Gyrase would relax the supercoiled DNA which could be detected on an agarose gel in a band shift.  If the antibiotic inhibited the Gyrase the band shift wouldn’t be visible even after ATP addition.  To answer question three we wanted to test the aminocoumarin resistant GyrB variant from S.aureus in E.coli. The active complex is formed by two subunits, GyrA and GyrB. Since S.aureus is a dangerous organism, GyrA and GyrB from S.aureus were cloned into a plasmid. These plasmids can be transformed into E.coli and used as a model for testing the toxicity of diverse substances.
Theoretical Background
For the agar-diffusion assay, bacteria were distributed in liquid LB Agar, which was then poured into petri dishes to solidify. Afterwards, antibiotic wafers were laid on top and the plate was left to incubate. If an antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills the bacteria, there will be an area around the wafer where the bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. This is called a zone of inhibition which depends on the antibiotic activity, the diffusion rate and the solub"

Besides the contamination evaluation, sequ-into furthermore allows for a separation                                     of the reads into the                                     ones that aligned to the reference versus the ones that that did not align. It                                     generates new FastQ files                                     according to the users inquiry which can then be used in a more elaborate                                     downstream analysis. One notable                                     possibility that sequ-into offers, is the extraction of reads against several                                     references at once. Exporting                                     only those reads in the end that represent the intersection (red) of reads aligned                                     against all references                                     or none, according to set theory.
Sequencing Results
We have found two main results with our app.
First, using our tool the wetlab part of our project could reduce the amount of                     contamination significantly to less than 2% of the reads as one can see in the                     following plots. This was a valuable step for Phactory as high contamination levels impair phage assembly in a TX/TL system.
Shown is the percentage of reads of the 3S sequencing                         experiment that did not align against the 3S phage genome across different purification                         protocols.
Shown is the percentage of reads of the 3S sequencing                         experiment that did align against the E. Coli genome, across different purification                         protocols.
Second, we noticed that running Sequ-Into on only a very first subset of the                     sequenced reads is sufficient to get an upper bound of the expected contamination.                     Thus only using the first 1000 reads of a sequencing experiment is enough to                     determine how well the library preparation worked.                     Moreover we noticed that the contamination usually has a lower average read length,                     and is higher in the very beginning of each sequencing experiment.                     On the first sight this seems to be surprising. Possible explanations are secondary                     structure effects of longer reads, making the longer reads drop down faster than                     shorter reads.
More non-target reads sequenced in the first 10%                                 of the sequencing time of each experiment.

From time step ~321 to 1400, Dox is zero, therefore Dox-TetR Complex changes into degradation phase as it is no        longer being produced (no Dox to bind with TetR). Free TetR proteins start to increase from time step ~321.       Without effect on TetR transcription, mRNA of TetR (blue line, mRNA-tetR) total count grow logarithmically and        reach the plateau phase due to natural degradation.
POPULATION MODEL
This simulation provides a simple and intuitive visualization of the effects of the probiotics onto the pathogenic       Choleras population.
Initially, we plan to test on Phagemid M13 and then CTXphi, which is more specific to Cholerae.        (Please refer to our experiment design page). Our lab had ordered Cholerae for this experiment. However,        the limited time did not allow us to test this. After Wiki Freeze, we still expect to continue the experiment.
Nevertheless, this is where this population simulation comes in and shows the potential application of        our bio-system.
POPULATION LEVEL DESIGN
This part describes the design of the simulation, how we come up with it and its relation to our         wet lab experiment.
Our design starts with a relatively stable probiotics population (green) and a growing pathogenic        Cholerae population (black). The probiotics should be able to sense the presence of Cholerae with a         sensing mechanism. (We discussed with Colombia iGEM Team on collaboration on this subject, as they were         working on the sensing specificity for Cholerae. We invite you to visit their wiki and check out their         project.)
Ultimately, we design the probiotics with our genetically modified plasmid with gRNA-Cas9 system         to be a stable non-pathogenic colony growing in harmony with the human intestinal flora.
[mode 0] In the absence of Cholerae, the probiotics would not release phages.
[mode 1] In the presence of Cholerae, the probiotics would release phages with the CRISPR system plasmid.
The molecules released by Cholerae induces the production of phages (the build up of phage capsid protein),         the packaging of our CRISPR system plasmid, and the release of such phages.Once the phages get in contact with        "

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,".
However, as our research progressed and we spoke to more experts working with the material, we learned there was so much more to mycelium than its self-growing properties.
Phil Ross, one of the founders of MycoWorks, a company working to produce a more humane and sustainable leather from mycelium, was one of our first points of contact. He showed us a material produced from mycelium that behaved and looked just like leather. It was so unlike any of the solid mycelium bricks we had produced. He emphasized to us the ways in which the mechanical properties of mycelium can be manipulated by how it is grown and what is grown on.
This sentiment was echoed by Rolando Perez, a Ph.D. student focused on mycelium at Stanford University in the Drew Endy Lab. He also added that the strain of the mushroom can affect its material properties, and for that reason he is currently working on creating a fungal database in order to make information about mycelium more accessible to the public and other researchers.
Eben Bayer, one of the co-founders of Ecovative, a company that got its start producing mycelium based styrofoam)emphasized in our interview with him how he first got interested in mycelium because of how it can act as a natural glue, binding together diverse substrates to create new material that is completely biodegradable. As a company they have conducted many material tests and found the material to be strong and flame retardant. Check out their materialspecs here.
Through these conversations it became clear to us that mycelium has the potential to revolutionize product manufacturing on earth, by introducing a completely biodegradable material that is also self-growing. These key characteristics will allow manufactures to cut back on the cost, time, energy, and environmental impact involved with traditional production methods. And the ability of manipulate the mechanical properties of the materials ensures that mycelium could be used as a substitute for a variety of products—from furniture to clothing to medical devices.
In response to this exciting realization we began exploring the ways mycelium could be used to create other products that might be necessary for our habitat--ranging from furniture, to scientific instruments, to a filtration system, to even a Rover chassis. We even generated some designs and prototypes for a few of these ideas, fully flushing out the idea of an entire living space created from one material.
One of first designs was a modular hexagonal stool that could be assembled into a larger surface through many units or separated into individual seating. We grew this stool by crating a hexagon mold from recycled"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Results#Recombinant_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase 1 clearly shows that this BioBrick is a cytoplasmatic protein which fulfills its function in the reducing milieu of the cytoplasm and tends to aggregation when exposed to an oxidizing milieu such a the periplasm of E. coli.
Secondly the amino acid sequence produced by the AutoAnnotator was fed into the bioinformatic tool ProtParam which gives a stability prediction for proteins. The result was: ""The instability index (II) is computed to be 42.99 - This classifies the protein as unstable.""
Taken both these indications into account it still seems a good idea to express the protein phosphatase 1 cytoplasmatically to bind microcystine but it is not advisable to think about a secreted version of PP1 as the protein seems to unstable for this application.
DDT-Dehydrochlorinase
File:TUM13 Animation DDT.gif
Figure 32: Animation of protein structure of DDT
The DDT dehydrochlorinase (<partinfo>BBa_K620000</partinfo>) BioBrick was designed in RFC[10] by the Caltech 2011 iGEM team and as a localization of this effector outside the cytoplasm isn't advisable we didn't improve this BioBrick to RFC[25]. The DDT dehydrochlorinase is dependent on the continuous supply of glutathione which conjugates to xenobiotics in order to inactivate them. The disadvantage of an RFC[10] BioBrick is that it can not be fused to an affinity tag which can subsequently be used to purify the protein after its recombinant production.
Beside the experiments already performed in iGEM we found monochlorobimane to be an interesting assay for experiments in bioremeditation. This commercially availible substrate can be conjugated to glutathione. The conjugation of monochlorobimane can be followed by the fluorescense of the conjugation product (excitation: 380 nm / emission: 461 nm). We tryed this assay with transgenic plants but could not see results as the autofluorescense of the photosystem in Physcomitrella was too strong in order to see the emergence of the fluorescense caused by the conjugation product.

It is realized through the regulation of the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity. The basic principle here is C4HSL can activate the expression of TetR, which can be used to inhibit the expression of LacI. Therefore, the activating of LacI by C4HSL can be counteracted.

II Design an easy way to regulate the killing ability of warriors.
    To mimic the situation we investigate in real world, sometimes we need to regulate the killing ability to an appropriate level, like making the two warriors have the same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of the warriors? Our model suggests that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of the two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins! (Fig.4)

III Design our E.coli War based on our models.
    We found that it will be much easier to consider the effects of some factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War ( Game Overview ) based on our model to satisfy our needs. What's more, the game can also help us realize educational purpose of our project and make the public know more about synthetic biology! ( Exhibition at National Museum and Game Overview )
    Our game is made on the structure of html5. The two small videos below are our fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.

This is the start of Spring Term at BYU! The weather is finally getting better: no more snowing. And we are ready to do some serious lab work! While we are waiting for our mutgen, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, to arrive, we decided to start this term with establishing the basic procedures for our direct evolution method. Specifically, this involves making sure that we can (1) grow and amplify T7 phage in liquid culture, (2) select for smaller phage using concentrated top agar, and (3) amplify phage from a single plaque. During these two weeks, we also designed primers for cloning and sequencing T7 capsid proteins as well as mapped out detailed procedures for both cloning T7 capsid proteins and applying mutagen.

Also should I consider increasing the extension time? That might help. It was a problem with the luciferase when I didn’t give it long enough.

With the help of our Sporovector , we fused two Laccases from Team Bielefeld to cgeA. We chose the Ecol (E. coli) and Bhal (Bacillus halodurans) because they did not contain any fobidden restriction sites (NgoMIV or AgeI for Freiburg standard RFC 25 ). However, the activity of purified protein is quite low in comparison to the other laccases tested by Bielefeld.
The obtained strains were growing slowly, but we were able to test the activity of the spores with the substrate.... . The activity was compared to wild type spores.
The result clearly shows activity for both Laccase-Sporobeads. Consistent with the results from Bielefeld, the activity of Bhal is higher than of Ecol. For us, this proves that the enzyme is displayed on the surface, it is still working and it has access to the substrate! Furthermore, the activity can be clearly measured, although these were not the optimal laccases.

Fine-regulation Circuits
Basing on basic regulation circuit, three fine-regulation circuits are designed for application in different fermentation situations. Recombinases are constructed downstream pH-responsive promoters to invert direction of constitutive promoter J23119, achieving automatic switch between acid and alkali production.
Main processes in these models are similar to basic regulation circuit model, including induction of the promoters, transcription, translation, catalytic process of enzymes and the effects of products on environmental pH. We also considered reversible reaction and materials’ production and degradation.
To simulate the inversion function of recombinase, we set several groups of equations and made cyclic processes. By determining some key values of pH, the model could switch different groups of equations.
The assumption we made are:
(1) J23119 is firstly in the direction of alkali production, as normal fermentation environment tends to be acidic.
(2) P-atp2 promoter is directly induced by hydroxyl ion, while P-asr promoter is directly induced by hydrogen ion.
(3) To prove the function of circuits, initial pH is set up to 8.0, where circuit led by p-atp2 has already be activated. This process is regarded as the first step of the model.
Cre/Flp Regulation Circuit
Fig.1 The gene circuits of Cre/Flp regulation system
The first fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinases Cre and Flp (Fig.1). The cyclic processes are described as followed:
(1) When pH is higher than 7.0, P-atp2 is induced and activates the production of Cre, which inverts J23119 from alkali production to acid production. Environmental pH begins to decrease.
(2) When pH is between 5.0 and 7.0, both P-asr and P-atp2 promoters are repressed. Because acid production circuit is open, pH level keeps declining.
(3) When pH is around 5.0, p-asr promoter is induced and leads production of Flp, which starts to change the"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html,"Team Site Directed Mutagenesis: Made Primer-Mixes for the bacterial laccases. Set Pre-culture of XL1 blue. Got everything ready for Lab work.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
We diluted our chromosomal DNA to a concentration of 20 ng/µL, since the volume we got was to low for doing many PCRs and did again a PCR reaction. This time S. goettingen laccase DNA could be identified but not S. tuebingen. The reaction conditions were the same so we were surprised because S. tuebingen didn`t work.
Team Fungal and Plant Laccases: Some of the ordered parts from the Parts Registry arrived and we plated the biobricks BBa_K500000 , BBa_K500001 , BBa_K500002 , BBa_K500003 and BBa_K392014 . Above all we are interested in BBa_K500002 because it’s a codon optimized laccase from Trametes versicolor and we want to use this laccase in our P. pastoris shuttle vector and characterize it.
Team Cultivation & Purification:
Today we performed our first flask cultivation. We cultivated E. coli KRX with BBa_K500005 , BBa_K863020 , pBpL6 and BBa_K863015 and as negative control we used E. coli KRX.
Settings: We used 300 mL flasks without baffles, final volume: 60 mL, autoinduction medium , 30/37 °C, durance: 24 hours
Found out that we had a mixed culture of E. coli KRX with pBpL6 , because it grew on chloramphenicol, but has only an ampicilline resistance. So we could not use this culture.

Besides the main fermentation process, the air withdrawal device could provide enough air for microbes' working and air purification tower could prevent noxious air (e.g. carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide) from polluting the atmosphere as only water vapor would enter the environment at last.
3) Space for Improvement
Since our project focused on the salinity of the microbe, we asked the manager about how his method decreased the salinity of the food waste. However, he replied that his company did not pay much attention to the salt content in the food waste. He suggested that the high salinity might affect the efficiency of the microbe and encouraged us to further our research. Then Mr. Zhang generously commented on our project design and gave us precious suggestions. He advised that we should pay heed to the stability of our microbe as the gene mutation is common among bacterium, which might greatly influence the microbes' function. As a result, we decided to take gene stability into account during our experiment design.
1.The total idea we got
Through this total investigation, the data we obtained confirmed that our research will benefit the environment and human’s life quality, which is really meaningful. Furthermore, the investigations provided us the clue in setting salinity gradients for the test of our modified yeast’s survivability and effectiveness during decomposition of food wastes. The exploration in the green community also gave us some idea in industry and the manager’s experienced suggestion did gave us  some inspiration.
Education
Speech tour in schools
To enhance the social impact of our idea, we held speeches in high-school classes in Beijing. Several teammates gave the speeches in biology classes of Beijing 101 International Department and Beijing Changping New Oriental Foreign Language School. In every speech, we mainly introduced the history of iGEM, and how creative the match is—lots of innovation are originated from this match. Then, we introduced our project—how to effectively decompose the kitchen waste with low osmotic pressure (high salinity) osmotic pressure. We basically talked about the factors which can affect the efficiency and the ability of yeasts in kitchen waste decomposing, and our own solution. We successfully managed to accomplish the propaganda of iGEM and showed our project.

The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

In the first one, we described how we got started with iGEM, and how we came up with our HEKcite project. Secondly, we wrote about the ‘dark’ side of science. The part of research where everything goes wrong, and how to deal with that. In our third article, we gave a more loose description of our activities outside the lab (sponsoring, meetings, education projects…). In our fourth and final article, we published a quick overview of our scientific results, and future directions.
According to the staff of Eos, every article reached around 1200 readers one week after publication. Therefore, we can conclude that we successfully brought synthetic biology, iGEM, and HEKcite, to a broad public. And that couldn’t make us more proud.

Marketing and Ethics for July 27th 2009
Today, I concentrated my energies at marketing our iGEM project and looking at the ethical aspect of our project. Here is what I did today:
1) I got a call from David Corriveau. He is the vice president for engineering and devlopment  at Albian Sands Energy Inc. He was extremely impressed by our work and wanted to know more about the possible bio-remediation aspect of our project. I sent him an e-mail detailing about our project this year.

DEBS 1 is the first part of the PKS which catalyzes and synthesizes 6dEB, the precursor of erythromycin. Its domain sequence is AT, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP, KS, AT, KR, ACP. Theoretically, the kinetic model of domains which have been stacked is match with the kinetic model of DEBS 1+TE.
In modeling section, we kept pace with the members who are responsible for experiment. We stacked the related equations according to the sequence of DEBS 1+TE. Meanwhile, we also simulated the kinetic equations of the whole DEBS 1+TE. Then we compared the equations of domains which have been stacked with the equation of DEBS 1+TE, and verified the feasibility of the model.

The UCSF team has fulfilled the following criteria to meet the gold medal requirements:
1. Submitted new BioBrick parts ( BBa_K321003 & BBa_K321004 ) and entered detailed information regarding these parts in the Registry of Parts. The information included a demonstration of the parts’ functions and characterization of their operation. [Silver Medal requirements]
2. Characterized an existing BioBrick Part and entered this information back on the Registry. [Gold Medal requirement]
Our team has further characterized the BioBrick part BBa_k209400 by showing a previously unknown cellular function conferred by this part.  Developed by the UCSF 2009 iGEM team, the HM4D synthetic GPCR part was originally found to successfully mediate neutrophil chemotaxis towards the synthetic ligand CNO.  (See project Cell-Bots )  As the process of chemotaxis involves activation of cellular kinases, we hypothesized that this synthetic GPCR might enhance the Killer cell killing signal, which is the focus of our project this year and also involves cellular kinases.  When we incorporated this part into killers cells, we found that it significantly increased killer cell activation. See the results here .
3. Assisted other iGEM teams with their projects. [Gold Medal requirement]
In collaboration with Paris Liliane Bettencourt and Peking University , the UCSF team has contributed to developing a variety of visual protocols for techniques widely used in synthetic biology.  (See Paris Liliane Bettencourt's collaboration page) These protocol images are being used in openProtocol by Paris Liliane Bettencourt to help write consensus protocols for common laboratory techniques.

THANK YOU PARIS AND PKU! IT WAS FUN!!!
In addition to the visual protocols, the UCSF team has helped teams Metu Turkey , Penn State , and Warsaw with their surveys.  These surveys covered the topics of Categorizing Registry Parts, Genetically Modified Organisms, and Synthetic Biology.

Therefore, the team wanted to detect the concentration of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus mutans through the device and analyze the process of oral dental caries, and combine the biological data using machine learning to assess the risk of suffering from dental caries to achieve early warning.
What have we done?
Since one of our goals is to win the entrepreneurship special prize, so we participated in the ""MIT beyond food mini bootcamp"" held in Taiwan. During this two-day camp, we learned a lot from many professional entrepreneurs in this field and experienced operation of as businessman. This helped us have a clear and better idea for our entrepreneurship plan.

SWOT analysis
To find our strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats we face, we used a business SWOT analysis for our product, specifying our goal, including internal and external factors.
Furthermore, this will help us build a successful selling strategy in the future.
Business model
A business model which consists of value proposition, customer segment, key partners, cost structure and revenue stream describes the rationale of how an organization creates value in economic or other contexts. It’s also a part of the process of building a business strategy.
Description of Value Proposition
This is a way to summarize why consumers should buy our product. It also examines beliefs of the customer (like how this product’s value and benefit will be delivered).
Description of Customer Segments
This relies on identifying key differentiators that divide customers into groups that can be targeted.
Description of cost structure and revenue streams
To keep our business working, the cost structure and revenue streams will help us to achieve the purpose. It’s also very important to assess the future blueprint of the product and provide a visual map of our business.
Description of costumer relationship－Risk Analysis
To improve business relationships with customers and ultimately keep sales smooth, customers retention is very important. To achieve this, we used Risk Analysis to anticipate unexpected situations that might happen when using product, so that we can keep the customer satisfied.

MODELING
We attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
Overview
Our project hopes to judge whether a man has esophagus cancer or the tendency of having it (set as y∈{0,1}, 0 stands for not having it or no tendency and 1 otherwise) through the expression level of a few kinds of miRNA (set as x∈Rn, n denotes the kinds of the miRNA being selected) in human saliva. This problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems, which is 1) what kind of mathematical relationship does the expression level of these certain kinds of miRNA satisfies so that we can make the prediction of whether or not having the cancer and 2) how to construct a biological circuit to express this kind of mathematical relationship and the conclusion of the judgment.
Sub-problem 1 can be summarized as a pattern recognition problem. We can use some statistical learning (supervised learning) methods to obtain the pattern of the way that the concentrations of these kinds of miRNAs are combined, concretely, a set of parameters that the classifier possesses, to make prediction of whether or not having cancer.
If sub-problem 1 is an applied mathematical problem, then sub-problem 2 is more related to biology, because a biological system is needed to physically realize the mathematical model obtained from sub-problem 1. We can analyze this problem from a systematic view. The input of this system is the concentrations of n kinds of miRNA, which is quite trivial. And how to use a biological system to express “ill or not”? The common method is to use some chemical to be the signal molecule, and our project follows the same routine. So the output of the system is the expression level of a certain kind of chemical (such as GFP).
If sub-problem 1 uses combinatory logic to characterize the relationship between y and x, first the thresholds should be set. Secondly, gene circuits needs to be designed to characterize the relationship of “AND” “OR” “NOT”. Usually this can be realized through the combination of different kinds of promoter or repressor"

Freiburg,2015,Team:Freiburg#Labjournals#irif_-_-_TEXT.html,"1501 Salmonella antigen
19.07.2015 Stamped freshly eluted Salmonella antigen, which was prepared the same day. Apart from not being frozen, salmonella antigen and antibody we're both eluted in a phosphate free buffer. While stamping, it was observed that the salmonella antigen (1501) already showed some flakes floating in the solution, indicating that the antigen is either denaturated, or that it naturally forms aggregates.
The Salmonella Antibody was diluted 1:10. Antigen was stamped without dilution (~3,2 mg/ml protein in solution). Controls were GFP and bBSA stamps. Binding of Salmonella antigen to salmonella antibody could not be observed.
Stamping pIG15_1501 Salmonella antigen
07.07.2015
Salmonella-antigen (1501) and Salmonella-antibody (1301) were provided by the protein purification. Unfortunately, after thawing antibody and antigen, both precipitated. Nevertheless, we continued (with not too great expectations).
To test salmonella-antibody binding to antigen the following experiment was conducted: Stamping sceme (look setup picture).  Flush protocol: - PBS (baseline) - BSA (blocking) (500 ug/ml) - PBS - Anti-Salmonella (1301) (0.5 mg/ml!) - PBS - Anti-GFP (5 ug/ml) - PBS - bBSA (200 ug/ml)
Some airbubbles came into chamber by initial flooding. Continued measurement. Blocking was fine. When anti-Salmonella was flushed over the slide, an intensense signal on the whole slide was seen; this is probably due to high unspecific binding. Then (as can be seen within the graph of the binding curves) specific binding of the a-Salmonella to the Salmonella-antigen stamp is detectable. Positive control (GFP / anti-GFP) was positive. bBSA to StrepCy5 was not detectable - this was not that surprising; already plate reader after stamping process revealed low transfer of StrepCy5 to the surface / denaturation of the protein. –> We have to repeat the experiment with unprecipitated antibody/antigen, maybe another surface for less unspecific binding and longer baseline/blocking/binding steps, but in general the antibody seems to bind to the antigen (see increase in intensity within a-Salmonella-step at the Salmonella spots - delta to the baseline)

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," method to recuperate trust, is through public engagement (Stebbing 2009). From that perspective, it makes sense for iGEM to bring forward an operational framework, or even a philosophy to include public engagement as an important element in the competition. In that way, students become familiarised with “navigating both inside and outside the Ivory Towers” as they become part of the synthetic biology community (Kuldell 2007: 2; McLennan 2012). The motivation or idea behind this is that when students become acquainted with what occupies the minds of the public, and learn how to effectively communicate the methods and intentions of their efforts, they will be able to provide better guidance to the further development of synthetic biology in the light of various external pressures (Kuldell 2007). While reflecting on the importance of public engagement, most team members have interpreted its necessity not only in terms of an educating responsibility they are expected to hold, but also as an act of scientific persuasion towards the lay public:
[Daniel] “There is a lack of information I would say. The thing is, it is our job to like to show people it is not sorcery that it is like actual science […]”
...
[Yan-Kay] “[…] we still need to convince the public that it is safe and that it is a viable option. And I think we need this form of communication between scientists and the public about this so that they know”
...
[Georgia] “[…] I think that there is not enough public engagement to get them to understand what genetically modified organisms are, or what they do, or are they dangerous. Everybody kind of like, if I talk to people who don’t do science […], [they are] like “can’t that give you cancer or something?”, you know”?
Besides raising public awareness about synthetic biology, with Goodbye AzoDye the team also seeks to bring attention to a relatively unknown and overlooked environmental issue. This meant that the team had to reach a target audience that could be both for and against their project considering the technology they are using for a beneficial cause. The central aspect of their public engagement exercise constitutes the #UncolourMeCurious campaign, which was developed as a way to sensitize the public on “the carcinogenic nature of AzoDye waste products” through the use of “a striking video campaign” to gain the attention. This would “culminate in a beautiful short film to explain the dangers of the ‘azodumping’ […]”, followed by a stakeholder debate, a concept art competition and the creation of"

     In enzymology, a benzoylformate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.7) is an enzyme that catalyzes the following chemical reaction:
    benzoylformate + H+ ⇌ benzaldehyde + CO2
    However, in our project we used an engineered benzoylformate decarboxylase, which could catalyze formaldehyde to synthesize Glycolaldehyde and Dihydroxyacetone(Figure1 and Figure2). If you use it to catalyze reaction in vivo, It needs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate.
Figure 1. DHA and Glycoaldchyde could be synthesize from Formaldehyde by BFD.
Figure 2. HPLC analysis of samples from in vitro experiment of BFD.
    This year we fused BFD with CtDock, and then CtDock could bind with CtCohesin(Figure3), which is part of our scaffold protein. Therefore, our core enzyme could form a enzyme complex, and the catalytic efficiency could be greatly improved.
Figure 3. BFD is fused with dockerin and then it can bind with matching CtCohesin.

    Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate = D-erythrose 4-phosphate + D-fructose 6-phosphate
    In our project, we use this enzyme to condense Glycolaldehyde and Dihydroxyacetone into D-xylulose(Figure 4 and Figure 5). If you use it to catalyze reaction in vivo, It needs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate. TalB was cloned into the plasmid vector pET22b+ for expression. We purify this protein by His tag. This year we fused TalB with CcsDock, and then CcsDock could bind"

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," sensing platform, our technology is faster, more quantitative, and capable of operating in environments where existing biosensors cannot. With collaborations in both industry and government, we are building better biosensors for the needs of the present, as well as the future.
Our business strategy has been grouped into several categories (listed on the left):
Pitch Video - A three minute overview of FREDsense Technologies!
Executive Summary - An overview of our business plan and our company description.  Start here to learn about everything we accomplished this year!
Technology - Use the technology link to learn more about the science behind our Field Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) technology and how it was developed in 2012 by the Calgary Collegiate iGEM team!
Intellectual Property - Since our group is developing a company out of a former iGEM project from 2012, it was critical that we handle our intellectual property careful.  Here we look at intellectual property from the perspective of the iGEM competition, protecting our technology through patents and trade secrets, and having the legal freedom to operate by ensuring we had the support of our mentors and supporters from 2012.
Operations - Managing the day-to-day activities of our company is vital for our success.  We must identify strong industry players to collaborate with, and develop our strengths to bring this product to market.  Additionally we engaged key manufacturing players to learn about the technical and business challenges relating to manufacturing.
Marketing - Here we evaluate the potential of our market, the oil and gas industry.  In addition we outline the size of the general toxin sensing market, and deliver a plan for how we can commercalize our technology and deliver it to the market in a time efficient manner.
Management - A company is never complete without it's team!  Here we demonstrate some of the important connections we have made, and the individuals who have become part of the FREDsense team.

Regulation
A problem that is encountered when expressing Bt toxins is that overexpression can be lethal to the bacterial chassis, in our case Escherichia coli. We aimed to prevent premature lysis of BeeT and achieve higher toxin yield by separating the growth phase from the toxin-producing phase. Toxin expression in coupled to quorum-sensing: only when a sufficient number of bacteria are present, the toxin is produced. Furthermore, we aimed to create a subpopulation of bacteria that do not produce the toxin, even when the bacterial density is high. When the toxin-producing bacteria perish, the subpopulation survives. As the survivors are genetically identical to the rest of the population, they are able to"

Introduction to Chitinases
Both honeybees and Varroa destructor mites have a chitin exoskeleton. As chitin is one of the most ubiquitous biopolymers found in nature, plenty of organisms possess the ability to degrade it. A well-described example of such an organism is Serratia marcescens, which is considered a model organism for chitinolytic activity 1 .  Chitinases isolated from Serratia marcescens GEI strain have been shown to have miticidal activity, while honeybee workers appear to be insensitive to them 2 . Additionally, chitinases are not harmful to humans, so they are a safer alternative to organic acids. Therefore, we made BioBricks out of these chitinases as a back-up strategy.
