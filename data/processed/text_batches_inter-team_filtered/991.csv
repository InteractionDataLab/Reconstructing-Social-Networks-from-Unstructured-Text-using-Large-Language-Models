✓ Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
In collaboration with the Imperial iGEM team, we worked to revive the iGEM subreddit as an online forum for discussion and collaboration amongst iGEM teams.
Additionally, although they are not yet a registered iGEM team, we provided the University of LaVerne with advice and logistical support on how to begin their own iGEM team.
❏ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.

Aachen Meetup
Five team members of team Tuebingen joined the iGEM meetup in Aachen. The meetup was organized by Team Aachen and took place on two consecutive days, the 13th and 14th of September. A total of seven German teams were present; five of which presented their iGEM projects to the public audience on the first day. On the second day, two lectures were given about advances in the field of synthetic biology by external presenters. In addition, all teams presented their posters and gave presentations in front of fellow teams for feedback and constructive criticism. The meetup provided a chance for teams to socialize and discuss possible collaborations.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Cooperations_-_-_TEXT.html," a relatively extensive screening process is needed to find the colonies that carry the designed fragment.                  Additionally, we had ongoing support by Jérémy to fix upcoming issues, which we had a lot of.
Alina, who was in charge of our security level 2 lab, contacted Jérémy for further troubleshooting, hence we had starting issues with the protocol. Continuous communication between our team and Jérémy helped us to fix our issues. We needed to tweak the PCR reactions due to some chemicals, enzymes being unavailable to us, being inexperienced with the method we needed council to make sure our changes would not alter the outcome.
Eventually Alina was able to troubleshoot the Golden-Gate-Assembly with Jérémy’s help so that we were finally able to amplify the whole construct with 6107 bp. Which we were able to verify by colony PCR and sequencing.
Since we were unable to find a proper solution to our problems with HMWP2 ourselves, many thanks go to Evry for their dedicated support.
Tu Delft
A collaboration with iGEM Delft felt natural to us for multiple reasons, first in the current lineup from Delft is a former student, Isabell, from our university, which prompted us to contact team Delft early. While we were visiting Delft for the European meetup we met the  team multiple times. During our stay  in Delft we had multiple occasions where we exchanged ideas and spoke about each other's projects.
Second our projects are basically designed to work together, Delft worked on a crispr-cas based detection method for multiresistant bacteria, and we developed a new antibiotic compound to target some of those. Sadly, this would involve both teams completing their projects before we start a collaboration. Which might have worked, in reality we both found out that synthetic biology often takes a lot of time and the verification of the own experiments has to be prioritized.
Nonetheless we made plans, even though they never came to fruition. The planned cooperation involved Delft identifying enterobacteria that are carbapenem resistant, identified strains would then be tried with our novel antibiotic compounds and tested for siderophore receptors. All in all we would have been able to identify and eliminate multiresistant bacterial threats.                  Many thanks to iGEM Delft who were great partners in developing important ideas to change our world for the better, and of course for the organisation of the European Meetup!

Collaboration with Dundee iGEM team 2013
Figure 1: Shipment from the Dundee 2013 iGEM team.
The Dundee iGEM team 2013 also works on bioremediation: The toxin microcystin is released into water from lysed cyanobacteria and appears in great amounts during algal blooms. This cyclic peptide toxin covalently binds the protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) and is thereby toxic for mammals. The idea of the Dundee iGEM team is to express the PP1 protein as an absorber for microcystin. We received their PP1 BioBrick, converted it from RFC 10 to RFC 25 and constructed some expression plasmids to transform Physcomitrella patens. Our purpose was applying Dundee's molecular mop in an aquatic, photoautotrophic chassis and thus expand their project's to a wider range. We  successfully obtained equipped the moss plants with our synthetic moss receptor and extracellular PP1. Please visit our PhyscoFilter results page to read more about this great collaboration.
We'd also like to congratulate the Dundee iGEM team 2013 for their success at the European Jamboree: Well done Scots!

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," creating plasmid DNA preparations of the colonies and performing confirmation digests to view on an agarose gel using the restriction enzymes Xba1 and Spe1 (Figure 4). During the initial design stage of the protein, parts of the sequence were lost between optimisation and sending it to be synthesised into a gBlock. This was not discovered until expression of SOX was induced by IPTG in BL21-DE3 cells and a sample analysed by SDS-Page gel electrophoresis (Figure 6). It was noticed that the band we were expecting was of a lower molecular weight than what it should have been; ~35kDa instead of ~42kDa. It was realised that the sequence in the PSB1C3 plasmid was different to the sequence origin. Therefore a new gBlock was synthesised using the proper sequence, a confirmation digest was performed to check for successful assembly (Figure 5), and an SDS-Page gel used to confirm that the protein expressed was of the correct molecular weight (Figure 7).
Figure 4: Restriction digest confirmation of first sarcosine oxidase assembly using Xba1 and Spe1 restriction enzymes.
Figure 5: Restriction digest confirmation of second sarcosine oxidase assembly using Xba1 and Spe1 restriction enzymes.
The plasmid DNA preps with the correctly assembled SOX gBlock present were then transformed into E. coli BL21-DE3 cells ready for testing.
Characterisation
To prepare SOX for testing, cell cultures were grown following this protocol to step 4. The protocol used for CFPS extract preparation was then followed. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of the samples was done to check for SOX expression. 1 ml of each culture was lysed with lysozyme and incubated at room temperature before being boiled at 100°C for 10 minutes. 20 µl samples were loaded into each lane.  At this point, an error was spotted with the size of SOX on the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 6), as mentioned above.

(RBS).
and promoter. This results in a part that includes the whole sensing function, but does not quite fit our scheme of clearly defined functional units. Since expression of any part cloned behind the regulatory region is directly controlled by it, and the part serves as both, a promoter and
RBS.
It is basically an inducible promoter fused to an
RBS.
Thus, we decided to give the part the overhangs of an
RBS.
on the downstream and a promoter on the upstream end.
In order to obtain the desired region from the P. putida KT2440 genome, we planned to amplify it via
PCR
and then isolate the fragment by gel purification of the corresponding band. Into the primer-design we factored in the overhangs we needed to make it Marburg Collection compatible. So, we gave them non-binding overhangs which automatically added the necessary BsmBI cut sites.
Figure 7: Scheme of the malonyl-CoA sensor
This sensor consists of two unique level 0 parts that combined with the lux operon as reporter constitute the biosensor
For the malonyl-CoA sensor, our proceeding was very similar. Just that we knew the exact location of all functional parts, except of the location of the promoter, from the 2015 paper by Liu et al and from annotations in the published genome (Liu et al. 2015). Therefore, we could implement it fully into the Marburg Collection, by simply treating the FapR coding sequence as coding sequence. Not that straightforwardly was the design of the fapO regulator binding site. Since we did not know the promoter strength, and the mechanism of regulation was independent of the promoter sequence, we decided to implement a promoter from the Andersen library, J23100. By placing it right in front of the fapO site, we created a construct that, in theory, should give us a FapR controlled promoter. For the amplification of the individual parts from the B. subtilis 168 genome, again, we used primers sporting non-binding regions, adding the necessary overhangs for our toolbox.
For future projects, other sensors could also be employed. In a publication from 2016, Rogers et al. proposed an alternative sensor for
3HPA
with a lower perception threshold (Rogerset al.2016). We choose not to implement it in our design because of its more complicated mechanism that requires the"

Instructors - Postdocs and graduate students that taught us seminars during bootcamp.
Supper Buddies - Veteran students that were part of the UCSF iGEM 2009 team. We came back to UCSF in February to start setting up everything for the new students. We go to college at San Francisco City College.
Students - Cloning Gods. At the end of the summer we discovered the Qiagen robot - if we only knew about it earlier we could have cloned everything there is to be cloned.
International Student - Min Lin is from Peking University and he pretty much knows how to do almost everything, like a true ninja master.
Raquel Gomes - Directs the UCSF iGEM program. We first met her when she came to taught us about basic principles of immunology and synthetic biology in the after school sessions at Lincoln High school during the Spring. She is in charge of our iGEM education. She loves giving us assignments.
James Onuffer - He knows everything and also runs the CPL lab! Any question we might ask he will give us an answer way bigger than we expected. :) When things would not work out he would help us find a solution or send us the right way - when the killing assays did not work he helped us figure out what other assays we could possibly use.

SAFETY:
Our work is very safe as it uses harmless fluorescent proteins that are well used and understood in research, in a safe host (E. coli TOP10) so there were no safety concerns to be flagged up.
All safety forms were completed for iGEM, as well as correct packaging and approval for sending live, freeze-dried cells to Groningen and Sheffield, as well as sending the dried DNA to iGEM for the submission deadline
This made us consider GM and safety in general, especially so as we talked to school children, local community and friends about what their concerns would be about a security system that utilises genetically modified bacteria. Their first question was always ""is it safe""? So our most important feature of our system is that it is safe. It uses well characterised and understood components that should not pose a risk to the wider environment. In a world where GM was accepted, our system would not have any problems passing safety regulations as there are no hazardous parts involved."

pcrRNA.bbsI-7-opto-phbc was transformed into E. coli DE3, we wanted to test the production of PHB by Nile Red. We did this experiment applying Protocol 15 . Here is the result.
pPT7-sfGFP was assembled successfully by restriction enzymes.
Week 9-11 (June 25th to July 14th) ▲ back
It was time for final examination!
Week 12 (July 15th to July 22th) ▲ back
We were blocked by assembling pSR43.6-ccaS#10-crRNA, we tried both Gibson assembly and restriction enzyme, and we redesigned the plasmid and primers for many times. We had to figure out what was going on.
At the same time, pHZccdA which contains antitoxic protein ccdA but without promoter was assembled by PCR and Gibson assembly.
Week 13 (July 23rd to July 30th) ▲ back
pSR43.6-ccaS#10-crRNA was still under assembling, we suspected that the leakage of crRNA might prevent bacteria from growing, so the Gibson product was transformed into EE-E15, in which Cas3 protein has been knocked out. EE-E15 grew at last but the result of colony PCR was incorrect.
Since the result of Nile Red wasn’t desirable, we tried to change the terminator of phbCAB gene cluster through restriction enzymes, but we failed.
Week 14 (July 31st to August 5th) ▲ back
Promoters with different strength (J23101, J23105, J23108, J23113 and J23114) were inserted into pHZccdA through Gibson assembly. But only J23108 and J23113 were inserted successfully.
We tested the production of PHB with Nile Red again, according to Protocol 15

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," selectively dispensing the output of a microfluidic chip into common lab vessels - as a system, TERRA consists of an active XY-plane and UI interface designed to accurately dispense the outputs of a microfluidic chip to a desired location on a laboratory vessel such as a 96 well plate. The ability to accurately dispense the output of the microfluidic chip enables effective integration of TERRA into the workflow of various synthetic biology procedures. Additionally, exporting onto standard laboratory vessels allows researchers to analyze the microfluidic outputs using benchtop equipment already in the lab, such as a plate reader or flow cytometer, reducing the need to incorporate sensors into microfluidic devices.
Works in conjunction with the 2017 BostonU Hardware iGEM team’s project MARS - MARS designed a set of 9 standardized microfluidic chips capable of running 9 common synthetic biology lab protocols. Additionally, MARS created a series of videos and documentation, Microfluidics 101, designed to introduce people to the basic principles and workings of microfluidics. This helps bridge the knowledge gap as well as created microfluidic chips for standardized protocols.
TERRA is application agnostic and cost effective - Since the project is microfluidic based, it has a variety of potential applications from liquid handling to PCR. Due to its DIY and open-sourced nature, TERRA is a low-cost solution, which further serves to increase its accessibility to the community.
TERRA and Other Potential Solutions
Another solution to the problem of microfluidic accessibility is outlined in the 2013 paper “Microfluidics on liquid handling stations (μF-on-LHS): an industry compatible chip interface between microfluidics and automated liquid handling stations.” 3 In this paper, they described how to regulate the inputs and valves of a microfluidic chip using an Tecan EVO 200.
The primary advantage of this solution is that it is better equipped to deal with small volumes, working with pipettes on the scale of 25-5000 μL. 3 In addition to the larger stepping accuracy, this solution is more precise compared to TERRA. Rather than exporting the output of the microfluidic chip, the output is transported downstream to the analytics section where it can be analyzed by the plate reader built into the LHS. However, this method requires a researcher to purchase the necessary hardware which can cost $100,000 or more. 3 This makes it extremely challenging for synthetic biologists to incorporate this process into their workflow.
The two primary advantages that TERRA has over this system are flexibility and cost"

7. In what way is this document useful to my iGEM project?
European Union
Our project is tackling two environmental problems: eutrophication and phosphorus reserves depletion. iGEM Manchester is designing phosphorus-accumulating bacterium, thus killing two birds with one stone. As part of our Integrated Human Practices, we will be creating a potential business model for our bacterium. This GMM Legislation Doc will help us massively in deciding where our potential business could be most easily set up from a legal point of view.
United States
Our project focuses on improving the wastewater treatment process. As such, knowing what legislation within the United States regulates the use of GMOs within the environment and with products such as drinking water is important if we wanted to make our project usable outside the laboratory.
Australia
The Macquarie University iGEM team is researching the use of genetically modified e-coli to produce hydrogen gas as a sustainable, zero-emission fuel source. Our prototype is an at-home refueling station that utilizes our technology to enable drivers of hydrogen-powered vehicles to refuel their vehicle at home. This document will be very helpful in developing our business plan as it will guide our decisions about consumer perceptions of GMO’s, laws that we need to consider and authoritative bodies that we will need to approach should we decide to produce and sell our product in overseas markets.

The tubes with the mixture were incubated at 55°C until the gel slices had completely dissolved. In between samples were vortexed, if fragement sizes were not too large. Since the color of the solution never changed, no pH adjustments had to be done. In the next step isopropanol was added (for 1 slice 200 μl; for 2 slices 300 μl) to the sample and mixed. For each sample a QIAquick spin column was placed into the vacuum manifold and the sample decanted to it to bind DNA. Vacuum was applied until the whole sample has been drawn through the column. For further purification samples were washed with 500 μl buffer QG and vacuum was applied. Afterwards 750 μl Buffer PE were added to the samples, let stand for 2-5 minutes and vacuum applied. To remove residual wash buffer, the columns were placed into collection tubes and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). Finally, the columns were put into clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and 20-30 μl water (55°C) were added to the center of the column. After letting the column stand for 1 minute it was centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the elute.
For larger DNA fragments, the QIAEX II® Gel Extraction Kit was used (suitable for 40 bp to 50 kbp). Solutions were prepared as advised in the instruction protocol. DNA bands were excised from the agarose gel with a clean and sharp scalpel and transfered to a microcentrifuge tube. After weighing the slices, buffer QX1 was added according to the DNA fragment size (6 volumes for <100 bp; 3 volumes for 100 bp – 4 kb; 3 volumes with 2 volumes of water for >4 kb). QIAEX II was vortexed for 30 seconds to resuspend the agent and added to the samples (10 μl QIAEXII for ≤2 μg DNA; 30 μl for 2–10 μg DNA; and an additional 30 μl for each additional 10 μg DNA). Subsequently the solution was mixed and incubated at 50°C for 10 min to solubilize the agarose and bind the DNA. Since we mainly used this kit for larger fragments, the resuspended pellet was only inverted and flicked to avoid shearing forces. We did not observe"

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," flux through ICL. The color indicates either the growth rate (A) in units hr -1 or fumarate production (B) in units mmol gDW -1 hr -1 . The circled area in both plots corresponds to the area with the highest growth rate.
Therefore, we conducted simulations where flux is forced through both reactions at the same time (fig. 5.3). These simulations were all conducted under the Night Δ zwf scenario. In plot 3A, the peak growth rate occurs where there is a small flux through MS and either a small or 0 flux through ICL, which is encircled in both plots. However, the direction of the flux through ICL within this optimal region has an effect on fumarate production. If ICL is in the reverse direction, fumarate production drops when compared to when ICL is off. On the other hand, if ICL is in the forward direction, there is a slight increase in production with increasing MS as well. One difference between 2A and 3A is that a small forward flux through ICL no longer leads to a reduced growth rate when MS also has a small flux. This implies that the detrimental effects of a forward flux through ICL when MS is off can be mitigated by a flux through MS. The takeaway from this figure is that expression of ICL may only be beneficial, in terms of fumarate production if MS is also expressed and ICL catalyzes in the forward reaction. A thermodynamic analysis of ICL under physiological conditions predicts that it will have a Gibbs Free energy ( Δ G) of -8.4 KJ/mol. This suggests that the reversibility of ICL will most likely not be the case in such a cell in vivo .
We have decided to put this new insight to the test by running dFBA simulations over a 24h circadian period (fig. 5.2). Comparisons were established for model variations constrained to mimick the following genotypes: Δ fumC , Δ fumC Δ zwf and Δ fumC Δ zwf expressing the complete shunt ( Δ fumC Δ zwf ::MS::ICL). Simulations were performed as previously described for figure 5.1 and both MS and ICL were modelled as irreversible and left unconstrained, i.e. at any given point they are not required to carry a flux. The analysis of these new batches of dFBA simulations clearly indicate that, during the day there is no difference between the models. But this is only so because during day"

Tsinghua-A,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"As function as posttranscriptional regulators which have distinguished features compared to transcriptional regulators, intervening late in gene expression process, with the capability to counteract variation from the upstream processes (Margaret et al., 2012). Research shows that while conducting experiment on an incoherent feedforward motif in mammalian cells, posttranscriptional regulation results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression levels and lower intrinsic fluctuations (Bleris et al., 2011). miRNAs can serve as buffers against variation during gene expression; transient increases in transcription factor activity would propagate to increases in target miRNA transcription while would be counteracted by increased miRNA and vice versa. Therefore, under the miRNA posttranscriptional regulation, protein output can be uncoupled from fluctuations in transcription factor concentration or activity (Margaret et al., 2012). miRNAs also possess good stability which, consistent with theoretical constraints, meets the need for enough molecules of a regulator to achieve a small reduction in the noise of a target gene (Lestas et al., 2010).
Experimental Characterization
We took advantage of another fluorescent protein(mkate ) as reference gene, which has no influence in our design. Published literature generally supports the view that in transient transfections, fluorescence depends linearly on the copy number of transfected plasmids (Tseng et al, 1997; Pollard et al, 1998;Cohenet al,2009; Schwakeet al, 2010). While strictly speaking, this reporter level also depends on many other potentially fluctuating parameters such as global synthesis and degradation rates(Leonidas Bleris et al,2011),it is more legitimately use the normalized quotient to instead of the value of EYFP.
Apparently, the output of circuit C is lower than circuit B .Having the negative feedback compared with circuit B, the expression of EYFP in circuit A is strongest. Then we analysed the output of constructed designs varies with the DNA copy number. Facing with the difficulty of counting the copy number directly, we employed the reference gene to reflect .We think the copy number is high when the expression intensity of mkate is strong. One hundred thousand positive Hela cells was collected to obtain the relationship between EYFP and make.
From the figure 2, we learned that in circuit A, with the increase of the expression intensity of makte, the value of EYFP gradually reaches saturation. In another word, the circuit A’s output reaches saturation fast with the increase of copy number. We came to a conclusion circuit A’s adaptation to DNA"

Typically, 10ul of cwlD spores are added to the lysozyme and buffer solution.
After the addition of L-alanine to the solution (which would initiate germination), the solution should be left in the incubator for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, the eppendorf tube containing the solution should be spinned down for approximately a minute.
Note: Another eppendorf tube containing water should be placed on the opposite site to balance out the weight.
After spinning down the solution, the supernatant should be removed and the spores should be resuspended in 1000ul of LB.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," positive bacterial strain, lysostaphin does not show any antimicrobial activity. As a final control, BL21 (DE3) only expressing HlyA and HlyB/D (without lysostaphin), was co-cultured with S. aureus (see 2.2 SA). Around these E. coli colonies, no halo formation can be observed again illustrating that the lysostaphin component of the fusion proteins contains the lytic effect selectively against S. aureus, and HlyA is not toxic. Due to the old BioBrick  BBa_K748002 not having a secretion tag, secretion would not have been possible even in the presence of the secretion system. Moreover, our initial protein expression experiments on BBa_K748002 did not demonstrate any lysostaphin production. There would not have been anything to secrete. Therefore, there would have been nothing to compare and this experiment was not performed.
In conclusion, our codon optimisation improved the expression of the lysostaphin domain considerably as we observed convincing lysostaphin production. In contrast, the original BioBrick did not show any protein production. However, in our eyes the most valuable functional improvement of this part over BBa_K748002 is the ability of lysostaphin to be secreted, which is obviously not possible for the BBa_K748002 part lacking the HlyA domain. Additionally, the use of cell lysis to release lysostaphin is no longer required, functionally improving the truncated lysostaphin construct from iGEM Harbin 2012 which required cell lysis for release in their system. Besides release, isolation of lysostaphin with this newly designed construct is also easier as purification can be performed directly from the medium, avoiding the requirement of cell lysis and decreasing purification problems.

Is genetically modified crop (GMC) ecologically safe?  More research is needed.
Chun-Yao Chen, Department of Life Science, Tzu-Chi University
This issue can be examined at four levels.
1. Will the GMC survive and outcompete local plants?
These crop species are generally less fit in the environments when compared with the indigenous species, therefore we probably spare ourselves from worrying about their direct impact on local community.
2. Will the indigenous plant species acquire the transgene?
It is widely accepted that genes can be transferred from crops to their wild relatives[1].  The resulting hybridization, if followed by polyploidization, can stabilize and keep the gene in the population. Changes in relative fitness of this genetic transfer and the potential ecological consequences, as well as how to streamline decision-making processes for transgenes that could cause unwanted ecological change, has becoming an emerging focus of research [2].
3. Will the transgenic plants affect the insect community?
The strategic use of transgene, for example Cry toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), to help the crop ward off insect pest has been successful. The use of Bt crops results in significant reductions of insecticide use, which is beneficial to the environment [3]. However, they also found changes in insect community composition, in that abundance of some beneficial insects increased. More research effort is needed to clarify and calculate the risk.
4. Will the transgene affects the plant-microbe interaction?
Highly diversified microbiota can be seen in plant rhizosphere, and is known to be affected by root/plant physiology. A study has shown that cultivating Bt cotton did not adversely affect the soil microbiota [4]. However another study using genetically modified poplar detected changes in microbial composition [5]. GMC affected growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and may affect fungal diversity after long-term cultivation [6]. Still, more research effort is needed to clarify and calculate the risk.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some of     the parts distributed are known to be nonfunctional. Web pages for parts     contain lots of information, but majority of them, are again not ordered.     Moreover, some additional information had to be removed or replaced     in such a way that the information for parts can be used effectively.     And removal of the redundant bulk information related with parts at     iGEM’s web site had been recommended for future.
Although, the final standardization, which we have suggested is not     for general public use and it was urgently needed in order to satisfy     the needs of our algorithm. But, still it will be a valuable resource,     since it summarizes the basic information about the parts.
As the first step to build the proposed standardization template,     the headings selected related to parts are listed on Table 1. Submission     of part IDs for individual parts is an accepted and quite valuable way     of tracking information. Although, every part has unique partID, for     every part there is a need to assign unique part names as official iGEM     names. Part names will have an important role as they will be providing     the short description about the part, which synthetic biologists can     immediately recognize and utilize during the construction of unique     Biobricks. Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify     the devices with more than one Biobrick in their constructs. Assignment     of unique and distinct names for parts describing their nature and content     will be helpful to researchers for the recognition of and search for     the parts.

Table 1: The table above basically describes and designates     qualities of parts which identifies their compositions and demonstrates     the status of previously assigned standards. PartID refers to the unique     ID number for parts including atomic parts and assemblies. PartName     refers to the given unique names to parts. Bricks, refers to the shortcut     names which specifies atomic parts. ImageIDs, refers to individual or     combination of numbers that are assigned by us. RFCs refers to the states     of parts based on RFC standards.
iGEM both provides individual, atomic parts and pre-combined constructs     such as devices and systems. Availability of combined constructs is     important to the researchers as combining individual bio-bricks one"

9. Afterwards the lysate was spun down in a J25.50 rotor at 15000rpm at 4oC for 40 minutes.
10. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a 50ml falcon tube. The pellet was kept for testing. Both were kept on ice.
11. Using FPLC, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ column.
12. The protein was eluted using an increasing concentration of imidazole. The two buffers used were Buffer A: 50mM Tris, 200mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole and     Buffer B: 50mM Tris, 200mM NaCl, 1M Imidazole. (Note: If purifying a membrane protein 0.02% DDM was added to these buffers.)
13. The fractions corresponding to any peaks were retained and concentrated using an appropriate filter size. A small amount of each fraction could be ran     on an SDS gel at this stage.
14. Using FPLC, the sample was then loaded onto a SEC column and any fractions corresponding to a peak were ran on an SDS gel to check for the presence of     the desired protein.
15. Fractions containing the desired protein were collated, to which 20% glycerol was added.
16. The samples were then flash frozen and stored at -80oC.

Safety Considerations
Safety considerations of E.coli DH5α
Most E.coli strains are harmless and normally part of human gut flora. However, environmental strains such as serotype O157:H7 can cause serious food poisoning in humans. The genetic set up of the E.coli laboratory strain DH5α has been engineered in such a way, that it can be considered as a safe laboratory strain, if standard safety protocols are followed. Moreover E.coli is one of the most used laboratory strains and requires only a biosafety level 1 laboratory. This fact alone eliminates most safety issues with regard to laboratory applications like in our case.
The genetic characteristics of the DH5α strains are:
F- endA1 glnV44 thi-1 recA1 relA1 gyrA96 deoR nupG Φ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169, hsdR17(rK- mK+), λ–
Amongst the most important genetic modifications is F-, which denotes the strain´s inability to develop F-pili. This prevents transfer of genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Another important genetic modification is recA1, making the DH5α strain recombination deficient, preventing recombination of the plasmid into the E.coli genome so that the plasmid inserts are more stable. This leaves DH5α also very sensitive to UV-light as a result of the strains inability to undergo recombination, thereby impairing its DNA repair mechanism.
With regard to its prospective use as a biosensor within industrial, environmental, medical or food applications safety aspects have to be reconsidered and implemented in product development strategies. For example if our E.coli biosensor would be deployed as an oral drug it will be necessary to prevent the bacteria spreading to other parts of the human body or giving rise to an immune response. A possible solution to these problems could be to encapsulate the bacteria in some way or/and to limit the number of bacteria reproduction cycles.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Is synthetic biology the best solution?
Not yet. PHB has never been produced from leachate, but it is likely that mixed cultures would still be better for leachate treatment. Leachate treatment may require synthetic biology to confer toxin resistance to select organisms in these mixed cultures.

OUTER SPACE
Demand
Waste management is an issue in space, as future interplanetary travellers will be producing waste over long periods of time. Storage of the waste is not the best solution, and ejecting it into space cannot occur when astronauts are on the surface of another planet like Mars. Burying human waste raises the ethical issue of possibly polluting a foreign environment; therefore, remediation of the waste is the best option. With regards to the material produced after the remediation, bioplastics can be used in space the same way that traditional petroleum-based plastics can. One benefit to utilizing bioplastics such as PHB in space is that powdered PHB can be used to 3D-print materials needed by astronauts. In addition, byproducts like water can be remediated to product potable sources, and solid waste can be converted to char via torrefaction for use as radiation shielding, building materials, or food substrates.
Cost
There is a high cost associated with developing an entire waste-to-product system from scratch. However, creating a larger bioplastic production system for human colonies on Mars would ultimately decrease the cost of raw material that needs to be shipped into space. According to NASA, the cost of shipping supplies to space using SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is $27,000 per pound. The costs saved by producing 41 kg of PHB in space would then be about $2,440,000. Our team contacted a 3D printing company called 4G Vision Tech that uses selective laser sintering (SLS), which can be used to 3D print with PHB (Pereira et al., 2012). Howard from 4G Vision Tech approximated that the predicted amount of PHB can be used to create approximately 50 hydroponic systems and 20 general tools like wrenches, hammers, and scissors.

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#project#fungal sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," encoded in the genome of P. putida KT2440 which should confer fusaric acid resistance based on in silico prediction. The corresponding genes are all found placed in an operon cluster starting from pp1263 to pp1266 [4]. Upstream of this region and transcribed to the opposite direction we found the pp1262 gene whose predicted function is a LysR-type regulator.
Based on the above predictions and the gene topology, we hypothesized that since fusaric acid resistance from this cluster has not been confirmed through experiments it was worth to try to check if the theoretical regulator pp1262 can control the expression of the gene cluster through a promoter in the intergenic area. Based on this hypothesis, expression of the pp1262 protein should repress transcription of the operon cluster in the absence of fusaric acid. On the other side, when fusaric acid is present, repression should be relieved. To further support that this is how the system works and that fusaric acid does not activate the regulator leading to higher transcription rates of the resistance cluster, we expect that when the regulator is overexpressed in P. putida, it causes lower fusaric acid resistance because of lower depression rate of the promoter (Figure 1). Hence, we isolated pp1262 and the intergenic region and put it into a BioBrick, effectively acting together as a fusaric acid inducible promoter (FAiP).
Figure 1. Hypothetical fusaric acid efflux pump operon present in the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. When fusaric acid enters the cell, the inhibition of the efflux pump is inhibited and the efflux pump is transcribed, resulting in the excretion of fusaric acid out of the cell. For the sensing part of this iGEM project, only the detection part is used.
We decided to test and characterize the fusaric acid sensitivity and expression of this part by using different levels of fusaric acid. The promoter was tested using GFP and RFP reporter genes ( BBa_I13507 , BBa_I13504 , BBa_J23100 ) as output. Each BioBrick part contains our promoter, an RBS, a reporter gene and two terminators (Figure 2). The new constructs were expressed in P. putida to test for expression in the presence of fusaric acid.

On the gel, the BFP+Term RD looked exactly like before, having a very small insert(100-200 bp).  The pTet+_FPc RD looked great and the DNA was extracted.  The rest of the day was spent doing a CIP reaction with the B0015 terminator so that we can avoid having the backbone re-ligate on itself.

Target issue
More and more people are now paying attention to the impact of CO2.                                     The trend of environmental degradation is gradually increasing.                                     Scientist and national worldwide contribute to capture those excessive CO2.                                     However, how to reduce carbon and use it has become a major problem today.                                     Challenges against carbon process are complicate. Except the technique and                                     implement problem,                                     social acceptability and policy are other key factors about carbon process                                     technology.
In general, planting is a method of carbon process,                                     and the current use of green algae as a method of carbon utilization.                                     This year, we hope to combine synthetic biology with the most advanced                                     technologies.                                     We want to draw people's attention to the environment and reuse these                                     environmentally                                     stimulating projects.

Cost Evaluation
The cost evaluation is always crucial for product being on the                                     market.                                     To compare our engineered E. coli to microalgae,                                     we calculate how much the cost it would be when capturing 1 ton of CO2.

It seems that the difference                                         volume required for utilizing same amount of CO2 is disadvantage of E. coli carbon utilization system.

For microalgae culture, it                                         requires a large surface area to increase light intensity.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#EngineeringJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," with discrete time and space. Since TALE is immobilized to the strip, with each time increment the DNA moves according to the movement rule specified by me, and when certain conditions are met it can either be bind to TALE permanently or can exit the strip. The difficulty was to translate those rules to the transition matrix, whose n-th power gives us the probability of state transition after n-th time increment, which we can obtain the probability of DNA capture. This model essentially hides irrelvent details such as how TALE binds to DNA, and focus on the efficiency of DNA biding directly. The probability of DNA capture obtained from the model can be tested against empirical data such that certain parameters (i.le. the rules) can be modified to better describe reality.
So far a model with hard-coded constants was constructed as a proof of concept. The revision of the code with functions were paritially done but was not tested for all combinations of TALE and DNA. So far the model has only considered 1 TALE and 1 DNA, with the movement rule being Brownian motion type, with no TALE-DNA dissociation, with no ¡°noise¡± or false DNA possible for binding, with no DNA and strip interaction. But those are future directions that I can work on to sophisticate the model.
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
After the quantitative modelling was presented to the entire team on Monday, some senior memebers gave us some great suggestions. One of them requested the implementation of the concept of saturation of TALE such that per one TALE at most one DNA can be bind to it. Although looks simple to implement but in reality it increases the computational effort significantly. If there are n possible states for DNA to be with an unsaturated TALE, then another n states with saturated TALE needs to be included in the state transition matrix. This effectively doubles the number of states needed and quadruples the number of calculations. Given that TALE and DNA will be much smaller than the space we consider, a large number of states will be necessary, which translates that the computational effort will be enormous. Here Dr. Nygren's suggestion of using Partial Differential Equations for the modelling of diffusion and reaction might be appropriate, except the parameters of the detailed DNA TALE binding scheme were not found.
After few days of research and thinking, two approaches seem to be worth a try: either do Monte Carlo simulations of the discretized system, or Bayesian network to exploit the overlapping sub-problems. For Monte Carlo simulations would be straight forward to code, for it simply describes the system in computer"

Integrated Human Practices
The development of our project has been closely related to our human practices. We have made an effort to consider as many elements outside the lab as possible. Please visit our Silver page and our Project Justification .
1.- Formation of the team
Our team was formed in quite an interesting way. We didn't start with iGEM, but at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP13-MOP8-MOP2). On december 2016, we attended this event as youth delegates of the Public Research and Regulation Initiative (PRRI), which, in collaboration with the ISAAA delegation, took an international group of young science students to introduce us to how biotechnology and synthetic biology regulations take place. We sure learned a lot about biodiversity and its international regulations. However, this experience quickly opened our eyes and we soon became aware that there is a widespread negative perspective on synthetic biology, mainly from activist groups and also from country representatives. But it didn't just end with that: there was also a big lack of participation from the scientific community and the young people regarding the regulation processes that were taking place. And even worse … we witnessed the proposal of a moratorium to Synthetic Biology!!!
Considering this a problem for the development of emerging technologies, something had to be done. We came back to our homes, inspired, conscious of the importance of effective science communication, and with the conviction to do something to make a change. It was then when we decided to create Youth Biotech, an international association that focuses on science communication, science regulation and science development. Today, it has presence in 15 different countries. Under the science development track we founded the PHAgave project.
We believe in international cooperation as the best mechanism of growth, success and evolution, therefore, we have built up a team that meets this belief. Our team instructors and advisors come from different parts of the world; like Panama, Germany and the United Kingdom; or have been involved with international institutions such as Stanford, McGill University, University of Edinburgh, The Global Biotech Revolution, and of course, have a vast experience at iGEM"

Consideration of Safety
After playing cards with the students, we were able to have a talk with the school principal and vice principal. They appreciated us for creating cards and teaching the students about synthetic biology in a simple and approachable way.
It was their first time to learn about synthetic biology in detail, so the principals were impressed of the possibility of this field. However, they had doubts about the safety using genetically engineered creatures. Since those creatures do not exist in nature, we do not know what will happen when they are released into the wild. If something happens, it might take a long time to get the previous nature back. Many people have this fear of genetic engineering, and this leads to the bad image of synthetic biology. Based on these doubts, we explained to them the scientists’ measurements for safety. When we make a discovery, for example “iPS cells”, we consider if it is okay to use them for human or nature on a long-term basis. Just like inventing a new medicine, we have to test them on animals for more than ten years, and when the safety is"

(a) Fluorescence monitored over time for cell lines incorporating the pT181 system with pT181 antisense. It shows that the GFP can be expressed in the pT181-attenuator, and the expression level increases gradually. (b) Fluorescence monitored over time for cell lines incorporating     the pT181 system without pT181 antisense. It matches the curve of how GFP’s expression increases without being repressed, which establishes foundation for measure the repression effect of pT181-attenuator. (c) The combination of (1) and (2). We could see the sharp difference in the fluorescence between the two     curves. This proves our pT181 could repress the expression of GFP as expected, which means our part C is able to produces repression effect as anticipated. This shows that the controller in our Three-Node Feedback Loop is constructed successfully.

Overview
We have developed a system by which PHB can be recycled when products made from it come to the end of their life. In order to do this, we have engineered E.coli to break down P3HB extracellularly to release the monomers of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB). We have designed the metabolic connection between P3HB degradation and synthesis so that 3-HB can be used as a carbon source. We are testing a putative 3-HB permease to increase the rate of uptake of the molecule into the cell. An intracellular 3-HB dehydrogenase will then form acetoacetate from 3-HB which the cell can utilise. We have thoroughly characterised the phaZ1 PHB depolymerase enzyme and demonstrated that it degrades PHB. Our models predict that use of the enzyme on a bioreactor scale will be effective in degrading bioplastic.
We are also establishing a second bioplastic recycling platform for polylactic acid (PLA)
This aspect of our module is in collaboration with the Yale iGEM team.

Augusto cotransformated the plasmid from Mr.gene, harboring the LuxY with the plasmid sent by Cambridge containing luxABCDE genes. The cotransformation was successful, but we have not been able to see the yellow glowing phenotype yet, it is still green-blue. We have to improve the experimental conditions, particulary the temperature because LuxY is not functional above 20°C.  We hope to use a CCD camera for the bioluminescence measurment.

Lumazine
In order to transfer Lumazine construction from Mr. Gene plasmid to pSB1C3 backbone and test that it works correctly, the next protocol was implemented:
Experimental Procedure
3 September 2010
1. Amplify by PCR reaction the Lumazine construction, using Mr. Gene plasmid as template and the  prefix and suffix sequences as primers.
7 September 2010
2.Digest the PCR product with EcoRI and PstI and ligate it to pSB1C3 backbone previously digested (EcoRI/PstI) and dephosphatated.
3. Incubate the ligation mixture at 16°C overnight.
4. Transform the cells.
5. Culture the cells in the proper selective medium.
6. Incubate the petri dishes at 37°C overnight.
7. Re-culture the resultant colonies in the proper selective medium; incubate them at 37°C overnight.
This ligation was intented several times due to problems with the pSB1C3 backbone samples used and to the ligase enzyme.
30 September 2010
8. Analyze the colonies with Colony PCR to confirm that they contain the correct ligation
Primers:  Forward (5'->3'): Preffix primer.  Reverse:(5'->3'): Suffix primer.
9.Isolate the corresponding plasmid and digest it, to test that the insert is around the expected size.
10. Co-transform the plasmid haboring Lumazine with LuxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri.

Introduction of new approach for vector design by Volker
multiple cloning site is modified before cloning to fulfill iGEM standards
lab work aiming vector improvement starts June 13th (Saskia, Daniela)
primers have to be redesigned to match the new standard and have to be ordered AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
Planning of lab work
Quick change mutagenesis will be used to eliminate restriction sites that do not match iGEM standard
Meeting for lab members that will start their work this week: June 13th, 3 pm
Some groups got their primers approved by Prof. Skerra (Coumaryl), some need further planning (Thaumatin, Light-Inducible Promoter)
Primer design
Everyone should use the same stop codon (TAA)
6 bases should be added to the primer ends (not GCGCG, but rather another restriction site)
N-end rule
Groups should consider the N-end rule while planning their primers
If protein contains an glutamic acid or similar amino acid at the N-terminus, a small amino acid like alanine could be introduced N-terminally
this might lead to increase in protein stability!
check with information provided by Ingmar on the main page
Codon optimization
We have to look up a table containing codons preferred by yeast
Uli Binder (employee of Prof. Skerra) can be contacted concerning codon optimization
Also remember the online tool GCUA (Graphical Codon Usage Analyser) which can be found here: http://gcua.schoedl.de/
Lab book
Discussion about whether lab book should be digitally or handwritten
lab team that starts this week will use an ordinary lab book (one book each)
digitalisation must be discussed in next meeting!
Brewing process
our yeast strain is a top-fermented yeast. Top-fermented yeasts allow for fast brewing. BUT: Does our yeast grow in Gyle medium that is used in the brewing process?
our two new team members (brewing students) will contact Simon concerning the yeast strain and will start an experiment to get information about growth behavior of ""our"" yeast in Gyle medium
other things that need to be discussed:
Is a specialized brewing yeast strain available that is fully sequenced?
How can we make sure that the beer will be sterile and free of genetically engineered yeast?

""Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.""
Synthetic biology has its unique magic:  every element works together for one purpose in the system we design, just like an imaginative idea can act as a magnet to draw people together. Involving the public stays on in our mind. In this spirit, we delivered a set of lectures and mini-labs to students of all ages to unlock a world of synthetic biology for juniors. Excitedly, vibrant students from High School Affiliated to Fudan University applauded the idea of synthetic biology and newly established an iGEM team on our instruction. In addition, inspired by the principle of opening science, we interviewed Ms. Shi, a doctoral student in pharmacy, revealing the true living and studying condition of common sci-researchers in China to people outside the industry. Finally, some artwork was created to help explain our STEP system to the public, saturated in the two-way constructing process of humanity and technology.
1. An image of sci-researchers in China
In our wildest dream of childhood, there always existed a profession named ‘scientist’. But only a few of us hold on to it ultimately. Researchers are always a mystery to the public. In public mind they are a group of people burying themselves in labs and isolated from normal society. Nevertheless, the truth is far from that while the public has started to think differently. Rooted in China, we focus on the topic Society, Research, Researchers to reveal the true living condition of sci-researchers in China today.
Begin Reading
In the meeting with Shi, a typical doctoral student of pharmacy, we discover the change of public attitude towards the field of research. What’s their working pattern? How do they step into this field? What do their future look like? Her one-step-at-a-time experience gave the answer.

Figure 1.2 | Figure1.2 It separately describes how the proportion of substrate “PB” and product “LR” in total DNA varies within 10 hours. The red line represents the concentration proportion of the product, “LR”. More calculation details about this graph are attached to the back.
Then, we improve the origin model by adding gene expressing and other biochemical reaction to predict the theoretical efficiency of the integrase in vivo.
We are not sure whether the integrase is effective as we expect in the coli, even if it prefers well in vitro, so we try to build a more integrated model. Considering that the factors in the coli are so complicated, we merely select the fairly significant factors as the component of our model, including the gene expression, the change of the promoter’s activity and the dilution and the digestion of the protein.
Finally, we get the exciting results of the model shown in the figure3. The transformation rate can reach to nearly 100 percent in 5 hours. The mathematical demonstration will explain how the factors in vivo help to shift the equilibrium forward.

Second part [ Details ]
In this part, we use the diffusion model to solve an experimental problem.
Although the models above can describe the whole process of our system in general, the experimental data still do not perform so well as our expectation because all the promoters are leaked. According to this case, we come up with an assumption that the diffusion of the repressor results in the lower concentration around the promoter than the one in center of the gene site where the repressor protein produced. Therefore, the lower concentration of repressor causes the high probability of separation between the repressor and promoter. That explains why the promoters are leaked seriously.
In order to describe the change of the concentration with the distance in cell, we build a diffusion model. We find that the concentration of the repressor will decline rapidly due to the diffusion. However, when there is a source in the center, for example the translation of mRNA causes a steady flow of repressor produced, the concentration distribution will get constant in the end. The results are shown in figure3.2.

Operational sequence:
First of all, the dried extract was solved in 200 µl of 70% methanol, mixed and than transferred into small glass tubes (LCMS tubes) and applied to the LCMS machine.
Results:
There were indeed two signals for theobromine and caffeine, howerver, these signals appeared in all samples, suggesting that it is not specific and belongs to the ""background"". A reason could be that the applied substrate xanthosine was not totally clean and contained small amounts of caffeine. If the enzymes had worked probably, we would have expected more significant signals. A reason could be that we had stored the enzymes for mor than two weeks at -80°C after the cell lyses and before using them for the enzyme assay. Maybe the experiment should be repeated with fresh isolated enzymes.
Analysis of yeasts' genome integration
Investigators: Martin
Aim: Study of genome integration Procedure: The clones of the experiment before were incubated in an over night culture, diluted to OD600 = 0.4 and put on a plate with G418 again to study the perseverance of antibiotics tolerance
Results: Of an overall number of 36 clones the experiment started with, 5 were already lost after the over night incubation (probably because of pipetting mistakes during the inoculation procedure on the 96-well plate). Of the 31 remaining plates, 21 were empty. The cfu of the positive plates were:

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"uB riboswitch will be used to design a system that will start gene expression in the presence of vitamin B12. For the guanine riboswitch the xpt-buX operon of Bacillus subtilis 4 has been used. E.coli possesses guanine receptors 5 , so no additional transporters are needed.
The riboswitches regulate gene expression at the translation level 6 , so they need to be constitutively transcribed. Therefore, a promoter of the Anderson constitutive promoter family was placed in front of the riboswitch. It is the consensus constitutive promoter family of iGEM, it is well documented and the amount of expression differs 2500 fold between different promoters. It can also be easily swapped for another promoter of the same family if a different amount of expression is needed 7 . This is convenient since the optimal expression level of the toxin gene is not known yet.
Riboswitches are known to be able to both start and stop gene expression upon binding to specific ligands. Both the guanine and vitamin B12 riboswitch stop expression after binding to the metabolites 4 , 5 . In order for the system to work upregulating gene expression, the TetR Quad-part inverter system has been used. Quad-part inverters, or QPI, are genetic regulatory inverters that consists of a ribosome binding site, a coding region for a repressor protein, a terminator and a promoter that is regulated by the encoded repressor protein 7 . The TetR system was used since it is widely used and characterized as a well-functioning inverter 8 . Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the system with the riboswitch, TetR QPI and monomeric Red Fluorescent Protein or mRFP.
Figure 1. Schematic overview of the mite sensing system based on riboswitch
An often encountered problem when creating a novel combination of genetic elements is the fact that even seemingly simple genetic functions behave differently in different settings 9 . Therefore, the behaviour of the designed construct could be different than expected. To make the system more stable or increase the chance that the system behaves as designed, the riboswitch system will be made bicistronic. This means that two genes are under the control of one promoter. In this case, the sequence of the riboswitches has been cloned together with fifty amino acids downstream of the riboswitch in the original genomic sequence of B. Subtilis and E. coli. Adding fifty amino acids to the system means an increase of protein production for the cell"

When induced, we expect the half-life of the switch in the original message, once received by primary receivers, to be short. In absence of induction, we expect half-life to be long.
We simulated the system with varying switch half-life, for short and long half-life (Figure 5 a and b). The system performance measure was the ratio of secondary receivers that receive Mmod vs Mori, expressed as P2 mod/P2 ori, measured at the time when all secondary receiver cells have received a message. For these simulations modification and retransmission were induced, and the rate of particle production in primary receivers was assumed to be 50% of the rate in senders. Initial populations of senders, primary receivers, and secondary receivers were assumed to be 1000, 10000, and 1000 cells/mL respectively.
Figure 5. Switch half-life in primary receivers plotted against the ratio of secondary receivers that received Mmod vs Mori for a) short and b) long half-life.
We note that sensitivity to switch half-life is high for short half-life and low for long half-life. Increasing responsiveness of the switch to induction gives increasingly better returns by increasing receipt of Mmod, while reducing unwanted switch flipping due to basal integrase expression gives diminishing returns in preventing receipt of Mmod.
Conclusions
Analysis of our model indicates that,
Delivery of Mmod to secondary receivers is most sensitive to reduced M¬mod transmission efficiency that may result from tinkering with the M13 genome when efficiency is very low. As expected, increasing Mmod transmission efficiency improves delivery of Mmod.
A large initial population of primary receivers with a low initial population of senders improves delivery of Mmod.
Most interestingly, we find that sensitivity of Mmod delivery to switch flipping rate is greatest for fast switch flipping rates and least for slow switch flipping rates. This indicates that improved responsiveness of switch flipping to induction produces increasing returns for system performance, but that improved resistance to uninduced switch flipping to prevent unwanted modification and retransmission produces diminishing returns.
The most significant result for design of this system is the sensitivity of M¬mod delivery to the rate of switch flipping. Leaky expression of integrase in primary receivers must be effectively avoided. Extra measures to prevent leak, such as the T3 promoter system or post-transcriptional regulation, should be employed. In light of the issues with basal integrase expression, this system is most ideal in situations where background levels of modification and retransmission are tolerable.

Those without the merRNA would adhere to the well and to each much more, which would result in a higher retention of crystal violet.  For bacteria with the merRNA, this reduction in biofilm formation would be indicated by a lower absorbance value at 550 nm of the dissolved crystal violet relative to bacteria without the merRNA.
Fig 1. Absorbance values at 550 nm of cells with and without the merRNA construct. JM109 and ZK1056 are both known to form rather robust biofilms, whereas ELS-30 is not. As such, ELS-30 was used as a control. Cultures were were started from 1:100 dilutions of JM109 and ZK1056 (with and without the merRNA) along with the ELS-30 control. These were grown under the appropriate antibiotic selection. 250 uL of each culture was aliquoted into wells on a nonbinding polystyrene 96-well plate. The cultures were grown at 30°C statically for 24 hours, after which time the planktonic bacteria suspended in LB were rinsed off. The bacteria that remained stuck to the well (those in a biofilm state) were stained with 275 uL 0.1% crystal violet. Excess crystal violet was then rinsed off. The crystal violet was dissolved in 300 uL 80% ethanol/20% acetone. 250 uL of this solution was transferred to a clear-bottomed well plate and the A550 was recorded with a plate reader.
These data indicate that, contrary to expectations, bacteria expressing the merRNA exhibited more robust biofilms than those without the merRNA. An approximately twofold increase in biofilm formation was seen for both JM109 and ZK1056. Since no significant difference was observed in the growth capacity of these cultures, cellular processes (rather than cell density) are believed to be responsible for the differential levels of biofilm formation.
Temperature Dependence
Fig 2. Absorbance at 550 nm of cells with and without the merRNA at 25°C. The same procedure detailed for Figure 1 was repeated at 25°C. Lower temperatures generally increase biofilm formation since cells are under unfavorable growing conditions. Although minor variable preclude direction comparisons to the initial trial at 30°C, the same relationships are seen in this trial.

Software
The arduino software our team used for the art installation is built on open source technologies. We are able to display the results of our data using inexpensive and easily accessible hardware by utilizing libraries created by developers from the DiY community. The software works in conjunction with the hardware by relating the concentrations of different elements found in the soil with the intensity of the light emitted by an array of LEDs, each of which represents a location sampled.

When meeting with iGEMers from Peking, BIT-China and Tianjin University, we were surprised to find that, much similar to our project, BIT-China was also working on a kill-switch based on TA modules. Characterizing varies toxins was one of the most important tasks for both teams. We measured growth curves by a 96-well microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Synergy H5), while BIT-China used traditional methods of taking a sample from a shake incubator for every 30 minutes or so.
So we helped them measure the growth curves of bacteria harboring their toxin gene, MazF. They chose three different RBSs, and we measured the growth curves of those three different bacteria. Using the 96-well microplate spectrophotometer, the value of OD600 was measured automatically for every ten minutes, making the plot more continuous, accurate and smooth. Setting three parallels, we showed that the measurement was quite repeatable. The graph was drawn using Prism 6.0. Fig. 3 shows that if toxin protein MazF is induced when the value of OD600 lies between 0.5-0.7, it instantaneously halts the growth of the curve, indicating strong growth arrest. Interestingly, if toxin is expressed at the beginning of the measurement, as Fig. 4 illustrates, the growth of bacteria was not immediately suppressed, which is quite different from the toxins we used. The growth patterns in the first 200 minutes are not observably different from Control. This result is in accordance with BIT-China’s data.

During CCiC at SYSU this September, we talked about our hardware design, a miniature aeration tank from waste water treatment plants. To our surprise, we got some quite useful feedbacks from Nanjing-China. They generously shared their experience of building a similar device in their last year’s project. Such details as materials for fillers have never been considered by us before. They gave us information about the effect of different fillers, which did inspire us a lot, and freed us from fruitless trial-and-error experiments. So their suggestions saved a lot of time for us, for we can spare more time on improving the design and construct of our own device.

Figure 12. The variation of chromoprotein after induced 300 min
Figure 13 The color of non-tag, AAV tail and LVA tail after induced 720 minutes
As shown in the Figure 12, both blue chromoprotein with LVA tail and AAV tail had less accumulation amount than the group of no-tail, which indicated both LVA tail and AAV tail can rise the degradation rate of the chromoproteins. In addition, blue chromoprotein with LVA tail had an even lower accumulation in host cells compared to blue chromoprotein with AAV tail. It was speculated that the LVA tail provided a higher degradation rate. In conclusion, the tails can speed up the degradation process of chromoprotein, and LVA tail is highly effective in protein degradation, whereas in our project the AAV tag was chosen to gain a balance between clear color performance and high speed of degradation. Figure 13 shows the color of non-tag, AAV tail and LVA tail after induced 720 minutes.

We call these new types of sensors, “intelligent biosensors”, because they have the ability to react in different ways depending on their surroundings.
With our project we hope to continue with the previous efforts of other iGEM teams, and at the same time propose a new type of genetic circuit for achieving these functions. In the process we plan to develop BioBricks for two new families of phage activators as well as different BioBrick constructons that can make our system easy to adapt, so that the creation of these “intelligent biosensors” becomes just a matter of choosing the substance of interest and choosing the different reporters.

We are planning to provide this information about     the parts to all parts registry users as a build-in option in the next     version of BioGuide in iGEM 2011.
Database Standardization
Two main focuses of our project was the organization of the available     information about Biobricks on iGEM’s website and development of a software     application to help synthetic biologists at the experimental set-up     level by providing all available construct combinations for any given     input and output relations ,which they can utilize for their own project.
Normalization and re-organization of the part information at iGEM’s     web site was needed in order to develop our application, which will     automatically search the possible construct combinations. For the organization     and analysis of the Biobricks, we used part info for Spring 2010 distribution.     The information on all three 384 well plates distributed by iGEM scrutinized     and checked individually to specify the standards available and needed.     iGEM is providing so many parts within a hierarchical way, but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some of     the parts distributed are known to be nonfunctional. Web pages for parts     contain lots of information, but majority of them, are again not ordered.     Moreover, some additional information had to be removed or replaced     in such a way that the information for parts can be used effectively.     And removal of the redundant bulk information related with parts at     iGEM’s web site had been recommended for future.
Although, the final standardization, which we have suggested is not     for general public use and it was urgently needed in order to satisfy     the needs of our algorithm. But, still it will be a valuable resource,     since it summarizes the basic information about the parts.
As the first step to build the proposed standardization template,     the headings selected related to parts are listed on Table 1. Submission     of part IDs for individual parts is an accepted and quite valuable way     of tracking information. Although, every part has unique partID, for     every part there is a need to assign unique part names as official iGEM     names. Part names will have an important role as they will be providing     the short description about the part, which synthetic biologists can     immediately recognize and utilize during the construction of unique     Biobricks. Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify    "

Since each Cas9’s hotspots where on gBlocks 2 and 3, we planned an assembly strategy in which we could exchange gBlocks 1 and 4 for assembling two complete dCas9 protein with different insertion frames at the studied hotspots. We based in Golden Gate Assembly Method for designing our gBlocks and we used Weber et.al (2011) fusion sites stragety.
Each of our gBlocks has BsaI recognition sites at its start and end; the “start” recognition sites from each gBlock are inverted so that the recognition sites can be lost after the Golden Gate reaction. As its shown in Figure 3, each of the 6 gBlocks has different fusion sites, which where added next to each BsaI recognition site.
In our assembly strategy, by performing a Golden Gate reaction with BsaI enzyme and the gBlocks 1, 2A, 3A and 4, we would obtain our A version dCas9 that includes L 390 and E802 hotspots; and by assembling gBlocks 1, 2B, 3B and 4, we would obtain our B version dCas9, that has hotspots N588 and N888.
Figure 3. dCas9’s gBlock Golden Gate assemble strategy.

Because we wanted to insert proteins in each of dCas9’s hotspots, we designed two insertion windows inside each dCas9 protein sequence. A-dCas9 has two insertion windows: one from amino acid 1 to 60 that contains L390 hotspot and other from 248 to 266, which contains E802 site. On the other hand, B-dCas9 has its insertion frames from amino acid 583 to 601, that includes N588 hotspot and from 882 to 908, which includes the hotspot N888.
These insertion frames are flanked by BbsI recognition sites; the “start” recognition sites of each frame are inverted so that the recognition sequences can be lost after this second Golden Gate reaction, leaving a functional dCas9 with two protein insertions. Figures 4 and 5 show A and B version of complete dCas9 with their insertion frames assemble strategy.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

However, this is the closest we managed to get as far as species, substrate and type of plastic are concerned.
Also, it was noticed that the molecular weight would change depending on the cultivation time (as conditions such as growth and pH can also affect it) and it was hard to find a paper that contains the exact same conditions and the range of cultivation times for our simulations.  Furthermore, in reality there wouldn't be a single value of molecular weight obtained, but a range of values (known as polydispersity). [65] Therefore, it was assumed that the molecular weight would remain constant during the time course of the simulation and that the value should be considered as an average.)

Project Summary
Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. As a matter of fact, constructing a bioreporter bacteria that has the ability to detect toxic chemicals is considered one of the first accomplishments in the discipline of synthetic biology (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) . There are several advantages to using a bacterial bioreporter instead of a traditional physical or chemical sensors, for example, bacteria can offer the same specificity and sensitivity that traditional sensors offer, but they are much more portable and grow in inexpensive media. Furthermore, bacterial reporters also offer advantages over using other types of biosensors like enzymes and antibodies because they are living organisms and they are capable of analyzing samples through a process that involves many enzymes (Yagi, 2007)
The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) although these early tests didn’t use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the areas of genetic engineering and synthetic biology have resulted in many more applications such as detection of contaminants (Willardson, et. Al., 1998) and sugar and amino acid availability in soils (Jaeger, et. Al., 1999) . Even though the reporters have gotten more sophisticated and sensitive, we realized that there isn’t much mention of a single bacterial bioreporter capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting differently depending on the concentration.
We thought the use of synthetic biology as well as the BioBrick standard could help create a “genetic circuit” (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting in a different manner depending on the amount detected.

8. Agarose Gel DNA Extraction
Agarose gel is prepared using TAE buffer or TBE buffer, then agarose gel electrophoresis is performed on the target DNA.
Cut the agarose gel containing the target DNA under the UV lamp and suck the liquid on the gel surface with a paper towel. At this point, we should pay attention to the removal of the gel which does not contain the target DNA, minimize the gel volume and increase the DNA recovery rate. When glue blocks exceed 300 mg, use more than one Column Recycling, otherwise seriously affecting the yield. Note: when cutting, please be careful not to expose the DNA to UV light for a long time to prevent DNA damage.
Shredding the gel block. When the adhesive block is chopped up, the dissolution time of the block in the operation step 6 can be accelerated, and the DNA recovery rate can be improved.
Weighing the weight of the glue block and calculating the volume of the glue block. When calculating the volume of the block, 1mg=1μL is used to calculate.
Buffer GM are added into the gel block, and the amount of solution Buffer GM.
After mixing evenly at room temperature 15-25 degrees C dissolve glue block (glue concentration is more difficult to dissolve and can be heated at 37 C). At this point should be interrupted oscillation mixing, so that the block fully dissolved (about 5~10 minutes). Note: the block must be fully dissolved, otherwise it will seriously affect the recovery rate of DNA. High concentration gel can prolong the time appropriately.
When the gel is completely dissolved, observe the solution color, if the solution color changed from yellow to orange or pink, add 3 M sodium acetate solution to the rubber block solution (pH5.2) 10μL, mixed solution to restore yellow. When the DNA fragment is less than 400bp, the isopropanol with a final concentration of 20% should be added to the solution.

We decided that Pooja and Devina will be the primary programmers for the project. We also received a screencast from the Purdue Biomakers team! We discussed some of the advantages and disadvantages of the program. Thomas, who is from Indiana, is going to try to visit the Purdue team during a short break he is taking to go home. (Check out the the Summer Fun page to see who Thomas ran into at the Boston Logan Airport!)
Datasheet - August 13, 2013
Thomas visited Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana to meet with Charlotte Hoo and Chris Thompson of the Biomaker’s iGEM team. The teams mutually agreed that BostonU would take leadership on the implementation of the web application/Clotho app for the creation of new datasheets while Purdue would head up the distribution of the web app through the various connections they had made while seeking out preliminary feedback on early datasheet prototypes. Using the prototypes BU had as well as the various revisions other teams had suggested to Purdue, Thomas, Charlotte, and Chris reviewed the proposed changes and made a final draft of the datasheet in a MS Word document to show iGEM HQ later this week.
While BU has a good handle on necessary information for flow cytometry data and induction curves, Purdue is going to try to put together a set of standard data fields for mass spectrometry and reach out to other teams they have worked with to develop some standard data fields for other protocols often used to characterize devices.
Meanwhile, Devina and Pooja, with the help of our mentors Jenhan and Evan, have gotten a start on the web app back at Boston University.

Gibson Assembly
This assembly method is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By coordinating the activity of a 5‘ exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase two adjacent DNA fragments with complementary terminal sequence overlaps can be joined into a covalently sealed molecule, without the use of any restriction endonuclease.
Preparation of DNA molecules for in vitro recombination
Generate the complementary sequence overlaps by PCR using the Phusion DNA-polymerase . If necessary add 5 M Betain in the reaction mix by reducing the amount of H2O to decrease the number of false PCR products.
Identify the PCR products of interest by gel electrophoresis with known DNA standards.
Extract the PCR products from the gel by cutting out the DNA fragments and clean them up by using a commercial clean up kit .

This change actually changes the crRNA and  taRNA sequence and therefore could result to the deviated results. Another possibility is simply because the genetic context that we did our characterization was different from what  Isaac et al. used to characterize their riboregulator system. If this is the case, we can at least see that the system is not very modular: changing the genetic context can change  the fold increase.
The fluorescence after induction is still low compared to that of unrepressed controls.
Although we saw significant fold increase for two riboregulator systems that we have characterize, compared to the fluorescence of unrepressed controls, the fluorescence is very low.  For Lock 1-Key 1 riboeregulator system, the fluorescence after induction only correspond to around 0.4% of the that of the unrepressed control. For the Lock 3-Key3 system,   the value was around 0.3%. The lower expression partly is because of the lower mRNA levels. After the introduction of the cis-repressing sequence the mRNA level was 40% of   that of the controls (Isaacs et al., 2004). Another reason for low fluorescence after induction could have resulted because of our genetic context. We have used a relatively   strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23102 ) to express the crRNA and a relatively weak arabinose inducible promoter   ( BBa_I0500 ). This could have caused imbalance of crRNA and taRNA levels. We could have had lower taRNA level and therefore failed  to fully activate the riboregulator system. Further investigation is required. Simply changing the arabinose inducible promoter to a strong promoter can tell us whether this is the   case.
Different Lock-Key cognate pairs behaved differently to different arabinose concentration.
Lock 1- Key 1 riboregulator cognate pair was fully induced and leveled off at 1% arabinose concentration. For Lock 3- Key 3 pair, the full induction was observed at 2.5% arabinose  concentration. We did not conduct further investigation to understand the difference in the response. Further investigation on how changing the riboregulator sequence can change  the sensitivity of the system could be an interesting study.

Hypothesis 2: Bacterial proliferation of cumate regulatory system with BFP in medium containing cumate in a concentration gradient
Hypothesis 3: Measuring BFP fluorescence of cumate regulatory system in medium containing cumate in a concentration gradient
The main objective was to determine whether the gene expression of BFP was dose-dependent over time during the exponential phase and whether the presence of cumate in the bacterial medium affected growth. The cells were treated with different concentrations of p-cumate and the fluorescence was measured every 30 minutes after the initial incubation time for a total of 3 hours.
Bacterial growth was not affected by the cumate in the liquid medium. The fluorescence intensity follows the same trend in all samples, therefore the cumate-induced expression of BFP is not dose-dependent. Normally, we would expect to observe fluorescence only in the treated samples because with cumate present, the repressor is dissociated from the operon, enabling the transcription of the downstream gene. However, we assume that the CymR is mutated at a specific site based on the sequencing results; thus, the expressed protein is unable to bind to cumate in the first place, the T5 operon is not inhibited, and BFP is not expressed.
Figure 2.Growth curve of E.coli TOP10 over time in different cumate concentrations. There is no effect of cumate on the proliferation of the bacteria over time.
Figure 3.Expression of BFP in E.coli TOP10 in different cumate concentrations over time. The fluorescence intensity is higher in all samples compared to the negative control. Therefore, the expression of BFP is not dose-dependent and fluorescence can be detected even in the untreated sample.
Subsequent experiments should follow with a positive control (bacteria with tagBFP) to confirm our assumption that there is BFP expression in our system. Furthermore, another experimental setup could be employed for the same endpoint, such as longer incubation time with cumate.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," our cells show a specially high initial response, shown as an exponential function. This response maintains until the quantity of plasmids gets saturated and the protein production becomes then constant. Below we show a plot (figure 8) of the overall behaviour of the saturation of the plasmids on the cell.
As mentioned before, these results are in accordance with previous literature on the “fast/short-term” response of transcription factors YAP1P and SKN7 in OSR.
Discussion
The above presented model and simulations form a basis to a better understanding of the stress response mechanism in the cell via the Gpx3 increase and gene activation through transcription factors Yap1p and Skn7.
From the above simulation results we can make several observations:
The quantity of active genes depends on the quantity of the S(NO:SKN7) complex as well as the total number of promoter binding sites contained in each cell, in particular the minimum. Once the quantity of active genes reaches its maximum, protein production occurs at a constant rate and the amount of YFP increases linearly. We also observed that protein production will stop after Yap1p in the nucleus is degraded and the Yap1p production rate can’t insufficiently replace the lost transcription factors in the nucleus.
Our model confirms that Yap1p and Skn7p seem to play a crucial role in the immediate response of the cell against oxidative stress. In addition, Not4 plays an important role in the long-term stabilization of the quantity of oxidised Yap1p in the nucleus and therefore also in the cell’s long-term response to oxidative stress. Altering the Not4 degradation rate and the kinase binding rate has large effects on the overall protein production rate. The simulations run in this model, support the Yap1p degradation mechanism based on Not4 activity suggested in the literature.
In order to have a more accurate model of the response against oxidative stress in the cell and the fluorescence production, we need to include the transcription MSN2/4p in our numerical simulations and then to fit our parameters to experimental FACS data using COPASI’s parameter estimation function. This would enable us to make more accurate numerical predictions of the behaviour of the detection mechanism under various conditions. We could then model the promoter structure in a more detailed way and use the simulation results to guide the design of optimal promoters for our detection mechanism.
