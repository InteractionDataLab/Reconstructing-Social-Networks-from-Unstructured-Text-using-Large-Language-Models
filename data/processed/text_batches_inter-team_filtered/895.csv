UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Cyanolux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," systems with minimal inputs to replace E. coli, for example, in the biotechnological industry in order to achieve greener processes.
Rationale
Synechocystis PCC 6803
Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic photoautotrophs and they are believed to have evolved oxygenic photosynthesis about 2.4 billion years ago 1 . Although this biochemical breakthrough can not be understated, several cyanobacteria species also play a crucial role in the planet nitrogen cycle as marine diazotrophs 2 . Cyanobacteria are found almost in every environment in earth´s surface and interestingly, they are one of the few prokaryotes known to have circadian rhythms accounting for their photosyntethic lifestyle 3 .
Synechocystis PCC6803 is a gram negative non-filamentous cyanobacteria and it was the third prokaryote and the first photoautotroph whose genome was sequenced. Consequently, it has become a model organism as its genetic background has been widely studied.
Given the reasons mentioned above, it is of no surprise that Synechocystis PCC6803 (among other cyanobacteria) has been extensively used for biotechnological applications and proposed as the “green E.coli” 4 .
With the dawn of Synthetic Biology, research has made use of Synechocystis for commodity chemicals production and detection of water soluble pollutants among other applications 5 , 6 .
While aware of these practical applications, we (UC_Chile) are particularly interested in the well characterized circadian behavior of this chassis 7 and its implications. There are several genes known to oscillate in a daily basis, most of them related to respiration, photosynthesis and energy metabolism 8 , and it has been shown that reporter systems using these promoters show a similar expression pattern 9 .
Lastly, there are a lot of biobricks designed especially for Synechocystis or derived from its genetic information by previous iGEM teams (references). However, sadly no one has characterized them in this chassis and the registry lacks a set of tools for its transformation with standard biological parts. Moreover, to our knowledge, no iGEM team has ever accomplished a successful direct Synechocystis transformation with naked DNA.
Lux Operon
The lux operon is a group of genes that are responsible for density-dependent bioluminescent behavior in various prokariotic organisms such as Vibrio fischeri and Photorabdus luminescens 12 . In V. f"

Informing Design
We consulted numerous experts in various fields to ensure that the design of the AuxIn system respects all relevant social, ethical and legal issues.  One module of our system, Gene Guard , is a direct result of brainstorming around the issues involved in the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although we have only reached the proof of concept stage, we have put a lot of thought into how AuxIn may be implemented as a product and the legal issues that would be involved.

GM release
There are many different biological aspects that need to be taken into account when deliberating release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. A big issue associated with this is containment of genetic information and preventing its spread to other organisms. To prevent spread of our auxin-producing plasmid in the environment, we have devised Gene Guard , a containment device that will actively prevent horizontal gene transfer. In addition, we have chosen Escherichia coli as our chassis to prevent spread to adjacent ecosystems because E. coli (unlike Bacillus subtilis) cannot form spores.
Gene Guard design
1. Goal
Bacteria frequently pass on genetic information via horizontal gene transfer. This can happen in a variety of ways, including conjugation, transformation and transduction[1]. As a result, a significant portion of bacterial genomes (12.8% of the Escherichia coli genome) consists of foreign DNA[2]. If the DNA we engineered into our bacteria were to be transferred to plant pathogenic bacteria, it may give them a competitive advantage when combined with their own virulence factors. This could negatively affect plants and the ecosystem. Therefore, we want to prevent spreading of the genetic information we have engineered into our chassis.
2. Action
Early on in the project, we recognised that containment of genetic information is an issue that has to be taken very seriously. We discussed many different ways in which we could ensure"

August 28th
We returned to our favourite cloning techniques - the three way assembly.  This time we succeeded. For confirmation, we amplified the ligation products. The shift to about 1.5Kb is shown in the gel photo.
September 9th
For the purpose of characterization, we cloned a reporter gene (GFP or RFP generator) into our construct. Using the three way ligation, we managed to do it successfully. The gel photo shows how we cut off the gels for extraction. We also show the streaked colonies of the transformants. They are green which indicates the presence of GFP (DLig 13E).

The SV Detector App
Figure 1: The app on an Android phone (Sony M4A).
The SV Detector app was developed to work with the spectrophotometer. The purpose of the spectrophotometer was to quantify the results by creating a controlled uniform environment for every test. The app is the spectrophotometer’s brain – the idea was to create a simple app so that even operators with little specialized knowledge of snake venom could still utilise it. The app is compatible with Android 5.0 meaning that it can run on hardware from 2014 and up.
The SV Detector allows the operator to simply test the incubated samples for the relative amount of colour that is present in every sample.
Figure 2: The start-up screen of the SV Detector.
The workflow is simple. The app is launched and the operator selects start measuring when ready. The next screen presented shows the instructions. These are extremely simple and numbered to increase the readability as well as eliminate misunderstanding.
Figure 3: The instructions screen of the app.
The instructions are also simplified by calling the three different substrates as 1, 2, and 3. These substrates were chosen from the peptide screening as they enable us to use logic in order to distinguish between the three chosen snakes. One substrate will react with the three venoms, and the other two will react with two different ones. Thus if the first substrate reacts and the remaining two do not, one can exclude all but the Naja nigricollis. If either of the other substrates react it is respectively either Bitis arietans or Bitis gabonica.
Once the operator selects the continue button the app launches the camera of the operator’s phone. The default camera interface was used to increase user-friendliness thus ensuring that the operator does not have to acquaint themselves with a new interface.
The pictures are analysed based on RGB histograms. The difference in colours and similarities measures are accounted for and is how either the match or no match is ensured.
Figure 4: The final screen with results and a link to the database.
The last screen displays the results. We aimed to make the results screen as simple as possible. The operator can instantly see the detected venom, if there is one. An elaborated 1x3 matrix-table shows the operator the substrates and the relative amount of color, if they are interested in the results or wish to double check them. The only other option apart from closing results is clicking to go to WHO’s venomous snakes and antivenoms search interface. This was advised by"

Nitric Oxide Sensing & The Hybrid Promoters | The Comparator Circuit | Theoretical Projects
Our hybrid promoter hopes to add to the systems already in the registry by creating a hybrid promoter that combines the bacterial promoter PyeaR and the mammalian CArG element , both of which respond to exogenous nitrogenous species. Combining the two would allow a more modular nitric oxide sensor that can be used in mammalian and bacterial cells interchangeably.
Six new BioBricks produced and submitted to the registry with characterisation from fluorescence-based experiments.
Parts produced from this project:
Bacterial-Mammalian/B-M (PyeaR-CArG) Hybrid Promoter -- Mammalian-Bacterial/M-B (CArG-PyeaR) Hybrid Promoter -- B-M + eCFP -- B-M + RFP -- M-B + eCFP -- M-B + RFP
Parts characterised from this project:
PyeaR Promoter -- PyeaR Promoter + GFP -- enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein + RBS + Terminators -- Red Fluorescent Protein + RBS + Terminators
Our main project has resulted in the production of a hybrid bacterial and mammalian promoter optimised for induction by nitric oxide, nitrates and nitrites. We have ligated PyeaR, a known bacterial promoter and Part BBa_K216005 (Cambridge 2009) in the parts registry, with its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The resulting hybrid promoter has been synthesised in two orientations; PyeaR (bacterial, B) upstream of CArG (mammalian, M), nicknamed (B-M); and CArG upstream of PyeaR (M-B). These orientations were submitted to the parts registry as our first two BioBricks.
Each orientation of the promoter was ligated to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) to produce four new BioBricks which have been submitted to the parts registry. These promoter + fluorescent protein"

Hence, the tested antibiotic works just as well as ampicillin against C. glutamicum.    We really enjoyed this collaboration, as we think the project from Tübingen is very interesting and the work on novel antibiotics is very important – especially in the fight against bacteria that are resistant against traditional antibiotics. So, thank you very much Tübingen!

Week 1
Day 1, June 17
Each team member prepared 5 ideas, and the team selected the top five ideas. These ideas include a biosensor for common parasites in water, a biosensor for UV damage, a bacteria that fights cavity, bacteria to produce diesel from food oil, and a composite biosensor that incorporates several biosensors.
Day 2, June 18
Each member focused on one idea. The goal for the day was to determine a possible mechanism. The goal for the day was to determine the feasibility of the idea. The team also considered several new ideas such as MSG detection, urine detection, and biofertilizer.
Day 3, June 19
This day was a continuation of the previous day. Emphasis today was to research previous iGEM teams for inspiration and possible mechanisms and biobricks.
Day 4, June 20
We tried to find one more idea that will be feasible. After meeting with advisors, we tried to focus more on the mechanistic details rather than a high level discussion of the project idea. We also took an inventory of the lab space and began sending out sponsorship emails.
Day 5, June 21
After deciding most of the ideas we have come up with are far from feasible, we focused again on previous iGEM teams, hoping to build on a previous team's work. Each team member was tasked with coming up with a new idea for the next week.
Week 2
Day 6, June 24
The team decided on roles to improve efficiency and team organization. The team made SOB solution and obtained Top 10 cells from Dr. Leonard (one of our advisors). The team also talked quorum sensing of bacteria as a possible mechanism to detect parasites in water.
Day 7, June 25
The team discovered that UV sensing is already done several times by different iGEM teams. The idea may lack novelty. To improve on the biofuel idea, different starting materials are considered, hoping to increase the financial sensibility by decreasing the value of the starting materials.
Day 8, June 26
Today, the team focused primarily on oral health and"

To avoid this, we then started to use 15mL Falcon tubes since the tops could be better secured. The first 20 minutes of reaction were carried out at room temperature with the lids only attached lightly to allow air to escape. Then, the lids were tightened and the tubes were shaken at 37C for an hour, with the air pressure being released every five to ten minutes. The samples were then centrifuged at 4,000xg at 4C for five minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and then the samples were re-suspended in 70% (v/v) ethanol. The samples were centrifuged at the same settings again, the supernatant was discarded, and they were re-suspended once more in distilled water. The samples were centrifuged one last time, the supernatant was poured off, and then the remaining water was allowed to evaporate overnight at 40-60C. The final mass of the plastic was then measured. This protocol was adapted from Hahn et al [8]. .
Extracting Plastic Sheets. Liquid cultures of P(3HB) were pelleted by centrifugation at five-minute cycles at 4,000xg at 4C. The tubes with pellets were then placed at -80C for at least one hour, and then rushed down to the lyophilizer, where they were allowed to freeze dry for at least 24 hours. The freeze-dried pellets were then ground up and added to a sealable glass container of chloroform. We used half as much chloroform as media in the original culture (100mL chloroform if we had cells growing in 200 mL TB media). The contents of the container were stirred for 24 hours and then filtered into a flask using a mixed cellulose acetate filter (glass fiber filters also work well). At this point, the P(3HB) and lipids from cells are dissolved in chloroform is in the flask. This solution was allowed to evaporate slightly, and then was dropped into a container of methanol. At this point, the plastic precipitates out, and the methanol dissolves the remaining lipids and non-polar cell particles. This solution is then filtered using a glass fiber filter to let the methanol and lipids through, and keep the P(3HB) in the filter. The filter was then changed to a different flask, and chloroform was added"

I discovered the iGEM competition last year when I joined the Evry team, and I enjoyed it so much I wanted to participate again. This year, as part of the Paris Bettencourt team, I spent way more time in the lab and was able to learn so many things, this experience was once again invaluable!

I am a student in bioengineering that loves biology and especially physiology. I did two years in med school that really made me discover biology and made me love it along with the different life sciences. I joined iGEM this year thanks to a rouya of mine that heard about it and told me it could be interesting experience (sadly, he couldn't participate). In theteam, I was part of the Human practice and I tried to collect as much information about the acceptance of our project. Besides like to read fantasy and scientific books, I like to watch movies and I play a lot of video games.

I’ve been in love with genetics for a while now, what I appreciate in synthetic biology is that it  gives us the power to be creative, and this is now so simple to be a part of it, as tools are really simplified. I look forward to see how synbio is going to be huge and more opened to the public. When I’m not tinkering bacteria with the Bettencourt team I’m studying Pharmacie, 5th year now. I also swim a lot in those microbe nest that are parisians swimming pools. I also love being in the woods, take a breath.

This year our team had the opportunity to partner with TEDxCalgary in developing a TEDx talk which we presented on October 13th in Calgary.  This was a great opportunity to present to not only our city, but also a part of a larger, international event.  We had a lot of fun thinking about synthetic biology and our project and the best way to share that in an inspirational and meaningful way.
Find our talk after the Regional Jamboree on the TEDxCalgary Youtube Channel .
City 2.0
Our talk was part of City 2.0 . This international event was awarded the TED prize of the year, which occurred concurrentlly in over 50 cities around the world on October 13th. This event was inspired by many ideas around building vibrant and sustainable cities, but is trying to move on to the next step: taking action. The themes involve Art, Food, Education, Public Space, Health and more! The ultimate goal is to create the city of the future that are “inclusive, innovative, healthy, soulful, and thriving!”

An important ingredient in cosmetics
Its current production cannot meet the needs of society
The yield can be increased by screening and mutagenizing high-yield strains, particularly glutamate-independent synthetic bacteria
Glutamic acid
$20-30/kg
Glutamic acid is the world's largest producer of amino acids and can be used in industrial production, food processing, medicine, scientific research, etc.
As an important intermediate metabolite in cells, glutamate can be converted into surfactin and γ-PGA by its own metabolism
Analysis of our research results, we found that the current production technology of glutamate was so mature that the price was very cheap. Novozymes and other biotech companies chose to produce polymers to form new materials that ultimately increased their added value. At the same time, glutamate was also a very important substance in cells. What’s more, the use of surfactants was very extensive. As a reason of the current production technology could not form large-scale industrial production, no wonder that the price was high; γ-PGA could be industrialized, but the current production cost is very high, resulting in its price was also very high.
Based on our findings, we finally chose to use intracellular glutamate to synthesize"

UiOslo_Norway,2016,Team:UiOslo Norway#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," specific nucleotide sequences. By now, it is known that by redesigning gRNA/tracrRNA/crRNA, one can design Cas9-systems that can recognize any sequence. Usually, this is used in combination with the native endonuclease activity of Cas9, enabling the researcher to cut DNA at specific locations and manipulate the target sequence. This differs from our approach. By taking a slightly unorthodox, but innovative approach to CRISPR/Cas9 usage, we want to interface it with our PhoneLab.
In order to combine CRISPR/Cas9 technology with our diagnostic tool, we imagine to preserve the “searching” capability of CRISPR/Cas9 systems, and replacing the “cutting” part with a detectable readout similar to what we have with the nitrocefin-based detection. This means that instead of cleaving the resistance genes, we want to couple the pairing of nucleotide targets and Cas9 to a colorimetric signal. By doing so, detection of genes could relatively easily be interfaced with the detection of ESBL activity in our PhoneLab, thus creating a more complete diagnostic tool for ESBL infections.
This could be achieved in several ways, but as a contribution to our project, we propose the following design of a CRISPR/Cas9 system to be used in PhoneLab.
First, we would need to design tracr/crRNA sequences compatible with known ESBL genes. These RNAs would be linked to a null-nuclease Cas9 (dCas9) - a Cas9 enzyme modified so that it binds tracr/crRNA and is guided to its targets,, but does not cleave the target genes. For each target gene, we propose to have two sets of tracr/crRNA, complementary to different, but adjacent parts of the same gene. Each of these RNA molecules would have a dCas9 partner, which again would be fused to half of a detectable protein partner in a split-enzyme assay. When the tracr/crRNA finds its goal, dCas9 would bring the two parts of the split-enzyme together, thus creating a detectable signal. So, in this system, two independent RNA/DNA-binding events would be required to take place, which lowers the probability of false positives.
The detectable protein partner of dCas9 is currently a matter of research for us, but one possibility is to use the subunits of galactosidase. LacZ alpha and -omega are two separate peptides that form the active form of galactosidase when in contact with each other"

Chang and Winnans (1992) revealed in their studies the parts of the VirA receptor which are essential for the signal transduction ( Chang CH and Winans SC., 1992 ). A structured model for different inducing conditions are shown in figure 4.

Phenolic Compounds
The ligand receptor interaction between acetosyringone and VirA is based on the interaction of several chemical groups. First of all the hydroxylated aromat is essential. Methoxy groups in the ortho position of the phenol play a crucial role in the signaling as well. It should be mentioned that dimethoxy compounds have a higher activity than monomethoxy compounds. The acetyl and alkyl groups in para position enhance the binding affinity. VirA activating compounds must have two methoxy groups in ortho position and an additional carbonyl group on the R3 chain. The potential capacity of the group para to the phenolic hydroxyl group is associated with higher activities. Moreover the chirality at this carbon center is critical for the inducing activity ( Winans SC, 1992 ). Regarding to the proton transfer model of Hess et al. (1996) the VirA activator transfers a proton to the basic area receptor binding site. The allosteric change leads to the phosphotransfer and the signaltransduction ( Hess KM et al., 1991 ).

Inducing enhancers
The sensitivity of this system is highly enhanced when additional aldose monosacchardic suggars occur in the environment of Agrobacterium. The sugar binding protein ChvE interacts with the VirA receptor, leading to a much stronger vir gene expression ( Banta LM, et al., 1994 ).

In our project we decided to work with E. coli instead of A. tumefaciens. The transcription procedure in E. coli is very similar to A. tumefaciens but not complete homolog."

Susan Chen
Hello! My name is Susan and I am a third year at UCSF in the Tetrad program. I grew up in the east bay area and stayed around to study biochemistry and bioengineering at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). During my time at Cal, I discovered academic research, more specifically synthetic biology, and became very interested in harvesting the power of biology for useful applications. Spurred by that interest, I joined the 2009 Berkeley iGEM team to work on bacterial surface display, and from there I became inspired to one day TA iGEM, contributing to this rich experience for students and just getting plain old excited for novel synthetic biology research.

Fig.3 the fluorescence microscopy result of DiO dyeing (showing the plasma membrane) and HRH4-mCherry
Quantification by Flow CytoMetry (FCM)
From the result of fluorescence microscopy, the expression of HRH4-mCherry fusion proteins can be observed roughly, for quantifying the expression level of HRH4-mCherry, FCM is performed. From the result, a distinct peak value can be observed. Considering the fluorescence microscopy result that most of HRH4 are correctly located, this data does provide us a reliable probability distribution of total H4 protein expression variance between yeast individuals. Finally, the probability distribution of functional H4 receptor expression variance can refer to the total expression probability distribution we get from experiments.
Fig.4 Flow Cytometry result of HRH4-mCherry fusion protein expression
The test of this composite part set the foundation of our project, it proves that HRH4 can be expressed in high level under the trigger of a constitutive promoter-ADH1 promoter. Besides, the HRH4 can locate in the yeasts’ membrane without adding other sequence. It can be part of the evidence that our HRH4 is functional. Then the Flow CytoMetry result provide us a reliable probability distribution of total H4 protein expression variance between yeast individuals, which is significant for modeling.

*A+K stands for ampicillin + kanamycin, C stands for chloramphenicol.
2. Test of the equality of killing: the killing effect of warrior II is far stronger than warrior I
    We calculate the ratio of Warrior I/Warrior II in group 3 and group 6. If the ratios are alike, then the killing effect of the warriors are similar.
    The figure shows the result. We can see that in the medium containing A+K, the amount of the warriors from two sides are roughly equal. At the same time, in the medium containing C, the amount of Warrior II is much larger. This is easy to explain as not only does Warrior II kills warrior I, but Warrior I kills itself as well.
*A+K stands for ampicillin + kanamycin, C stands for chloramphenicol.
B. Killing effect test
1. Test of killing effect
    We calculate the ratio of Beggar/Warrior in each group and the results can be seen from the figures.
    We can see that when we mix Warrior I with Beggar II, the amount of Beggar II after 15h is much more than the amount of Warrior I. This may partly because Warrior I kills itself and partly because its killing effect towards Beggar II is weak.
    In contrast with the result above, we find that when we mix Beggar I and Warrior II together, the amount of Warrior II surely surpasses that of Beggar I. This means that the killing effect of Warrior I is very obvious.
2. Killing significance of warriors
    Furthermore, we compared the amount of beggars when they are cultured alone with the amount of beggars when they are cultured with warriors. We calculated the amount of beggars in group 7/group 8 to see the change in beggar I and in group11 /group 12 to see the change in Beggar II. From this figure, we can see that the amount of beggar I drops drastically when it is cultured with Warrior II, which means that Warrior II really work. As the amount of Beggar II does not have an apparent change, we may say that warrior I’s killing effect is surely too weak.
V Analysis
    Firstly, we ensure that our warriors can really kill. The amount of beggars do decrease when the warriors from the other side is added and the more warriors, the less beggars. (tset of killing effect)

May
After a sufficient time of brainstorming, we finalized our iGEM 2016 project. We started working on experimental designs. We finished writing our protocol, which contains complete description of our parts, experiments with timeline. We designed sequences for IDT gBlocks and placed the order. We made a list of consumables required for our microbiology and molecular biology work and ordered them. We prepared Ultr-competent cells using Inoue method. We started ideating for our modelling part of the project e.g. problem statement, hypothesis, statistical toolbox etc.
June
We started our cloning work and successfully cloned parts required for our 'Noise in Device' experiment. We finalized our modelling section and finished writing hypothesis, model etc. We started reaching out to other iGEM teams for the possibilities of collaborations. By the end of the month, we started planning for Interlab study.
July
We contacted HKUST, HonkKong iGEM team, we shared our project plans to each other over skype. We also talked to IISc Banglore and sent our biobrick to them for characterization. We started our modelling work and finshed getting results in form of raw data. We finished Interlab Study by this month. We started planning on our outreach and human practices activities. We got our IDT gBlocks and finished cloning 'RIBOSON & RIBOSOFF' parts. We took fluorescence measurement for 'Noise in Devices' parts using plate reader.
August
We started working on tri-stable switch model of HKUST. We finished the analysis part of our modelling and  presented it to Dr. Karthik Raman, expert in Systems Biology. We attended SVCE iGEM meetup and indian igem hangouts. As planned for human practices work, we started reaching out to public via survey. We also reaching out to the very vocal and anti-GM NGOs in India. We were appoached by Paris Bettencourt team for untreated hydrophillic cotton fibers, which we shipped to them. We started working on our game 'Codonut'.
September
We started cloned sgRNA gBlocks by IDT. We faced difficulty in cloning these parts. We ran the gBlocks on 1% agarose and found most of them to be sheared. We shipped the required cotton to team Paris Bettencourt. We performed our FACS measurements for our constructs. We interviewed experts on GEAC, India committee."

1. Centrifugation (6,500 rpm, 30 s), discard supernatant.
2. Add 600 μl protein tagged by Spytag, incubate at 37℃ for 15 min.
3. Repeat washing step.
4. Peptide 300 μl for SDS-PAGE analysis.
5. Add TEV protease to the rest solution, release protein of interest.
The reaction system is as follows:
Fusion protein
20 μg
20×rTEV Buffer
7.5 μl
0.1 M DTT
1.5 μl
rTEV protease
1 μl
H2O
up to 150 μl
6. Incubate at 4℃ for 5-6 h.
Bradford Protein Assay
For the Bradford protein assay we used Bradford Protein Assay Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.
SDS-PAGE
Casting the gel
1. Select and cast the appropriate base (separating) gel. The amounts of reagents required for two gels with dimensions 0.07 × 14 × 14 cm and containing 10% and 16% acrylamide are given in the table that follows. Do not degas the gel mixtures, because the gel buffer contains SDS. Overlay the poured gels with several drops of water. Leave the gels for about 30 min to polymerize. (Alternatively, precast gels can be purchased from vendors, and the protocol can be started from Step 3.)The freshly prepared ammonium persulfate (APS) solution and TEMED should be added last, immediately before pouring the gels, because these polymerize the gels.
2. Overlay the polymerized separating gel (10% or 16%, or 16%/6 M urea) directly with a 4% sample (stacking) gel prepared as indicated in the table in Step 1, except if resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired. If resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired, then use AB-6 instead of AB-3 for the separating gel and overlay the separating gel with a 1-cm 10% gel, made up as described in the table. The 16% separating gel and the overlaid 10% ‘spacer gel’ can be polymerized together if no glycerol is added to the 10% acrylamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it"

Finally it was terminated by SV40 poly(A) signal Termination (BBa_K2217005).
 
Fig-4 Composite Part BBa_K2217022
Part BBa_K2217022 was composed of CMV Enhancer as well as CMV Promoter (BBa_K2217000 and  BBa_K2217006 respectively) as constitutive promoters to enhance the transcription process of the laci that was submitted (Ba_K2217012). We also improved the fragment’s characterization by adding the miRNA binding site of the miRNA mir-1825 as determined computationally using circ interactome database [4] where we hypothesised its function as a trigger for miRNA binding and synthesis. Finally, it was terminated by SV40 poly(A) signal Termination (BBa_K2217005).

2. Mechanism for erasing all reporter cells in users is necessary.
Dr. Chang strongly recommended that we design a mechanism for wiping out the reporter cells introduced in user when we ignorantly think that the reporter cell is harmless and shortly mortal while overlook the importance of biosafety and the possible allergy responses in users. Therefore, we introduce AID , the auxin-inducible degradation system, in which targets are degraged in response to auxin, into the design of BioWatcher.

We would like to thank all of those who have supported and assisted us in the laboratory, in the school and in society since the             beginning of our tetracycline detecting and degradation project. Without those help, this project wouldn't have been possible and cannot been progressing well.
Introduction
Fluorescence data usually cannot be compared because it has been reported in different units or because different groups process data in different ways. Many have tried to work around this using “relative expression” comparisons; however, being unable to directly compare measurements makes it harder to debug engineered biological constructs, harder to effectively     share constructs between labs, and harder even to just interpret your experimental controls.
The InterLab protocol aims to address these issues by providing researchers with a detailed protocol             and data analysis form that yields absolute units for measurements of GFP in a plate reader.
Instrumentation
We used SpectraMax i3x+MinMax to measure Abs600 and fluorescent values. All the samples were taken from the distribution kit.             The instrument settings were kept as: Excitation/Emission wavelengths-485nm/525nm, Bandwidth-25. Abs600 sample measurements were taken in 96 well micro test plate.
Experimental Design
For this study，first of all, we measured the Abs600 of LUDOX and MiliQ, the Abs600 of diluted monodisperse         silica microspheres and the fluorescence of 1x fluorescein with the plate reader according to the InterLab Study Protocol.

Book the right equipment e.g.. fume hoods, LAF-benches or centrifuges that you are going to use and get acquainted with it prior to usage.
Identify your limitations and when you need a second pair of hands to be able to perform the experiments.
Always plan to work in the laboratory when other people are present - NEVER work alone
Know your:
Chemicals, how to handle and dispose them - look up the MSDSs for each of the chemicals
Organisms and how to dispose them - are they generally regarded as safe or are they pathogenic and need extra caution
Know who to ask/call to get your questions answered and remember, there are no stupid questions.

BioMORTAR Project Abstract
In order to facilitate the design process for novel bacterial metabolism, our team has created a tool suite known as BioMortar which will automate plasmid design for metabolic processes as well as model cell growth. BioMortar begins with a much improved version of IMPtools, which uses an algorithm over a network generated by the KEGG database, to determine the optimal metabolic pathway according to specified conditions. At this point, it accesses the DNA sequences for each recommended enzyme for each reaction and searches the BioBrick database for related gene sequences. Then, BioMORTAR designs and displays the advised, usable plasmid(s) in BioBrick format for the user.  Finally, the program models the growth of the organism, with the addition of the new metabolic pathway(s). By automating the design process, BioMORTAR streamlines the process of designing bacteria with new metabolic processes.
Project Description
The 2010 Illinois iGEM Tools Team is in the phase of constructing a program to design a plasmid in-silico for the user-specified host bacteria as well as model the growth of the designed cell.
The web-based program will begin by implementing the desired metabolic pathway computed by a greatly improved version of last year's project, IMPtools, then by determining the recommended enzymes for each reaction, and accessing the DNA sequence for it. In the meantime, the program will model the growth of the user specified bacteria"
UT-Tokyo,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo-Software#Project#BioBrickSearch_-_-_TEXT.html,"elasticsearch can handle complex queries on structured data quickly and this characteristic of elasticsearch allowed us to build a sophisticated and responsive search tool.
Sorting Criteria
Sorting criteria for BioBrick search results are the most important part of this tool as it has great impact on the usability of the software. In designing sorting criteria for BioBrick Search, we decided that the features of a part that users most frequently consider in determining which BioBrick parts to use are:
Reliability of the part (Will this BioBrick work?)
Relevance (How relevant is this BioBrick to your query?)
Popularity of the part (How many teams have used this BioBrick?)
Reliability is computed from 3 entries (part_results (whether the BioBrick works or not), part_status (whether the BioBrick is available or not), best_quality (whether the nucleotide sequence of BioBrick is confirmed or not)) on the data obtained from partsregistry.org API.
We quantified the reliability of each parts in 5 grades, from 1 to 5 (higher is better). The code (in Python) used to score the parts is shown below.
pos = neg = 0 if part['part_results'] == 'Fails': neg += 2 elif part['part_results'] == 'Issues': neg += 1 elif part['part_results'] == 'Works': pos += 1 if part['part_status'] == 'Available': pos += 1 if part['best_quality'] == 'Confirmed': pos += 1 elif part['best_quality'] == 'Questionable': neg += 1 elif part['best_quality'] == 'Bad Sequencing': neg += 2  if pos >= 3 and neg == 0: return 5 elif pos >= 2 and neg == 0: return 4 elif pos - neg > 0: return 3 elif pos - neg == 0: return 2 elif pos < neg: return 1
Relevance is a measure of how relevant  a BioBrick is to your query. This score is automatically computed by elasticsearch.
Popularity is a measure of how many teams have used the BioBrick. We counted the number of teams that submitted a part that (directly or indirectly) contains the specific BioBrick and used the logarithm of this number as the ""popularity"" score.
The search results are ordered according to the product of these 3 scores.
3. User-Experience
In designing the BioBrick Search software, we saw to it that users can intuitively and comfortably use this tool."

As our technology is developing, new intellectual property will be generated, and this is reflected in our profitability analysis in the legal section.
Costs for patenting were based upon a rough estimate of $10,000 per provisional patent and $50,000-$70,000 per utility filing.  This assumes that our first provisional will be filed in 2014, and two patents will be issued by 2016. Miscellaneous legal fees would include the drafting of all documents relating to customer agreements, non-disclosure agreements, sales agreements, etc. These will begin to increase as our first product hits the market. Cost were based on hourly rates of $250-$500.
Regulatory approval costs will include, in 2015, approximately $21,500 for Environment Technology Verification (ETV) approval and an additional $10,000 dollars for necessary toxicity and growth assays as required for general safety verification by CEPA. In 2016, this will increase to $43,000, accounting for new approvals for subsequent technology and an additional $50,000 to begin USA Environmental Protection Agency assessment.
Travel costs will occur between labs, as we will have research and development activities occurring in both Calgary and Edmonton.
Travel for promotional related events will be highest in the early phases as we try to network and seek advice from potential customers.
Telephone and fax services are based on current prices in Calgary. These will commence in 2014 when we begin to rent office space.
Insurance increases annually as the business grows and sales commence. Key insurance for our venture will be business liability insurance as well as product liability insurance.
The budget places emphasis on numerous components of the company's development, namely those listed above the detailed expenses list.  The budget requires that we raise significant capital funding for our business, requiring $2 million to bring our product to market by the year 2016.  The budget reflects a number of assumptions.  These include being able to supply ourselves with numerous laboratory equipment through government granting programs and university technology transfer programs available in Alberta.  This also assumes that for up-scale of our prototype towards commercialization, we have the ability to partner with a manufacturing group to supply the  equipment required to produce our product.  Additionally, the expenses of becoming certified through numerous government programs may be variable depending on the particular legislation.  Therefore we plan to tackle Environment/Health Canada certification prior to more expensive certification programs such as those offered by the Environment Protection Agency in the United States.

The phage system is such that BioBrick DNA will not be packaged into the phage, so transfer of DNA to other organisms by this route is impossible. Any escaping phage will contain only normal M13 DNA, and code for normal M13 proteins in the second generation.
Any E. coli that escape (from either system) will have greatly reduced fitness. Our lab strain of E. coli, JM109, is a ""disabled"" strain, which has very poor survival in the wild.
Therefore, the only plausible way any part of our project could survive in the wild is if horizontal gene transfer moved DNA into other organisms. However, even if this occurred, it could only become established in the metagenome if it confers a fitness advantage to some host. However, extracellular display of enzymes such as cellulases has already been accomplished by evolution, and indeed natural cellulosome systems are almost certainly far superior to our system, a fact which greatly decreases the likelihood of our own constructs conferring a fitness advantage.
In short, our system will enable the use of a cellulosome-like system in E. coli. It will not, however, be a superior system to those that exist in nature in other organisms.
Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
We do not see any potential for weaponisation of our systems. Specifically, the destruction of living plant matter by either system is essentially impossible because plants have already evolved defenses against the thousands of cellulose degrading organisms which exist; industrial use of cellulases currently depends on extensive pretreatment to remove lignin, a substance extremely difficult to degrade by biological means, and our systems do not bypass this requirement.
Mitigation of risks and BioBrick safety
If your response to any of the questions above is yes:
Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
In the event that we unexpectedly discover a new safety concern, this page will be updated and any parts on the Registry will be updated with the new information. Any new required procedures in the lab will be implemented. However, we do not anticipate this occurring.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
did you document these issues in the Registry?
how did you manage to handle the safety issue?

Procedure
1. Pre-wetted
Soak membrane in sterile water for 1min and put membrane in the filter holder;
To eliminate DNAs that bound to the membrane, DNAs (1 μg/μl) were passed three times prior to the selection cycle through pre-wetted nitrocellulose acetate membranes  in “Pop-top” filter holders;
2. DNA denature
For the first cycle of selection, 35.5 μl (1μg/ μl) DNAs were added in 114.5 μl binding buffer solution (volume 150 μl);
And then were denatured at 95oC for 10 min;
Then were allowed to cool in thermocycler to approximately 300C (about 1.5 hours);
3. Binding
Denatured DNAs (35.5 μl, 1μg/ μl DNAs + 114.5 μl binding buffer) + 50 μl target protein (87 μg/ml) were incubated at 15 rpm on a variable speed rotor for 1 hour and 45 min at room temperature.
4. Washing
Soak membrane in wash buffer (the same as binding buffer) for appr. 1 min and then put the membrane in the filter holder;
Aspirate the binding reaction mixture (DNAs+target) with a syringe with a needle
Remove the needle and inject the binding reaction mixture into the filter holder with a membrane and then inject 1 ml wash buffer solution (the same as binding buffer) and let wash buffer pass through the membrane.

Sample preparation and protein loading
5. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 15 min or for up to 60 min for samples that were in pellet form. Avoid boiling samples, because membrane proteins can irreversibly aggregate in SDS at temperatures >50 °C.
6. Mount the gels in the vertical electrophoresis apparatus (see EQUIPMENT), and add anode buffer as the lower electrode buffer and cathode buffer as the upper electrode buffer (anodes and cathodes are commonly marked red and black, respectively, by the suppliers).
7. Load samples under the cathode buffer. Apply 10-μl sample volumes to 0.7 × 5 mm sample wells.For the optimal resolution of peptides of 1–5 kDa, reduce the amount of SDS in the incubation buffers, for example, by fourfold and reduce the volume applied to 5 μl. Reducing the amount of SDS facilitates electrophoretic separation of peptides from the bulk of SDS. To avoid streaking of peptide bands, peptides and bulk SDS must be separated before the faster-migrating bulk SDS and the peptides immediately following reach the separating gel. The sample volume applied for Tricine–SDS-PAGE should not substantially exceed 10 μl, because stacking of proteins in the range 20–100 kDa is less efficient than in Laemmli–SDS-PAGE.
Electrophoresis conditions
8. Set running conditions appropriate to your type of gel; guidance on appropriate running conditions are given in the table below. Start electrophoresis with an initial voltage of 30 V and maintain at this voltage until the sample has completely entered the stacking gel. The next appropriate voltage step can then be applied. The initial current may be as high as 80 mA for a 0.7mm 10% gel. Gels may warm up, but the temperature should not exceed 35–40 °C. Approaching the end of the run, voltage can be gradually increased to shorten the total time of electrophoresis. Fast runs give better results than overnight runs, especially with 10% acrylamide gels. Alternatively, a constant power of 10 W per gel might be set to ensure an even distribution of heat. The specific settings for electrophoretic runs depend considerably on the apparatus"

Off target cleavage probability (relative to on-target) for crRNA 1-5 on the TcR plasmid ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). crRNA 3 (orange) is the crRNA with one on-target site that further displays the lowest probability of false-positive activation on the TcR plasmid itself (i.e. on the non-target sites). Interestingly, crRNA 3 also results in best Cas13a performance in the lab .
Rewriting the implementation of the model into a command line utility allowed us to use the TU Delft computer clusters for simulating the off-target effects of our crRNAs on the genomes of different relevant organisms (genomes retrieved from NCBI): Escherichia coli BL21 (4.5 mln basepairs (bp)), Staphylococcus aureus (2.8 mln bp), Staphylococcus epidermis (2.5 mln bp) and chromosome 27 of the domestic cow (Bos taurus, 45 mln bp). E. coli BL21 is a commonly used lab strain, which was the strain containing the tetracyclin resistance-conferring (TcR) plasmid that we designed the crRNA for. S. aureus and S. epidermis are common pathogens in mastitis , while genetic material from the cow itself may also be present when detecting sequences in cow samples, for example milk. Scanning the entire genome allows to investigate if tiny local off-target effects together influence the reliability of the output signal.
In Figure 6, we present $P_{FP}$ for our crRNA sequences for the different genomes/chromosome. In general, we find off-target cleavage probabilities below 1 in 100.000 for the bacterial genomes. As expected, the $P_{FP}$ is generally larger for the Bos taurus chromosome 27, which is approximately tenfold larger than the bacterial genomes, but reaches a maximum of 1 in 1000. As such, we conclude that the probability of a false output is low and likely does not compromise the usability of the Cas13a-mediated detection system.

Thus, brown eumelanin was chosen as a good candidate for our balloon’s UV protection.
Melanin Production
Overview
Melanin is synthesized by many biological organisms from the aromatic amino acid L-tyrosine through the activity of tyrosinases. These enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, as well as a further oxidation to produce the cyclical dopachrome. Eumelanin is formed in vivo by the non-enzymatic oxidation and polymerization of dopachrome. [7] The MutmelA gene endogenous to Rhizobium etli encodes a feedback resistant tyrosinase that has been shown to be effective when transfected into E. coli. [8] Based on the work of MI Chávez-Béjar, our team sought to increase the production of L-tyrosine in E. coli through metabolic engineering to shuttle the flow of carbon from the cells’ central metabolism into the shikimate pathway.

Designed by team member Taylor Sihavong in Adobe Illustrator
L-tyrosine, along with many other common aromatic compounds, is produced endogenously in E. coli through the shikimate pathway. In this pathways initial reaction, DAHP synthase catalyzes the conversion of Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) and Erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to DAHP. PEP and E4P are naturally derived from glucose, and are present at high concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli grown in glucose containing medium. E. coli naturally contain three isoenzymes of DAHP synthase, each of which are inhibited by the increasing concentrations of specific amino acids produced via their activity. This negative feedback limits the production capacity of L-tyrosine in wild type E. coli. To upregulate L-tyrosine production, we investigated and biobricked multiple feedback resistant variants of the DAHP synthase isoenzymes AroG ( BBa_K2027013 , BBa_K202701"

Patents
Early on, the team had questions about the possibility of patenting the new, invented system. Early advice was sought from one of the team mentors (Daniel Winter), which essentially stated that genetic sequences were not patentable or protectable, and therefore, there was no possibility of patenting the invention. However, the advice lacked clarity as to the actual reasons why that was so. Further research was then conducted into the relevant legal decisions establishing genetic sequence protection law, particularly the High Court of Australia decision in Myriad Genetics v D’Arcy
2
. Such research later showed that in actuality, it was the DNA sequence of the proteins which was not protectable – rather than the actual structure and design of the scaffold

. Dr Alexandra George (Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Intellectual Property) was also consulted regarding some of the particular aspects of the law in order for the team to then evaluate if our invention would fall under the protected category. Given the potential patenting issues, we decided not to proceed with trying to patent the invention, and refocused the project as a foundational technology designed to be accessible to all. The legal reason behind this decision comes from the lack of ‘novelty’ once sequences are removed from contention

SpyTag/Catcher
Further patenting issues were encountered when the team decided to use SpyTag/Catcher and SnoopTag/Catcher as part of the scaffold. Legal research revealed that SpyTag/Catcher was patented in the US, but we could not find an Australian patent
11
. This meant that we could use the SpyTag/Catcher system (which we did), as neither intellectual property provisions in the bilateral Australia - USA free trade agreement, nor those in the worldwide TRIPPS treaty, make US patents enforceable in Australia

As a result, our project used the SpyTag/Catcher system instead of the unpatented SdyTag/Catcher system, which was a better result as SdyTag/Catcher is much more cross-reactive with SnoopTag/Catcher

Questionnaire in our survey
We conducted a wide survey targeted at the general public, with respondents ranging from high school students to working citizens, in collaboration with the Kyoto Institute of Technology KIT-Kyoto and Ehime-Japan . The survey had two objectives. The first was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its associated issues such as bioethics and safety. The second was to capture the public perception of radiation in Japan. We surveyed people who came not only from biological backgrounds but also from various other fields of study. We also obtained feedback from visitors to our universities' open campus events. In addition, we made an online version of our questionnaire to survey even more people from various walks of life.
Attributions & Acknowledgements
We take pride in the fact that all experimental work - part design, construction and testing - were done by ourselves, without relying on outside help. However, directly or indirectly our project has benefited from help from the following parties:
Professor Todo and all the members of Radiation Biology and Medical Genetics Lab at Osaka University for lending us lab space and putting up with our intrusion
Issay Narumi of Ion Beam Mutagenesis Research Group at Japan Atomic Energy Agency for supplying us with D.radiodurans genomic DNA as well as helpful information and invaluable advice concerning the RecA promoter, etc
Professor Hayano of the laboratory of Hayano at the University of Tokyo and ASACUSA at CERN for invaluable advice concerning biodosimetry and dosimeter.

To manage personnel in the company as further key individuals are brought in, we will acquire a part time administrative assistant in 2016 when production begins to ramp up. Finally, during the first five years, should the need arise, we are preparing to take on a new Chief Executive Officer, replacing Emily Hicks and David Lloyd. Although they will be responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the company during its initial start-up phase, with growth of the company, it will likely be important to attract someone with significant experience in this. This move may also allow us to be better positioned to obtain venture capitalist funding needed for late-stage production costs.
Contingency Plans
In the event that certain situations that could disadvantage FREDsense were to occur with regard to key personnel, we have developed a set of contingency plans that could be implemented. These are listed below for each outlined scenario.
Death of an Officer
Upon the death of an officer, the shares will be bought from the estate of the deceased by the company. These shares can then be bought by the founders of FREDsense at the current market value of the shares. If the remaining founders do not purchase these shares they can be purchased by other shareholders or kept by the company at the discretion of the board of directors. In the event the officer holds a joint position with another officer (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, or any other position in the future), the other officer will take full responsibility for this role. In the event that the officer has a unique position, a replacement will be brought in, with unanimous agreement from all remaining officers. This position would be compensated with shares in the company.
Officer Withdrawing From the Company
If an officer wishes to withdraw from the company then his/her shares may be purchased by the remaining founders for a negotiable amount. If the remaining founders do not wish to purchase these shares then they will be purchased by the company for the current market value of the shares. In the event the officer holds a joint position with another officer (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer), the other officer will take full responsibility for this role. In the event that the officer has a unique position, a replacement will be brought in, with unanimous agreement from all remaining officers. This position would be compensated with shares in the company.
Advisor Withdrawing From the Company
If an adviser wishes to withdraw from the company then his/her shares, if applicable, may be purchased by the founders for a negotiable amount. If the remaining founders do not wish to purchase these shares then they will be purchased by the company for the current market"

High school visits and children's education
To ensure that the younger generation is fairly informed about the science progress and to encourage them to seek the knowledge on the field, our team spent several months on communication with the schools of Lithuania while paying visits and giving talks. The aim of the school visits was to spread the knowledge to both students with scientific and non-scientific profile. Our team visited 11 schools in 6 cities, met 530 pupils aged from 7 to 18 years old and got filled 214 questionnaires by high school students. Adding to that, we had a chance to run workshops in ‘The Centre for Child Development’ for children with developmental, mental and behavioural disorders and in an annual event ‘Children’s University’.

Competition for school students - ‘A Day of Scientist’
Our team believes that one of the most important things for the world’s successful future is the connection between science and schools. That is the reason, why we decided to announce a competition for secondary school students, called ‘A Day of Scientist’. The winners of this competition had an extraordinary opportunity to visit the biggest and the most innovative science centres in Lithuania: UAB ‘ThermoFisher Scientific Baltics’ and Vilnius University Life Sciences Centre.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Notebook.html_-_-_TEXT.html," a type of battery that uses live bacteria for current production. The bacteria releases H ions and electrons into the environment, when encapsulated in an anode chamber. These secreted particles contribute to energy formation, when electrons pass from the anode to the cathode of the battery. We would like to genetically engineer E.coli to secrete more electrons, by introducing the secretion system present in a different organism, Shewanella oneidensis. This has been attempted in iGEM before, but never achieved. In addition, we would try to deposit gold nanoparticles on the anode of the battery, to increase its conductivity.
Ivan, Kobchai, Nick, Ric, Gintare, Rudolfs and Alex looked into this idea. The main challenges are that, although nanoparticles have been created before, we are unsure which genes we would use for this process. More reading through literature is needed to identify them, before carrying on.
February 27th
Each subteam presented their latest findings for the two ideas. Kobchai went to discuss with people from the engineering department, who gave useful insight into how nanoparticles are made in vivo and which organisms and gene could be used. We found out that Salmonella enterica has a good gold-detection system, which we could use to control gene expression in the presence of gold ions. We have also identified a few papers which describe how bacteria secrete nanoparticles. We decided this would be a good starting point to carry on with the gold idea.
We have given ourselves two weeks to divide work into subgroups and do reading on several issues; 1st year students will be grouped with older students, to ensure they receive support in interpreting data and understanding the articles. To do list:
        ● what genes would be involved in electron secretion?
        ● what method of nanoparticle formation would we use?
        ● how would we control gene expression?
        ● are there any parts in the iGEM Registry we could use?
March 13th
Ivan gave a comprehensive presentation on our findings so far, in front of potential supervisors. We have established that the main objective of our project is to improve existing microbial fuel cell technology and make fuel cells more cost effective. The three aims which lead to this are:
        1) Expressing the MTR protein complex from Shewanella on the surface of E.coli for electron transport;
        2) Creating a MFC of approx 3cm diameter and engineer E.coli to deposit gold nanoparticles on the anode;
        3) Use a quorum sensing system to control gene expression of genes involved"

We used the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit to fulfill the random mutation in the ankyrin repeats segment of TRPC5. According to the instruction manual (Agilent Technologies,Catalog #200550), mutation rates of 1–16 mutations per kb can be achieved using a single set of buffer conditions (MgCl2, balanced dNTPs) optimized for high product yield. The desired mutation rate can be controlled simply by varying the initial amount of target DNA in the reaction or the number of amplification cycles performed.

Collaborations
This year, Tufts Synthetic Biology collaborated with the MIT iGEM team on their Human Practices project.  Invitrogen has created a tool for screening ligation reactions during the Golden Gate cloning process.  The Invitrogen tool contains the CcdB gene in the pDEST vector as a negative screening tool.  Since the CcdB gene codes for a toxin which inhibits systems in Escherichia coli,  any uncut vector transformed into E. coli would prevent growth of a colony, drastically reducing the amount of colonies on the plates due to transformed, uncut vector.
As the pDEST-CcdB gene sequence is the intellectual property of Invitrogen, the MIT iGEM team created an alternate screening tool, pDEST-mCherry.  mCherry is a fluorescent protein which can be seen with the naked eye.  As a result, any colonies resulting from the uncut vector will be red, and so easily distinguished from successful ligation reactions.  MIT also developed a protocol for other iGEM teams in the future.
Tufts Synthetic BIology tested the protocol with the strain of E. coli in which we have been doing all of our cloning, JM109 from Promega, and successfully produced colonies with clones of our Golden Gate reaction.  The pictures below demonstrate the mixture of red and white colonies, which allowed us to easily and accurately pick out successful ligation reactions from background."

The principle of operation is based on the pressure barrier that develops when cross section of capillaries change abruptly in neck and expansion regions. This type of gating device in its normal state can only stop flow, but it can be electrically triggered to re-establish flow when used in combination with two electrodes.
Mechanics: The capillary stop consists of a region of the tube that is necked down followed by a sharp enlargement. When the liquid as first introduce in the reservoir, it wicks in the necked region and abruptly stops at the neck of the outer edge preventing any outer flow. The pressure barrier provided by the stop can be overcome by external pressure to re-establish a flow.

Increasing the polymer content provides a softer and tackier adhesive, whereas higher resin levels result in lower tack but higher adhesion and resistance to cold flow.

Medal Criteria
Gold Medal and Integrated Human Practices
This page will contain information for your Gold medal Human Practices work, which you can also use to nominate your team for the Best Integrated Human Practices page. To make things easier, we have combined the Gold medal page with the Best Integrated Human Practices page since we expect the work to overlap considerably.
iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices page .
Gold Medal Criterion #1
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.

We created two WeChat rumors, including bacterial resistance and GM food safety; and were promoted and forwarded in a circle of friends. Finally, we have received a lot of praise and received a lot of attention. Through our promotion, middle-aged and elderly people understand the truth behind more rumors and are no longer easily misled by rumors. It is hoped that this will enable older people to understand biology more deeply, so that the elderly are no longer misled by rumors and hope to promote public attention to biology.
Children interested in biology
Place：Science and Technology Museum Activity Summary
In order to promote the popularization of synthetic biology and arouse public interest in synthetic biology, we have jointly planned the 2018 Zhejiang Shengxi Science and Technology Festival with six schools including Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Science and Technology Association. In this activity, our team prepared two small games to let children know more about biology. In addition, some children participated in the game boards produced after our activities to gain a deeper understanding of these biological knowledge. We also prepared lectures on project promotion and the spread of synthetic biology. All the children in the audience listened carefully and enthusiastically answered our questions. Therefore, we will learn from the experience of this event and do better in the next HP promotion.
Young scholars in the field of synthetic biology
This summer, the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community(CCiC) was held at ShanghaiTech University. More than 60 IGEM teams shared their research and experience in Shanghai. We shared the main content and project experience of this year's team project. In addition, we also displayed posters in the lobby of the School of Life Sciences of ShanghaiTech University, and further exchanged with other team members. Many of the suggestions we received from other teams were very valuable, so we went back to further improve the design and adjust the next step; in addition, we worked closely with Jiangnan China and ECUST because our project modules are suitable for them.
University preaching to freshmen
In order to give 2018 freshmen a chance to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM, we distributed brochures on synthetic biology and gave them a demonstration. We also extended knowledge of biosafety to them through this event. After we delivered our speech, they had a more detailed understanding of iGEM and raised many questions for us. Through lively communicating with them, we saw there are many new students interested in synthetic biology and biosafety issues.

We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities. 
Nagahama Meetup
We think ethics and safety on iGEM projects. iGEM Nagahama decided to do human practices to know synthetic biology. We had great opportunity to think  on iGEM project. We participated in The 86th Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of Japan at Nagahama Institute of Bio-Sience and Technology in September 17th-20th, 2014 . We proposed the workshop of synthetic biology and invited general public, iGEM Teams, researchers and instructors of synthetic biology there, because we wanted to know and learn relation of synthetic biology and society. This is a so big event that is enough to win the Best Policy & Practice Advance.
Abstract
Cadmium is the heavy metal which is very harmful to a creature. The pollution of cadmium brings a serious problem for natural environments. It is very important to collect this efficiently. We tried to solve this problem with recombination Escherichia coli which our team made in this year.  We decided to make two kinds of recombination Escherichia coli. One traps cadmium on the outer membrane. It produces fusion protein with the heavy metal binding protein and outer membrane protein and it traps cadmium. Another collects other Escherichia coli. It produces aspartic acid of positive chemotaxis factor to Escherichia coli.
Is it necessary to distribute it to two kinds of why? We suggest the following theory for this question.
""One E. coli has One function theory""
There is the possibility that the following demerit occurs when I summarize two functions in one.The first is that the ability of the Escherichia coli situation decreases by producing multiple protein at a time.The second is that subsequent editing becomes difficult when we complete a  gene cassette once. The merit in case of one kind is next.  At first it is that a function becomes very simple.We can make Escherichia coli which was specialized in it by a function becoming simple. The number of Escherichia coli just leads to the level of the function, analysis becomes easy.

We finished the expression of Escherichia coli confirmation which composed aspartic acid by using thin-layer chromatography;TLC. Escherichia coli trapping cadmium is con"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#HumanPractice#GermanArmedForces_-_-_TEXT.html,"Designer database includes only S1 organisms. Nevertheless, as in the future the database may be expanded with S2 organisms, we intend to handle such cases by issuing appropriate alert messages to the end-user and also allowing him to filter the domains available to his constructs based on the safety level.
A second consideration arises from the extensibility of the NRPSDesigner database, which means that any user can enter new NRPS domain sequences. These in turn are fed into the algorithm for the design of synthetic NRPS constructs. Thus it is important to ensure that no malicious sequence can be entered, which could then be returned as the output of the NRPSDesigner to an unsuspecting user. This is achieved by ensuring the correct domains have been entered by use of the automated domain prediction pipeline using Hidden Markov Models. Additionally, a user that wants to be particularly safe, can filter the domains available to the NRPSDesigner algorithm according to curation status. (Curated domains have been entered or validated by an iGEM Heidelberg or Edinburgh 2013 team member or by another NRPS specialist in contrast to domains that have been entered by other end-users.) The other non-NRPS sequences, such as backbones, promoters etc., which can be added to the constructs after the domains have been determined by the software, are specific to the user that entered them (e.g. by the automated interface to the API of the Parts Registry) and hence pose no danger to other users.
Another important safety issue arising from the theoretical underpinnings of the NRPSDesigner is its use for the malicious synthesis of toxic peptides. Thus in a future version we want to integrate information from databases on toxins in order disable the design of NRPS domains for toxic peptides. We also searched for peptide toxicity prediction tools which could be integrated with the NRPSDesigner. One such tool, called ToxinPred
, uses machine learning methods and a dataset of 1805 toxic peptides in order to accomplish this very task. Unfortunately, the current implementation only considers peptides consisting of proteinogenic amino acids and not the variety of modified or D-amino acids available to NRP-synthetases.

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua-D#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"  potential application in the fermentation industry is discussed:  the software provides a new method for  achieving controlled expression of products in the fermentation industry.
RNA Thermometer (RNAT)
Residing in the 5’ untranslated  region (5’UTR) of the entire mRNA, the RNA thermometer (RNAT) is a kind of  temperature-sensing sequence.  As the  environmental temperature changes, the RNAT folds into a series of different secondary  structures.  Several of the structures  block ribosomes’ access to the mRNA thus hinder translation (referred to as  unmelted structure).  Other structures cause  ribosomes’ binding to the mRNA and the initiation of translation (referred to  as melted structure).  By shifting from  the two kinds of structures, the RNAT regulates gene expression in the level of  translation (1). 
The software RNAThermo designs RNATs that meet the  given parameters
Based on biological and physical  principles, adapting computer algorithms, TNAThermo designs RNATs that meet the  given parameters.  What the user tells  the software are the regulation temperature, the structure (both unmelted structure  and melted structure) of the RNAT and the SD sequence position of the RNAT.  RNAThermo gives the sequences of RNATs that fulfill  these requirements. 
The design of RNATs based on biological principles
The principle behind the RNATs’ response to temperature is fundamental: At  low temperatures, the sequence that binds to ribosomes will be trapped in a  hairpin structure.  Increasing  temperature destabilizes the structure such that the trapped sequence becomes  accessible, allowing translation to be initiated.  The following (Figure 1) is the schematic diagram (2):
 
Figure 1.  Structural change of RNAT’s according to the environmental  temperature.  The SD stands for  Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is recognized and bind by ribosome to initiate translation.  The AUG stands for start codon, from where  the translation begins.
One example for this mechanism is the  regulation of E.Coli’s rpoH gene (Figure 2).  Responding to  environmental temperature change, rpoH gene regulates the expression of the heat shock protein.  Low temperature (30℃)  induces a bend in the ribosome-binding site (RBS)-associated downstream box  (DB) region, thereby interfering with ribosome binding.  High temperature (42℃)  disrupts the bend and initiates the process of translation (3"

Figure 1: Evolution of E.coli DH5α growth depending on the toluene concentration added in the cell culture medium
In compliance with those results, bioluminescence test were realized with a toluene concentration in the culture medium comprised between 0 and 10 mg/L.
Biosensor construction
Three parts were synthesized by IDT in order to construct the whole biosensor : BBa_K2023004 composed of Pr-RBS, BBa_K2023005 coding for the XylR protein and BBa_K2023006 made of Terminator-Pu-RBS-Gaussia Luciferase-Terminator. Those three BioBricks are described in the Parts and characterization section. The biosensor was then assembled using digestion and ligation as described in the notebook Biosensor Construction . The 2nd of August, E.coli bacteria were transformed into the whole biosensor genetic construction. Colony PCR were realized to select the recombinant bacteria. The results (Figure 2) indicated that the colony 6 and 7 have integrated the whole biosensor as strips can be seen at 3400bp. Those colonies were miniprep and the collected DNA was sent to sequencing.
Figure 2: Colony PCR results of bacteria transformed with our whole biosensor. Strips are expected at 3400 bp
Sequencing results were not what we expected: a mutation on the start codon of the XylR protein was present in the plasmid of all our clones. Therefore, we performed a ""site  directed mutagenesis to overcome this problem.
Biosensor characterization
XylR production by modified E.coli bacteria
We aimed to asses the XylR production by E.coli cells modified with the BioBrick BBa_K2023013 composed of Pr-RBS-XylR-RBS-mRFP-Terminator. This BioBrick was designed to monitor XylR synthesis by our cells. To do so, we thaw a tubes of transformed cells on ice for 10 minutes, we added different volumes of SOC medium to obtain several dilutions (1/2, 1/4 and 1/8), we plated different concentrations of bacteria cells on petri dish with LB Agar + Chloramphenicol at 25µg/L final and incubate overnight. We obtained the expected results : red colonies were shown on the petri dish (Figure 3) due to the synthesis of the red protein m"

Sheffield,2014,Team:Sheffield#collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," relaxed evening on the town. We had a great time hosting the teams and hope they did too! Below is a video to show a summary of the events that took place:
Edinburgh
During the course of the project we established contact and collaborative links with a number of different iGEM teams. For instance, with Team Edinburgh we were in touch regarding Human Practices. During skype meetings we discussed our HP project approaches and decided there how our inter-team collaboration would work. Team sheffield was interviewed by team edinburgh over a skype call regarding task management and role distribution within a team. On the other hand, we asked some questions about the different components of their HP work, so that we could incorporate them in the SocioBrick Registry of standard parts that we developed for iGEM. We considered the collaboration successful in that each team was able to get the necessary data from each other to carry on their individual work. We then had a chance to personally meet some members of team Edinburgh in the Young Synthetic Biology Conference in London which was a wonderful further learn about the work they had been invested in as a whole.
Oxford
The Oxford iGEM Team were one of the first teams we established collaborative links with after the meet-up they held in Oxford. When we held our own meet-up in Sheffield, our teams agreed that there was an overlap in the aims of our project.
Team Oxford were one of the first teams we established collaborative links with. After the University of Sheffield Meet-up organised by us, our teams felt their was an overlap in the way our teams worked and what we were addressing and therefore decided that if needed there were certain identified that we could definitely collaborate in. For instance in the beginning of the project our team was having trouble obtaining successful transformations of a certain promoter that we require and so asked if Oxford could try transforming it and see if they encountered the same problem. Oxford were very helpful and happy to do it. However, while this was taking place, our team troubleshooted what the problem had been.
Further down the line, Oxford started developing a stochastic modelling system. With that, they asked if we would be interested in giving them some info regarding the promoters we were testing with our lipase and copy number which we did to allow them to further improve their model.
Paris Bettencourt

We have participated in their fortnightly  newsletter with a sizeable number of other iGEM teams from around the world, updating the participating teams with our progress so far"

Limonene Synthase
Joe and Alina went through some GC-MS data with Lina. We found out that the limonene synthase from the registry works! Read more about it on our data page .
Smiley Face C41 Competent Cells
Jacob has made more C41 competent cells for characterization of the synthases in bacteria.
Cineole Synthase
Disaster! Jacob returned from a couple of weeks vacation back in his home town in Manitoba to find that sequencing showed that his biobrick construction didn't work! A PSTI site remained in the original PGXE synthase, and when the restriction digest and ligation were done, it cut out the part after the site. The sequencing results from the other synthase gene (the PG) showed a tyrosine kinase, which, while interesting, was not what we wanted to send in. Jacob went back to using site directed mutagenesis to remove that site from his original plasmid, having learned that you want to be sure of the sequence of a part before putting it in biobricks.

Collaboration
We are glad to cooperate with HKUST-Hong_Kong on modeling the hypothetical behavior of bcr gene induced by lac or T7. bcr is amembrane protein that actively pumps out a variety of substrates from the cell, notably antibiotics such as tetracycline and kanamycin. Hence, expression of bcr leads to antibiotic resistance. The collaboration was established because of the similarity between halorhodopsin and bcr. Both proteins are membrane transporters, and we are familiar with such scenario.
 
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is acommonly-used indicator to measure the vulnerability of bacteria in presence of antibiotics. It is usually determined by the minimum concentration of antibiotics that could cause observable reduction in turbidity (optical density) for an overnight LB culture. We modeled the relationships between the change of MIC of tetracycline and kanamycin respectively and the concentration of IPTG, which induces bcr downstream of Plac in E. coli. The change of MIC is reported as the ratio of the MIC of bcr-transformed E.coli over that of wildtype E. coli.
 
Modeling results

Fig. 2  Activity of native promoter [1] of bcr (acrAp+acrBp) vs. change in MIC. Curve is fit by one-site total binding model from experimental data [2], [5].

Fig. 4  Change in MIC (effect of using T7 promoter). Data are obtained from [6] and using one-site total binding model for curve fitting.
We modeled HKUST’s data with three assumptions. Firstly, antibiotics are applied during exponential phase or stationary phase. Secondly, Plac only affects the expression of target genes (bcr).

Oscillation
Oscillation
Overview
    Oscillation can be found in the nature easily. It is a phenomenon describing objects changing periodically with time. Seasons change, sunrise and sunset, heartbeat, biological clock, they are all a form of oscillation. And now, we want to apply oscillation to E.coli, making it express different genes periodically, in order to realize the purpose of changing the code book. So, how can we achieve this goal?
Solution
    Through the preliminary experiment, we can see that the bacteria concentration of fluorescent protein expression of AHL and the strength of bacteria is positively correlated. Therefore, we through modeling of the external AHL concentration, the results can be used to characterize the fluorescence intensity.
    After being catalyzed, AHL, which is generated by bimolecular components of luxR and luxl will combine together, and this compound will promote the expression of pluxR. pluxR controls the expression of aiiA, encoding the enzyme which catalyze the degradation of AHL. And all of these form an AHL single-cycled oscillation.
    Therefore,basing on the biological reaction process above, we derived the following set of delay-differential equation model for intracellular concentrations of LuxI (I),AiiA (A), internal AHL (Hi), and external AHL (He)
    In the equation（1）（2）,P(α，τ) represents the Hill function
    describes the delayed production of corresponding proteins, it depends on the past concentration of the internal AHL, and τ is the time delay. These delayed reactions mimic the complex cascades of processes (transcription, translation, maturation, etc.) leading to formation of functional proteins."

Possible Future Applications
1. Probiotics - A Platform For Drug Delivery
Nowadays, drug are not necessarily produced by chemical combination purified from plants or other substances.                 One example is the probiotics that treat Clostridium Difficiles, replacing traditional antibiotics or fecal                 transplantation which may cause negative effects.
There is an increasing support on the effect of microbiomes on human health. Microbiome species present inside                 human body can tell whether a person gets sick and what kinds of illness that could be. Thus, microbiome                 therapeutics is a new hope and breakthrough technology.
The genetically modified bacteria used in the therapeutics can be programmed to detect signals when some dangerous                 or pathogenic bacteria invade the environment. This signal transduction allows bacteria to produce desired                 proteins that help combat with the disease bacteria. Nevertheless, while engineered probiotics offer several                 advantages to human health, it is still deemed as GMOs. Thus, safe implementation is necessary to remove                 engineered gene in this application.
In the light of growing microbiome therapeutics market size, we proposed that microbes can be functioned to deliver                 suitable amount of drugs under a concentration which can optimally cure human diseases. The engineered bacteria                 can be delivered simply in a form of pills like bacterial spore inside an oral capsule. Our construct simulating                 sensing, time delay and knockout condition will be suitable for tourists or soldiers who need to take these                 pills before traveling to a place with high risk of transmissible disease, but this drug will not need to                 express immediately unless diseases are detected. This would be cost saving and safer than taking drugs frequently                 especially when it involves antibiotics.
In addition, the environment will be kept safe by reverting microbes to their original state that can balance                 human flora and continue to serve beneficial purpose to human bodies.

We performed a workshop about synthetic biology called “SynBio 4 All” with the collaboration of Paris Bettencourt iGEM team in Turgut Ozal University International Medical Student Congress. The congress is the biggest and the most qualified medical student congress in Turkey with the highest attendance. By last year, over 1,500 medical students and experts attended our congress to present, learn and discuss new researches and treatments in medical field. Medical students all over Turkey join and present their scientific work which has been achieved throughout the year. Another fact is the international nature of this congress that experts, scientists and attendants from other countries have enriched the content and atmosphere of the congress. The impact on media and public opinion takes place in news and TV channels.

Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Bioluminescence#Bacterial Codon optimisation_-_-_TEXT.html," of codons. This conserves the sequence of amino acids in the gene products, but improves the rate of translation, as more common tRNAs are recruited. Codon usage optimization can yield dramatic increases in the expression of foreign genes, especially if they are introduced from less closely related species Gustafsson et al. 2004
Altered G-C content
DNA curvature is increased by sequences rich in A-T or G-C pairs. The natural V.fischeri Lux operon, and especially its intergenic regions, contains stretches rich in A-T, resulting in the curvature that H-NS proteins bind to preferentially. Changing the coding DNA sequence also meant changing the curvature of the DNA, which affects the binding affinity of H-NS proteins. To alleviate the repression that H-NS exerts, we took care to raise the G-C content of intergenic regions and coding sequences (at times resorting to suboptimal codons). According to a computational prediction, this resulted in greatly reduced DNA curvature, and thus hopefully to a reduced affinity for H-NS proteins.
Change in G-C(red)/A-T(blue) content by codon optimization. The occurence of long A-T rich stretches is reduced in the re-synthesised version of the Lux operon.
Computational prediction of DNA curvature before and after codon optimization. (click to enlarge)
Differential Expression
In Vibrio fischeri, LuxA and B are expressed at five times the levels of LuxC, D, E and G. Since all these genes are transcribed on the same mRNA, but have their own Ribosome Binding Sites, this is probably due to differences in codon usage ( Meighen et al. 1988 ). A number of rare codons are found in Lux C, D, E and G, but not in LuxA and B. Since we did not receive the newly synthesised LuxA and B in time, we constructed a new operon using our LuxC, D, E and G, and the LuxAB BioBrick that was put into the registry by the Edinburgh iGEM team 2009 (BBa_216008). These genes originate from Xenorhabdus luminescens. Compared to Vibrio fischeri, there is only limited amino acid identity in the Lux A and B genes (52% and 66% respectively). Yet the literature describes both as using the same substrates. Schmidt et al. 1989 describe positive complementation test using components from V. fisheri and Xenorhabdus luminescens. To use"
