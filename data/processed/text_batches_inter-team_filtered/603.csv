Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#BioBricks#Used_-_-_TEXT.html,"from registry
This BioBrick was used to create a plasmid without ColE1 ori. The R6K ori has a different compatibility class than the ColE1 ori. So it is used for a two plasmid screening system. The R6K ori is a medium copy plasmid in pir+ / pir116 E. coli strains like EC100D but it does not replicate in pir- strains like E. coli TOP10. So it is easy to separate a ColE1 ori plasmid from another with R6K ori by simply transforming both to e.g. E. coli TOP10.  The R6K ori was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid. Subsequently, the plasmid containing the R6K ori was digested with Hin6I. The largest fragment was extracted from an agarose gel and ligated with T4 DNA Polymerase. Thereby the ColE1 ori was removed, leaving a small fragment of about 30 bp.

We wanted to use this virA BioBrick from the registry but problems occurred ( characterization ), so we created our own virA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 TI-plasmid. Our own (working) virA has the partnumber <partinfo>K389001</partinfo>.

The same problems occurred as with the virA BioBrick - this one from the registry does not work properly , so we made a vir-promoter by ourselves (<partinfo>K389003</partinfo>). The part that was sent to us is actually a tetR gene (<partinfo>C0040</partinfo>) under the control of a constitutive promoter (<partinfo>J23105</partinfo>) before a double terminator (<partinfo>B0015</partinfo>, compare our sequencing results ).

The VirA receptor is used by A. tumefaciens to detect acetosyringone and other phenolic substances which are secreted by plants after injury. In presence of these substances VirA phosphorylates itself and afterwards VirG, a response regulator which activates vir promoters. These promoters control genes which are used for infect"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-def_-_-_TEXT.html," poly-G sequences on the spider silk protein.
Conjugation, First attempt [✔️]
Figure 10. Expected size: 33.7 kDa. Result of the SDS-PAGE run at 200 V, 3.00 A. (1) Protein ladder (7) Spider silk with Def (8) No sample (9) Spider silk reference (10) Protein ladder. Unrelated samples on the gel were covered for clarity.
A clear band at the expected size of approximately 33.7 kDa, corresponding to defensin-fused spider silk protein, can be seen in well 7 in Figure 10. A faint band just below that band, at an approximate size of 23-24 kDa is visible and probably corresponds to spider silk protein not fused with defensin. The non-fused spider silk reference in well 9 is not visible, which is most likely due to the very small amount added as the total amount was limited.
Figure 11. Expected size: 23 kDa. Result of the SDS-PAGE run at 200 V, 3.00 A. The well marked ""SS"" is the one with spider silk protein.
Since the reference in the gel (see Figure 10) is not visible, the spider silk-defensin fusion sample was cross-referenced with another SDS-PAGE made earlier with a non-fused spider silk protein sample (see well labeled ""SS"" in Figure 11). There, the band corresponding to spider silk protein is clearly at a size of approximately 23 kDa, the expected size of the spider silk protein. From this, the conclusion can be made that the conjugation of recombinant produced defensin, with attached His-tag and LPETGG recognition motif, to spider silk protein using Sortase A, was successful.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practice#igemathome_-_-_TEXT.html," of users via the comments field of the survey and the forum pages (see paragraph 3.) reveals a need for improvement of calculations concerning the way calculation processes are split into consumable subtasks. BOINC veterans reviewed the calculations (figure 1, (4)) as to be improved by introducing checkpoints to the calculations that allow an abandoned task to be continued instead of being recalculated from the very start. The overall reception of the project is very good. Not a single participant rated the project 'bad'. Only 5% of the participants did not know how to rank the BOINC project iGEM@home (figure 1, (5). One of the most imporatant results of the survey is the fact that more than 60% of the participants did not now of the existence of the iGEM competition before they downloaded and supported iGEM@home.
Figure 2, Bar Chart:
The bar chart displays the numbers of participants that did evaluate the respective media (screensaver and forum). Whilst both media were evaluated by about 60% of BOINC ‘veterans’, new users preferably reviewed the screensaver (80%) and about 55% did not rank the forum at all.
3. Direct feedback and quotes
Comments and feedback on software and infrastructure:
""Need checkpoints!"": This statement was supported by additional 7 participants of the survey and also a major issue for discussion on the forum. Checkpoints are a feature strongly demanded by many BOINC veterans which is also represented in the review of the calculations (figure 1, (4) and will be implemented as soon as possible.
""Don't want or need a screensaver."": A statement supported by 2 users in total that are both supporters of additional BOINC projects. Some BOINC-enthusiasts that focus on collecting BOINC points might not be interested in the information spread via the screensaver.
""Forum spam was a VERY noticeable problem at first, but since the changes have been implemented as requested by various users I have not seen any spam in the forums."": It is important to quickly respond to requests by members of the community. The BOINC community is very communicative and eager to solve problems in coordination with developers. Several measures including the requirement for posters to have at least earned a few BOINC points with calculations, detecting and deleting spammers and active moderation of the forum solved the problem of spam effectively.
""Credit rate is poor compared to many other projects."" Three users supported the claim that the points earned for computations for the iGEM@home project are low in comparison to other projects. The users proposed"

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Notebook.html_-_-_TEXT.html," we tried amplifying mtrAB(from the previous Gibson), mtrC(from previous PCR, should have used the genome) and pSB1C3 backbone(the linearised plasmid from iGEM HQ). Unfortunately, the backbone PCR failed.
We thought that perhaps dimers of the primers formed as the sequences of prefix and suffix are not that different. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, 1kb ladder(Invitrogen) (on the right).
However, after playing a bit with DMSO and annealing temperatures we were still unable to amplify it until we changed the template. We took a random iGEM part we found in the fridge and tried the PCR on it and it worked. Conclusion: iGEM HQ should provide more information about their plasmid linearisation and how were the ends modified.
August 13th
2nd and 3rd Gibson Assembly. So we purified the assembly parts from previous PCR and did the calculations to maximise the amount of product. This reaction was also relatively simple as we reduced the number of fragments to 3 and it results in already circular plasmid.
So while we do the transformations, spending some usual late time in the labs, we also did a PCR using VF2 and VR primers. The gel confirms that reactions were successful. We can see the bands just above the 5kb mark,and as there is only about 130bp difference between these distinct mtr constructs it is impossible to see that on the gel. 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, 1kb ladder(Invitrogen) (on the right).
August 14th
So after having some sleep we head back to the lab and do the colony PCR on our transformations. But because Jonas is a very lazy person he used Phusion polymerase (which is as much as 4 times faster than GoTaq) and failed - there is nothing visible on the gel apart from ladder. It is not the first time this happens with Phusion colony PCR, so we try to avoid doing it, it appears though that Phusion requires relatively pure DNA template.
Nonetheless, we inoculate 2 cultures each of both mtr ORFs only and mtr+promoter constructs and grow them overnight. But it is not all for the day.
Also, today we got the new primers for the rest of the cloning, so we amplified the sequences of gold peptides and gold sensing device adding the rest of prefix and suffix. It all worked but the gel is really really hideous thus it will not appear"

Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it’s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI’s from different organisms[5]. AND, not all of them have the same level of sensitivity towards triclosan[23]. This is why we needed to screen a panel of enzymes in order to find the enzyme most sensitive towards triclosan with a nanomolar inhibition constant. (See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)
Reported triclosan inhibition constants:
Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex. IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%
From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI. We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum. Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set. We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn’t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our project
Of the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18]. From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI’s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19]. Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme. Therefore we decided to test 3 FabIs from algae: P. tricornutum, T. pseudonana, and A. protothecoides.
This left us with a candidate list of 7 FabI proteins. 1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry ( Bba_K771303 ), 3 FabI proteins"

To introduce ourselves, get expertise on the S.H.I.E.L.D. and discuss further cooperation with the Deutsche Malaria GmbH we met with Dr. David Hutchinson, Erik Lindemann and Frank Oertel. Dr. David Hutchinson is an expert with more than 50 years of experience in the field of tropical medicine mainly working on malaria treatments as a clinical research clinician. Erik Lindemann and Frank Oertel offered us their expertise in funding and development to build a commercial product.
After explaining our idea, we discussed the practical application of the S.H.I.E.L.D and the future challenges for a broad implementation. When explaining their vision in joint fight against malaria, Mr. Oertel mentioned the frightening numbers and put our focus on the high child mortality rate.
Mr. Oertel: “We think the need to fight malaria is getting more relevant. There are about 500.000 deaths and 200 million infections due to malaria and 80 percent of these deaths are children below an age of five.”
At the end of our discussion Dr. David Hutchinson drew our attention to another important topic, we had not investigated at that time.
Dr. Hutchinson: “But out there is a huge disease, causing immense morbidity, insect vector borne disease, which is dengue. That is a crippling disease. […] Very seriously, you should bare that in mind.”
The S.H.I.E.L.D. uses as a device to fight other insect borne diseases shows its great potential as a protection against today’s biggest health risks.
Full Interview with Dr. David Hutchinson
Bjarne: We started our project and developed it and the basic problem we saw is that in Africa in many rural areas you do not have a very good infrastructure like hospitals and electricity. So, we asked ourselves: How can we design something that is everlasting and can actively fight malaria mosquitoes and we came up with this idea of a co-culture between cyanobacteria and genetically engineered E. coli. The plan is that the cyanobacteria produce nutrients for the genetically engineered E. coli, while the E. coli have to do the majority of the work and produce certain molecules, certain proteins, that we can use to basically lure mosquitoes and kill them.
Dr. Hutchinson: The killing part is the interesting one.
Bjarne: That is why we firstly designed pathways to produce certain volatile molecules that lured these mosquitoes so that they get to our trap and then we designed a specific insecticide from a scorpion, that only targets insects and which is able to kill these mosquitoes. Also the E. coli are genetically engineered so that they have limited"

An exception is K389422 were induced and not indiced system revealed analog results. Corresponding to data of iGEM Team, Cambridge 2009, K389423 (originated from I746390 ) shows the highest amplification rate of all tested Sensitivity Tuners. Our results indicate to higher amplification rate of K389421 than K389422 of 100 fold under induced conditions. The controls also show high basal transcription rates.
Because there is small difference in induced and not induced system visible and basal transcription rates are high, we assume that the sensitivity tuning constructs are not well applicable for luciferase measurements.

For safety, know more & do more.
In our Human Practice project, we decided to do a survey focusing on the health and safety of researchers. We collected information and the results inspired us a lot. We consequently decided to integrate the 'safety' part into our program.
We will demonstrate the survey before presenting more details of the integration.
investigation Information collecting Investigating Initiate a reform Integrating
Context, rationale & prior work of the investigation
Event 1 On Sep 21st, a serious accident hurt three students badly, which shocked the whole country. According to the report, a student who is in his second year of postgraduate study was teaching two newcomers to do experiments. He wrongly used an Erlenmeyer flask instead of a beaker and added much potassium permanganate (KMnO4) to concentrated sulfuric acid. When he was doing this, he told his students to be careful because ""the product is easily to explode"". Pitifully, hardly when he had finished the sentence did it come true. Two of the students became blind with their face destroyed.
Event 2 Young Overseas High-level Talents Introduction Plan is a program started by the government of China. The program encourages young scientists to return and work in China. With the help of the government, talented young scientists can do research freely. However, many young scientists work so hard that they don't care about their health. They work for so long time that many of them suffer from serious health issues. According to a survey made by China Association for Science and Technology, scientists work for 8.6 hours per day in average, the longest of which spend 16 hours a day working in lab. Things are particularly worse for PhD students. They work for 9.29 hours per day. Recently, a professor died at the age of 35, the best age for scientists.
Traditionally, respect hard-working people are highly regarded. This tradition influenced all the East Asian countries. In Japan, you could still see that many people work as long as they could. Another reason is that the government used to encourage scientists to devote themselves to their work. This is because China used to be poor and weak in 1950s. Many scientists"
Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"quired about their interest in possibly organizing a Canadian iGEM team Newsletter. Helen took on the initiative of managing the submissions, editing, and production of the newsletter, which she envisioned as an accessible platform for collaborations between Canadian teams.
On Thursday, May 25, the entire iGEM Calgary team attended a tour of the Pine Creek wastewater treatment plant. We learned about the different stages of wastewater treatment. An image of our team at the wastewater treatment plant is shown below:
Figure 1: iGEM Calgary 2017 visits the Pine Creek wastewater treatment plant. Image courtesy of Lalit Bharadwaj.
We also discovered that integrating our engineered bacteria into the wastewater treatment system may not be cost-effective and that the natural PHB-producing microbes would be easier to culture in the bioreactors which already exist at the wastewater treatment plant. We also considered the costs of implementing our system into the wastewater treatment infrastructure and realized that any profit from the sale of the plastic would be negligible, especially since the wastewater treatment plant was already obtaining a value-added product (biogas, for electricity generation) from its treatment process.
By the end of the week, our team had a clearer direction as to the possible impacts and applications of the plastic produced. Our findings are summarized below:
Literature and team brainstorm summary (applications of PHB):
This project will also explore whether bioplastic production is actually more environmentally friendly than traditional plastic production. Factors to consider include carbon usage and storage, biodegradability, contribution to landfill waste, and the ecological impact of the bacteria we create. Ultimately, it is important to our team to identify a few key applications (preliminary research has suggested medical implants and microbeads) where our product would be safe, non-polluting, and effective. With regards to the bacteria, we are looking into ways to use antibiotic resistance-free selection mechanisms so that our bacteria do not pass on resistance genes to wild-type populations of bacteria. This will ensure that the water supply does not become contaminated.
Medical implants could be a good application for our product since the specific PHA product we hope to synthesize, Poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) is nontoxic and biocompatible (in mouse studies) as long as it is treated to remove inflammation-causing agents prior to tissue implantation (Williams et al., 1998). PHBV is also a good candidate for creating strong sutures which can naturally degrade (Williams et al., 1998).

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
The model should impact your project design in a meaningful way. Modeling may include, but is not limited to, deterministic, exploratory, molecular dynamic, and stochastic models. Teams may also explore the physical modeling of a single component within a system or utilize mathematical modeling for predicting function of a more complex device.
Please see the 2018  Medals Page for more information.

    Pollution of toxic heavy metals generated by anthropogenic activities is a worldwide concern while aquatic environments are frequently the final recipients of most of heavy metal pollutants (Bakis and Tuncan; Boyd). For instance, enhanced accumulation inferred from sediment and ice cores clearly show mercury continually accumulates in waters and rivers (Fig.1 Tchounwou et al., 2003). Traditional techniques to detect or decontaminate heavy metals in natural samples can be costly and time consuming, especially at low metal concentration; therefore, robust and inexpensive methods to detect and decontaminate heavy metals in water are highly desirable (Tecon and van der Meer, 2008; van der Meer and Belkin). Namely, we need to develop a high-performance heavy metal decontamination kit which can accomplish the detection and absorption of heavy metals in aquatic environment conveniently.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-lys_-_-_TEXT.html,"ostaphin PCR product. In this first attempt, the digestions were unsuccessful and the sizes of the single and double digested were not consistent. To exclude human error, the same procedure was repeated.
Digestion: Second attempt [✔️]
In the second attempt of digestion, the double digestions showed smaller sized bands when compared to the single digestions (well 10-12). The three bands however showed smears which could suggest that the sample was only partially digested. Bearing this in mind, we continued to gel purify the digested products and ended with a purified DNA product of 5.1 ng/μl at 747 bp.

Ligation and Transformation pSB1K3-T7-Lys: First attempt [❌]
In order to perform the 3A assembly, the T7 Promoter and pSB1K3 were also subjected to double digestions with the correct restriction enzymes. The T7 was digested with EcoRI and SpeI whereas the pSB1K3 was digested with EcoRI and PstI.
Together the three digested products were ligated and transformed into chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells. The first attempt of the ligation procedure showed positive results, as mentioned in Lab book 4.

The colonies were subcultured into LB medium and kept as glycerol stocks. The plasmid from the bacterial was extracted and later confirmed through sequencing. The result of the sequencing however showed that the insert was not lysostaphin but in fact Esp that had contaminated the lysostaphin samples. We suspect that this cross-contamination emerged when we used digested backbones from pSB1K3-T7-EB. At that time we had ran out of the the linearized pSB1K3 stock and resulted in recycling the stock we had from the pSB1K3-T7-EB. We suspect that the during the digestion of pSB1K3-T7-EB or during the gel purification procedure, undigested pSB1K3-T7-EB was still present in the"

We were not able to open the traces of the sequences because Java was being annoying and wouldn't download on this computer properly, but it is safe to say that what we ligated into our plasmids was our G-blocks, and from the transformations it is clear that those G-block worked to create the 2 plasmid interaction that we intended it to!!! YAYATAYYY HAPPY DAYS!!
6/19/14:   Made more 1X TAE  We checked the colonies from yesterday and did not see any colonies. Therefore we decided to re-transform on a Chlor 50 ug/uL LB plate.  We transformed HSP+pACYC184 ligation with -80 C DH5Alpha cells and also using C-medium and T solution protocol on page 41 of the lab notebook (see attached photo?) except that after that protocol was followed we added 50 uL of T solution and cells to 5 uL of the ligation. Then we added 500 uL of 1X SOC and put it in a water bath at 37 C for an hour. Then we plated on the chlor plates.   We found 3 promoter and 3 reporter genes for the high school kids (Promoters and Reporters doc).   we took the 4 2014 parts from the above list of 6 that we got from the IGEM registry by adding 10 uL of ddH2O to the proper wells on the IGEM trays and then we transfered that to ependorfs that we put into our box. Then we followed the transformation from page 41 again with the same added steps as above with the expection that we used 2 uL of the biobrick instead of the 5 uL of ligation that we usually use.   We then streaked out those transformations and incubated overnight.      6/20/14 (Devora):  We looked at our plates from yesterday and saw 4 colonies on one of our HSP+pAYA184 plates! It was the one made from the frozen DH5Alpha cells. So in order to see if it has our construct or not we colony PCR'ed the 4 colonies on #130. We also used a positive control of HSP G"

Education & Public Engagement
- A Trip to the Future and Beyond!
If you want change, look to the future! Such was the wording of our core philosophy. A philosophy that was carried out, by reaching out to the people of our society to ensure the engagement of the next generation, within the world of synthetic biology.
Ever since World War II, the West has seen an expansion and intensification of anti-scientific sentiment, which today primarily concern Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). We will for that reason explore GMO’s role in history, to see if a historical perspective will allow us reach a new understanding of these sentiments. You can read all about it here.

A Historical Perspective on GMO
From Food Concerns to Sustainable Energy
When talking about the history of GMO, we have the rare privilege of choice, as  depending on how you define GMO, One could potentially choose any historical period as their starting point. For instance, we could be examining the breeding of wolves to dogs, or simple agriculture, where the bad seeds are destroyed in favour of higher quality crops Rangel G. From Corgis to Corn: A Brief Look at the Long History of GMO Technology. Genetically Modified Organisms and Our Food. August 2015.
For the purpose of narrative, we will be starting our examination with the dawn of the 20th century. A time in which stale and rotten food lead to health concerns. Through several years, the public was continuously made aware of health problems regarding food in the United States. This culminated in the 1906 statute:, which allowed the inspection and ban of products JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. . During the time leading up to this act, the public grew to appreciate items labeled as pure. A trend we can observe in most journalistic material from the time period O’Keefe TJ. The Alliance herald. : (Alliance, Box Butte County, Neb.) 1902-1922. T.J. O'Keefe; 1902.
This need for pure food naturally originated partly from several years of unsatisfactory food and health concerns JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. , and partly from a political fiction: The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset & Dunlap,; 1906 1906"
UofC_Calgary,2016,Team:UofC Calgary#notebook#sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," Tack - The immediate holding power of the label upon contact with the substrate. A label with high initial tack will grab the substrate quickly. A label with low initial tack will exhibit a low level of adhesion when first applied and may remove cleanly.
Ultimate Adhesion - The ultimate or maximum holding power that the label will achieve as the adhesive penetrates into the substrate. The time required to obtain ultimate adhesion may depend on the stiffness (shear) of the adhesive, the roughness of the substrate and the temperature of the environment.
Shear Resistance - A measure of the internal cohesive strength of the adhesive. The shear of the adhesive is an indication of how soft an adhesive is. A low-shear adhesive (soft) has more of a tendency to flow (resulting in higher initial tack), and has a higher chance that the adhesive will split apart if put under stress. A high-shear adhesive (firm) is less likely to split under stress because of its good internal cohesive strength, and will be less likely to flow (possibly lower initial tack).

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"2098L was already in the iGEM registry (iGEM Part_ J18926) but was not available. Moreover, it contains only one mutation on the 3 described in the literature. So we decided to work with the fully mutated FRB. The rapalog and the plasmid containing the mutated FRB and FKBP12 were offered from Takara Clontech. But as mentioned previously, this system is used in mammal cells, so we decided to optimize the sequences for an expression in E. coli with the Jcat platform. We finally ordered gBlocks coding for the FRB* and FKBP12 optimized sequences and a linker in prevision of the fusion with their respective dCas9s.
Using these two systems (dCas9 recognition and FRB/FKBP12 dimerization) we design our new tool [Figure 2 and Figure 3] based on the two following BioBricks:
Fig 2: Final biobrick designs for the BDC tool and dimerization mechanism. Color correspond to the two different orthologous dCas9s and to the heterodimerization system. dCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is fused to FRB* and dCas9 from Treponema denticola is fused to FKBP12. Addition of rapalog allowing dimerization.
These two biobricks will be assembled in the pSB1C3 plasmid giving us a BDC tool which would work as presented bellow:
Fig 3: BDC tool mechanism
Now you can understand why we needed two orthologous dCas9: it avoids us being in the situation where two dCas9-FRB* or two dCas9-FKBP12 are fixed on the DNA!
Visualization tool construction
As every system needs an efficient control, we set up a new part of the project in order to assess our Bring DNA Closer tool works properly: the visualization tool.
To build this new tool, two other orthologous dCas9s were used and respectively come from the organisms N. meningitidis and S. thermophilus. These dCas9s will be fused to subunits of a fluorescent protein [Fig5]. We also decided to use a dCas9 system for this tool in order to detect an accurate and unique sequence in the genome. It will be associated with a tripartite split-GFP, which has never been released in the iGEM competition.
The tripartite split-GFP is composed of two twenty amino-acids long GFP tags (GFP 10 and"

Next, we electroporated all ligations into both BL21 and DH5α cells. Hopefully, a fluorescence trial can be done tomorrow with these colonies! We made overnight culture for pC13J. We did electroporation for pC13I, pC13CV and pAK13CS. The last one unfortunately arced. Our Gibson-transformed plates had too many colonies so we restreaked them. We miniprepped pC13CG and prepared it for Biobrick submission. We also checked our plates in the Turgeon lab. The control plate is growing well, and the others appear to have something very small starting to grow. We will give them more time before checking again. We also received our sequencing results from pC13BM 1, pC13BK 1, pC13BC, pC13BV, and pC13CE, which all appear to have been successful. We set up a culture of pC13CD from its glycerol stock to re-miniprep and submit as a biobrick.
Gibson assembly for the G. lucidum promoter yielded no colonies. Numerous ligations and electroporations were done for fluorescent constructs. We are starting the afp1 Aspergillus growth assay.

Greetings from Team DTU!
Our team is made up of 10 students competing in this years iGEM competition. This year's team representing DTU is made up of a diverse group of students, both culturally and scientifically. This means that we get to learn so much from each other, professionally as well as culturally. As we are studying at a technical University, we are given an even greater opportunity to really flex our brain-muscles and be innovative. You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter !
The goal of our project is to enable colonies of E. coli bacteria to transition between production of two different reporter proteins. In our system, switching between states will be induced by exposing the bacteria to light. Each of the states will have a specific frequency associated with it. There are multiple potential applications for biologicals ""switches"" such as these, this includes the improved control of production of additives in industrial biotechnological processes.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," as shown below. We then once again treated our PCR amplified tubes with DpnI for one hour, and then transformed into highly competent E.coli. The plates were left overnight to allow colony growth. Our second accomplishment of the week was successfully amplifying the OleT gene from Jeotgalicoccus, by using the Kapa system. This was very successful, as shown in the gel below. We then performed the cycle-pure spin protocol to remove contamination from our PCR product, and then proceeded to perform a restriction digest on the product with HindIII and AscI so that we could ligate it into the PET vector. After this ligation was complete, it was transformed with E.coli on a Kan plate, and left overnight to incubate. Unfortunately we do not see colonies yet, but the incubation is not complete yet, and might still be successful. Thirdly, we obtained the PetroBrick stock from the Washington team on Tuesday, and immediately proceeded to transform it. We obtained a great deal of colonies, and then performed colony PCR on 12 of these colonies to ensure that our ~2400bp PetroBrick was present in these cells. Last but not least, we have still been working on a successful purification of NPT from a transformed plate. A colony PCR indicated that NPT was potentially in a few of these colonies, so we made overnight cultures of these four colonies, and performed a miniprep the next morning, and then a restriction digest to verify that the gene was present.
Week 18 (August 27 - August 31)
This week, the primary objectives from last week were continued. Another restriction digest of OleT and then a ligation was performed, in order to see if we could obtain more colonies following transformation. After preparing overnight cultures and minipreps of eight of these colonies, we attempted to cut the OleT/PET vector with EcorI to verify that the gene had successfully inserted into the vector. Unfortunately, we did not have any luck, even after several attempts. Our attempts to verify this will continue. We also performed ligations with NPT (cut with XbaI and PstI) with JI3002 (cut with SpeI and PstI), so that we could produce a biobrick with JI3002 before NPT to act as a promoter and ribosome binding site. We decided on how we will build our two primary constructions, and where each part will be. Also, we attempted to amplify the CAR gene in the PET vector (with 3 mutagenesis sites replaced) with biobrick prim"

Cell Lysis with RIPA Buffer
Cells of 24-well plates were washed with 500 µl of cooled DPBS. Then, cells were lysed in 100 µl of chilled RIPA Buffer, followed by a 10-minute incubation on ice. Next, cells were dissolved with a cell scrapper or inverted pipet tip and the developing lysate transferred to a 1.5 ml tube. Samples were vortexed thoroughly, preceding a second 10-minute incubation on ice. A 5 minute centrifugation step was done at 10,000 g. 60 µl of the supernatant were mixed with 20 µl of 4x Laemmli protein dye. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 minutes and afterwards either frozen at -20 °C or directly used for subsequent Western Blotting.
PCB preparation
PCB preparation 25mg purified PCB was obtained from LivChem. The PCB- powder was diluted in 1,3ml DMSO and aliquoted into Eppendorf- tubes. The absorbance- spectrum at 300 to 750nm, as well as A680 was determined using the GeneQuant 1300- spectrometer. The concentrations were calculated according to Lambert- Beer´s Law (E= ε*c*d;ε680nm= 37900 M^(-1) cm^(-1)).
The absorbance spectrum of PCB was measured aiming to proof the purity of the purchased PCB. PCB was diluted in methanol/HCl (95:5) and subsequently the absorption was measured within the range of 450 to 800nm wavelength using the infinite M200 PRO- plate- reader (TECAN, Switzerland).
Red-Light experiments
24 h post transfection, the medium was exchanged thereby adding 15µM phycocyanobilin (PCB). The cells were incubated for 1h in the CO2- incubator to allow the formation of holo-Phytochrome B. Subsequently the cells were illuminated under controlled conditions using light sources emitting distinct amounts of light: 20µE for 48h, 660nm or 740nm wavelength. The control-plate was kept in darkness.
UV-B Light experiments
The cells were illuminated under controlled conditions using light sources emitting distinct amounts of light: 5µE for 24h, 311nm wavelength. The control-plate was kept in darkness.

Fusion protein functionality testing: Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
From the previous test, it was shown that Tn5 by itself were able to load the adapter DNA. Since the Tn5 portion of the fusion protein might behave differently, we did the same experiment with the fusion protein.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.
Table 1: Primer sequence to be annealed for the adapter. Note that 5’ of the upper strand of the adapter has to be phosphorylated for successful integration.

The conversation with Dr.Jiang
16th August 2018, our team visited Doctor Yiliang Jiang from Xi'an Jinhua Ecological Technology Co., Ltd.
He is a doctor from Northwest A&F University and Chinese Academy of Science.
At the same time, he is the general manager of Xi'an Jinhua Ecological Technology Co., Ltd.
Xi'an Jinhua Ecological Technology Co., Ltd. is an agricultural environmental protection company providing environmental testing, soil testing and diagnosis, soil improvement and restoration, soil and water conservation, etc., with Shaanxi as the center and “China Agricultural Silicon Valley” – Shaanxi Yangling as the fulcrum National radiation, effectively promote the landing and promotion of scientific and technological achievements. In just over two years of establishment, they have accomplished ecological management in a variety of complex environments in many regions.
During the meeting, We got information about the currant situation of Chinese saline-alkali land and so on.
According to the talk with the him, we’ve learnt that nowadays only in China there were 550 million mu available saline and alkaline land resources in all kinds. In these fields, there are 185 million mu has prospect of agricultural utilization, which includes 153 million mu saline alkali wasteland unused and new-coming, 32 million mu saline alkali barrier land unreformed and 100 million mu saline alkali land which has  improvement potential.
At the same time, the distribution of saline alkali land in China is imbalanced. It mainly distributes in Northeast region(30 million mu), Middle North region(15 million mu), Northwest region(30 million mu),"

Figure 4: Red light driven mCherry production in CHO-K1 cells using spatio-temporal gene expression
3.5x10^6 cells were seeded and transfected with tetR-pif, vp16-phyB and mcherry reporter. The illumination was proceeded at 0.5 µE for 1 h through a ""heart"" edit format (left picture). The right picture is showing the fluorescence of mCherry and was proceeded using imageJ with a Gaussian Blur(1.0) and by adjusting intensity and contrast. A heart is visible within the cells.
Figure 5: Red light driven mCherry production in CHO-K1 cells using spatio-temporal gene expression
3.5x10^6 cells were seeded and transfected with tetR-pif, vp16-phyB and mcherry reporter. The illumination was proceeded at 0.5 µE for 1 h through a iGEM logo edit format (left picture). The right picture is showing the fluorescence of mCherry and was proceeded using imageJ with a Gaussian Blur(1.0) and by adjusting intensity and contrast. The iGEM logo is visible within the cells.
Figure 3 -5 is only a collection of our best pictures. The picture quality strongly depends on the density of cells as well as on the efficiency of the transfection. In either case a failure would result in a diffuse resolution. Another important factor is the illumination time and the scattering of light. Both has to be optimized empirically. In our experiments we removed the lid of the culture dish and covered the top of the uniBOX with a black rag to minimize backscattering.
Summary and Outlook
We showed that our uniBOX is able to efficiently activate gene expression using red light. Therefore the iGEM team Freiburg 2013 provides an easy and cost efficient protocol to perform light experiments. Furthermore with help of Konrad Müller and Hannes Beyer we were able to show spatio-temporal gene expression using the uniBOX. Spatio-temporal gene expression itself is a big step forward in the direction of tissue engineering. Already simple structures as shown with the iGEM logo can be translated into gene expression. With modern equipment like a red laser in the right focus plane it should be possible to minimize light scattering and activate even cells. Together with our uniCAS tool that is able to target multiple genes at once on different light stimuli different pathways in different cells could be activated or repressed.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," funded by SOSV such as Peer to Peer Probiotics and Anú Dairy.
On the 28th of July we were involved in the organisation of the IndieBio Eu Demo Day and Summer Party. We helped out at registration desk and running miscellaneous errands throughout the evening. Three of the team were in charge of running the Livestream of the event on Periscope. This involved asking many scientists and CEOs about their work on synthetic biology. One of our opening interviews was with Dragons Den investor Sean O’Sullivan who founded SOSV. He gave us valuable insights into starting a business such as, what investors’ look for in a CEO and the comparison of failure and success rate of start-ups.
Our involvement with IndieBio enabled us to gain invaluable expertise from past iGEM members that went on to develop companies based on their iGEM project. One such past member was Prateek Garg, who took part in iGEM 2015 with a postgraduate team representing Paris-Battencourt. He is now the CEO of Peer to Peer Probiotics who fortify foods with enhanced probiotics that you can grow at home and share in a peer-to-peer fashion.
When speaking to Prateek we were delighted to receive ample invaluable advice with regard to the iGEM competition. He informed us that in addition to him, there were several other scientists in his company alone who had partaken in iGEM. He gave us a brief illustration of what their iGEM project was based on and imparted many lessons which he and his counterparts had learned. He indicated the importance of keeping record of all the relevant biobricks, throughout the summer. Maintaining a story element to the project was an aspect he placed key emphasis on; i.e. not only focusing on the wet lab of the project but also on the applications of the project. He advised that work on the wiki be commenced as early as possible, which we learnt in due course was excellent advice! Obtaining some guidance from a member of a successful iGEM team gave us great confidence in completing the tasks necessary to progress our project.
IndieBio Survey
Our team also decided to conduct a survey to investigate the relationship of the creation of start-ups and iGEM or DIY Bio. As previously mentioned, IndieBio (a synthetic biology start-up accelerator) has its european operations based in Cork. Every summer there is an accelerator programme in which chosen start-up companies receive seed-funding and lab space to develop their ideas. Having met with the IndieBio teams and hearing about some of their previous IGEM experiences, we were interested in"

Michael Bartoschek
Michael is a bachelor student of Molecular Biotechnology at the Ruprecht-Karls University Heidelberg. He has recently finished the 4th semester. He likes the idea of Synthetic Biology and iGEM. He is looking forward on working with a highly motivated, young team and learning much about arranging own scientific projects.
Simon Haas
Simon is a Bachelor student in Molecular Cell Biology at the University of Heidelberg in the 4th semester. During several smaller internships at institutions like the BZH, ZMBH, HIP, ZI he gained experience in experimental molecular and cellular biology and biochemistry. He is fascinated by the idea of creating functional synthetic systems in biology. Besides Synthetic Biology Simon is highly interested in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience. He will continue his studies in Biochemistry at the Imperial College London next semester.
Tim Heinemann
Tim started his scientific career at the Humboldt University Berlin with the Bachelor program of Theoretical Biophysics. Inspired by the beautiful cultural and academic atmosphere of Germany's capital he first encountered the field of Theoretical Biology. After three years he wrote his thesis in multivariate statistical analysis at the department of physics at the Free University Berlin. Currently he completes the second semester of his studies of Systems Biology within the Master's program Molecular Biosciences at the University of Heidelberg. During this work he realized that having knowledge in both the theoretical and practical field is essential to model biological systems. For example to make a good theoretical model it is necessary to be aware of the approximate character of the experiment and to evaluate the collected data. According to him"
Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"pAh13G), we amplified the trpC promoter (PtrpC, a constitutive fungal promoter) and the trpC terminator (TtrpC). From pNG (pAg13H), we amplified nptII, the geneticin (a plant/fungal antibiotic) resistance gene.
The second day of bootcamp had more activity-- we PCR-amplified a variety of parts to biobrick them and get ready for making composite parts later.

Originally Rafael converted his mycodraw program from java to javascript (which took a VERY long time), but the script only worked on some browsers :( We had to settle for the gif instead.
I finally started moving pages to the 2013 wiki! It's looking very empty right now, but Rafael made a gif of our logo with his mycodraw program to use as a homepage placeholder.

Unfortunately, last time our ligation of GFP and the promoters from the Interlabstudy did not seem to have worked. So we started again with a ligation and we ran a gel to see if the digestions worked. In the first lane you can see the backbone and the GFP insert. The second digestion should have shown the same result but did not (for some reason) and the other three wells show us the backbone we opened for the ligation. Let's hope that we get the ligation working this time.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html,". The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace"

3. Collaboration with CIEI-BJ
[mentoring a new high school team]
◎ BIT-China for CIEI-BJ
https://2016.igem.org/Team:CIEI-BJ/Collaborations
CIEI-BJ is a high school team and it’s their first time to participate in iGEM competition this year. In the middle of July, team CIEI-BJ came to visit Beijing Institute of Technology and communicated with our team BIT-China.
As an undergraduate team, we shared the core concept of our project this year and explained a little bit about how we have exchanged ideas among the team members and how to assess the feasibility of our design as a reference for high school students.
Later, team members in high school also shared their fascinating ideas. However, some plans are not that practical due to the objective reasons. A lot of questioned were raised by members of BIT-China to help shape the project of team CIEI-BJ this year. The considerations refer to the practical meaning and the possibility of conduct for an appropriate project. What’s more, some suggestions are given to optimize the details like designing an experiment to prove a concept.
After the discussion, we showed high school students around our lab and explained the brief function of some experimental instruments. Besides, we introduced them to the previous projects of our team with the aid of posters preserved.
After they designed the basic gene circuit, we gave some advice on how to improve it. In the next few months, the guidance of BIT-China to CIEI-BJ are not only limited to the project itself, but also extended to the details about the competition procedures. We have been in touch with CIEI-BJ through the Internet and give advice on many aspects, like how to present our iGEM program to potential sponsors and how to achieve the requirements for deliverables.
In September 17th, 2016, some members of BIT-China are invited to share their experience on how to design the wiki page. A few examples were given to explain the good elements in introducing the project in a simple way. What should be put on the wiki were also discussed during this meeting. Considering the web fluency and in order to design a clear page, notes are listed for high school members to pay attention when they are working on their wiki.
In the process of mentoring a high school team, we also benefited a lot. Not only did we engage in the competition, but also we had a better understanding of the"

Paris EcoR1-Pstl Insert Plasmid
During the summer of 2018, we approached the 2018 iGEM Paris Envy team with a request to use one of their 2017 composite parts.  We believed that we could use it to incorporate our promoter, regulator and reporter together and incorporate it into a plasmid with a compatible ORI for an E. coli that had already been engineered to produce 3HP.  Essentially we intended to implement our biosensor into a 3HP producing chassis in order to demonstrate that our biobrick could be integrated into a previously existing biotechnologically modified system.  The biobrick was sent expeditiously by the Paris Envy team, and worked exactly as promised.  All of our work is carefully documented and will be an excellent future goal for our project.

Boas Pucker: Weekly Mentor Meetings
We had the privilege to meet Boas Pucker through the iGEM Mentorship program. Pucker has helped us in a variety of ways via Skype calls. He has helped us stay track on deadlines, troubleshoot lab issues and cheer us on. Currently, he works as a research scientist at the department of plant biology at Bielefield University. He is currently on the Bielefield 2018 iGEM Team.  Check out their Wiki!
Edinburgh
The Edinburgh iGEM team reached out to us about a possible collaboration. Their E. coli strain has the ability to produce propionate. They wanted to know whether or not our biosensor would be able to work inside of their strain, to measure the amount of propionate they are creating. We tested our Bacillus subtilis strain in a propionate gradient to see if it would be able to measure the chemical. We have demonstrated that our 2018 iGEM device is a successful biosensor of propionic acid. Our next steps are to grow up Edinburgh's construct and lyse the bacterium to extract propionate. We will then place our B. subtilis biosensor into the lysed contents and"

Modeling for Human Practices: The secret files
Students from our Human Practices subteam found out that two years before releasing their last product, the Talking Life Device, Talking Life Technologies started to carry out a high number of secret experiments regarding the safety of their uprising new sensing-bacteria. These controversial results have just been released two days ago! Click on the image below or in this link to read the complete version of their report!
After analyzing it, we realized that these equations and the parameters used belong to previous studies done in 2010 (1). Since we wanted to test whether these results were true, we have also carried out our own experiments (Table 1) to determine the best data to use and check the possible outcomes. Let’s model Human Practices!
Table 1. Data from different sources used to modelllize the population dynamics.
*Data obtained after several experiments with a cheating plasmid and with no plasmid at all.
After using our own data the population dynamics we obtained is similar to those from Talking Life Technologies (Figure 4), confirming the worst-case scenario:

using our own data.
So, how could this big company have done something like that? Is our health under their control?
Experimental evolution prediction from the model
With the model proposed by Frank [1], with some changes to meet our experimental setup, we obtained the folowing system of ODEs
And after the parametric identification of the system with SSm algorithm, with data from the experimental evolution , we get values for the model parameters.
Then we made a simulation experiment to see what happens when we start with no cheaters. In figure 5, we can see the predicted time evolution of the Bac2 and cheaters population.

TP_CC_SanDiego,2016,Team:TP CC SanDiego#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Coli might also be useful in reducing use of antibiotic resistance genes. The gene coding for an amino acid could be substituted for the antibiotic resistance gene, with all petri dishes containing essential amino acids, except one. This would ensure growth of just transformed bacteria. To prevent spread of the newly engineered parts, it might be ideal to integrate them into the bacterial chromosome, as to prevent spreading parts through bacterial conjugation. For conducting the tests for our experiments, e.g. gel electrophoresis, there is little to report. The only major thing that should be improved on that has some safety risk is the handling of the hot agarose solution in gel electrophoresis. Instead of the hot-mitts that gives one a somewhat crab-like grip, it might be a better idea to provide hot mitts that enable a 5 fingered grip. Most of our other lab procedures are quite safe; for instance, we do not use UV light to determine banding for gel electrophoresis. Instead we use regular lighting due to our visualizing solution.
UCLA iGEM Meetup
On September 23 we met with UCLA’s iGEM team via Skype. During this meeting, we discussed details of our project’s goals, progress, and impact. In particular, we shared what new updates we’ve made to our experiment from last year, discussing what changes worked better. This included updates to our secretion system, and updates to our method of analyzing chitinase gene expression via FLAG-tag. UCLA iGEM gave us advice on how to expand our chitinase project, especially regarding ways to create a chitin medium that would enable us to test whether the chitinase was working. We also shared ideas for human practices, discussing public outreach strategies that have worked and failed for us in the past. We also provided key suggestions to help UCLA iGEM with cell-cell adhesion as well as growth inhibition.
RESULTS
Lab Work
New design for chitinase secretion system: pBAD promoter, upstream phoA secretion signal peptide, FLAG-tag for more effective protein purification and extraction methods

Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends"

We databound the objects that we were dropping into the tree panel so that there was a response in the behavior panel, which was really nice after a frustrating day.
Wednesday:
Today, we worked on the part view and making sure it could display the SBOL picture and part name in the parts dragged to our tree panel instead of the arbitrary parts we'd been using until now. After databinding the part name and image to the part view, we began looking at how to dynamically change the part view depending on what part it is.
Thursday:
Today, we picked up where we left off yesterday to dynamically change the part view by pulling in information from the parts registry. It was more difficult than we thought it would be, but we're still making progress towards having a functional product sometime in the near future. We're able to display the part information from the registry, which is great, but we need to clean it up a bit.
Friday:
Today, we said goodbye to most of our high school interns! They've been helping out the zSpace and Art teams, and it'll be sad to see them go. We are now pushing for having a fully integrated product that is able to construct a basic inverter about a week from now, so it's truly crunch time! I'm now working on a popup that allows the user to edit properties of generic parts to search for devices based on direction, length, and properties.
Week 8: July 22 - July 26
Monday:
Today, we're starting work on our poster and abstract! Everyone in our summer research program is presenting a poster of our research to the Wellesley community, so we're presenting on the progress we've made so far in developing Eugenie and our future plans (AKA iGEM!). I also have made some progress with the popup - when a user edits a field, the part actually updates to reflect what it's repressed by, induced by, etc, which is valuable for users who want to use custom parts in their search.
Tuesday:
The work on the popup continues! Tiffany has been doing a great job with writing the abstract and designing the poster, which leaves me with more time for development. I worked on the styling of the popup - since I made it a scatterviewitem, its default properties are to resize and rotate as the user wants, so to make it more standardized, I took away those properties to have a smoother user experience. I also fixed the color scheme so that it matches the rest of the Eugenie color scheme.

Holin is responsible for forming pores in the inner membrane of bacteria, while lysozyme breaks down the peptidoglycan layer and lyses the cell. Prior to the induction of this death program, anti-holin is constitutively expressed and prevents holin from mediating lysis. Anti-holin is essential for meeting our needs, because preventing lysis should maximize replication of our engineered probiotic during the production phase (e.g., during fermentation of the dairy product) and thereby maximize delivery of phytase cargo to the desired location (the stomach).

Experts: Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM), Lori Goff
Solution: Extensive dialysis of methacrylated dextran removes all toxic components. The use of a                         novel, radiation-based crosslinking method and alternative catalysts could reduce the toxicity of the                         synthesis and polymerization. The gel is biodegradable.
More information
Our hydrogel production requires toxic catalysts and yields a hazardous intermediate product. How do                             we ensure a safe synthesis and polymerization process and prevent the presence of toxic intermediates                             in the final product?  Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are regulations which ensure the safety and                             quality of food and medicine. As part of GMP, it is thus important to protect the chemical safety of Gelcatraz and the safety of its production process. Furthermore, chemical waste should be minimized,                             and the costs should preferably be low. Below, we provide the results from our research into these                             topics. In short, our research revealed that all toxic components are removed by extensive dialysis                             of the methacrylated dextran. Furthermore, a leakage test showed that no leakage occurs from the gels                             over a period of two weeks. The use of a novel, radiation-based crosslinking method and alternative                             catalysts could reduce the toxicity of the synthesis and polymerization reactions. The gel is                             biodegradable.
Toxic chemicals and intermediates
Dextran itself is biocompatible and safe, but its synthesis and polymerization require several toxic                             chemicals. Furthermore, some toxic intermediates are produced.  While handling these chemicals, we                             take all required precautions such as working in the fume hood and wearing protective gloves.                             However, it would be even better to replace them by less toxic equivalents. We researched                             replacement options for two steps: the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and polymerization of                             methacrylated dextran into gels.
Synthesis of methacrylated dextran
For the synthesis of the gel, we use some toxic chemicals, the most important being glycidyl                             methacrylate (GMA) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). GMA is carcinogenic but required to                             functionalize the hydroxyl groups of dextran. We handle it with syringes to avoid exposure.                             Furthermore, we remove all traces of GMA after the synthesis and confirmed this with H-NMR."

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients. The list of ingredients that could be added is now available on the internet. Manufactures are required to hand in their examine result themselves. 
We: If we are now planning to quantify our products in the form of pills, do they have to be examined?
FDA: Sure. Everything should stick to the Standards for Specification, Scope, Application and Limitation of Food Additives.
We: Is there now any regulation related to GMO products?
FDA: For GMO products are generally related to GMO plants, there is still no fine institution for GMO microorganisms. Moreover, we have not yet received any application for this. But, if this really happen, we will ask the applicants to hand in the microorganism’s DNA strands they use. We will test whether any toxic substances or allergens is produced. 
We: So, is it true to say that the limitations keep GMO products from prevailing in Taiwan?
FDA: This is considered a topic of personal view. The governing departments stand on neither side in a controversial topic. But, we’ll be sure that customers have the right to know whether it is a GMO product.
We: So, what kind of data is required?
FDA: First, the effect of the product must be testified. Also, we will ask for the descriptive data about the bacterial strain, how you grow and preserve them, how you rebuilt its DNA, and whether any toxic or allergic reaction is found.
We: Is it an offence if we just make an allegation that our product is of health-giving properties?
FDA: If your product is added to medicines, you may violate the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act. If you claim that your product is of medical effects, you could end up in prison.
We: If we get the permission of commercializing health supplements, will there be an expiration date?
FDA: 5 years. If after 5 years, a new regulation is enacted, and the standard is adjusted, we will examine the product with the new standard again.
We: Is it necessary that we conduct human clinical trial?
FDA: Either in vitro or in vivo trial is acceptable. But, if your product is related to hypertension, than it will be better if you can conduct human clinical trial. Moreover, items should be labeled if it has been done with animal studies. 
We consider the public's voice
Public Survey
 
In order to understand our project affects the world and the world affects our project design, we did a series of surveys with School’s students, teachers and staffs, as well as team members"
NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". The selection of drugs and treatment design needs to consider a number of factors, we should collect more social opinions, trying to make an effective, safe and easy way of treatment for those people in need.
2 Promotion
After completing the investigation and the design of the preliminary scheme, we want to make some changes in the current situation of low recognition of inflammatory bowel disease among the youth groups. So we delivered a presentation about IBD, synthetic biology, iGEM competitions as well as our programs into more people's lives. To the end, we made a three - fold booklet and poster. We not only distribute our reading materials in public places such as communities and libraries near the campus but also put our reading materials on the reading shelves in the hospital halls and beside the school medical room, hoping that more people can learn about IBD and synthetic biology.
Nearly 100 brochures were distributed to introduce the use of synthetic biology to treat IBD. Many people were impressed by our original intentions and behaviors, and expressed their support and admiration for us. Some even expressed their sympathy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
3 High School Lecture
On July 26th, we came to the Northeast Yucai High School in Liaoning Province to give a speech to the third-grade students who are about to enter the university. We detailed the iGEM competition, knowledge about synthetic biology and our projects. Many high school students were interested in biology. They asked questions actively and enthusiastically, and we had conducted more in-depth exchanges. We also taught high school students to do a DNA gel electrophoresis with the plasmids constructed in our project. The basic operation of molecular biology experiment has aroused everyone's strong interest in biological experiments.
4 Visitation of Patients
We went to the inpatient department of Shengjing hospital affiliated to China Medical University to interview a patient with ulcerative colitis(UC) to learn more about IBD.
The 64-year-old patient was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2016. This is the second time she has been hospitalized for severe illness when we came to her. Through the visit, we learned that:
Ⅰ. Ulcerative colitis seriously affected her life. She had chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea, poor energy, and inconvenient use of the toilet. When coming on, defecate is accompanied with hematic frequently, a dietary difficulty made her complement nutrition with fluid food only. She is depressed all day long.
Ⅱ. The illness comes up repeatedly and the treatment cycle is long as well as expensive. Because it's a lifelong illness and you need to take a pill every"
Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," addition, he also called for the emergence of cross-disciplinary talents in medicine and law. Yao made compliments on our attention we had paid to relevant laws and regulations and he answered the questions we were concerned about. He made us realize when we formulated and enforced the laws, we should take the complex commercial benefit and the national overall background into account. We found out the contradiction of innovation and strict control. When China encourages “Mass entrepreneurship and innovation”, the law may not keep pace with the innovation of the new medicines. Therefore, we hope to draw the attention of departments concerned by summarizing these questions and suggestions.  Finally, Yao emphasized, no matter how much benefit were involved, we should always put the right of life in top priority. Behind the laws and regulations, living lives were what our projects were truly facing.

Dr. Li Ye Associate Professor, Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmacy Fudan University
How is a laboratory project transformed into industrialization? Prof. Ye has been dedicated to the research of tumor immunotherapy drugs, owning multiple patents, and has been involved in many enterprise technology development projects. We come to Zhangjiang pharmaceutical valley, which is not only the location of the school of pharmacy, but also the base of biomedical science and technology industry gathering a large number of pharmaceutical companies. Ye introduced the current limitations of CAR-T therapy, and proposed that if our cell therapy could be universal, it would greatly reduce the cost of treatment. She made us realize that safety and targeting are two sides of tumor immunotherapy. Therefore, in the later experiment purpose and implementation, we not only improved the work efficiency of STEP system, but also strengthened the attention to security. In addition, Ye stressed that a new drug cannot be popularized by a single medical or scientific institution and must be industrialized. Therefore, we went to Shanghai Pharmaceutical R&D Collaborative Innovation Center to participate in the Open Day for consultation services on new drug development.
Hui Li Hospital Administrator    Shanghai Anda Hospital
What kind of role do the hospitals and patients play? Li’s experience is quite unique. As an expert in medical disputes for decades, he now works on the management in the biggest private hospital of Shanghai after serving the army as a surgeon. Professionally, he analyzed the application prospects of a new medicine from three aspects for us: clinical doctor, hospital management and patient. In terms of our wondering that whether a clinical trial would cause any medical disputes in China, Li admitted that the lack of effective communication between doctors and patients is what to blame for. Clinical trials should never be permitted without informed consent, concerning its high"

In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, the following 4 goals must be achieved:
1. Demonstrate the relevance of your development for Synthetic Biology based on standard Parts.
The assessment model in “Easy BBK” are based on the information of standard Parts collected from Registry. In the model, we have taken into consideration 13 attributes of the biobricks and have modified the weight of those attributes to rank the standard Parts in a reliable manner.
Additionally, the components in the “design” part of “Easy BBK” are based on the legend available on Registry. Although a little modification have been made on each component, they are easier to be identified by users.
2. Provide a comprehensive and well-designed User Guide. (Be creative! An instructional video may work as well.)

The next step to do is to insert LacI and RcsA construct in front of two terminators (B0015) to complete the construct. To do this I want to clone the previous construct in front of the B0015 part in the pSB1AK3 plasmid. So I digested the LacI + RcsA construct with EcoRI and SpeI. The pSB1AK3:B0015 was digested with EcoRI and XbaI.  DNA digested was 1.5 ug each as a 50uL reaction for 2 hours in a 37C water bath.
After digestion, I ran a gel to extract the desired DNA fragments. For pSB1AK3:B0015, I wanted the 3318bp length and for LacI + RcsA construct I wanted the fragment at 700bp. See below.

Collaborations
Our team had many productive collaborations with universities across the world. We were especially excited by the number of teams who approached us out of interest in the numerous mutation-reducing tools that our team has developed. We were happy to give these teams free access to our optimization techniques, which not only helped our collaborators to improve the stability of their genetic elements, but also helped us expand our techniques to new applications and even new organisms.
University of Paris-Bettencourt:
The team at Paris-Bettencourt approached us out of concern for the stability of their genetically engineered fermenting microbes. Given the importance of strict quality control and long-term stability in the applications that their team was envisioning for their project, they had a keen interest in making their genes more stable. We offered to optimized their fermentation genes using our computational algorithm. As their team did not have sufficient time to synthesize the genes we sent them, we also provided them with statistics on how many mutation-prone sites their original genes had and how much they can be improved for stability.
Washington University at St. Louis:
Early on in our project, we contacted WashU's iGEM team to ask for their assistance in characterizing one of our optimized RFP constructs. Their team graciously offered to measure the fluorescence of two of our RFP constructs. In addition to their standard measurement protocol, their team also had the foresight to ask for our measurement protocol, which they replicated in detail in their lab. From the data they generated, we were able to resolve two issues- first, the cross-compairison between WashU's protocol and our own demonstrated that our initial mesaurement protocol was not fully optimized. With their protocol, which they gave our team in detail, fluoresecnce measurements were much more consistant. In addition to this valuable finding, which has caused our lab to change our measurement protocol,"

Integrative vectors for Bacillus subtilis
All except for one vector that we provided to the registry for B. subtilis are integrative. They all insert into the genome via double homologous recombination at specific sites. Thereby, a target gene in B. subtilis is disrupted, which can be selected for by specific tests. The tests are part of our protocol ""How to use Bacillus subtilis vectors"" .
The following grafic shows how the integration works.

Aliquot: An aliquot is a term to denote a certain quantity of something. In this case an aliquot of antibiotic stock would denote either 1mL or 0.5mL, depending on the antibiotic.
Antibiotic: Compounds which inhibit bacterial growth. They act either bacteriostatically by preventing reproduction of the bacteria, or bacteriocidally where they directly kill the bacteria. Generally bacteriocides work by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan in the bacteria’s cell walls. Tetracycline is an example of a bacteriostatic, where it acts by binding to the ribosomes of prokaryotic bacteria and inhibits translation.
Autoclave: A piece of equipment used for sterilization. The autoclave performs much like a pressure cooker: it subjects the contents inside it to a high temperature and high pressure steam bath. Usually the temperature is 121°C and at 15lbs/in2, 20 minutes is enough to kill most microorganisms and render equipment sterile. When adding antibiotics to media, it is done after autoclaving so that the heat does not destroy the antibiotic activity.
Safety precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding th3e information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.

2015SZU-iGEM Project Questionnaire & Analysis
We are the Shenzhen University iGEM team.In this year, our project is the 《Synthesizing genetic circuit based on Unnatural Amino Acid orthogonal system to cure bladder cancer》, which is about to construct the gene circuit to detect and kill bladder cancer cells accurately without killing the normal cells. We sincerely hope that this survey could help us obtain more data and information to further our research. Here are our conclusions.
The main purpose of synthetic biology is to restructure the existing functional components into simple biological system.Have you ever heard of the concept of synthetic biology?
Do you know any application in terms of the synthetic biology used in medical field?
Analysis
We know from the 4th and 5th questions,people know little about synthetic biology. Therefore,we did many things to improve the situation,such as propaganda synthetic biology iGEM,and carried a lecture at Shenzhen Yueliangwan elementary school, to let more people know about and be interested in synthetic biology
ShenZhen University iGEM team is doing a project about gene therapy which will have a great prospect for the treatment of bladder cancer.How do you think of it?
Analysis
We have 93% of the supporters in 543 people, which is a great inspiration to our project and will be very good to promote the in-depth study of our subject.
￼
Compared with traditional treatment, gene therapy has the advantage to specifically detect and kill cancer cells without any harm to normal cells.If gene therapy develops more effective for the treatment of bladder cancer,will you choose gene therapy in the future?
Analysis
In 543 people,440 people are very supportive of our team project, which gives us a lot of confidence. We believe that what we do is worthy of recognition and meaningful.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html,"oresis, we had bands appearing to indicate success with the 50ng samples of CAR that we had run, as shown below.
</html>
This gel shows 2 bands of CAR that indicate successful mutagenesis of the first PstI site in CAR. The CAR gene is contained in the PET vector. Lane 1 contains the 1 kb plus ladder, while lanes 2,3 contained samples in which 5ng of original CAR+PET plasmid were used, lanes 4,5 contained samples in which 20ng of original plasmid were used, and lanes 6,7 contained 50ng of plasmid sample and underwent mutagenesis by PCR amplification successfully. The bands are slightly over the 9kb band of the ladder, at about 10kb, which is roughly the size of the 10,090bp plasmid.
After combining these two PCR tubes and incubating with DpnI, we performed a transformation with this DNA and allowed the plate to incubate overnight. Also, we continued to try and verify NPT, but were once again unsuccessful. When we viewed the plate that we had transformed the following day, it was found that we did not have any colonies. We presumed this was because the 9kb plasmid was very difficult to uptake with its large size. Several more transformations were attempted. We also attempted a new procedure called site-directed mutagenesis, which would use a single mutagenesis primer per site, rather than one for each strand, and supposedly had the capacity to mutagenize multiple illegal cut sites at once. We would try to mutate 3 sites with this protocol: the 2 PstI sites, and 1 EcorI site. The PCR was run overnight, with 8 different samples, at two different concentrations of DNA (50ng and 80ng), with four different annealing temperatures. The following day, each sample was incubated with DpnI for 6 hours, and then each was tranformed on a kan plate. A restriction digest of the NPT plasmid was once again performed, cutting with both (E/P) and (X/P) as before, this time using more DNA. An overnight culture of a single potentially successful NPT colony was made, to perform a restrictin digest to see if NPT was present - this would be done over the weekend. Finally, a transformation of the single mutagenesis KAPA PCR of PstI was performed, to hopefully yield more colonies.

Human Practice Overview
  The human practice of our team is about two major themes. One is studying how the mobile scientific computation platform would influence the development of synthetic biology; the other one is popularizing the knowledge of synthetic biology.
iPhone and Biology
  At the beginning when we chose the project of human practice, we realized that the promoting of computing ability of the mobile platform, which is mainly on iPhone, will bring something new to the approach of synthetic biology research. So we decided to take the two research direction in human practice. We studied the amount and category distribution of the biology apps on app store, click here to see details.
  
  Popularizing the knowledge of synthetic biology is also a field which we devoted to. We used many approaches to propaganda.
SynBio Intro
  
  After the beginning of the new semester, we did a poster and a lecture toward the freshmen, so that more and more students would get to know synthetic biology. We also recruited volunteers who are interested in biology to participate in the propaganda. Click here to see details.
High School Lectures
  
  We went to some of the most outstanding high schools in Shenzhen. By lecturing and distributing leaflets, the high school students were all impressed by the beauty of synthetic biology. Click here to see details.
