SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," intestinal flora, and using these bacteria to metabolize some metabolite in the human body to cure some diseases. Professor Shen encouraged us, but he also pointed out some problems we need to take care of. Among those problems, microorganism colonization was what mentioned by Professor Shen as the most challengeable one, which usually influences the final cure effect. He suggested us to search more references to choice a suitable strain if we do want to develop a curable intestinal flora. Therefore, to solve the colonization problem, we made many effort, including choosing probiotics E. coli Nissle 1917 as the chassis, designing deficient strain and complementary plasmid to enforce the colonization ability, and we also use animal experiment to test whether the bacteria colonized as we expected.
In conclusion, attending the 2016 Chengdu International Conference of Gastroenterology is beneficial for optimizing our project.
Project Presentation for the 1st Time
On 22nd February 2017, After the rudiment of this project was determined, we invited our 6 instructors, professors from the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, Sichuan University, to give us some advice to our project. The professors are doing researches in different fields and we believe they can offer more diversified suggestions to our project. We made a presentation to introduce the whole design of our project to them. At that time our project contained 4 systems, which were related, progressive and all linked to the same theme, using reconstructive probiotics to cure metabolic diseases. The diseases we aimed to cure were phenylketonuria (PKU) and gout. The four systems were all related to reconstructive intestinal flora, but worked in different places, including gut, dialysis tube human being’s blood and artificial blood vessel.
After we introduced our project, professors asked many questions and had a fierce discussion with us. They mainly queried the safety and effectiveness of our project, especially the fourth part in which we planed to inject the remolded bacteria into a artificial blood vessel near the hepatic portal vein. They thought the immune reaction will do harm to the human body a lot. Their worry let us be more aware of the possible risk which our project contained, and let us thought twice before we made the final decision.
After this reply, we carefully collated and analyzed our instructors’ suggestion. Finally, we deleted the last two parts and started to focus on using reconstructive intestinal flora and dialysis devices to cure hyperuricemia and gout.

SMS_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SMS Shenzhen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"On Jun 14, 2016, about ten of our teammates went to Shenzhen Vanke Meisha Academy, an affiliated high school of Shenzhen Middle School. A biology teacher from the Academy led us to a school tour, and we visited their labs and biology club.
On that day, six students from the club went to their lab and held their club activity, while we discussed with them and gave them a presentation on synthetic biology and iGEM. Specifically we introduced the concept of synthetic biology first, and found that even the club members did not know about this field much. We mentioned some detailed steps of synthetic biology experiments, which raised the students’ interest a lot. Then we presented more about iGEM and our project, and invited them to also take part in this competition next time. Although the club members were not familiar with this field of knowledge, they expressed great curiosity and willingness to iGEM. We emphasized that we would like to offer help, in whether professional knowledge or experimental resources, and the biology club appreciated our hard work and stated that they would definitely learn more on synthetic biology.
Shenzhen teams meet up
To further communicate with other projects, exchange our ideas and improve our methods, we contact several teams in Shenzhen in order to hold a seminar and share opinions. On august 20, 2016, we met up with SZU-China from Shenzhen University, BGI-College from BGI to present our project and develop more. After the presentation, we each receive specific great advice on experiments from other teams on possible safety problem on projects and improvement in experiments. We also examined and discussed into bio-safety problem in biological projects and the world.
iGEM&Maker
The concept of “Maker”, highly promoted and becoming increasingly popular in current society, encourages everyone to make everything everywhere. iGEM, an interdisciplinary project-oriented competition that covers the area of biology, mechanics and computer science, etc, is an exemplary implementation of “Maker” concept. Because of the bacteria’s ability of mass reproductionand the direct operation on genes, bio-hacking has great potential in the future.
However, in Maker Area, at least in Shenzhen, bio-hackers are still the minority. Most maker projects are still on mechanics such as robots and chips, and people including students and adults have barely any idea of bio-hacking. Therefore, we felt a great urgency to promote bio-hacking in Maker’s area and more importantly, among all people, to spread the idea that operating genes is as normal and accessible as using screws.

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,": Meeting with Dr. Gabor Balazsi (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University)
Dr. Balazsi explained steady-state approximations and Michaelis-Menten kinetics to us. Within this context, he showed us various possible parameters that we could apply to our specific system. Specifically, he told us to focus on carbon dioxide intake, light intensity, redirection of carbon flux to natural pathways, the production of intracellular sucrose, and the rate of secretion of this sucrose. He showed us how to set up various generalized differential equations that we could then use in our system given rate constants that we would have to find in literature.
Modeling this system accurately could inform us on optimal light and atmospheric conditions for maximum sucrose production. It could also inform us on the value of knocking out other pathways for carbon flux, such as glycogen anabolism, for the purpose of retaining more carbon for sucrose. 
June 8: Tour of the Research and Development Park Center with Dr. Devinder Mahajan (Department of Chemical and Molecular Engineering, Stony Brook University)
Dr. Devinder Mahajan is a professor and graduate program director for Chemical and Molecular Engineering at Stony Brook University who researches about low carbon energy technology development and implementation. We used this opportunity to grasp the potential our project has after our laboratory studies.  Once we introduced him to iGEM, he offered to meet with us to talk more about our project in the scope of biofuels and energy, as he researches low-carbon energy. We wanted to make sure that our project would aid in the development of biofuels and would be relevant to current advancements in carbon sequestration and renewable energy technology. During the meeting, we learned about the research he was conducting on carbon sequestration and renewable energy technology. He recounted the emission numbers of local Long Island landfills and powerplants and gave us the idea to use landfills as a site of carbon sinking for biofuel production. We toured his laboratory at Research and Development Park in Stony Brook where he showed us his eppendor fermentor machine, a device that is capable of turning the sucrose potentially produced by cyanobacteria into ethanol for biofuel. After the tour, he invited us to visit the facility again and to have bi-weekly meetings and correspondence to address our progress on the project and any questions we may have.

Fig. 8 Sequencing result of construction RPG- BBa_K2326005. Derived from Snapegene.
Fig. 9 Sequencing result of construction RPG- BBa_K2326006. Derived from Snapegene.
Plate Reader
We measured the relative concentration of GFP in recombinant E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326005) suspension. The IPTG inducing concentration was 1.0 mM, and 2% of MSG was added as substrate. The induction process lasted for12 hours. Negative control was tested with endogenous, wild-type E. coli Nissle. The relative concentration of GFP is represented by relative fluorescence intensity in Fig. 10.
The concentration of GFP of recombinant E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326005) was higher than the negative control, indicating that the fusion protein of GAD and GFP was expressed. Thus, GAD could be expressed in E. coli Nissle (RPG-BBa_K2326006).
Amino Acid Analyzer Result After Protein Purification
We purified GAD in E. coli Nissle and did the reaction (see experiments ). Fig. 11 – Fig. 13 show the result of reaction products. Since there were still no peaks in the range of 48 – 50 min, GABA was still not produced.
Fig. 11 Yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326006) with reaction pH 4.2 (protein purification)

Fig. 13 Yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326006) with reaction pH 4.6 (protein purification)
When we analyzed the experiment, we found that we ignored the effect of cofactors. Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor of GAD enzyme, which is derived from vitamin B6 (Purves & Williams). In our reaction system, vitamin B6 was absent, so GAD might have low activity. We developed the next step based on this problem.

In addition to the limonene synthesis, we acquired an odor-free E. coli YYC912 strain from the Coli Genetic Stock Center. This strain differs from the wild type E. coli K12 MG1655 in that it does not produce indole. Our goal was to examine the smell of the odor-free strain compared to the wild type. That way we would determine which strain would be best suited for our Edible coli project. We also wished to clone the limonene constructs into the odor-free strain, to investigate if the lemon smell is more prevalent than in the wild type. Though due to time restraints this was not accomplished.
This comparison should show if there was a difference in the odor of the limonene synthesizing strains and the ones that did not produce limonene, and if the odor was improved. The way we wanted to test this, was  to set up a blind test using overnight cultures of E. coli K12 wild-type, odor-free E. coli and the two limonene  constructs in wild-type E. coli K12 (since transformation of limonene constructs into the odor-free strain did not succeed). The bacteria were supposed to be grown in minimal media, but since we received the sequencing data, saying that the ligations were not successful, we did not carry out the experiment.
We decided to investigate the difference between the odor-free and wild type strain. Because the focus of interest is on the difference in odor, we decided to analyze the two strains with Ion-Mobility Spectrometry (IMS). Since IMS analyzes molecules in the gas phase, this analytical technique is particularly suitable for our investigations. In order to minimize the effect of the media, M9 Minimal media was used to grow the two strains.

The graphs in figure 1 and 2 shows the results from the IMS analysis. Along the horizontal axis is the reciprocal of the reduced mobility (K0-1), along the vertical axis is intensity and along the axis going towards and away from the viewer is the retention time. At first sight it can be seen that the two spectra are somewhat different from each other, which substantiate that the two strains are different. The difference between the odor-free strain and wild type is, as mentioned, that the odor-free strain should not produce ind"

Building Healthy and Self-Sustaining Cities: Big Problems and Small Solutions
In our talk, we hoped to give people a peek into the fascinating world of synthetic biology. In addition, we hoped to inspire people to take actions in working together to building better cities and healthier environments, by following their passions and using science. The story was developed around how we use the smallest living organism to take on some of the toughest challenges we face as a society, overcoming adversity and being creative with our limited resources. The talk raised people’s interests in joining the revolution of democratizing science. It also raised questions on how looking beyond the ordinary and realizing the potentials of insignificant things can potentially change the world.
“What bacteria hold in billions of years of evolution is the key to the revolution of healthy and self-sustaining cities!”
— Jay Wang
The talk was very successful and received overwhelming feedback from the audience! Our topic sparked numerous discussions in both online and offline communities.  There were people walking up to our speaker and saying that they were very inspired and intrigued by the talk; audiences surrounded our speaker with questions and comments right after the talk expressing interests in the ideas. There were high school students who want to be where we are when they are in university and who expressed interest in joining the team. Also, there were national media approaching us for potential interviews. We had supporters from the university at the talk as well - one of our university staff went to the TEDx event primarily to listen to our talk.

The above two experiments show that the modified synNotch can be located on the surface of cell membrane normally and release intracellular domain after receiving external signals. The replacement of intracellular domain with TEV has no effect on the function of synNotch.
Eukaryotic verification of TEV activation transcription system based on modified TetR
As mentioned earlier, inducible promoters using transcription activator factors that cannot inhibit transcription often have some leakage due to background expression.
However, our system hopes to realize the absolute function of 0/1 switch, and the background expression is what we do not expect. Therefore, we need to find a transcription activation system with very low background expression.
Coincidentally, the previous team iGEM 2017 Oxford was making a similar attempt. They have designed TEV activation transcription system based on the modified TetR. Although they have not fully proved that the system can work effectively due to time constraints, we believe that their theoretical basis for designing the system is reasonable. Therefore, we attempt to verify their system with eukaryotic cells.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C"

Problems in the Lab (Again)
1.9.-30.9.2014
We had a lot of problems with one specific ligation. Every time we tried, only one of the inserts seemed to ligate with the backbone and moreover the PCR and restriction digestion results on the gel looked bizarre.
For the longest time we pondered what could be wrong with our protocols or parts but then with the help of a professor we figured out that the problem might be that we had repetitive sequences in both inserts. Apparently E. coli doesn't like having two similar sequences in the same plasmid and it splices the other one out.
Juggling Between Lab and School

Fluorescent Protein Experiments
While the estimation of repressor strength of the lacI IS mutants in the genetic experiment with the pET28a-RMF mutants has yielded some qualitative data suggesting that all mutants repress expression of lac controlled genes even at high IPTG concentrations, we attempted to quantify the repressor strength of different lacI IS mutants. We cloned the constitutive lacI expression cassette, which had been constructed by the iGEM team of ETH Zurich in 2007, (BioBrick BBa_I739002 ) behind one of several lac-controlled fluorescent protein generators (BioBricks I763004 , J04430 , I13601 , J5526 ). The order of the assembly was directed by the intention to minimize readthrough of the RNA polymerase from the constitutive expression cassette into the lac-controlled reporter gene. Placing the lacI generator behind the fluorescent protein generator was assumed to help decreasing the background of leaky reporter protein expression.
The constructs holding GFP and RFP were selected for site-directed mutagenesis, since they are easily detectable with the filter set of our plate reader and – in the case of RFP – even detectable by eye. Site directed mutagenensis was carried out by PCR using forward primers

Experiment: Different concentrations of IPTG were added to a 96-well plate [link to assay] of e-coli Top 10 cells containing LacI-RFP genetic constructs. Here we measured the optical density of the cells over-time, for different concentrations of IPTG to monitor the effects in the culture. The IPTG growth curve results are plotted below:
Figure 1: Effects of [IPTG] on cell growth
We can see that initially, there is an exponential growth phase followed by saturation of growth once glucose has been used up. In this diagram, effects of IPTG on growth rate are not apparent. Instead, a more informative measure is the growth rate during the exponential growth phase. As we know, if the OD curves follow exponential expression in the form of:
y=yoexp^rt where r is the growth rate, t is the time in hours, y is the absorbance/OD over time and yo is the initial absorbance/OD, we can simplify the relationship such that:
logy=log(y_o+ rt) So when we plot log y against t, there is a linear relationship in the exponential growth phase, so we can estimate the growth rate r from there. This is better illustrated in the plots below, showing OD against time for different concentrations of IPTG:
Figure 2: log data with fitted line: Only considered points in the initial exponential phase
Visual assessment of these plots shows that between time=0.5-5 hours, there is a linear phase, so we fit a straight line (red) to estimate the growth rate. After 5 hours, growth saturates and the exponential relationship no longer applies, so the points were discarded. The estimates of the growth rates shown in the table below show if IPTG concentrations affect cellular growth rate in the exponential phase:
Average rate = 0.1767
Standard deviation = 0.0286
Standard error of the mean  = 0.0101
Discussion and conclusion :
We can see that growth rate stays within a narrow range and does not change significantly with concentrations of [IPTG]. Therefore, we can conclude that [IPTG] in the concentration ranges we are using does not affect cellular growth and is non toxic.

Summary
Our software is the first tool that gives synthetic biologists the ability to reduce the risk of mutation for any given gene sequence. Users input any gene which the program then scans for sequence motifs that are prone to mutate at elevated rates. These motifs are removed by synonymous substitutions that are designed not to effect gene function or expression. Parameters can be customized to tailor the optimization to protect against different mutagens, as well as ensuring parts are compatible with assembly standards, and allowing for mutation maximization for directed evolution experiments.
Software Application
Our software is hosted at: cosmicexplorer.github.io/mutation-optimizer
To use our software tools, user simply need to input a gene sequence into the left-hand field and press “Go!”. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences are accepted as inputs. By default, sequences are optimized broadly against all mutation types, eliminating a variety of sites including those for oxidation, irradiation, deamination, alkylation, polymerase errors, and recombination. Any of these optimization parameters can be customized to concentrate on specific mutagens, ensure compatibility for RFC assembly standards, and directed evolution.
In the output window, the changed nucleotides are highlighted to visualize the changes made to the gene. The display also includes two metrics to compare the relative effectiveness of optimization for a particular gene. We combine the mutation types that the user includes as input (or keeps as defaults) into a single mutability score that captures how at-risk the inputted gene is to mutate. Following optimization, the software calculates the score again and returns the percent mutability change, which gives an indication of how many predicted mutation-prone sites were successfully removed by the algorithm.
Program Parameters
We analyzed the literature for reports or nucleotide sequences that appeared to mutate at rates higher than what would be expected by chance (Rogdozin and Pavlov 2003). In particular we concentrated on short (< 5 bp) motifs with multiple studies-worth of validation that could reasonably be targeted by sense substitutions. In all, we selected sequences associated with ultraviolet dimers, insertion sequences, deamination, oxidation, RNA hairpins, microhomologies, polymerase errors, alkylation, and sites non-specific to mutagens"

University_of_Sheffield,2008,Team:University of Sheffield #Project_-_-_TEXT.html," gene a . However, the very high inhibition with CsrA is actually due to 6 binding sites, one of which overlaps with gene a formyl-methionine codon.
Thus, the only possible way of inserting GFP, with minimal disruption of the whole operon, is at the end of gene a sequence just before the termination codon. This would give a high level of control by CsrA, as it is just after the CsrA regulatory binding sites, and would hopefully prevent extensive damage to genes b,c and d expression.
Cholera Autoinducers
Cholera autoinducer (CAI) is a signaling molecule. It is unusual from most pathogen autoinducers as it actually inhibits virulence factor production at high concentration. This is because of the nature of the disease V.Cholerae causes. The inhibition of virulence factors allows the bacteria to be flushed from the host body into the environment.
CAI is used naturally only by V.Cholerae. This makes it very useful in our bacterial sensor, because unlike other autoinducers, such as AI-2, which are used by many bacteria, this allows us to know bacteria species detected.
CAI is a short ketone with a hydroxyl group. The image below is the different CAI molecules (3 isomer pairs)
The Microchip Theory
Our idea originated with the concept of a microchip that would test water for pathogen concentration. Whilst one summer wouldn’t allow us to actually build it, we still had an impression as to what it would look like.
How?
The target was for a cheap, reusable, quick and non-technical piece of equipment. At first, the microchip really was micro, and would require a microscope to look at, but in areas of natural disaster or extreme poverty this wasn’t viable. So we planned and hand-held size chip, with a number of ‘wells’ or ‘chambers’ built into it. Each chamber would contain a different pathogen-sensing E.coli colony. This presented other problems into how to keep the E.coli alive – could they survive if attached physically to the chamber? Or would they have to be frozen, or suspended in media? Frozen seemed the most likely, but not ideal, but proper design could be implemented later. Then the idea was to take a sample of water, possibly contaminated, and place it on the chip. The contaminants would interact with the specially designed E.coli, and those activated by contaminants would produce a distinctive glow visible to the naked eye. The chamber that glows"

This does not include potential revenue from other water management sources for oil and gas, only mandated sources provided from Environment Canada legislation.
In order to achieve this market capture, an early customer must be identified, as discussed earlier in the selling activities section. Six major companies dominate the majority of water quality sensing and monitoring including HydroQual Laboratories, which is responsible for a large percentage of the water toxicology sensing done for oil and gas companies. We are in the process of establishing partnerships with companies such as HydroQual Laboratories to ensure that we can capture this part of the market.
Marketing Activities
Once we have developed a working prototype and begin manufacturing our product, we require a market strategy to implement delivery of our product. The market is composed of a large number of small companies who may have interest in purchasing this product. Therefore, direct distribution will be the easiest means to release our product to the market.
These price points allow for maximum profitability while maintaining a competitive advantage in cost against our competitors. The lower cost of the device also opens our market to not only target large service providers such as Golder Associates, HydroQual Laboratories, and A&L Consulting, but also smaller firms and laboratories who are more greatly impacted by product price point.
We plan to advertise our product through government regulatory bodies as these institutions will dictate the acceptance of our technology in the marketplace. Our initial market strategy involves the adoption of our technology in the oil and gas sector in Alberta. This will be followed by efforts to include the remainder of Canada, targeting other mining operations including precious metals, coal, etc. and further into North America by penetrating markets in the USA.
Our company’s strategy is to be more than a field service company. The current water monitoring field is dominated by hundreds of small service based consulting companies.  This provides easy entry but allows for limited growth in this highly competitive space. In contrast, we see ourselves fitting into oil sand providers present monitoring frameworks giving us a competitive edge over present service company models. This allows for us to penetrate more of the market, reducing potential competitors that we might have faced.
Expansion into other Markets
With a versatile technological platform, we hope to be able to transition easily into other markets. This could be advantageous in terms of expanding our profit potential with second and third generation products, or it could be advantageous should we run into insurmountable hurdles in accessing our first market. Examples of such markets could include:
"
Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolic products are continuously removed at the same rate. This technique is called continuous culture and allows microbial growth to take place under steady-state conditions - growth that occurs at a constant rate and in a constant environment. Unlike a batch culture method where bacterial cells undergo the full bacterial cell cycle, a continuous culture keeps the bacteria growing in the exponential phase of the bacterial cell cycle, thus a continuous supply of bacteria can be produced (Herbert, Elsworth and Telling, 1956). This process would be integrated into our Phosphostore System so that once containers are taken out of the water and their contents are removed, new bacteria can enter seamlessly.
What exactly are these panels? - These containers would have dimensions of 1.5m x 1.5m x 0.2m. This way, they would be relatively easy to operate and still have a lot of our bacteria inside. They would be made out of two metal panels, each 1.5m x 1.5m, connected by a membrane. We could use the peptidosome membrane designed by iGEM TU Dresden 2017 Team . This would allow water to flow through the container, allowing the bacteria to accumulate phosphorus, whilst preventing the bacteria from escaping. The containers would stay inside water for about 4 hours, which corresponds to water’s current length of stay in the aeration zone (Oleszkiewicz, 2015). We would manufacture the containers ourselves and include them into our Phosphostore package sold to WWTPs.
Our Phosphostore panels could be made with the use of iGEM TU Dresden 2017 Team's idea . Our close interactions proved such a design would be theoretically possible.
How would you kill the bacteria and use the remains as fertilizer? - We would first collect all the bacteria and put them through a crossflow filtration system. In crossflow filtration, pressure drives the liquid culture through a microfiltration membrane where particles in the 0.1-10µm range can be separated from the liquid medium. The system can operate at pressures up to 18 bars and temperature up to 200°C (Ho and Sirkar, 1992). Since our product uses E. coli, the system will operate at temperature of 100°C to kill all genetically modified bacteria present. The remaining solids will contain bacterial debris with polyphosphate and these can be used directly as fertilizers.
How do you plan to sell the phosphorus? - We would sell the recovered phosphorus together with the bacteria in which it is trapped as fertilizer to wholesalers for a standard market"

B-A-G Course
The Build-a-Genome course offers a cool environment in which undergraduate students can participate in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research.  In pursuing the synthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc2.0 chromosomes, students gain hands-on experience in synthetic biology research.  The de novo synthesis of genetic information offers the promise of a deeper understanding of chromosome structure, gene function, and gene order.  The ultimate goal of this class is the development of students into skilled, independent researchers with well-developed troubleshooting skills and experience and familiarity with molecular biology and computational approaches to genomics problems.
The Build-a-Genome course consists of lectures, “Molecular Biology Boot Camp”, and eventually, independent research.  The lectures offered in the course reflect the many-faceted underpinnings of synthetic biology, ranging in topics from fundamentals of genetics (such as nucleic acid structure and function, chromosome structure, and genome organization) to bioinformatics, to central concepts of synthetic biology (such as recombinant DNA technology, gene synthesis, synthetic circuitry and of course iGEM!).  After introductory lectures are complete, students go through eight sessions of molecular biology “boot camp” that serve as a period to review lecture topics, master lab techniques, and learn the methods used in this project.  Graduation from the boot camp requires students to submit assignments that verify proficiency in each step of the gene synthesis protocol – such as PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, molecular cloning, sequence analysis, etc.

Once graduated from boot camp, each student is assigned 12-16 building blocks (~10,000 bp) to synthesize.  While they are encouraged to work independently and have open 24/7 access to the laboratory, most choose some form of cooperative work and learning, either with their lab partners (assigned during boot camp) or in small groups.  Regular “lab meetings” are held in which short student presentations engender group troubleshooting discussions that help students become fluent with scientific language and ensure that they understand concepts"

Team composition
Team is composed of 11 undergraduate students of biochemistry, biotechnology, medicine and informatics and computer sciences at the University of Ljubljana, two of which finished their undergraduate study during the summer and one of them enrolled in October 2012 to the PhD study of biomedicine.
Team selection
The 2012 Slovenian iGEM team was selected among more than 40 candidates who replied to the team member recruitment announcement posted at the end of December 2011. An initial meeting of candidates with advisers announced the challenge of this year's project - to find a synthetic biological solution for medical therapy using biological drugs. Out of the candidates that attended the initial meeting, 18 candidates submitted their proposal for the project by the end of February.
Eight wet lab team members were selected based on the interviews with team advisers in March while the three computer modeling team members were selected by advisers from the Faculty of informatics and computer sciences. The team started with experimental work towards the end of April and more intensively at the end of June after the summer exams.
Contribution of student team members:
contributed ideas for the project
performed all cloning (the ‘masters of cloning’ were mainly Boštjan and Fedja, with help of all the other students, Uroš, Miha, Lucija, Anja, Zala, Urban)
performed all cell culture experiments (transfection, growth, fluorescence and luminescence reporter and cytokine assays) (Mainly Uroš, Miha, Lucija, Anja and Urban)

Nanodrop: Finding DNA Concentration
↩ Back to other protocols .
Ensure the program is selected to read “NUCLEIC ACID” where it says “Sample Type” (Top right of screen)
Load 2 µl of your blank onto the raised pedestal. (NOTE: this blank should be the solvent your DNA/RNA is suspended in. For example this could be EB buffer if you have just done a MiniPrep)
Lower the metal lever until it gently rests on the sample pedestal and click ‘BLANK’ to zero the spectrophotometer reading.
Using a tissue blot off the liquid from the pedestal and the contact on the underside of the lever.
Now load 2µl of your nucleic acid sample in the same manner as the blank and close the lever
Click ‘MEASURE’. After a short while it will display a concentration in ng/µl in the bottom right hand corner.
Also displayed is the UV/Vis spectrum. One should expect a clean ‘bell’-like curve that indicated a clean sample. If a rough and wavy spectrum is seen the sample is likely contaminated.
Blot off the sample from the contacts as before and repeat for other samples.
At the end of your use wash the contacts by adding 2µl water to the contacts and closing the lever a few times before blotting off the water to leave the machine dry.

The right: Survival rates of synX and S1 in cadmium ion solution. In order to eliminate the error brought by the different amount of cells picked up from the media, the survival rate equals the value of the number of the colonies developed on growth media after immersed in cadmium solution for a certain amount of time divided by that of the colonies developed on growth media after immersed in cadmium solution for 10 minutes. Mean values are shown in the graph. The error line stands for the standard deviation.
Fig.3-5 Picture of the third survival rate experiment results. Growth media: YPD. Experimental strain: S1; control strain: synX. Cells were plated onto the media after immersed in 5 mM cadmium solution for 10 minutes, 30minutes, 1 hour, and 2hours.
The Fig.3-4 and Fig.3-5 showcase that the survival rate of S1 is higher than that of synX after yeast cells are immersed in cadmium ions solutions of identical concentration for the same amount of time. We painstakingly counted and recorded the number of the colonies on each individual growth media. The quantitative results are that compared with the control strain, the experimental strain S1's ability to tolerate cadmium ions has increased by 23.8% (30 minutes), 231.9% (1 hour), and 192.4% (2 hours). The longer the time of immersion is, the more obvious the difference of survival rates is. The results are consistent with the dilution assay, which is that the mutated strain has a better resistance level of cadmium ions .
As for copper, the seemingly best strain, S5, is chosen as the experimental strain to test its ability to survive high concentration of copper ions compared with synX. Results are shown in the pictures and tables below.

Results - Red Light Sensor Characterization
Objective
Characterize the red light sensor system using Cph8 with its promoter pOmpc. Reminder: in darkness, the EnvZ histidine kinase of Cph8 phosphorylates endogenous OmpR, a transcription factor which activates transcription from the OmpC promoter. Under red light conditions, the activity of the EnvZ histidine kinase domain is inhibited, impeaching transcription from the downstream sequence.
Conception
The following construction was designed:
In order to mimic the real behavior of the red light sensor system in the E. calculus design, Cph8 gene was placed under the control of the pTet promoter, the general inducer system. The transformed strain was supposed to express the modified RFP while in the dark. In red light conditions, expression was supposedly promoted, except when aTc was added in the media.
Result
We obtain the previous construction to characterize the red light sensor system.
Used parts are available here:
- Strong promoter and strong rbs
- Ho1
- PcyA
- TetR
- pOmpC promoter
- rfp
- ptet
- Cph8

As a first step to achieve this system with an incoherent feed forward loop, we constructed a circuit shown in Fig. 2-3-19 to confirm that our new RM/lac hybrid promoter actually works.  We set GFP as an output of the RM/lac hybrid promoter and introduced the circuit into E. coli .

6. Applications
Our project can be applied to studying the plants' response to external plant hormones. By applying the incoherent feed forward loop to our circuit, we can achieve pulse-generation of the output (Basu et al., 2003). Moreover, the pulse wave can be customized with changing the parameters, for example, intensities of promoters or various interactions. Various artificial genetic circuits which can achieve the temporal pattern of the output, such as incoherent feed forward loop, have been reported (Elowitz et al., 2000; Fung et al., 2005). By combining plant hormone synthesis genes to these artificial genetic circuits, we will be able to make E. coli produce plant hormones in various temporal patterns. Analysis of the plants' response to plant hormones given in temporal change leads to elucidate the abilities of plants in signal transduction. Findings in plant science using this strategy will be important for contributing to new approaches in farming. We believe that such basic research can help to solve worldwide food shortages. We hope to meet public expectations by realizing agriculture aids by bacteria, though there may be some difficulties.

Sup35p
[PSI+] is a non-Mendelian trait of Saccharomyces cerevisae that supress nonsense codons.  This phenotype is due to a self-replication conformation (prion state) of a protein encoded by the gene Sup35. This protein, Sup35p, is the yeast eukariotyc release factor 3 (eRF3) and forms the translation termination complex with Sup45p (eRF1). The function of Sup35p is releasing the nascent polypeptide chain from the ribosome through GTP hydrolysis when Sup45p recognize a stop codon (Shorter and Lindquist, 2005).
Sup35p is 685 amino acids long and has three distinct parts (Fig.2). The NH2-terminus (N) is termed the prion-forming domain (PrD) because plays a critical role in Sup35p’s changes in proteic conformation and it is responsible for its prion behaviour. This domain is 114 amino acids long and has a high"

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The newly generated dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
With the new batch of d-AuNPs, the salt concentration variation was performed again. The range of salt concentration is adapted from 0 to 1000 mM NaCl added concentration. From the plate view it can be seen that the d-AuNPs are aggregating at a lower salt concentration than the previous (older) batch on 14/09/2018, 17/09/2019 and 19/09/2018.

Basic Test
——One Connectee Binds Connector
At first, tests should be taken to check whether TAL can bind to plasmid DNA in prokaryotic system. Here we used E.coli. As mentioned in the overview, in order for the protein to bind to the plasmid(the connector), we have designed two kinds of delicate fusion proteins(the connectee). One is anchored to the cell membrane, the other is free in the cytoplasm.

Connectee:
Schematic Introduction
The connectee consists of linkers and various sections, which are shown in the schematic diagrams below.
1. TAL effector: A transcription activator-like protein
TAL effector can bind to a target sequence on DNA. The 2012 Freiburg iGEM team has offered us a whole set of 96 TAL-protein direpeat bioparts, with which we are supposed to build functional TAL proteins. Since each TAL protein is able to identify a 14-nucleotide target sequence, the first and fourteenth nucleotide being Thymine, all the 96 parts can be used to identify more than 16 million different nucleotide sequences, which makes it very convenient for us to choose a sequence for the fusion protein to bind to.
Figure 1.2.1 TAL Golden gate
2. Membrane anchor system: ssDsbA-Lgt
ssDsbA, the signal sequence of DsbA, directs the fusion protein to the periplasm. Lgt is a transmembrane protein.
The membrane anchor system has been identified by iGEM12_SJTU-BioX-Shanghai.
3. Fluorescent protein
CFP is a Cyan Fluorescent Protein which has an excitation peak at 439 nm and an emission peak at 476 nm.
YFP is a Yellow Fluorescent Protein which has an excitation peak at 514 nm and an emission peak at 527 nm.

Adding Flavodoxin to the Equation
J_exp6
At the end of last week, Laura added an additional reaction to the N2 WM1788 model that expends flavodoxin:
We found that the flux ranges changed for over 1,300 reactions. And as for the pyruvate synthase reaction, there was hardly any variation in the flux ranges ( ­9948.95 to 443.698 and ­9948.904 to 443.703 for max biomass and max flavodoxin respectively). We started to look at reactions whose flux ranges varied by more than a factor of 1.0 × 10­1.
- Experiments From Jun 23
Knockout PDH and PFL
J_exp7
After the meeting with iGem, I started researching potential growth implications of knocking out the pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase reactions from the model. Our data supports that knocking out either of these reactions individually has little to no effect on the flux through the corresponding reaction, or on the flux through the pyruvate synthase reaction. Research shows that pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency has been associated with a buildup of lactic acid in the cell. The enzyme has also been identified for its essential role in initiating the series of reactions that make up the TCA cycle. According to a study conducted by Anderson ME, Marshall of RT JFood Safety in 1990, increased concentrations of organic acids have been shown to reduce cellular activity in E. coli, leading to higher levels of population reduction. As for the pyruvate formate lyase reaction, one study examined the effects of knocking out it’s associated enzyme on the yield of butanediol in a strain of E. coli known as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Even though the yield was 92.2% of it’ theoretical value, mutant growth was slightly reduced to the parental strain. Similar studies on other mutants of E. coli suggest that this growth deficiency is due to a redox imbalance rather than a reduced level of acetyl­coA. These findings would eliminate the possibility of knocking out either of these reactions from the model.
After removing this reaction, we had to rer"

Prof. Kalua:
Blantyre Institute for Community Ophthalmology, or as most people know it: BICO, has been around since 2008 and addressing community challenges in eye care. Not in the whole range of eye care, but with trachoma being a bigger focus. Working with the Ministry of Health and Universities to do operational research that is directly [brought] into practice. So we are not just clinical researchers doing the field work, research and publishing it, but also want to change the policy. So most of our work as projects, the Ministry of Health [adopts] them as national projects, but we always build in research in those ones. Most of our research may also not need ethical approval, because we are doing the treatment and everyone accepts that what we are doing is good. But we can also collect samples at the same time.
Kai:
How was it, that you started BICO?
Prof. Kalua:
My career started many years ago, this is now the end of my career. I studied medicine, specialised in Ophthalmology, working as an eye doctor and in the community I saw a lot of challenges where the profession as an eye doctor could not help me, because I needed funding and [organisational support]. So I decided to start BICO, to be able to actually help my profession. So at that time BICO was found on the idea of it being a source of personnel, material and equipment, but I always tried to improve my work in Ophthalmology.

1.3 In conclusion...
Gene therapy [1]
Gene therapy consists in delivering specifically a gene in target cells or tissues with a minimal of toxicity. Swap a defective gene with a healthy gene to restore the lost function in a patient is the principle of this therapy. Gene therapy represents a promising tool for some diseases treatment and principally for cancer: nucleic acids administration can induce or inhibit the production of a specific protein to induce a therapeutic response.
Unlike medicines which act on the activity and function of a protein, therapeutic genes act more upstream, at the dysfunction source.
Administration mode [2]
Genes can be delivered ex vivo or in vivo. Ex vivo cells are removed from patient tissue, and exposed to the gene-medicine. Transgenic cells are selected, and then reintroduced into the patients' organism. Gene can be delivered in vivo as well: DNA is directly injected into a patient, usually in the tissue to treat, to increase transfer efficiency. This simple protocol presents the advantage to do not require surgical intervention.
However, ex vivo administration is still the technique the most used, like attest the current number of clinical trials.

Gene therapy and challenges [1,3]
Gene therapy faces several problematic which reduce its efficacy on humans:
- To identify mutations responsible for the disease,
- To identify healthy genes,
- To deliver the gene-medicine to the target cell.
- To optimize the gene-medicine expression.
Identifying the target gene requires answering to several questions: Which gene is found in the disease signalization pathway? Is this gene expressed at the beginning or in the final phase of the disease expression? Indeed, the target gene inhibition can be not sufficient enough to inhibit the disease expression.
So, for cancer treatment, there are many target genes and strategies: the tumor suppressor p53, the oncogene inhibition with antisens of oligonucleotide, ribozymes and siRNA use.
Indeed, cancer can be the result of DNA damage due to carcinogens or"

Furthermore due to the involvement of the metabolites, especially amino acids, in primary metabolism one can observe direct effects of the interaction (taking place in co-culture) on the behavior of both partners.
TD:  Do you have experiences with amino acid exchange without exporters?
Sh: The cross-feeding system that I used and studied for my PhD did not inherently contain mutations in any of the amino acid exporters. We observed exchange of amino acids via physical structures connecting cells. However we cannot completely rule out the involvement of exporters as a response to amino acid starvation.
TD: In your publication it is mentioned that the exchange took place via nanotubes. Did you modify your cells for this? And if yes, how?
Sh: We used a synthetically engineered cross-feeding system wherein we introduced two mutations in wildtype
E. coli
cells namely an auxotrophy and an over-production. We observed the formation of nanotubes in co-cultures where one partner was auxotrophic for an amino acid. We did not introduce any specific mutation that enabled the formation of nanotubes.
TD: We are working with a lysine auxotrophic system. Can you explain why lysine, histidine and tryptophan are good candidates to work with ? Why are they so often in focus of studies?
Sh: Lysine, histidine and tryptophan are usually selected for their isolated biosynthetic pathways which allows for easy manipulation without affecting the production of other amino acids.
TD: What were the challenges you faced and what do you think could be challenges with our approach?
Sh: The first challenge of your project is to introduce the auxotrophies and amino acid production/secretion mutations in the different partners. The second would be to ensure that the produced amino acids are sufficient to support growth (Keep in that due to the fact that the partners belong to different classes their amino acid requirement levels will likely be different). The third challenge is to successfully cultivate the 3 organisms such that each partner remains stable over a time period long enough for you to study the interaction. Here you need to take into consideration differences in growth rates, nutritional requirements, ambient pH and so forth for the 3 organisms.
TD: What methods did you use to quantify your amino acid production?
Sh: I used both an indirect biosensor based approach and a chemical analysis technique (LC-MS) for quantifying amino acid production.
TD: What method would you suggest if we want  to extract amino acids from the cells?

7/8: Results of MacConkey agar growth and transformation of  MG1655(Δcya)with pUT18-OBP2A
Aim of Experiment: To perform a transformation of MG1655(Δcya)with pUT18-OBP2A. Also the results of plating of our bacterial two hybrid interaction onto MacConkey agar has produced promising results as the colonies appear to be taking up a small amount of red dye - an indicator of protein interaction. This suggests that the two separated parts of OBP2A may in fact be interacting in vivo. This interaction will need to be quantified through the use of the β-galactosidase assay.
Protocols Used: Transformation
Results: N/A
Next Steps: If the transformation of MG1655(Δcya) with pUT18-OBP2A is successful then the next step of experimentation will be re-transform positive colonies with pT25-OBP2A.

Introduction
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) offers efficient and convenient means of visualising the dynamic process of gene expression and of obtaining readout of the current state of complex gene regulatory networks – features of major interest for synthetic biology.  GFP and other fluorescent proteins are hence commonly used as reporter genes in synthetic biology. Since the initial description of GFP and its potential use for molecular biology [2], many different mutant variants of this wild type have been published, conferring altered spectral properties and/or improved fluorescence intensity [5] or folding properties [4, 5] with respect to the basic protein. Improved folding and enhanced intensity of fluorescent proteins open up many new potential applications including the secretion of proteins from Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, the use and efficient folding of GFP in in-vitro gene expression systems as well the potential to target markers to extracellular spaces in eukaryotic organisms such as the cell wall space in plants. In addition, more intensely fluorescing GFP variants allow the reduction in copy number of synthetic circuits carried on plasmids in bacterial hosts, thus potentially improving the stability of those systems while the reporter (GFP) is still detectable.
Despite those potential applications of improved variants of GFP in synthetic biology the only GFP variant currently listed and characterised in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts is the somewhat outdated GFP mut3b [3] .
Contributing folding improved and intensity enhanced versions of GFP – in standard BioBrick format - to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts would thus be expected to have a range of positive effects on the efficiency with which fluorescent proteins are used in synthetic biology and on the range of applications they are employed for.
Hence the objectives of this project were to standardise into BioBrick format, and to characterise two of the recently reported improved GFP variants in comparison to the currently used mut3GFP and to contribute those new variants to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The GFP variants chosen were superfolder GFP, developed and described by Pédelacq et al (2006) [5], which was engineered for"

Panel Debate at the World Schools Debating Championships
On the 21st of August, 2011, the St Andrews iGEM team collaborated with the Dundee iGEM Team and John Urch of Revealing Research Dundee to organise a synthetic biology panel debate at the World Schools Debating Championships in Dundee. The World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC) is a celebrated debating competition between high school students of various cultures and academic backgrounds, which has been taking place annually since 1988. Previous participants of the competition have included Tony Blair.
The concept of running this debate was to form a platform for discussion between future scientists and future world leaders.  The students at WSDC are some of the brightest and best from their countries all around the world, so we viewed this as a perfect opportunity to inform them about this up-and-coming area of biology and discuss its implications.  This would not only benefit us by receiving an international perspective from young leaders of the future, but would also give them an educated opinion about synthetic biology upon which they could base decisions and future reading in their careers.
Our preliminary idea was to conduct a panel debate which would inform students about synthetic biology and would inspire a healthy discussion concerning the various ethical issues and opinions associated with the subject.  St Andrews and Dundee had a few meetings prior to the event where the programme of the presentation and the division of responsibilities were discussed. It was decided that the Dundee iGEM team would talk about the positive aspects of synthetic biology, while the St Andrews iGEM team would discuss the negative aspects of synthetic biology. After the presentation, both iGEM teams and their advisors would form a panel to address questions raised by audience members, in order to encourage independent thought and internal discussion amongst the audience.
Our Arguments
The Dundee iGEM team began the discussion by introducing the concept of synthetic biology and discussing their iGEM project. They explained the basic principles of iGEM, the concept of a biobrick, and how it affects the activities of the overall cell.  They began their discussion of the benefits of synthetic biology by introducing the role particular biobrick sequences could play in the"

Sound Pressure Distribution

Introduction
Sonic and ultrasonic waves could generate a pressure field to the cells adhering to the bottom of the cell dish. In our study of the sensitivity of mechanosensitive (MS) channel, we really found a most efficient sound frequency using 108KHz ultrasonic transducer and around 80V driving voltage. However, to quantitatively define the relationship of channel opening (considering the influence of energy or force difference), it was important to know the pressure field distribution on the cell layer with a certain device configuration. Mathematical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA) were used to define the modeling.
Firstly, a function was studied to give pressure on the surface of the ultrasonic transducer-water interface knowing the input voltage. Based on the interface pressure and physical properties of device, we constructed FEA models to simulate the ultrasonic radiant pressure field of the cell layer. Pressure field was studied in conditions of diverse power and distance between transducer interface and cell layer.
Fig. 1 Cell fluorescence response for 108KHz stimulation. The stimulation began at 10s and lasts for 20s. The fluorescence intensity increased to more than 5 times stronger than background.
108KHz Ultrasonic Pressure Modeling
In this part, ultrasonic radiant pressure field for 108KHz transducer is modeled. In experiment, the 108KHz ultrasonic transducer was drenched into cell dish 1mm above cell layer for ultrasonic stimulation. The following is the equivalent circuit of an ultrasonic transducer. [1]
Fig. 2 A The equivalent circuit of ultrasonic transducer, for low power condition (<500W), R0 is very large and C0 very small. The ultrasoinc radiation power is consumed by sonic radiation impedance. Dielectric and mechanical power is consumed by vibration impedance.
Fig. 2 B To measure the total power of transducer, U0 and Urm in fig. B were measured using oscilloscope. Rm=100Ω.
To calculate the power of transducer, we measured voltages using oscilloscope.

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
EMSA on both the Tn5 and dxCas9 portion of the fusion showed that these portion individually were able to load adapter or sgRNA and EPO. Following this, integration assay was performed to test the integration of adapter DNA by fusion protein.
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

What is BioHub 3.0 Motivation In the future
Project
What is BioHub 3.0?
BioHub 3.0 is a synthetic biology community, integrated Intelligent Search Engine and the online report editor. It brings you a new way to edit your reports and search whatever you need only in one step.
The Editor
 
We established a standardized description of experimental steps. The editor can help you complete high-quality lab reports quickly just by choosing steps and filling in the blanks. Custom steps and protocols are also supported. And in our report editor, biologists could use a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation and writing articles, which improve the efficiency of completing the experiment report.
Intelligent Search Engine
 
We developed our search engine on the base of 2017's project. Our engine has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like ""reports today"", ""reports by ana"", ""reports this year"" and edc.. Meanwhile, we listened to the opinions of the judges. This year we added advanced search and we can now sort the results by time, labels, etc.. It is easier for synthetic biologists to find what they need without many input's instructions. Additionally, we have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could search information more quickly.
The community
 
In this community, bio workers can record their experimental process and release those reports. Meanwhile, they could also read and comment on other scholar's reports. In this way, we make the academic discussion more convinent.  We provide both site search and off-site search to provide better user experience.
Motivation
After consulting with several synthetic biology workers, we found that they would inevitably suffer from the need to spend a lot of time to complete the experimental report during the experiment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a editor that provides a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation, writing articles by dragging steps or protocols to improve the efficiency. So it can replace the original Pages or Microsoft Office for its convenience.
As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned"

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer."

Interviews with Experts and Companies
Interviewing Laura Jakobsen
Do you see our product usable for patients with burns?
“With a bit of change, the product could become useful.”
What kind of wishes have you had earlier for a useful product to burn patients?
“A better handling of the liquid production of the wound, that is often a major problem in the first week after the accident (includes first and second degree burns).”
According to you, is it a type of product that should be focused more on, even though the number of burn patients is decreasing?
“Yes, there is always a need to develop a better, cheaper and more patient friendly bandage.”
Could you imagine our product being used for a different condition or type of wound?
“It could be used as a bandage after surgery in the inguinal region. It is often a quite problematic healing region due to the serum that can create pressure and tighten the region. Serum tapping is a passage for infection every time tapping is made. It is a region of contamination due to tight bandage, patients can not avoid to create pressure on the wound (when they sit), often very moist region (due to sweat) and many more challenges are encountered with diabetics, smoking and overweight patients.”
Should there be added anything to our product so it could be more effective or making the burn treatment easier?
“ A better fluid handling.”
Have you ever encountered resistant bacteria in your working department of the hospital? What measurements have been taken into account to treat these patients?
“Yes, and many different kinds of them. Isolation, protection, hand hygiene and antibiotic treatment after current guidelines for every kind of bacteria, are being followed.”
Can you see a potential in covering the silk in lidocain* to reduce the amount of pain burn patients have to go through? Are there any cons in giving this (today patients who come in to get their bandage removed and gets fibrin** scratched off are not receiving any kind of pain killer)? Can anything be done to get the bandage easier off when it has to be changed after the first couple of days (this type of wound is typically very wet the first couple of days after the injury)?
“Typically, the caregivers recommend the patient to take pain killers (paracetamol and ibumetin, and sometimes morphine preparates) approximately an hour before changing the bandage to reduce any kind of discomfort if the bandage should grab or got stucked in some skin. It could be a possibility to cover the silk with, for example, I"

Resulting fiber was incredibly brittle
Dried fiber collected on the godet
We were unable to take it off the godet without breaking it
However, it glowed.
Fragments of the Tamura fiber are in the dish on the right. On the left is a tangle of natural silk, barely visible. Image was taken in a blue light box with a UV filter
Some observations about the spinning process:
It was extremely difficult for several reasons
the silk emerges from the PEEK tubing tip too quickly
emerging silk fiber is too difficult to see in the bath
very hard to grab and guide the silk to the godet
Silk breaks frequently from the godet. This is probably because we don't know exactly what godet speed to use
Silk slips off the bottom of the godet often
Current setup requires us to hover over the solvent bath as we guide the fiber"

SILVER medals for the team
Only team member who can draw is away for the drawing part
Got signatures from over 40 teams from 6 continents!
A robot, a lobster and an FBI agent walk into a conference...
So proud to be part of an amazing experience
Thank you.
It was all leading to this. The finale, the giant jamboree. 3000 students from all over the world all under one roof with medals on their mind and a passion for Synthetic Biology. To be the first, not only from our university, but from Wales itself to compete laid a heavy burden on our shoulders - for all intent and purposes we were not just students, not just scientists, but ambassadors.  We arrived early the night before - this was the first time we had been together as a team for nearly 3 months. Unfortunately Laura was unable to make the conference which left a hole in the team, but nevertheless we moved on, preparing notes and printing our poster out for the big day.
Our first day was stupendous, beginning with a huge conference hall presentation opening the jamboree - its loud high energy being infectious. Everyone got caught up in the excitement, with Chris and David catching up with all the teams from EE16 Paris, whilst others were scattered around the poster hall, exchanging project notes with teams from every continent in the world, as well as our closer neighbours such as Oxford and Warwick, whom we had collaborated with previously. There were quite a few colourful characters.
However, with our presentation looming over the horizon (after lunch), we hunkered down and got the last minute details down. The tension was high, with even the PIs getting twitchy. To a hall of judges, friends, and fellow teams we presented our diagnostic tool, highlighting our outreach efforts, our international reach, and the strong collaboration effort, even managing to answer the judges questions as a team. We were pleased how it turned out, and it showed in our final marks. With the pressure off, all our responsibilities were about the poster presentation, but this was a more languid affair. While a few stayed behind, the team was free to mingle the 300 odd other projects around us.
From then on, the week passed in a blur of conversations, the halls filled with the sound of collaboration. Forging international links with like - minded students, listening to projects of public and scientific interest, even our PI got stuck in, giving a running commentary on our Twitter with his favourite projects (especially whenever we"

Figure 7. PCR making use of custom primers to extract Beta-lactamase from the psB1A3 vector. Expected band sizes were seen for all of the extractions at approximately 950-bp. Some unexpected amplification is seen for this PCR. No contamination is observed in the NTCs (no template controls). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour
A construction that was attempted this week consisted of placing the beta-lactmase gene with a His-tag behind the promoter BBa_J04500 . Also attempted were plasmid switches of the three beta-lactamase genes extracted via PCR. Colonies were seen for all of the transformed ligation mixtures for these constructions. Colony PCR of these transformed colonies only produced potentially viable results J04500 + Beta-lactamase (with His-tag) construct.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
The primers for golden gate assembly arrived this week and we conducted the PCRs required for our first attempt at making our constructs. The final ligation product was run on a gel and appears promising, showing a 1500bp band, most likely representing our construct. Despite this, transformations have failed and therefore we have to look back at our primers and experimental design.
We now have a more set idea of how we’re going to synthesize magnetoferritin. We will most likely be using a flask with a rubber stopper that will allow inflow and outflow of the nitrogen gas, which will be bubbled into the solution with an air stone. Nitrogen is free to exit a small port in the stopper and reagents can easily be added via injection through the rubber stopper. Safe handling of the thioglycollic acid is paramount, therefore equipment has been ordered (elbow-length gloves, respirator, apron, and something else), and attempts at synthesis will be conducted as soon as we get the equipment.
The beta-lactamase construction attempted last week proved to be unsuccessful however another construction from this week did produce a gene that appeared to be the J04500 + Beta-lactamase with a His-tag part. This construction was sent in for sequencing over the weekend.

Using 1,3-DCP as substrate, HheC specific activity was 6.72(U/mg) and the fusion protein specific activity is 5.28(U/mg). It indicates that the 2A peptide is an excellent linker to compose the two enzymes function together.
FIG.6 lane7 and lane8 are blank control; lane1 and lane3 are DhaA and HheC. In the lane5 and lane6, HheC and DhaA bands can’t be found, a part of DhaA+P2A+HheC are solved, P2A peptide sequence can’t cleave DhaA and HheC. In the sediment, there are also inclusion protein.
FIG.7 the reaction in buffer(50MmTris-SO3,PH=8.0), after breaking the cell. Blank control was the cell transformed empty vector. incubating at 30℃. Colorimetric method is a way of detecting the concentration of Cl-(refer to protocol). The solved chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC could degrade 1,3-DCP and TCP. The inclusion protein doesn’t have any activity.
Polycistronic co-expression system constructed
In polycistronic co-expression system, the quantity of HheC was less than DhaA and LinB is less than LinA(FIG.9). Because the gene is further from promoter, the expression is less. That is why we want to utilize 2A peptide in prokaryotic system.
FIG.9 (a) In the lane5 and lane6, LinA and LinB are expressed, according to the bands, the quantity of LinB is less than LinA. (b) In the lane1 and lane2, there are both bands of DhaA  and  HheC, the quantity of DhaA is more than HheC.

How does this part work?
Our SaCas9 can be programmed to cleave specific target sequence followed by the PAM sequence (5’-NNGRRT-3’).
To express SaCas9, it requires suitable machinery such as promoter, RBS,and terminator.
To programme SaCas9, you need to design guide RNA (tracrRNA [2], 21 bp spacer flanked by direct repeats [2] ).
Advantages of SaCas9 compared with the conventional Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9:
Smaller size (1053 amino acids against 1368) resulting in an easier expression/delivery
Different PAM sequence recognised (5’-NNGRRT-3’ ) increasing the usability
Higher efficiency of SaCas9 over SpCas9 [2]

We performed PCR again to the 3α-HSD gBlock with the original sequence (RFC10 compatible) and cut the 3α-HSD with with SpeI and XbaI restriction enzymes.        We then repeated the ligation reaction of the 3α-HSD and the pSB1C3 plasmid and transformed the ligation product to E. coli Top10.
After colony PCR of 3α-HSD on the pSB1C3 plasmid with 13 colonies, we received 10 positive colonies!!  We sent them for sequencing, but received negative results.

Cofactor
The sequencing results from last week came out negative, so we re-inserted the zwf gene into the plasmid, performed transformation, colony PCR, and sent for sequencing.  The results came out positive!  We prepared a glycerol stock from the positive colonies.  We also performed a mini-prep and transformation into E. coli MG1655 with and without the gene knockouts.  We prepared glycerol stocks from these strains as well.

Comb
We printed the new version of the comb which was planned last week.
We planned a focus group survey which will enable us to receive feedback about the structure and feel of the comb.

Secretion
We transformed  pDR111+signal peptide+3α-HSD and an empty pDR111 intoB.subtilis PY79.
We performed an mCherry expression experiment on the following strains: B.subtilis with an empty pDR111 plasmid, B.subtilis with mCherry, E.coli with empty pDR111, E.coli with mCherry. The B. subtilis strains didn’t grow so we didn’t proceed with the experiment.
We repeated the mentioned experiment, but we diluted the starters with a ratio of 1:100, rather than 1:20. The experiment was successful but we ran out of sample volume before reaching a plateau.

Due to last week's negative results, we decided to plan a new restriction strategy for BBa_K1321338 with 3α-HSD.  We performed a restriction reaction      of BBa_K1321338 with Spe"
iHKU,2008,Team:iHKU#home_-_-_TEXT.html,"ella to move around. To  generate a recognizable and stable pattern, bacterial motility must be  controlled and coordinated. This can be accomplished by designing genetic  circuits coupling bacterial quorum sensing system and genes controlling  mobility. There are several key genes responsible for the movement of flagella,  two of them are cheY and cheZ. CheY protein has two forms: its  phosphorylated form makes flagella rotate clockwise and the cell will tumble;  its dephosphorylated form makes flagella rotate counterclockwise and the cell  will be driven straight in one direction (run). The CheZ protein is involved in  dephosphorylation of protein CheY. It is known in the literature that cells are immobile in the absence of CheZ.
By rewiring the genetic circuitry  that controls cell motility, we aim to generate unique patterns ( Design ). First, we applied the method of  Recombineering to delete the cheZ gene in chromosome of wild type E.  coli strain, MG1655 ( Protocols ).  Then, a series of biobricks and strains were successfully constructed ( Plasmids and strains ), to (i) import the quorum sensing system of Vibrio fischeri and (2) control the  expression of cheZ by quorum sensing, either positively or negatively. As expected,  interesting patterns were observed ( Results ),  such as Mt.Fuji-like and ring of void patterns, when cells are seeded on low density agar plates. Since the ring-like patterns are so counterintuitive -- they formed despite cell growth and diffusion, our remaining work mainly focused on the characterization  and modeling of these patterns.
Considering E.  coli movement as a random walk, a coarse-grained model was used to describe the basic cell motility in response to AHL (the quorum sensor) synthesized by the cells. Our model is  based on time dependent partial differential equations including the effect of  cell random walk, cell growth, AHL diffusion, AHL synthesis and degradation,  and nutrient diffusion and consumption. ( Modeling ). Analysis of the model suggests a basic mechanism underlying the formation of the intriguing trough-like patterns: regions of low cell density are formed by cells being sucked to  neighboring high density regions as the engineered cells move randomly at low density and become immobile  at high density. Our simulation indicated some factors might significantly affect the  development of ring-like patterns, such as the growth rate of the cell which  was also observed in the experiments. By measuring these factors, we provide  not only solid data to support our hypothesis for our model,"
Judd_UK,2017,Team:Judd UK#Pages#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," I have mainly been involved in researching our various ideas and have taken charge of the lab work. It has been especially great having the opportunity to be doing university level experiments in school. It has made me certain that I want my future to lie in science and I aim to study Natural Sciences at university next year and am pursuing A levels in Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Further Maths and Design & Technology.

Synthetic biology is something that I knew next to nothing about before iGEM. It’s a topic that has not been covered in my time as an A Level Biology student, so when given the opportunity to explore it in depth, I couldn’t refuse. Synthetic biology, in my opinion, could be on verge of causing a period of our history comparable to that of the industrial revolution. The possibilities are endless. Being part of the iGEM competition in such an innovative field of science was an opportunity that I couldn’t let slip by. Through studying chemistry, geography and biology I hope to achieve a degree in biological sciences-Biology has been fascinating to me from an early age and turning that interest into a potential career makes perfect sense to me.

Synthetic biology is the future of engineering and holds the potential to solve many of the world problems we face today. As an aspiring engineer, currently studying maths, further maths, physics and biology, I saw iGEM as a great way to become more involved in this new exciting technology and develop key skills such as working in a group, research and lab-work - all essential skills for engineering. My responsibilities in the team have included research and fundraising.

I wanted to join the team after hearing about synthetic biology in a podcast about bio-luminescent lights. Being a part of iGEM has given me the opportunity to develop valuable lab skills, an opportunity that is not available in most schools. I want to study Medicine at university and am currently doing A-levels in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Maths. Outside of school I enjoy tinkering with technology, the skills I have developed have been useful in leading the development of the wiki. I also enjoy reading, basketball, running and volunteering.
