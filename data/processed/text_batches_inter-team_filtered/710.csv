Model your project – Convince the judges your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modelling.
For our project, we built three types of models. The first was an agent-based model which simulated our multicellular biosensor framework. This model gave insight into the optimal ratio of cell-types to have in the system. This information was used during experimental characterisation to optimise our system. Our second model was a statistical, multifactorial Design of Experiments (DoE) approach towards optimising Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) systems. This statistical model was used to generate an experimental design to gather data on the importance of certain supplements in CFPS systems, and then use the experimental data to optimise CFPS systems. Find out more about our models here .

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Coacervation_-_-_TEXT.html," decreasing polymer length. The spinodal curve shifts into the direction of positive σ when the polymers in coacervates are chopped up into smaller pieces. Here plots of $\sigma(\phi)$ are shown for polymer lengths $400$ (A) and $100$ (B). Where a solution at point P would be in the coacervate region for polymers of length $400$, it would not in the case those polymers would be chopped up into a length of $100$.
So there we have the coacervation method qualitatively explained. It can easily be shown that this explanation is general for any values $N$, and that we did not conveniently choose $N=400$ and $N=100$ to meet our statement. We saw in Figure 2 that the coacervate region in the $\sigma(\phi)$ plot “moved upwards” as we chopped up the polymers. First we rephrase the statement that $\sigma(\phi)$ “moved upwards” with decreasing $N$ as: for a fixed $\phi$, the point $\sigma(\phi)$ will be higher if $N$ is lower. This is equivalent to saying that for arbitrary $N>0$, $$\left(\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial N}\right)_\phi <0 $$ The subscript ""$\phi$"" means that $\phi$ is held constant. This reduces our proof to the exercise of proving that the derivative of $\sigma$ with respect to $N$ is always negative. After some basic calculus, we find $$\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial N}=- \frac{2}{3}\cdot \left(\frac{4\sqrt{\phi}}{3\alpha\phi}\right)^{2/3}\cdot N^{-2}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{N}+\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\right)^{-1/3}<0$$ Although the expression in the middle of the above inequality looks complicated, the important result is that it is the product of positive terms with a minus sign in front, and thus we conclude that any point on the curve $\sigma(\phi)$ “moves up” (that is, in the positive $\sigma$-direction) with decreasing $N$ as it did in Figure 2.
The theory presented so far has another important implication. Opposite to what you might expect, coacervates form only within a range of polymer concentrations. More polymers does, after some point, decrease the amount of coacervates. This may sound very counterintuitive, but as"

Introduction
We aim to reconstruct and model the simplest communication in nature, like a flow of information between eukaryotes and prokaryotes through odorant. To accomplish this mission that S.cerecisiae communicate with E.coli, we require to fabricate a kind of dedicated biomimetic nose for our yeast and single out a special and adapted volatile to serve as their “language”.
After a long discussion, argument and selection, finally we decided to select a complex and 7-transmembrane receptors, GPCR, Odr-10, as nose and specific odorant, diacetyl, as the language. In order to construct the system precisely and efficiently, we constructed the Odr-10 expression system and modified the downstream pathway, deleting Gpa1 and Far1 gene then reconstructing and expressing chimeric Gpa1.

Pathway Overview
S.cerevisiae is selected as the protagonist of our system owing to the clear genetic background and its natural advantages to express G protein family. The endogenous receptors, Step2, a G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), will be activated when they sense a/αpheromone, as description of figure 1.
In yeast, the pheromones are bonds to a GPCR, Sted2, and active downstream pathway. It is composed of Gpa1p (Gα), Ste4p (Gβ) and Ste18p (Gγ) subunits. The GPCR induces the complex of Gα and Gβγ, resulting in the separation of Gα and Gβγ. The Gβγ particle subsequently transmits the signal to a MAP kinase pathway, comprising Ste11p, Ste7p, and Fus3p held in a complex with the Ste5 protein. Fus3p then activates the cyclin-dependent kinase"
UESTC-Software,2018,Team:UESTC-Software#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the start of our project, we need to know clearly what problems we are facing and what our users’ needs are. Only in this way will we make sure that our project is adaptable and user-friendly. We designed an online questionnaire ‘Investigation of situation about the use of iGEM parts’ and spread it to over 16 districts and nearly 100 iGEMers and synthetic biologists.
Of course, questionnaire cannot live without analysis. We spent some time analyzing the results and used the method of binary-crossover analysis. Surprised results were found and it inspired us for the next step.
Our analysis results
We used binary-crossover analysis to the question ‘How do you feel about searching information in iGEM Registry? ’ and ‘What difficulties or problems you would encounter when constructing a gene circuit? ’. The former is the independent variable X and the latter is the dependent variable Y. Through this method, we were surprised to get a message that was easily ignored before. From the initial statistical results, the ratio of option A ‘I don't know which part to use’ is the smallest. However, after analysis, we could see that most dissatisfied people chose ’I don’t know which part to use’. In other words, in our project we should focuses more on this issue. According to this, we are more determined to added more accurate information to the database as much as possible.

A visit with iGEM team
We went to UESTC-China and communicated with them about their opinions. First, we asked the problems they may want to avoid and what they think is a user-friendly database. Their opinions are important for us to design the database.
“If we can search for biobricks by keywords and functions will be more than goodness. Also, if a database can provide information such as judging form would be better.” — Leader of UESTC-China Changyu Li

2) Noro-catcher binds to NoVs multiplying within the small intestine.
3) Binding Noro-catcher to indigestible cellulose for swift removal of the NoV-bound Noro-catcher.
2-3 Surface Display
For this Noro-catcher to function, it is essential to express a functional antibody and CBD on the bacterial cell surface. We thus undertook the method commonly called surface display (Fig5).
Fig5 Structural model of surface display.
Fusing passenger protein to anchoring protein anchored in lipid bilayer (the outer membrane of E. coli) with a linker peptide. Passenger will physically be anchored to the cell surface of E. coli.
Surface display is a method to fix passenger proteins to the cell surface using anchoring domain. We selected INPNC and BclA proteins as the anchor to fix passenger proteins. INPNC is a domain of a surface expressing protein derived from Pseudomonas Syringae [6]. BclA is a hair-like protein derived from Bacillus anthracis(34F2) that covers the B. anthracis' spores. Despite its surprisingly compact size of 21 amino acid long chain, BclA is known to display passenger proteins on bacterial outer membrane [10]. When INPNC and BclA's original proteins are surface expressed, their N-terminal domains (NTD) faces the inner cell, C-terminal domains (CTD) faces outwards, and internal repeating domains fill the gap between NTD and CTD.
Although most anchoring domains are limited in its ability to carry large passenger proteins, INPNC and BclA are unique in that they can carry up to 120 kDa [10]. As the groundwork for our Noro-catcher, we considered the highly versatile INPNC and BclA as suitable anchors.
2-4 Anti-NoV Antibody and NoVLP
We used single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of anti-NoV antibody. scFv is a fusion protein consisting of VH and VL, a variable region of the antibody. VH and VL is fused by a linker peptide. (shown in Fig6).
Fig6 Structure of scFv.
To test scFv's functionality, we decided to use NoV-like particles (NoVLP) instead of NoV particles, which are highly infectious                     (<20 copies to be infected) and too dangerous to be used in our lab. NoVLP consists only of capsid proteins of NoV, and does not include the viral RNA"

Exchange Meeting with LZU-China
On July 16, 2015, we had exchange meeting with iGEM Team from Lanzhou University, LZU-China, at Hokkaido University. We each had a presentation on what project we were going to work on through the summer.
After that, we held a ""nomikai"", Japanese casual style party.
Synthetic Biology Regulation and Rights by Tec-Monterrey
Introduction
The effect of GMO to the enviroment has been raising a concern, since they disturb the biodiversity of our nature. To solve this, Cartagena protocol was adopted in 2000, Montreal.  Cartagena protocol was adopted for that, ”In accordance with the precautionary approach contained in  Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the objective of this Protocol is to  contribute to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use  of living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology that may have adverse effects on the  conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health,  and specifically focusing on transboundary movements.” and Japan aceceded into it in 2003.
This regulation about gene recombination is very important for us iGEMers,  since we handle GMO in our daily experiments. Also, the yield of GMO crops has been increasing  and the GMO crops are becoming more familiar to us. Therefore, futher understanding and discussion of the protocol is needed.
So we, Hokkaido University team, participated in online forum held by Tec_Guadalajara in Mexico.
Purpose of this forum
This online forum was held by Tec_Guadalajara in Mexico and for shaping policy for our discipline of biotechnology/synthetic biology. This online forum imitates the real discussion from parties and observers to the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD, part of United Nations). Next conference and meeting of the Parties of the Cartagena Protocol will be taken place in Mexico, so they held this online forum like their government. Hokkaido University team"

The second team is expected to present an 'extension' consisting of new constructive arguments. The debaters address the Speaker of the House and entertain questions, called Points of Information, from debaters arguing the opposite side of the issue. Debaters can stand up to ask a question at any time except the first and last minute of a speech. The speaker may either wave them down or take their question. All speeches are seven minutes. The last speaker on each side summarizes the debate.
First Proposition Speaker:
Competitor at the Debate World Championships 2009
Model: This house proposes that genetic modifcation of all organisms except people be permitted. We would remove all restrictions on what genetic engineering techniques can be used on, but still hold people responsible for the negative consequences of their creations - an 'innocent until proven guilty' plan.
Arguments:
1. Advantages of new strains of organism: for instance, biofuel, nanotechnology components, and golden rice. The more we can control life, the more useful we can make it.
2. Genetic engineering is better than alternative ways of getting new strains: for instance, seeds used to be irradiated to produce new mutations, which is much less controlled than current genetic engineering.
3. The benefits of knowledge
a) pragmatic: to produce tools for the future, and apply that knowledge to learning about other things, such as fighting disease and living longer. We don't need to experiment on people if we can engineer animal models.
b) philosophical: humans are knowledge seeking, that is what separates us from other forms of life. We should take advantage of our unique abilities to pursue knowledge.
First Opposition Speaker
Veteran debater from the Unversity of British Columbia
Second Proposition Speech
Refutation
Re: irraditation to produce new strains: just because previous techniques were bad doesn't mean current techniques are any better
Re: trying to acquire knowledge is important because we don't know the answer - and that's why it's dangerous too. Proposition has agreed experimentation is dangerous.
Arguments
1. Locking stuff up doesn't work: for instance, computer viruses, outbreaks of diseases, illegal transport of weapons. If the floodgates are open, people will experiment with everything. Scientists like to experiment and they won't be careful. Harms of this include ecosystem damage. For instance, CFC's, X-rays, and DDT are substances we should have examined more before using.

Purdue,2012,Team:Purdue#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Biofilms"" by Judisth H. Mernitt, Daniel E. Kadouri, and George A. O'Toole was helpful in determining how we would do this assay.
Monday, July 9
Performed the Growth Rate Assay on NEB Beta and DH5 Alpha E.coli strains to determine the time frame we will use to grow our static biofilms.A typical bacterial growth curve is shown below. This is what we expect our curves to look like.
Below is the results of the growth rate assay for NEB Beta and DH5 alpha. Overall, the plots show the expected shape with a lag, log, and stationary phase.
Also worked out the lab plan for the rest of the week.
Tuesday, July 10
We did the same Growth Rate Assay as yesterday, but with the XL-10 Gold E.coli strain because we think it will work better for the biofilm purposes.
Below is the results of the growth rate assay for XL-10 Gold. The plots show the expected shape with a lag, log, and stationary phase.
Here is the excel file containing all of the data from the three growth rate assays.
Also researched and developed the static biofilm assay that we can do to determine the biofilm rates of our non-transformed E.coli.

Monday, July 16
Researched how Membrane Aerated Bioreactor work and how we will use one for testing. There are multiple types of Membrane Aerated Biofilms: MABR (the type we will be using in our experiments), Membrane biofilter, and extractive membrane bioreactor (EMB).  These reactors can be in shell and tube or plate and frame configurations.  We will be using the shell and tube configuration. The two limiting substrates are introduced at opposite ends of the bioreactor"

Optogenetics
What is Optogenetics?
Sensing light
Nature has evolved a multiple of photoreceptors able to sense light.       Those systems have provided synthetic biology tools for the precise control of biological functions, offering superior spatial and temporal resolution.        The research field focusing on the combination of optical methods and genetics has been named «optogenetics» and can lead to the control of gene expression, cell morphology or even signaling pathway thank to light signals.
Photoreceptors
What is VVD and how does it work?
Among other photoreceptors, Vivid (VVD) is the smallest known Light–oxygen–voltage (LOV) domain protein and photo-inducible dimer.          Isolated from Neurospora crassa, VVD forms a homo-dimer in response to a blue-light stimulus.         The LOV domain, present in VVD, is a small blue-light sensing domain found in prokaryotes, fungi and plants.         After blue-light activation, a covalent bond is formed between the co-factor Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and one of the cysteine residue.          This bond leads to a conformational change inducing functions by dissociating the C-terminal a-helix (Ja) and the LOV-core.          In VVD, this undock triggers homodimerization (Bilwes, Dunlap, & Crane, 2007; Müller & Weber, 2013).
Why did we choose the photoreceptor VVD ?
Contrary to other photoreceptors, VVD is a small protein with 150 amino-acids facilitating accurate molecular design and avoiding steric issues ( BBa_K1616014) .        Moreover, it is a homo-dimer when most of photo-inducible dimers are heterodimers.        In addition, the use of  VVD is easy; and doesn’t need any addition of co-factors: VVD works with Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which is already abundant in eukaryote and prokaryote cells (Müller & Weber, 2013; Nihongaki, Suzuki, Kawano, & Sato, 2014).
Split-Protein
What is a split-protein and how does it work?
A split protein is a protein whose sequence has been divided into two (or more) different parts.        Often used to study protein-protein interactions, the protein can not perform its function until the parts are put"

Are cyanobacteria transformable?
Yes! You can use conjugation, natural transformation or even electroporation for gene transfer. In our project we used the conjugation method. The protocol can be found here: https://www.protocols.io/view/triparental-mating-of-synechocystis-ftpbnmn
What kind of plasmids are needed for transformation?
Normally cyanobacteria are transformed using genomic integration. Therefore a plasmid should have fragments which overlap with neutral sites in the genome of the chassis organism. For example you can use NSIa and NSIb for this purpose. It is also possible to transfer plasmids using triparental mating .
How do you gain competent cyanobacteria?
Many cyanobacteria, like Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 or Synechocystis PCC 6803 are naturally competent. There are also transformation kits available for the transformation.
Are cyanobacteria compatible with E. coli biobricks?
It depends. Some biobricks like the ribosome binding site BB_0034 are compatible. Generally you can use them, but they may work less efficiently than in Escherichia coli.
Which medium is needed in order to cultivate cyanobacteria?
It depends on the strain because some strains need freshwater media and others need saltwater based media. The usually used medium for freshwater strains like Synechococcus elongatus is called BG11. The protocol for the preparation of BG11 is listed here: BG11. For marine strains the same medium can be used with additional salt.
Are there any toxic metabolites released by cyanobacteria?
It is possible for S. elongatus to produce microcystin and β-Methylamino-L-alanine, but it is rarely released into the media and can be neglected.
How long is it possible to cultivate cyanobacteria?
Basically forever as long as the medium is frequently refreshed and there is no contamination.
What is the typical yield of sugar production of cyanobacteria?
There is little production of sucrose from the wild type. Some modified strains like the S. elongatus sp. PCC 7942 cscB strain from Daniel Ducat et al., 2011 have a production rate of 36.1 mg / liter * h.
At which wavelength do you measure cyanobacteria?
When you want to measure the OD of your culture, use 750 nm."
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#VarroaIsolates_-_-_TEXT.html," step was with 1% halamid solution and lasted 10 seconds.
Initial plates showed no colonies; the experiment was repeated with a ~2.5% bleach washing step.
The second set of plates also showed no colonies. After the heat treatment, the LB + mites was incubated for 24 hours and streaked with an inoculation loop.
Again, no colonies: a mite was dissected and its gut rubbed on a plate. Due to the small size of the mite, it was difficult to isolate the gut. Additionally, the same protocol as before was followed, except only 0.1 mL of the LB was heat treated and the rest was plated without a heat treatment.
This week, the protocol failed to yield any colonies. I also tried to plate mite samples without a sterilization step. During dissection of the dead mite, I was able to observe dessication; this indicated that the mites were too dry to avoid sucking up bleach during the sterilization step. Their guts were probably also sterile, which explains the lack of colonies.
To test this hypothesis, I repeated the isolation protocol without a sterilization step and only washed with sterile tap water. This yielded 3 colonies, but now I would be unable to exclude environmental contamination.
Figure 1. Photo of the first plate with colonies (no. 15). These mites were not sterilized, so this was probably contamination.
Week 3
More colonies grew on the plates from Week 2. They were streaked, even though plate 13's colony was yellow and plates 14 and 15 only had transparent colonies. Plate 17 had small and large white round colonies.  Prepared more plates; also without sterilization step, but they were washed carefully. Up to plate 39 was prepared this week. I tried a different heat treatment: 3 minutes at 80 degrees Celsius. I observed the colonies with a stereo microscope, but images were unclear and largely useless.
Week 4
Prepared up to plate 49. A colony from plate 46 looked like Bacillus thuringiensis HD350! I prepared 16 samples for brightfield microscopy. B. thuringiensis HD350 (also referred to as Bt HD350) was used as a positive control; this strain was ordered from DSMZ (no. DSM-6030) and grown according to the supplied protocol. All samples were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R according to the protocol . I used a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 for imaging with the 100x oil immersion objective. Very little sp"

Safety
During our time in the lab (Biosafety Level 1), our primary concern and focus is following the                     safety and security procedures and rules of the lab we work in, to ensure the safety of the lab                     members, society and the environment.
We received Safety and Security training by various members of the labs we worked in. We were                     taught proper lab practice, sterile techniques and physical biosecurity, along with proper                     waste disposal and emergency procedures. We were instructed on the function and usage of the                     various equipment in the lab like Biosafety Cabinets, centrifuges and more. Application of the                     above in our daily lab practices will prevent any organisms to escape the lab.
We had conversations with professors about various Bioethical issues that might have arisen                     from implications of different projects that were considered. The present project does not pose                     any major bioethical questions.                     Furthermore, early on in the process of deciding on a subject, we were taught about data safety                     and regulations along with dual use research of concern.
Here, we present an overview of such practices:
Potential Dangers Assessment:
In our project, we primarily used E. coli DH5a cells as chassis for our constructs. Additional                     strains of said organism that we used as chassis include: INVaF’, C43 (DE3), CC118 λ-pir, Xl-1                     Blue. We, also, used Vibrio natriegens as part of the collaboration measurements with iGEM                     Marburg 2018. All of the above organisms are Risk Group 1 according to the DSMZ. We believe                     that under the application of proper microbial sterile techniques and waste disposal practices,                     they pose no significant threat to us, the rest of the lab members, or the environment.
We did not use any part from a risk group 3 or higher organism.
We did not fill in any check-in forms since none of our parts met the requirements to do so.                     When visualizing gels under UV light in the dark room that were meant to be extracted, we used special equipment that protected us from the radiation.
Potentially Harmful Chemicals:
During our time in the lab we handled some potentially dangerous chemicals.                     Those include:
Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) is a potentially carcinogenic molecule that we used to stain                             and visualise DNA in agarose gels. EtBr was stored in tightly sealed tube to avoid                             spillage, wrapped in tin foil, at 4 degrees centigrade, and was used with caution and                             care (g"
UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Human Practices#Law_-_-_TEXT.html," submission, and suggestions for improvement, were critically evaluated and analysed in light of comments from Dr Alexandra George and the Pasteur Paris iGEM team. The Pasteur team particularly gave us insight into the differences between the civil law European regime and the Australian process, and Dr Alexandra George also gave insight into how the French system’s benefits are replicated here, but in a slightly different way.
Integration
The team’s research into the legal frameworks and implications on scientific research has affected the direction of our project. Firstly, it affected the decision of whether to patent the Assemblase system, by providing the framework to discuss the likelihood of a successful protection claim. As legal information gathered suggested that a patent was an unlikely outcome, we refocused the system onto modularity, using ‘ideal’ test enzymes. It also affected the way we consulted with other academics and people in industry, as we were more open with our ideas, and they could give us better feedback (being more directed towards the project).
Figure 4: The Assemblase scaffold with the Tag/Catcher systems.
Secondly, it affected the decision of which covalent protein attachment system was going to be chosen to use with the scaffold. Initial legal research had made us aware of the patent system, and further research was undertaken to establish whether an Australian patent was held for the system we wanted to use. We also researched whether that patent would stop our use of the system (educational exceptions to patents) and whether a US patent which did exist would stop our use of the system. Fortunately, using the research we came to a conclusion that the best systems to use (SpyTag/Catcher and SnoopTag/Catcher) were not protected in Australia, and that we could use them

. The legal information gathered also led us to present an alternative in case of protection; the use of SnoopTag/Catcher and SdyTag/Catcher systems, being that these were not patented in both relevant countries of the United States and Australia.
There were also several indirect effects of legal systems on our project. Namely, the availability of certain methodologies in sufficient detail to allow them to be replicated within the modelling aspect of the project. It seemed that in some of the key papers, writers were trying to patent part of their research, and so did not publish very many details on their method – which proved to be challenging when our team tried to replicate part of their research using our enzymes. Additionally, it appears that the legal system fed into the lack of funding opportunities available; as outlined above, the lack of legal protection is associated with a lack of funding opportunities,"

COLLABORATIONS
Collaborations and Outreach
In iGEM Uppsala we believe that collaboration and outreach is an important part of our project. Helping out other iGEM teams, but also asking for help when we need it, is as important as anything else in a successful project. This year was no different. We collaborated with teams all around the world in our webinars and in a postcard challenge. Additionally, we also had collaborations a bit closer to home. Such as in June we took part in the Nordic iGEM Conference (NIC) in Copenhagen. We also collaborated with other Swedish teams during our iGEM run. The biggest collaboration there was the organization of a panel discussion with the Stockholm team. We also helped iGEM Lund with their newly established team that is having their first run in 2017. Of course there is no way we could have done iGEM without receiving some help! Here we would like to thank all the teams from Sweden, Denmark and Finland for giving us constant insight and answering the burning questions we had. Also, a special thank you to iGEM Stockholm for helping us with clarifications around the InterLab study.
Now, let’s take a more detailed look into the collaboration we had this year!
Webinars
This year our team wanted to discover a bit more about the ethical part of our project and science in general. After some discussion with the ethics experts at our university we felt a need to talk with other iGEM team. Therefore, we decided to host three webinars with topics relating to ethics in science.
These webinars were based on our chapters in the ethics guidelines and the answers given by the teams were taken into consideration for designing our guidelines. The three webinars topics were Social Responsibility, Genetic Engineering and Property Rights. Five teams from all around the globe participated in each webinar and discussed three questions about the topic, shared their opinions and experiences. The sessions were live streamed on YouTube and the recording can be found at iGEM Uppsala´s YouTube channel .

St_Andrews,2010,Team:St Andrews#project#modelling#models#RK4_-_-_TEXT.html," be noted that the x-value at which the function is being evaluated is halfway across the prediction interval and the y-value consists of the current y-value plus half of the Euler predicted Δy. So then the function is evaluated at a point lying halfway between the current point and the Euler-predicted next point. When we evaluate the function at this point what is produced is an estimate of the slope of the solution curve at this halfway point on the curve. Multiplying this result by h gives a prediction of the y-jump made by the solution across the entire interval. However, this prediction is made not on the slope of the solution at the left end of the interval but on the estimated slope halfway to the next Euler-predicted point.
A comparison can be made between k3 and k2, with the only difference in their formulation being the replacement of k1 by k2. Here the function evaluated at this point gives an estimate of the solution slope at the midpoint of the prediction interval but one which is based in the y-jump predicted by k2 rather than the Euler-predicted one. When multiplied by h we get a further estimate of the y-jump made by the solution across the whole interval.
Finally, k4 evaluates the function at the right-hand side of the prediction interval. The y-value at which the function is evaluated, yn+k3 is an estimate of the y-value at the right-hand side based on the estimate of the y-jump made by k3. In its entirety, k4 gives a final estimate of the y-jump made by the solution across the entire width of the prediction interval.
So to provide a summary: each ki yields an estimate of the y-jump made by the solution across the entire width of the prediction interval h, with each using the previous ki to make its estimate. The Runge-Kutta formula can be viewed as the y-value of the current point plus a weighted average of four different predictions for the slope.
Figure 2: Runge-Kutta technique
Implementation
The code which performs the operations in the Runge-Kutta algorithm is shown below.
The operation of the algorithm is thus; k1 is calculated from the value stored from the solved differential equation which is stored in the array ""ode"", multiplied by our step size h which can be chosen by the user. This process is looped round for each variable to produce an array with an element for variable in the system. Values for y2 are then calculated using the value for k1 and the y value from the previous iteration, which is initially zero. Again this process is looped round for each"

Contribution for part BBa_K731400
This year, we improved the characterization of a part encoding the cysteine desulfhydrase( BBa_K731400 ) from team iGEM12_TRENTO. We found out a new function of the part, to generate sulfur ions from cysteine to precipitate the cadmium ions. In another word, this protein can increase the bacteria's resistance to a certain concentration of cadmium ions and solve the pollution of cadmium ions. With this part, we can successfully precipitate CdS nanoparticles on the surface of our bacteria.
The reason we chose this part for contribution is that we found out that many characterizations should be added if we want to have a thorough understanding of this part. For example, although it can precipitate cadmium ions to increase the resistance, but what is the maximum concentration of cadmium ions it can take? We did a growth curve test to find it out. Besides, we also used Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM) to confirm that the precipitations are form on the surface on the bacteria because it needs to attach to the bacteria to function in our project.
1. CysDes-pLuxR-pSB1C3 construction and transformation
We obtained the sequence of CysDes gene from Genebank and synthesized this gene from IDT. We inserted this gene to plasmid pSB1C3 with promoter pLuxR on it which was provided by iGEM headquarters. The sequence of gene CysDes was validated with DNA sequencing by Sangon. We transformed this plasmid plays (one contains gene CysDes and promoter pLuxR) into strain BL21. Then we picked some colonies for cultivation and confirmed the transformation result by PCR (shown in Figure 1). From the result of electrophoresis, we confirmed the transformation of pLCys was success.

MIT,2014,Team:MIT#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," were presented the opportunity to watch a documentary on the life of a patient, we didn’t hesitate to take it. The Alzheimer’s Association was organizing a screening a documentary called “The Genius of Marian”, a walk through the life of Pam White in her early and later stages of Alzheimer’s disease. It showed us different aspects of how the disease affected the patient, from the daily struggles in Pam’s life, to the big changes such as denial, keeping the disease a secret, reluctance to accept external help, and finally acceptance. It showed the importance of family support, both to the patient and to the caregiver, in Pam’s case, her husband, Ed White.
The documentary was very emotional. It showed us how devastating the disease can be to a family. After the screening, we met with the Alzheimer’s Association representatives and discussed with them the possibilities of us volunteering for the organization.
Alzheimer’s Association: TriMatch
After the Alzheimer’s Association movie screening, we were very enthusiastic to volunteer for them to get a chance to meet Alzheimer’s patients or their family members. We were presented with an opportunity to volunteer at the Walk to End Alzheimer's, organized by the Alzheimer’s Association, where we would try to persuade people to sign up for TrialMatch. TrialMatch is a system designed by the Alzheimer’s Association to match an individual to an ongoing clinical trial if he/she chooses to participate. Our goal was to get healthy people to sign up for clinical trials, because currently, the number of healthy people signing up is not enough.
At the Walk, we met some professionals in the field who were volunteering with us, and many friends and family members of Alzheimer’s patients. Their stories helped drive home how deeply the disease affects people’s lives and how important it is to find a cure.
Survey
Our synthetic biology approach to diagnosing and treating Alzheimer’s disease was built and developed around the idea of an administrable therapeutic for patients with the disease. In order to get our system into the patient’s brain, he/she must be willing to receive it in whatever manner necessary. We sought to answer the question of which delivery method would be most effective for our system, not only in it's scientific functionality, but also in it's social acceptability and therefore, its potential reach. With this in mind, we designed and implemented a survey to help us obtain an understanding of how our project would be perceived in the public eye. More details can be found here .
Synthetic Biology Lecture
We know how important synthetic biology is to the future and we also knew how excited we are about this field, so we thought it would be a great idea to expose"

Data For Our Favorite New Parts
BBa_K568003 - T7 promoter with lacZ reporter part:
Our original reporter construct. The presence of a functional T7 polymerase causes expression of beta-galactosidase. Thus, it is possible to detect the output of our optogenetical AND-Gate.
BBa_K568002 - blue light promoter with lacZ reporter part:
The blue light promoter followed by lacZ is a simple optogenetic device that expresses beta-galactosidase if the blue light input is positive. We used this part to find out the characteristics of the response to blue light in E. coli. The blue light promoter is part of the YcgE/F system which is a blue light sensor that is naturally found in E. coli. Thus, only the promoter itself is needed in this part.
BBa_K568001 - optogenetical AND-Gate red/blue light:
This part is the centerpiece of our 3D-printer. It is supposed to cause expression of a functional T7 polymerase only when both the red light and the blue light input are positive. Further characterization will be needed.
All submitted parts
BBa_K568000 - red light sensor:
A red light sensor without reporter. It was extracted from BBa_K322127 using PCR. Thus this is an improvement of BBa_K322127 by making it usable in many different contexts.
BBa_K568001 - optogenetical AND-Gate red/blue light:
see above (""favorite parts"") for information concerning this part.
BBa_K568002 - blue light promoter with lacZ reporter part:

BBa_K568003 - T7 promoter with lacZ reporter part:
see above (""favorite parts"") for information concerning this part.
BBa_K568004 - optogenetical AND-Gate without first promoter - choose your first input:
This part is a part of the optogenetical AND-Gate. It lets you choose the first input, that in combination with blue light will lead to expression of the T7 polymerase. Whether you choose a different wavelength of light, a chemical substance or a physical condition - the choice of the first input is up to you!
BBa_K568005 - Intermediate optogenetical AND-Gate without T7ptag:
This part is a precursor of the finished"

WLC-Milwaukee,2014,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Anthropology_-_-_TEXT.html," the scientists teach the farmers, and in turn, the farmers relay information to the scientists. Perhaps in the case of South Africa, education would have been helpful; if they had known the seeds produced less pollen than needed, they may have been able to notify Monsanto and replace the defective seeds before harvest.
Even so, biotechnology has gained a strong foothold in South Africa; there are fifteen (as of 2007) biotech firms in the Western Cape region. There are some setbacks to South Africa’s potential, one being the lack of “venture” capital; many “people put venture money into real estate, into building a mall or into mining” . The desire for education in biotechnology is strong, and “the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity will be offering learners from Grades 11 and 12 the chance to work as apprentices… on March 22 and 26, while marine biologist Dr. Nadine Strydom…will be offering high school students and adults an excursion along the Eastern Cape coastline for one day only during SciFest” (Science in Africa).
In Asia, rice has been a staple for millennia. In Japan, rice is linked to abundance, harmony, and wealth. “For example, the Emperor became a ""priest-king"" early in Japanese history. Many of his priestly functions under the Shinto religion revolved around rice-growing and included rice products such as sake (rice wine) and mochi (rice cakes), as well as the actual grain and its stalks.”  Recently, crops have failed, resulting in a major shortage of food for this nation. Children here, as in Africa, and as in South America rely on this food, not only for themselves as their most basic biological needs dictate, but also for commerce; any extra crops could possibly fund a way to escape the rural poverty through which their parents struggled. It is difficult and dangerous to study while hungry, let alone to work from sundown to sunup. Yet, that is what they do.
Our Project
In a small liberal arts college in southeastern Wisconsin, an assembly of science-minded undergrad students is attempting to make the developing world healthier. The focus of Wisconsin Lutheran College’s iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) team this year is to utilize bacteria for further digestion of fiber, first tested in animals, and then given to humans in developing areas in order to combat malnourishment. In humans, the gene to digest and utilize fiber is not expressed, and this creates problems for those who do not have a relatively unlimited source of fiber, protein, or carbohydrates.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Adam Smith
This is my second year as a member of the University of Lethbridge's iGEM team, and I am very excited to be back. I am taking a step back from my role last year as a lab technician, and am acting as an advisor on laboratory activities.
I am currently working as a research assistant in the molecular biology/biochemistry labs of Dr. L. Brent Selinger and Dr. Steven Mosimann, and hope that my knowledge and experience will influence this year's iGEM team positively.
In my spare time, I enjoy golfing or skiing, depending on the season, or playing Angry Birds in any season.
Fan Mo
Fan currently works as a lab technician in the Wieden lab. In her spare time she likes to play badminton, computer games and dancing in the rain. She currently holds the title for best score playing gold miner among the Wieden lab. This is her third year in iGEM as a supervisor and looks forward to another year on the team.
Jeffrey Fischer
Currently, I'm in the process of finishing my PhD in Biomolecular Science in HJ Wieden's lab. This is my third year in iGEM, and I'm delighted to be back and working with the team yet again. I am extremely busy in the lab as always, and in November, I will become a Papa! This year promises to be the best that the U of L iGEM has had yet.
Supervisors
Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:

Protocol A. Plasmid DNA purification using centrifuges
Step
Procedure
1
Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 μL of the Resuspension Solution. Transfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. The bacteria should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
Note. Ensure RNase A has been added to the Resuspension Solution (as describe on p.3)
2
Add 250 μL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
Note. Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA. Do not incubate for more than 5 min to avoid denaturation of supercoiled plasmid DNA.
3
Add 350 μL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Note. It is important to mix thoroughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization Solution to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris.
The neutralized bacterial lysate should become cloudy.
4
Centrifuge for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.
5
Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting or pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white prepipitate.
Note. Close the bag with GeneJET Spin Columns tightly after each use!

We strongly believe that the practicability of our project would attract more plants even business companies to cooperate with us.
a. On campus part
We conducted lectures of iGEM projects and synthetic biology techniques to students on Tuesday and Thursday weekly. At the start of our education program, we briefly introduced our project's purpose, effectiveness and future potential contribution to the environment. We also invited students who were interested in improving the environment by synthetic biology technologies. After that, we held a series of lectures explaining the molecular mechanism, and prove practicability of our project to the students who followed up our project.
For the whole process of education, we put a high value on the effectiveness of lecture. Therefore, we required students who is willing to cooperate our work to register their WeChat account, and asked randomly 75% of students each time to share their perspectives, so we could adjust and improve the content of our lecture. We also interviewed students to find future iGEMers.
Furthermore, in our synthetic biology club, we introduced some basic methods and techniques of genetic engineering such as DNA extraction, restriction enzyme digestion, Primer design, and PCR, reserving talented students for our further iGEM projects.
In general, our on-campus education program comprehensively passed on our experience in iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge. Our program had also triggered students’ concern on environmental problems, as well as their passion for learning synthetic biology and becoming a qualified iGEMer.
b. Off campus part
During the visit of a sewage treatment plant, we briefly introduced our project to work leaders, then we showed reliability of our project and resolution to protect the environment. On one side, sewage treatment plant helped us conduct the design of our program by providing first-hand information of sewage plant. On the other side, we offered more information of our modified biology treatment. As a result, both sides were looking forward to establishing a long-term collaboration.
V. Conclusion
In conclusion, through the biology method, we found that the expensive cost and decreasing effectiveness are two main problems for traditional biological treatment method. These experiences from human practice has inspired us with the idea of designing our Biofilm × Laccase system. In the near future, we will build a filter with PHA beads coated with laccase linked biofilm and optimize the filter for real world sewage treatment.

Again, we are interesting in the possibility of using evolutionary development techniques to mutate a variant promoter, specific for MicroBeagle activity, with a higher threshold stress tolerance than the native Cpx promoter. Other extensions to this work would be in use of characterising the binding domain strengths of MicroBeagle , and we hope other teams may seek to use similar methods in future.
Characterisation of Si4 silica-binding oligo-peptide
Growth Curve
Here the growth of cells expressing INP-displayed Si4 was monitored via absorbance and compared to the growth of cells that do not contain Si4. As was seen when device 1 was inserted into the cells, the growth is slowed down considerably. Although the graph shows a log and a lag phase for the cells expressing INP-Si4, the absorbance reached in log phase is very low compared to cells without Si4; it is even lower than the absorbance reached for cells containing Device 1.
Characterisation of Device 2
Growth Curve
This graph shows the results of monitoring the growth of cells with expressing Device 2. As with other hetereologous expression experiments, growth of the cells is considerably slowed when compared with cells that do not contain any device at all. A slight change in the gradient of the graph can be seen showing the transition of the cell growth from lag to log phase, so the cells are still growing normally, but the insertion of Device 2 is restricting rate of cell growth and final density acheived. We propose that this is due to the increased energy and nutrient requirements to produce the inserted structures.
Scannning Electron Microscopy
The gallery above contains Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) data on cells either expressing Device 2 (i.e. displaying Si4), or not (control). Cells were grown overnight and then incubated with 1 mM silicic acid (formed by acid hydrolyzing 1 mM tetraethoxysilane), pelleted by centrifugation and then imaged by SEM, which chemical analysis by electron x-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). Only in the cell samples containing Device 2 were silica-coated cells observed, whereas in the control cell population no cells coated with large quantities of silica were observed. Silica formation is expected to occur through reaction of surface-displayed Si4 with silicic acid in solution. The silica-coated cells shown here were relatively few in the overall population of experimental (Device 2-containing) cells, with large number of experimental cells un"

Team Activity Test:
Remember our first activity measurements? The activity was awesome and reached quickly its saturation. So today we decided to have a lazy Sunday and reduce absorption maximum and reaction speed, too. For this we used 0.1 mM ABTS instead of 5 mM ABTS and we got good results. The saturation reached its maximum at a OD420 of ~1.6 after roundabout 2 minutes (see Fig. 2). Taking together we halved the maximal OD420 and doubled the reaction time until maximum is reached with using 0.1 mM ABTS instead of 5 mM ABTS.

Methods for Producing Recombinant Silk Films
Dialyzing silk to remove ions and prepare for lyophilization
Following recombinant protein expression and purification, the solution contains many ions and other molecules, which are easily removed by dialysis. We dialyzed the solution in a SnakeSkin tube with 3.5 kDa MWCO against 5mM ammonium bicarbonate for 24 hours with 2 total bath changes. Dialyzing against ammonium bicarbonate also prepares the solution for lyophilization, as ammonium bicarbonate facilitates the sublimation of water in the lyophilizer.[5]
Lyophilization
We froze the dialyzed silk solution using liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized the frozen sample in a LabConco FreeZone 4.5-105. Lyophilization allows us to recover all of the protein that was purified, which is around 5 to 8 mg from 1 L of recombinant cell culture.
The lyophilized silk can be seen on the walls of the tube. In this form, the silk is pure and without any solvent.
Dissolving in HFIP
Very few solvents are capable of dissolving pure silk. HFIP, a highly polar organic solvent, is one of them.[1] We dissolved our recombinant silk in HFIP to obtain a dilute silk dope of 5% w/v (50 mg/mL).
Casting films and water annealing
We pipetted 100 uL of silk dope into a small weigh boat and let it dry in a fume hood for 24 hours. We then removed the film from the weigh boat and placed it into a vacuum desiccator along with water in a separate container. Vacuum was then applied to the desiccator, and the film was allowed to anneal for 24 hours. The water annealing process encourages further formation of the silk's secondary structure, giving the film stability in aqueous environments as well as added strength.[4]
Measuring thickness of the film
A Vernier micrometer was used to measure the thickness of the film.

Those chemically competent cells were used for a second heat shock transformation of the second plasmid BBa_K2201032 containing our UBP isoG-isoCm. 10 μL of the above described Gibson Assembly was transformed into chemically competent cells. After the heat shock, the cells were recovered in liquid recovery media (2xYT media supplemented with 50 mM K2HPO4, 0.5 mM IPTG, 100 μM isoCmTP, and 100 μM isoGTP) and shaked at 200 rpm and 37 °C for 1 h. Growth was performed in liquid growth media (2xYT media supplemented with 50 mM K2HPO4, 0.5 mM IPTG, 100 μM isoCmTP, 100 μM isoGTP, 3 μg μL-1 chloramphenicol, and 50 μg μL-1 kanamycin) while shaking at 600 rpm and 37 °C for 48 h. The described experimental set-up is shown in Figure 10.
K2HPO4 is needed in the recovery and growth media as a competitive inhibitor for phosphatases. This prevents the dephosphorylation of unnatural nucleotide triphosphates. The IPTG in the media induces the expression of cas9 that is negatively regulated by our designed lac operon ( lacO_tight1 ) optimized for tight repression. This needs to be added right from the beginning after the transformation to start the retention system during recovery. For the same reason the isoGTP and isoCmTP were added to the recovery and growth media.
Before analyzing the efficiency of the UBP retention, the plasmids need to be isolated from the cultivation samples. But this leads to the isolation of both plasmids, the high-copy (pSB1K3) and low-copy (pSB3C5) plasmid. For the detection of the UBP, which lays on the pSB3C5 plasmid, the pSB1K3 plasmid needs to be digested by restriction enzymes. This can be achieved by the restriction enzymes PvuI, NsiI und BamHI that are solely targeting the pSB1K3 plasmid BBa_K2201027 . Afterwards, the remaining pSB3C5 plasmid can be prepared for the Oxford Nanopore Sequencing method in"

""We found that the debate was interesting and educating, but we were suprised by the way in which the debator treated the subject. We found that the proposition side made a better case. We were suprised to not hear more arguments to back up their case but what is important is that they succeded to entertain the floor and prove that even though they didn't know that much about the subject they were the more convincing ones. The opposition did a good case as well, but they lacked all the examples they could have brought to the case to explain why the whole thing is so uncertain, why we don't know what the consequences of what modified bacteria would bring to our world. We were happy with both team's work and really enjoyed the debate. Thank you for this opportunity to witness such a great debate and organization"" (Dessislava Tocheva, from the law school ""Paris II - Assas"" AND coordinator of the Franco-British Comparative Project, and one of this debate's adjudicator)
Debators's feedback
Our feedback
""I really enjoyed this debate. I think the level of biology was actually quite high, I didn't expect it to be that high. I though it was going to be just some random exchange of arguments, but actually they did  a great job preparing the debate. Therefore I was surprised by how high the level of debating was. I don't know if my point of view changed on the issue of releasing genetically modified organisms in the environment, but I think both teams brought some very interesting arguments and I guess one of the messages I take from this is that if we bring now this kind of debate to the parliament, people are probably not prepared enough to have a very rational debate on that. People are not ready for that question yet. I think one of the jobs we have to do is to keep educating people about synthetic biology, about dangers that it might create, because we don't know yet if it is dangerous or not, so people can make their own opinion about that and choose very carefully what they want for our society in the future"" (Ernest Mordret, iGEM 2012 Paris Bettencourt team)

Most of the debaters knew nothing about synthetic biology and putting genetically modified bacteria in the wild, and yet, during one week, they researched information on the internet, called aquaintances and friends that might know more to discuss with them.

Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, while in 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight.               In particular, many low- and middle-income countries face “double burden” of under-nutrition and obesity. Rates of malnutrition is much higher in low income countries, while there is a greater exposure to high-sugar, high-fat, high-salt foods which are low in cost and nutrients. Such dietary patterns result in low levels of physical strength and sharp increase in childhood obesity with under-nutrition existing side-by-side.
2. In obesity, fatty acids delivered to liver may outpace fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes, resulting in triglyceride accumulation. Obesity leads to health hazards, including cardiovascular disease - mainly heart disease and stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis – a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints, and cancers, such as endometrial, breast and colon cancers.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". To keep track of time, the IPTG-induced gRNA, gRNA 1, locates the target sequence on all the recording DNA plasmids at the first time point. With this, the system is ready to begin recording.
Keeping Track of Elapsed Time
In this system, there are multiple recording plasmids with different amounts of repeating DNA sequences. The amount of DNA repeats corresponds to how many time points the recording plasmid can record to. To keep track of time in this system, gRNA 1 leads the base editor to make a mutation at the first repeating unit in all of the recording plasmids. As mentioned previously in the Description, repeating units are designed such that a mutation made by the base editor to the current frame in the recording DNA allows gRNA 1 to recognize the next repeating frame in the DNA.
Marking the Presence of a Stimulus
Once the stimulus of interest is in the system, gRNA 2 is produced because it is driven by an inducible promoter detecting the stimulus. In our design, the stimulus was arabinose. gRNA 2 is able to recognize the current frame in the recording plasmids corresponding to the time and mark the recording DNA with a special mutation, designating when the stimulus occurred. This mutation is unique because it turns the corresponding recording DNA sequence to a known restriction enzyme site, MfeI (CAATTG).
A target sequence that corresponds to gRNA 2 locates at the end of the repeating sequences and will be marked as the appearance of gRNA 2. However, if this target sequence is totally different from the repeating unit, it will always be open to be marked. By making it overlap with part of the repeating unit, the mutation made by base editor/gRNA 1 complex is able to cap it, making this target sequence only open for a short period of time which corresponds to one time point.
Readout
When we were thinking of a readout that was cheaper and more accessible for researchers to use, we thought of a restriction enzyme digest and an agarose gel as a simple way to visualize the information recorded. Especially since the recording DNA units are limited in being only 10 bp in length, we needed to think of an output that could be accomplished by changing 1-2 base pairs in such a small window. Thus, we came with the idea of the base editor creating a restriction enzyme site when the stimulus was detected in the system. In the recording plasmid corresponding to the time point when the stimulus occurred, an MfeI site is created by the base editor. In"

S-layer
Applications
The ability of self-assembly and forming defined nanostructures enables the use of S-layer proteins as building blocks in a biomolecular construction kit for the generation of a universal nanobiotechnological matrix. By using the matrix as a nano pinboard for further components or just the nanostructure itself, a great variety of applications in modular nanobiotechnology, biomimetics, bioanalytics and medical diagnostics are imaginable.
Focusing on the repetitive features of S-layer proteins to form a well defined nano lattice, the use as filtration units become reasonable. So-called isoporous S-layer ultrafiltration membranes (SUM) combine the advantages of a constant lattice with a well-defined pore size and the presence of functional groups in defined positions and orientations which are a common problem of current ultrafiltration membranes.
A current topic in S-layer research is the design of more sensitive and improved optical and electrochemical sensors. One example is the luminescence lifetime based oxygen sensor. The key benefits of using S-layer proteins for this type of sensor are the imparted anti-fouling properties and the good biocompatibility. This is especially valuable for sensing applications in complex biological fluids or implantable sensors.
The self-assembly and immobilization properties of S-layer fusion proteins also open new innovative perspectives in clinical applications like immune therapy, blood purification and drug targeting. The genetic fusion of an allergen to SbsC S-layer proteins from Geobacillus stearothermophilus combine reduced allergenicity with"

This was the most successful week by now. I obtained most of the results I had been trying since I started and I went on vacation with a smile in my face.
Week 6 (September, 1-2)
Back to work! After three weeks on vacation it was hard to return to the lab, but I was overexcited to face the home stretch to the Regionals. In those two first days of September I mostly checked some results from August and prepared new materials.
Checking the clones containing the portable attTn7 by colony PCR. I had transformed pSB1C3 + attTn7 and pSB4K5 + attTn7 ligations in DH5α but I only obtained colonies for the former construct. The control plates looked OK. So I tested eleven candidates by colony PCR using the pSB1C3-attTn7 plates and the standard primers for prefix and suffix. The PCR products were analyzed in an electrophoretic gel and most of them showed the expected 208 bp attTn7 band. I restreaked five positive candidates onto fresh plates.
Cleaning chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance cassettes. The gel-purified PCR products bearing resistance cassettes were digested at the flanking NcoI sites. However, we observed that these preparations did not freeze at -20, and we suspected ethanol contamination. Because of that, I discarded the digestion reactions and cleaned the DNA, analyzing the cleaning results in an agarose gel and measuring the DNA concentration.
Cleaning BioBrick mini-preps and digestions. Previous minipreps of the miniTn7 BioBrick inserts contamined with RNA were treated with RNAse and then cut with EcoRI and PstI. The digested BioBricks were isolated from gel and purified, but the resulting preparations had low DNA concentration.
Checking plasmids containing synthetic mini-Tn7 transposon. The pUC18-SfiI-miniTn7-Gm plasmid was checked by SfiI digestion with positive results. On the other hand, the selective plates from the pUC18R6KT-miniTn7-Gm ligation did not show any colonies. I"

We have 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, so we need to dilute this by 100. to get 10 mM Tris-HCl.  Thus, one should add 1 mL for every 100 mL.
To get 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA, add 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl and 0.1 mL of 1 M EDTA to 100 mL of water.
Will autoclave all of these tomorrow, in addition to YPD media.

Creating the TERRA Adaptor
Check back soon for our design of the TERRA Adaptor!
Designing the XY-Plane
In order for TERRA to select for specific locations to dispense fluids, we needed a method of either moving the output tube or the vessel, such as a 96-well plate. We ultimately decided to move the vessel, as that would minimize the length of and amount of dead volume in the output tube. Our team designed an active XY-plane, which would allow us to move the platform in the X- and Y-direction to target a specific location. This XY-plane needed to have the following functions and features: the ability for translational motion; a homing system; a control system; a manufacturing method; material; and motors.
The following morphological chart illustrates our potential means of accomplishing each function or feature and the chosen options are written in green.
Translational Motion:
Homing: Our team chose to utilize contact switches in order to home our system as they were the easiest to integrate into the existing design of TERRA and were low-cost . We had briefly considered manual, user-controlled homing, but realized that it would result in a great amount of human error, as the user would need to approximate the distance from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA and are harder to integrate to our system.
Control: We decided to use the Arduino Mega to control our XY-plane and syringe pumps, as the addition of Arduino shields allowed for more motors, and therefore syringe pumps, to be connected per microprocessor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it would have been harder to integrate into TERRA and it contained more functions than needed for our project.
Manufacturing Method: TERRA is composed of 3D-printed supports, as 3D-printing is more accessible, lower-cost, and allows for quick prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate"

Improve a previous part
We improved the validation system for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for ncAAs from Austin Texas 2014 (BBa_K1416004) and Aachen 2016 ( BBa_K2020040 ) with a FRET system ( BBa_K2201343 ) and used it in our project. You can find our part improvement site here .
Model your project
Using ROSETTA, we successfully modeled several protein sequences for our synthetases to incorporate the new synthetic non-canonical amino acid CBT-asparagine and 2-nitrophenylalanine. Find the results of our modeling here .
Demonstrate your work
We were able to integrate and detect the unnatural bases in the DNA sequences by software modification of Nanopore Sequencing. We also expanded the genetic code by providing a toolbox of some evolved synthetases. These are able to incorporate non-canonical amino acids into any kind of protein and proof their functionality. Find a summary of our achievements here .
Validated Part
In our project we used and created various parts. We want to highlight our nucleotide triphosphate transporter part BBa_K2201004 which functioned just as expected and has been well characterized and validated by us.
Collaboration
Throughout our project we collaborated with many iGEM teams to improve our work and help each other. Especially our part exchange with the CU Boulder team and the mentoring of the new iGEM team UNIFI was very important for us. Find the summary of our collaborations here .
Human Practices
During the last months we had a lot of interactions with the public trying to convey all aspects of our work and project. For example we worked with students at the GENIALE or at our institute’s yearly pupil’s academy and organized a literature workshop about synthetic biology. We had appearances at the radio, created a little biotechnology quiz show for a student initiative and wrote a biosafety report. All human practices of the silver category are collected here .

HokkaidoU_Japan,2010,Team:HokkaidoU Japan#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html," (Fig.3). The length of SPI-2 region about 40kb and T3 secretion apparatus is a complex consisted of more than 20 kinds of proteins. As mentioned before cloned SPI-2 on R995 vector was functional in E. coli (K-12) [9] . And also it was reported that SPI-2 region cloned on pBeloBAC11 (BAC=Bacteria Artificial Chromosome) is functional [4] . So, we decided to request a E. coli (K-12) strain carrying a pBeloBAC11 vector encoding a genome fragment of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 which covers the SPI-2 region [B_STM07H21  SGSC4024  1464540～1562427] from Salmonella Genetic Stock Center(SGSC) in University of Calgary, Canada ( http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kesander/index.html ). We confirmed the presence of the cloned SPI-2 region in this strain via PCR analysis(Fig.4) shall refer to it as ""pBAC-SPI-2"" from now on. Because of the provision of MTA, we cannot register this strain as a Bio Brick, but you can also get the same strain from SGSC.

Conceptional figure of the project
   We have made a T3SS test construct on the tetracycline resistant plasmid [pSB1T3] and transform it to the E. coli (K-12) carrying pBAC-SPI-2 as shown in (Fig.5). It was reported that N-terminus 191 amino acid residues of SlrP (one of the natural effector protein of SPI-2 encoded T3SS) function as a T3 secretion signal domain in Salmonella [6] . And it was also reported that GFP can be secreted through T3SS of Yersinia [5] . So, we fused the N-terminus 191 a.a. of SlrP with the N-terminal of GFP. In addition we located triple NLS (Nuclear Localization Signal) repeats between the T3 secretion signal and GFP so that the injected GFP would localize inside of the nucleus in the target cell. This [T3signal-NLS-GFP] fusion gene is under control of inducible arabinose promoter. In contrast RFP reporter gene, which is joined to the down stream of the GFP construct, is under control of a constitutive promoter."

We arrived at Cambridge's Downing Site, where their iGEM team were working in the Plant Sciences building, and were taken straight up to the lab to meet the team. In the lab we were introduced to their members and discussed our projects and the various problems we had encountered throughout the experimental side of the competition. Their team were a couple of weeks ahead of ours so it was interesting to hear their advice on certain aspects of the lab work; in addition we exchanged thoughts and constructive criticism on regards to each others projects. Ultimately we felt that both teams benefitted from the meeting and gain valuable information and experience.
Later in the day we traveled to STAR Radio 107.9/1 FM for our interview on their 'The Business Hub' show. The presenter met us and was extremely interested in the competition as well as synthetic biology as a whole. Khadija and Pascoe conducted the interview and did a fantastic job; the interview went very well and we were able to put across a lot of information on synthetic biology, iGEM and our own project. We hope that once the programme airs that we will receive feedback from members of the public.
Labs
After checking the plates of transformed E. coli we found that none had grown. We theorised that the chloramphenicol concentration of the agar might have been to high (50µg/ml) and decided to spend the rest of the week researching the growing conditions for the bacteria, the details of the cells we were using as well as compare various protocols of transformation used and developed by other iGEM teams in order to perform a successful transformation of E. coli again the next Monday.

Our team artist, Amy Congdon, visited today in order to discuss our video to present at the Jamboree in Amsterdam as well as to discuss the design aspects of our project. The next Friday we will be going into a school in order to present about synthetic biology and the project, therefore Amy helped out the members of the team involved in that presentation to produce some equipment and props to aid with it. She also looked over our wiki designs and adapted the logo with our suggestions in order to produce a final draft of the logo that we all felt was the most suitable one. Amy's ideas on the video were extremely exciting and captured the entire team's imaginations as to our project and how we will be presenting it and we all began to anticipate starting to work on it.

Abstract
Among natural materials, silk fibers boast unparalleled strength and elasticity. This has made silk ideal for use in apparel, medical sutures, and other high-performance materials. The unique profile of silk arises from the composition of its repetitive protein domains, which varies between species. We aimed to program the physical properties of synthetic silk in two ways: by modularizing spider silk genes and tuning their properties through directed assembly, and by fusing accessory proteins to silkworm and honey bee silks to expand their functionality. To overcome the challenge of creating large, repetitive, GC-rich genes, we adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to ligate spider silk genes in specific ratios, orders, and lengths. The recombinant silks were expressed in E. coli then spun via standard wet spinning. This provides a platform for standardizing the customization of synthetic silk fibers, and exploring their potential as multipurpose biomaterials.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
We have adapted a novel cloning technique called iterative capped assembly (ICA) to rapidly and controllably assemble spider silk genes.  Our new process will dramatically shorten the time and expense needed to assemble these repetitive parts.  Click here to learn more.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers with novel peptides, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this"

We also realized the advantages of regulating different functionalities independently.
Our awareness of the importance of safety in the design process increased.
Follow-up
Made sure that different functionalities in our project can be regulated independently by using different operators which are each induced by a different molecule.
We further researched the option of linking lysostaphin secretion to a sensory mechanism such as quorum sensing. Check our applied design  page for more information.
August 10, 2018. Safe-by-design: Phone call with Cécile van der Vlugt
For the Safe-by-design challenge  we had a phone call with Cécile van der Vlugt. She is active in the field of risk assessment and provided us with some interesting feedback on our work done so far. The phone call was very useful to put our work into perspective. For instance, she stressed that although it is good to be cautious, we do not need to see risks everywhere. In the week before the call, we had been researching alternatives to the toxic chemicals we use in the synthesis of our hydrogel gel. She said that in principle there is no need to replace the chemicals, as long as we ensure safe working conditions.

August 10,2018. Safe-by-design: Phone call with Cécile van der Vlugt
She recognized the importance of two aspects of our project: the fact that we are working on a safe platform to reduce the risk of GMO escape into the environment and how we are providing an alternative to antibiotics. For the RIVM, antibiotic resistance remains an issue with top priority. Nevertheless, we learned that antibiotics use in research and development (R&D) is not a big issue for the RIVM, as the quantities are low, and the types of antibiotics use are generally basic ones. For those antibiotics, many alternatives still exist in the unlikely case of resistance developed due to research work.
Insights
Be cautious, but not too cautious
The problem of antibiotic resistance and the topic of prevention is mainly relevant to the healthcare industry, rather than to R&D.
Follow-up
Consider safe handling of toxic chemicals instead of full replacement.

We determined the mutation rate of our genome wide mutator BBa_K2082117 to be (7.16±4.31)×10-6 bp-1×generation-1 induced and (2.51±3.18)×10-8 bp-1×generation-1 when repressed.

Therfore our aim to reconstruct this mutator with definded iGEM parts was successful.    Furthermore we showed the muation rate of BBa_K1333108 in our construct BBa_K2082116 to be (2.3±1.12)×10-6 bp-1×generation-1 induced and (6.67±4.09)×10-8 bp-1×generation-1.    Thereby we show the functionality of this already existing part.
Summary
We showed mutation using the error prone polymerase I, which is 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than basal mutation rate.
We determined the mutation rate of the error prone polymerase I and our genome wide mutator systems. Both systems produced mutations with a     frequency several orders of magnitude over the background. Therefore, our parts can be used be in vivo generation of protein libraries     to optimze enzymes or proteins for various purposes.
After determining the mutation rate of our construct we also investigated them with high-throughput sequencing

Overview / Rationale
While time delay might not be applicable in some situations, for example, containment of bacterial spill, it still has an implication on lab safety that must be met. Under a condition when modified bacteria secrete commercial products into a culture medium, this genetically engineered bacteria can be controlled to express within a constraint period of time before it is automatically knocked out. Keeping cell intact is crucial to prevent protein contamination in the media.
Therefore, this construct aims to set a timer for an inserted gene of interest to function for a controlled period of time before undergoing knock out by Cre recombinase. Knocking out of construct will lead to inactivation of the gene of interest, providing a secure and safe method for researchers to control the genetic modified organism (GMO).
Our Design
Time delay turns Cre recombinase either on or off dependent on the presence of AHL. All promoters in the Time delay module is a constitutively repressible promoter.
There are two scenarios of activity in Time Module Construct:
In the absence of AHL, only phlF molecules produce and repress its pphlF promoter. Then, the expression of downstream recombinase is rendered.
The second scenario is when sufficient AHL initiates cI protein production (BBa_C0051). The cI molecules will inhibit phlF expression by repressing pcI promoter (BBa_R0051). This turns on pphlF promoter, leading to expression of recombinase.
The length of time control is dependent on the strength of ribosomal binding site (RBS) downstream to pluxR promoter. The stronger the RBS strength, the higher recombinase expression.
Potential Issue
....
Experiments & Results
In order to observe the change in GFP expression due to different ribosomal binding site strength, we select five RBS in this investigation: 0.01, 0.07, 0.6, 0.3, 1.0 respectively. RBS 1.0 will be the"

As the graphs show, this verification was successful and indicates that NodB was refolded properly and is present in its active form.  We are thankful for the advise Prof. Dr. Bruno Moerschbacher (also see  integrated Human Practices ) gave us concerning NodB purification and the recommendation to use the acetic acid assay kit from Megazyme. After successfully purifying NodB, we would appreciate having the opportunity to share our results with his research group and eventually optimize our purification process. The many reaction steps of the kit result in somewhat inaccurate data. Additionally, we would need to try different acetic acid assay kits to evaluate the best one for our purpose. The measurement of background from NodB interaction with the assay reactions is another control, which is needed to be measured to complete our calculation.
At some point in the future, mass spectrometry is another point that has to be tackled as well. Retrospectively, hoping to achieve even better purification results, we would like to try to express nodB in colder conditions for about 40 hours  [3] . The expression at lower temperatures enables us to express nodB without the need of refolding from inclusion bodies.
COD -Vibrio Cholerae
Introduction
In order to bring more variability in our produced chitosans, we decided to implement a second chitin deacetylase. Because of its bacterial origin, we picked COD isolated from the gram-negative organism Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str. N16961  [10] . It is not part of its pathogenic activity. During our conversation with Professor Moerschbacher, he informed us that the expression of COD in E. coli has been successfully performed by himself and his group. In addition, it was already proven that both NodB and COD could be expressed in the same organism  [2] .
The cod gene is 1296 base pairs long and translates into a hydrolase with a molecular weight of approximately 45.5 kDa  [2] .

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"naE assembly construct was successful (proven by sequencing)
Expression Vektors:
Quantitative expression test with FACS scan. + Sequencing
Cloning of the intein protease construct was successful (proven by sequencing). Cloning of the test construct for the intein protease was not successful.
Development of a cloning strategy for the translocation tags and the SsrA degradation tag. The strategy was to clone these tags into pSB1C3 carrier plasmids containing BsaI sites to enable users of the registry of standard biological parts to easily clone these tags into intein assembly constructs by Golden Gate assembly.
Expression vektors:
Expression vectors were tested with facs after induction of 2h, 12h, 24h. Furthermore they were given to Aachen to be tested with their own designed fluorescence measurement device.
Primer order for the tags and a chitin binding domain (for the purufication tool)
Cloning of the tags was begun by attaching BsaI overhangs by PCR. Cloning of the carrier constructs was begun.
The PCR products of the tags (containing BsaI restriction sites) were cloned into the carrier constructs by Golden Gate assemby. Positive sequencing results.
Cloning of SspDnaB 2Gate assembly constructs was begun (SSpDnaB N, SspDnaB C, SspDnaB  N*, SspDnaB C*)
OmpA was cloned into a carrier construct as the last remaining tag.
OmpA cloning was successful.
Cloning of the SspDnaB assembly construct failed.
Cloning of the SspDnaB assembly consructs failed again. The mistake was the usage of a wrong template for the CPECs.
A new attempt was started.
The rest of the parts was successfully cloned into pSB1C3. Additionally, mRFP selection maker inserts were cloned into our pSBX vectors in order to fulfill the submission criteria.
Software for calculating the best path for semi-rigid linkers between the beginning and the end was started. At first a parser for PDB files was written in python. A calibration of lengths was made based on the C-alpha distances in the protein. The test whether the ends could be directly linked was inserted and it was decided how the general setup would be. The linkers will be stored in arrays of the points where the angles lie. A maximum linker would have 3 additional angles.
The function that sorts linkers out, if the angles don't fit was introduced. All the paths were generated,"

One thing our team would have really liked to have done was assist Rolla in characterizing their BioBricks, however both of our projects were   in their early stages of development. We hope to continue both projects and have wet lab collaborations with Rolla next year.
UIUC Illinois
Last year, our team was nominated for the Safety Commendations for our work with a concept we call “Safety Cases”.  Safety Cases is a proactive technique that use an organized combination of structural units to help build arguments that prove the root goal of a project is safe.  This year we tried to further develop Safety Cases by launching a website to help other iGEM teams build their own Safety Cases.  Promotion of our online tool was difficult since it was released late in the iGEM season. However, we were able to get our friends from UIUC Illinois to try out the website.  They created their own general Safety Case and gave us helpful feedback. You can read more about it on our Safety page.

UT-Tokyo-Software,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo-Software#Medal_-_-_TEXT.html," from which we received feedback.
For example, since their team's main project is similar to team Tokyo-Tech's 2011 one, they've searched with restriction: team:Tokyo-Tech and year:2011. This team & year restriction enabled them to obtain the desired parts quickly. And they decided which parts to use in important parts such as ArgBox and terminator.
Also, they gave us a lot of feedback. So, we took their comments into consideration.
The main points of improvement are:
Save the history of the words you've searched at the top of the page.
Add a link to Parts Registry's page.
*Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
・Sharing :
Our “ BioBrick Search ” allows you to search the desired BioBrick parts quickly.
This means that you can access the accumulated knowledge of past iGEM projects quite easily.
It also enables users to share the knowledge of BioBrick parts, which will result in determining the parts to use much easier.
・Human Practice :
Our educational software tutorials (“ BioBrick Puzzle ” and “ Gene Network Game ”) made synthetic biology easier to approach.
We think it would be beneficial in human practice, especially for beginners in that it could help them take part in the field much easier.
Also, these tutorials may be helpful when you want to give lessons in synthetic biology to newcomers. So, tutorials may expand the scope of synthetic biology.
*Develop and document a new technical standard that supports : the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
Our software, “ BioBrick Search ” allows the sharing of the information of BioBrick Parts information via internet.
Best Interaction with the Parts Registry
*Propose an alternate interaction with the registry. Clearly document this on your wiki in a page explicitly dedicated to this aspect of your tool. You should clearly show how to use this tool in a design flow used by experimental iGEM teams.
Our software, “ BioBrick Search ” propose an alternate interaction with the registry.
BioBrick Search improves PartsRegistry in that :
Search result is sorted by combination of 3 factors (reliability, relevance to your query and popularity)
Filters can be set by various conditions, such as year submitted, team name, category
->Users can obtain desired parts quickly.
User-friendly interface
->Users can easily know the parts information, such as which team used the parts.
Detailed explanations are here .
And the tutorial video explains how"
Austin_UTexas_LASA,2017,Team:Austin UTexas LASA#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,".
Add water (volume dependent on objective) directly to the column, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min.
Transfer the column to a clean microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 1 min to elute the DNA.
Gels & Gel Electrophoresis
Reagents:
TAE Buffer
~ 50 mL per gel, more necessary for electrophoresis chamber.
NF Agarose (generally Seakem LE)
Grams of agarose : mL buffer = percentage of gel
Ethidium Bromide
~ 1 drop
**Don’t forget ladder.
Protocol (gel):
Mix the TAE buffer and agarose once measured in microwavable flask. Stir with stir bar in flask and magnetic stirrer.
Afterwards, microwave for 1-3 mins until agarose is completely dissolved.
Pause the microwave if the solution starts bubbling over, then stir the solution by slightly shaking the flask, and put the flask in the microwave again.
Let the flask cool until it is cool enough to carry with the orange heat “gloves.”
Add ethidium bromide and let gel solidify (10 - 20 min). Remember combs.
Usually, use the gel for gel electrophoresis right away, but if needed, the gel can be stored in a container filled with TAE buffer and 1-2 drops of ethidium bromide.
Protocol (gel electrophoresis):
Add reagents together (always at least ladder and sample).
This can occur in PCR tubes or parafilm.
# bp ladder - 2 uL
Loading dye - 4 uL (1:3.5 ratio)
Water - 8 uL
Sample - volume depends on objective. Remember: try to have at least 50 ng to visualize on gel.
Loading dye - 1:3 ratio with sample.
Place the gel in the gel tray in the gel electrophoresis chamber and fill with TAE buffer to max line.
Since DNA is negatively charged, the wells should be near the positive end (black) and DNA will “run to red.”
Put the ladder and sample(s) in the wells with the ladder in Well 1, etc. Close the chamber properly, and run the gel electrophoresis chamber at 100 - 130 V.
Wait for about 30 minutes before stopping the gel electrophoresis chamber and removing the gel tray.
Place the gel in the Gel Imager (UV Light) next to the computer that will show the image. Run the program “Ethidium Bromide” to see"

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html,"-canonical codon assignments: the amino acid-codon groupings can by specified in whatever way the user wants in the codon distribution file.
When executed, DoubleOptimizer will first display the input sequence with repetitive regions highlighted. It will also give the fraction of the sequence that initially consists of repetitive regions (defined by default as regions of 8 nucleotides or more that occur more than once in the sequence, including as their reverse complement), and a chi-squared value for the goodness-of-fit to the desired codon distribution (lower is better).
DoubleOptimizer will then compute and display the optimized sequence (By default, it will produce the best sequence it can find after 10 seconds of computation time). Again, repetitive regions will be highlighted, and the same measurements of repetitiveness and codon fit will be given.
The following optional flags may be used to change the program's behavior:
-A
This allows for an amino-acid sequence, specified in single-letter code, to be used as input instead of a DNA sequence. The initial sequence statistics displayed will be for a uniform random reverse translation of the given amino acid sequence.
Example:
java -jar DoubleOptimizer.jar aaseq.txt codons.txt -A
-T##
This allows the user to specify, in seconds, a different run-time for the program other than the default 10 seconds. While 10 seconds should be sufficient to produce a well-optimized result for most genes of moderate length on modern desktop computers, longer times may produce better-optimized results on slower machines or on longer sequences.
Example:
java -jar DoubleOptimizer.jar aaseq.txt codons.txt -A -T30
-L##
This allows the user to specify a different minimum length for what is considered a repeat, other than the default 8 nucleotides.
Example:
java -jar DoubleOptimizer.jar seq.txt codons.txt -L7 -T15
-S##, -E##
These allow the user to specify the starting and ending nucleotide, respectively, of the coding region in a construct sequence to be sythesized. Nucleotides outside this frame will be ignored for codon usage optimization, and will never be modified. This option is useful for preventing repetitions, within the coding region, of fixed sequences that occur at the ends of a construct to be sythesized, outside of the coding region. The default values are the beginning of the sequence, and the end of the last complete codon. These options may be used together or independently. Values are one-indexed. If used with ''-A'', these will be interpreted as amino acid indices.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html,"fiI restriction site we added to the primers could be avoiding the annealing, so we designed new primers where some nucleotides of the SfiI restriction site were part of the complementary region of the primers and others without the SfiI tail to have a positive control for the amplification.
Mini-prepping. I repeatedly had problems to get highly concentrated plasmid preparations. I used mini-prep kits, so I did not know what my mistake was. I tried different kits and Fernan supervised my work one day, but the error was not obvious. By the end of the week, when one of the solutions of the kit ran out and I had to change it, my mini-preps started to rise their concentration.
Not amplifying resistance cassettes. I tried to amplify kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance cassettes from pSB4K5 and pSB1C3 vectors, but after three PCR reactions changing conditions I did not get an useful PCR product.
Preparing BioBricks to insert them into mini-Tn7. I set up inocula, did mini-preps of the plasmids and digested them with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. The next step would be isolate from gel, but the concentration was too low to use the fragments for cloning; so I repeated the digestions with high amounts of DNA, but the results were similar. I need mini-preps with higher DNA concentrations.
Synthetizing a portable attTn7. I performed two PCR reactions changing dNTPs concentration and annealing temperature to amplify the insertion site of the Tn7 transposon from the E. coli chromosome, but I did not get any amplification. I preformed this process as a colony PCR (picking a colony to get the DNA template), so next week I will try to amplify the desire region of the E. coli chromosome by purifying the genomic DNA first.
Working on our own-designed mini-Tn7. I performed the first necessary steps to do with a synthesis order: resuspending, transformation in DH5α, plating, setting up inocula and mini-prepping (this was one of the mini-preps of the last day so I got a highly concentrated preparation).

The Perceived Dangers Associated with Gene Technology and Creating Artificial Life
With the rapid advances and the high impact of molecular biology in our lives, it is extremely important to be aware of the consequences science has on society and our environment. Scientists do most of their work in enclosed laboratories and following strict guidelines governed by regulatory bodies (in Australia the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator - OGTR). Though regulations dictate the containment of all genetically modified organisms (GMOs), there have been several cases in which GMO's have been unintentionally released.
For these reasons we were interested in collaborating with Penn State who undertook a survey on the perceptions of Synthetic Biology in society and the acceptance of GMO's in our everyday lives. Societal perceptions will continue to change as biotechnology increasing is rolled forward to deliver greater outcomes to mankind and such surveys are important benchmarks to these changes in perceptions and practices.
The RMIT 2010 iGEM team is attempting to create a biological system that will produce therapeutic peptides at a low economic cost. A biological machine will be created that uses an inactivated thermostable polymerase as a carrier protein with an attached desired peptide - in our case a therapeutic peptide. There are several safety concerns when undergoing this project that we have addressed:
Our project involves working with polymerases, which are proteins found in all living organisms and are involved in the process of DNA replication. More specifically Taq polymerase (found in the Archeon Thermus aquaticus), being a revolutionary enzyme in the field of molecular biology due to its thermostability, was the focus of our work. The immediate danger is a bacterium containing a Taq plasmid part escaping into the environment and altering the genetic material of many organisms. RMIT team has reduced these dangers by creating mutations that will not allow this protein to bind to DNA or undertake polymerase activity.
The chosen peptides that are being ligated with the Taq polymerase are Losartan and arginine vasopressin. Losartan is a peptide that reduces blood pressure as an antagonist of the angiotensin system. This peptide is safe if not ingested intentionally for harmful purposes as recognised by drug and therapeutic agencies world wide.
The second peptide is arginine vasopressin (AVP), commonly known as antidiuretic hormone. It is associated with water, glucose and salt regulation in the"

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Community_-_-_TEXT.html," were approached by the UCLouvain team from Belgium. It happened to be that one of their team members was on an exchange in the University of Helsinki, so we met and talked. We told as well as we could how our team was assembled the first time and what problems the first team had had. We talked about financing the project, choosing the project subject and about founding an organization to help with the financial side. Hopefully our tips were helpful and UCLouvain has had a great time in iGEM!
Thanks to the Stockholm conference we made good friends with the other Nordic iGEM teams and got to do a small collaboration with the Uppsala team. They asked for general information and methods for working with yeast, since they knew from our NiC presentation that our project involved S. cerevisiae . We had a Skype meeting with them and sent our protocols.
EPF Lausanne team contacted us regarding a collaboration project they were planning to do which was somewhat related to our CollabSeeker. They wanted to create a platform, in the form of a blog or website, on which they could present iGEM teams and projects through “news articles”.  We informed them about the CollabSeeker, and their reaction was positive. We ended up giving them an interview via Skype, telling more about our search engine and answering questions to the survey they had prepared.
We also got in touch with a few other teams. We shared information about ourselves and CollabSeeker for XMU-China team’s exchange platform – Newsletter.
We had a Skype meeting with TEC CEM team and shared information about our teams as well as projects. The team, which is from Mexico, didn’t know that we had a true mexican in our team, and finding out about this was really fun for both teams.
We also helped METU HS Ankara team who wanted to create a database consisting of protocols in different language. We helped them to achieve their goal by translating our protocols into Finnish. The protocols were about Transformation, LB Broth, LB Agar, ONC, Competent Cell Preparation by Calcium Chloride, Getting the DNA Parts from the Kit Plate, Mini Prep Plasmid Isolation and Plasmid Isolation.
Founding an iGEM organization
As this was the third year Aalto-Helsinki competed in iGEM, we decided that it was time to strengthen the continuity of the team and also provide basis for an Aalto-Helsinki community. This is why we founded an organization called Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry, for all the members of the previous years’ and the present"

Macquarie_Australia,2018,Team:Macquarie Australia#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," survey
A survey created by the Macquarie University iGEM team was sent to other iGEM teams to provide us with an insight into the resources used for the human practices component of their project. As seen on the map above, teams from around the world completed our survey and using their feedback, our team was able to incorporate this data for our customer discovery toolkit. Furthermore, we responded to several other teams’ surveys, many of which completed our own survey, in an attempt to aid them with their own projects.
UNSW symposium
We would like to thank the UNSW iGEM team for organising an event that provided the Macquarie University iGEM team with the opportunity to present our project for the first time. Hearing from other teams and scientists that spoke on the panel gave us a better understanding of our project and how we could improve before we present it at the jamboree.
Virtual Conference
iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi ran a virtual conference which enabled 6 iGEM teams (iGEM HKUST, iGEM Rec Chennai, iGEM VIT, iGEM Saint Joseph, iGEM NYU Abu Dhabi and iGEM Macquarie) to virtually meet one another to discuss their projects. The event had an emphasis on questions and discussion of each project. The conference gave us a chance to learn from other teams and discuss any issues that were unclear to help each team throughout their journey.
Additional Collaborations
iGEM Macquarie was contacted by a couple of teams asking to send science related photos to unite the science community from different countries. Two of the main highlights were when  iGEM TecMonterrey GDL asked us to take a photo with a sign showing how far away we were from the Jamboree, showing that ‘science is everywhere’ and when iGEM Estonia created a huge mosaic of photos showing fashion in the lab.

Two members of our team went to the iGEM Team Groningen to perform microarray analyses. With this approach we tried to identify novel c-di-AMP-dependent regulatory elements that control gene expression in B. subtilis.
Two members of our team with the Groningen iGEM Team.
We found several interesting candidate genes that seemed to be regulated by intracellular c-di-AMP among them ydaO, a gene that has been recently shown to be controlled by a c-di-AMP-dependent “riboswitch”.
This is Sam who prepares the RNA for microarray analyses.
Besides the lab work, we were also interested what Groningen has to offer during the night. So the Groningen team took our two members to a night out through the nightlife of Groningen.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Public Engagement
Overview
Keeping in line with the principles of synthetic biology, we aimed to make our research accessible to all members of society through the development of a range of educational resources. Many of the misconceptions and scepticism of synthetic biology are the result of a lack of public understanding of the field and the inability of researchers and industries to “initiate open discussions”. Our initial outreach activities involved the delivery of lessons and workshops for summer school students, and we drew upon the feedback from these activities to plan further outreach events and resources designed for a larger target audience. Equally, these activities enabled us to assess the level of knowledge that the public have about synthetic biology, and discover their opinions about this emerging research field and, more specifically, our project.
The design of our educational programmes were guided by the synthetic biology educational aims outlined by Kuddell et al (2007):
Encourage students to precisely and carefully articulate their views
Raise controversial issues and encourage debate
Address the issues of security, safety and ownership
Be realistic about what synthetic biology has the potential to do
Summer Schools
An important and accessible platform for increasing public knowledge is to educate school children, so we ran workshops at four summer schools in Oxford:
Northwest Science Network Summer School (16-17 year old students interested in a broad range of science subjects)
UNIQ (16-17 year old state school students interested in biochemistry)
Pembroke Science Summer School (16-17 year old students interested in different science subjects)
Oxford Summer Courses (13-16 year old international students)
Our initial summer school classes were targeted at 16-17 year old students studying STEM subjects and with an interest in pursuing these subjects at university. Upon planning our educational resources for summer schools, we sought guidance from current teachers to ensure that the activities were tailored to the right level of understanding and delivered in an engaging format. We worked on developing activities that would appeal to the interests of a young audience, as well as making the activities as interactive as possible. We believed that it"

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," lies in achieving the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates).
What we do
Based on the above, this is the main content of our modeling:     • We establish a differential equation model based on the system mechanism described above. As is partly veriﬁed by our wet lab , we quantitatively prove that the maximum of dynamic range can be reached by changing the production rates of PC and TC chains[1] and demonstrate how to do it.   • For the high background noise from wet lab results, the model above successfully explains why the excessively high chain production rates enhance background noise. Furthermore, we provide a method, that can be used in further experiment, to simultaneously achieve greater saturated output and lower background noise.   • We also establish a model based on birth-death process, so that we quantitatively prove that the dynamic range is negatively correlated with protease cleavage ability under normal condition, which gives a explicit guidance on further experiment.   • Furthermore, We advance the birth-death process to a more general continuous-time Markov chain, which demonstrate that it is feasible to increase system efﬁciency by changing binding abilities, as long as we design a dedicated degradation pathway of free TC chains without transcription factor. What’s more,we obtain a method to improve system efﬁciency while preventing system saturation output from decreasing. This will be one of the ideas for our further experiment.
Production rates
Introduction
In the wet experiment, we can control the expression rates of TC chain and PC chain by regulating the content of plasmids transferred into the cells, and then indirectly control the quantitative ratio of the two chains on the membrane. Although the expression rate and the number of receptor chains are not strictly proportional, there is no doubt that there is a positive correlation between them.   We establish a system of differential equations that can reflect the reaction mechanism of the entire system in detail and use it to quantitatively prove that the dynamic range can be improved by changing the production rates of PC and TC chains, under normal condition. In addition, via the model, we provide a specific method of changing the two values mentioned above.    In the first place, we assume the operation of the system can be described by a seire of chemical equations, and obtain the corresponding differential equations, through law of mass action. The production rates of the two chains can be balanced with a dilution rate that all substances in the system have, so the system can reach a stable state after a while. The initial differential equations and a simulation with appropriate parameters are both shown in Figure "
