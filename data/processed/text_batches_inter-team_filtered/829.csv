Though all the three promoters are from the same constitutive promoter family, their promoter strengths are different. According to the Part Registry, the promoter strengths of BBa_J23101, BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23117 are 1791 au, 1185 au and 162 au respectively. This could be the main reason for causing the great difference of the GFP produced. Overall, the results obtained was reasonable.

DryLab - Vesicles creation
Main | Introduction | Vesicle model | Delay model | Fec simulation
The lipid surface conformation
The Lipid conformation of the outer membrane is a well known problem: at 35°c the lipid bilayer behaves like a liquid which conformation character is ruled by an energy called the bending energy. This energy represents the fact that the lipid bilayer will search a special conformation depending on the shape and the chemical properties of its constituents. In order to explain the way lipids organize together we need an expression for the membrane bending energy. This is given by :
E is the energy of a whole lipid bilayer (or monolayer). Kb and Kg are Bending and Gaussian moduli which can be obtained by experiments. γ0 is the intrinsic curvature of the outer membrane which describes the local form of a lipid bilayer when it is at is lowest state of energy ,the more stable. γm  and Hg are the mean curvature and the gaussian curvature( see Helfrich [Z. Naturforsch. C 28 (1973) 693] ). dS is a surface infinitesimal element and the previous formula relates how the local surface energy varies with the local mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature. Let us first calculate the energy of two different shapes of membranes,  (i) a model of the shape of E. coli before budding, and (ii) after budding of a vesicle.
(i) We consider the shape of E.coli as a cylinder of radius r =0.3.
This is a simplified shape based on the heuristic fact that in septa where the vesicle will be constituted principally with lipids of higher bending energy.  In fact this model is just a first approach to determine range of parameters and could be developed in a more sophisticated way later.The aim of this first representation is to estimate this energy in the division region of E.coli before division. With this approximation γm = 1/2r.
Thus for the E.coli lipids membrane the bending energy per aera is:
(ii) For the vesicles we consider their basic shape as a sphere of rayon r’ so the bending energy by lipid area units is:
Thus as the area of a sphere is known and is independent of the location on the surface we can write:
The energy of the same membrane area in E.coli is:
The relations can provide a basic vision"

Results
Used 1% e-gel, with 0.5 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 E-gel image of ICA 6- and 9-mer from elution and from PCR with post-elution primers. The expected product for 6-mer is 706 bp. The expected product for 9-mer is 1018 bp.
The resolution of this gel is somewhat too low to accurately size bands. We will run on a higher percentage gel later.
Elution products show nothing, but there are products after PCR amplification.
The presence of multiple bands may indicate non-specific amplification, or improper ICA.
Plan on doing temperature testing, and more troubleshooting.
Extension time was a bit short for a 9-mer."

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," amplification attempt, we used Touchdown PCR and used increasing concentrations of yeast cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Still no results.
Week of August 6th
Overview
Gibson Assembly
Gene Amplification
Riboswitch

So many people are in the lab now! Because so many of our small lab teams have transitioned to lab work, the “Yeast Parents”, or team in charge of maintaining the yeast and the lab, gave everyone a tour of the space to keep everything organized (and keep us all in line).
Unfortunately, with great numbers of people in lab comes great margin for mistake. We burnt through a ridiculous amount of Q5 polymerase this week because we miscommunicated the concentrations needed to perform PCR. However, the team took this as a learning experience and practiced concentration math and master-mix-making. We are also going to begin a crowdfunding campaign to supplement the team funds when/if errors arise in the future.
Outreach is really cool! Three of us, plus our PI (of course), spoke to Martyn Smith, Managing Director of the Family Planning 2020 Secretariat, over the phone. He nearly gave us heart attacks when he offered to help us reach local agents familiar with the regulatory environments in the countries we wanted our project to extend to. Aside from the FP2020 call, two of our members have been diligently working on outreach at home. They’ve started to develop a game as an interactive way for high schoolers to join in when we present our project to them later this month.
After double checking that we were using the right volumes for our PCR reaction, we were able to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2. We then confirmed this by running it on a 1% agarose gel seen below.
We ran OE PCR reactions without primers for all five genes but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes. We discovered that the master-mix concentration was too high for all of the reactions we had performed, so we changed the amount of master-mix in each reaction to ensure the concentration was 1X rather than 2X. After changing the master-mix concentration, we ran more OE PCR reactions without primers and selected certain reactions with the least amount of nonspecific bands for templates in our regular PCR reactions.
Our over-the-weekend cultures had little growth after 24 hours, but showed adequate growth come Monday morning. After discussing this with other teammates, we found it was most likely due to improper aeration of our samples, which were stored upright with a tight cap in the incubator. We then performed a plasm"

Enzyme checking :
Because we had no results with the latest cloning session, we tested our enzymes. We tried to digest each site individually. We obtained linearized plasmid. So, enzymes are well working.
Cloning session :
Biobricks which require an RBS and have the same antibiotic resistance as RBS plasmid, were transfered on pSB1AC3 plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance :
TetR
LuxR
LuxI
LacI
GFP
Lycopen
Fha1 was also transfered on pSB1AT3 plasmid to simplify selection of the right constructions.
Digestions :
A gel checking of the restriction results were performed.

Having been fascinated by the intracellular world since my first ever biology class, a synthetic biology competition seems like a logical sequel. By participating in the competition I hope to further improve my collaboration and lab skills. Next to that it's just really fun to have your own little research group running.

Since my enrollment as a Biomedical Engineering bachelor student at the TU/e, I have thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of subjects involved in this study. Being an extraordinary and internationally reknown challenge, participation in iGEM allows me to dive into the interesting discipline of Synthetic Biology, which I consider to continue for my Master's. Furthermore, our iGEM project offers valuable opportunities to improve my lab skills, while also enabling me to learn about the entire pathway from fundamental research to functional clinical applications.

Maarten Merkx (1970) studied chemistry (cum laude) at the Radboud University Nijmegen specializing in organic chemistry (Prof. Nolte) and biophysical chemistry (Prof. de Grip). He did his PhD with Prof. Bruce A. Averill (University of Amsterdam, 1995-1999) studying metalloenzyme catalysis and was a Human Frontier of Science Program (HFSP) post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Stephen J. Lippard (MIT, Cambridge, USA) studying methane monooxgenases. In his scientific work he combines a fundamental interest in the molecular origin of biomolecular recognition with a strong desire to apply and test this knowledge through the engineering of protein-based tools that allow the imaging of molecular processes in live cells or organisms. An important research theme is to develop generic engineering concepts for the construction of protein switches and apply these as sensors and regulators for intracellular imaging, synthetic biology and molecular diagnostics. In 2006 he was awarded both a young investigator grant from the HFSP and a VIDI award by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO).

Figure 1. A helical wheel representation of the IAAL E3/K3 coiled-coil heterodimer viewed as a cross-section based off of a similar figure created by Litowski and Hodges (2002). The peptide chain propagates into the page from the N to the C terminus. Hydrophobic interactions between the coils are indicated by the clear wide arrows. The intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the coils are displayed by the thin curved arrow (eg. Between Glu15 and Lys20)Letters a, b, c,and d designate the positions of IAAL repeat in the heptapeptide. THe e and g positions are occupied by the charged residues.
Based off of results from previous ferritin fusions (Kim et al., 2011) it was decided that a linker sequence was needed between the coils and their respective proteins to prevent any steric hindrance due to the size of the ferritin and TALE proteins. A flexible glycine rich linker lacking protease cut sites was selected from the registry ( BBa_K157013 )
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
We continued to perform literature searches this week for our project. This week our main focus was on determining ways we could characterize our coils and finding additional useful properties of coils. Many papers make use of circular dichroism in order to detect if the coils are able to bind to each other.  This technique requires the use of a spectropolarimeter and a fair amount of knowledge to complete so it may not be the most ideal technique in our situation given the timelines we are working on. Another option consists of using FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) to measure the binding of the coils. The idea is to have an individual fluorophore attached to each coil so that when the coils are bound the process of FRET can occur and light emission will be observed from the fluorescent protein that is having energy being transferred to it from the other fluorescent protein (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008). This technique can be difficult to perform however so it will likely be maintained as a backup characterization technique.
One interesting properties of coils is that they are sensitive to acidic pH levels (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008). This warrants examination once we have our coils complete and purified as a protein as this pH sensitivity could be problematic for our system or it may act as a benefit.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Project#Detector#EngineeredTALEs_-_-_TEXT.html," is fused to a ferritin nanoparticle, which in turn is fused to eleven other TALEs. So the mobile TALE has to be able to keep a very large complex in place when it binds to the DNA. Thus, if our TALEs do not bind strongly to the DNA, the system would produce false negatives.
To increase the binding affinity of the TALEs, we picked the pyrimidine-rich regions of the Stx2 gene. The relative binding affinity of different RVDs to their respective nucleotides is as follows: NG(1)> NN (0.18) ~ HD (0.16) >> NI (0.0016)> NK(0.00016). NG, NN, HD, NI, and NK bind to T, G, C, A, and G, respectively (Meckler et al. 2013). Therefore, picking regions rich in Thymidines and Cystidines would dramatically increase the binding affinity of the TALE to the DNA segment. Although NN also has a relatively high binding affinity, it was avoided as much as possible, as NN can also bind Adenine and therefore decrease specificity.
Another important factor in picking the target sequences of the two TALEs was the distance between the two. The distance has to be far enough so that the proteins fused to one TALE would not block the target sequence of the other TALE. With that in mind, we tried to pick two target sequences that are as close to each other as possible; DNA can get sheared into smaller pieces due to physical factors, or it can get cut by endonucleases. In order for our system to detect an EHEC, the two regions of DNA that the TALEs bind to must remain attached together. Therefore, we picked target sequences as close to each other as possible to decrease the chances of a cut between the two target sites.
The TALEs were designed to be extremely specific. Based on the considerations explained above, a number of possible target sites were selected. To find out the most specific pair, we conducted some BLAST searches on each TALE target sequence separately. As expected, we observed a huge number of alignments with EHEC strains. We also found out some partial alignments in non-EHEC organisms that were screened to find out if they can be problematic. Lets call the two selected target sites [1] and [2]. If [1] had a 90% alignment to a region in the Homo Sapiens genome, we checked to see if [2] can also be found in Homo S"

Integrated Biosensors for the Detection of Chromium and Lead
Water pollution has become a rising problem in Lake Michigan as more and more contaminants are accidentally or illegally dumped. In 2017, U.S. Steel dumped 300 pounds of hexavalent chromium, a carcinogen, into the lake. Yet, very little is being done to raise citizen awareness or to combat the negative effects these spills have on the ecosystem. Thus, the goal of this project is to create a paper-based assay that detects whether chromium or lead is present in a given water supply. For each metal, there are two plasmids; one that produces a repressor protein while the other constitutively produces GFP. With this combination, the repressor interferes with the production of GFP until the specified heavy metal is present, resulting in a fluorescent output. The benefit of creating an easy-to-use sensor is that it empowers everyday citizens to test their water and become aware of its quality.

Project significance
MetaSense is a cell-free biosensor designed to detect and respond to the presence of toxic lead and hexavalent chromium in water. By producing this sensor on a platform available to citizens, we hope to include the public in scientific processes, ultimately giving them a greater sense of control over their well-being. Additionally, individuals will be able to proactively screen their water supply, resulting in less instances of unsafe contaminant concentrations. .

envZ – YFP Control (Light / Dark)
At 50 minute time intervals 200μl of each sample was taken and mixed with 800μl of sterile water in plastic cuvettes. The optical density of each sample was taken after the spectrophotometer was set with a sample of 200μl of sterile LB and 800μl water as a control, as was the luminescence, with readings for the background luminescence being taken for the sample of LB and water.
Two readings for each sample at each time interval were taken and then an average was calculated for each time interval for both optical density and luminescence.
For each sample at each time interval the average luminescence (normalised by the background luminescence) was divided by the optical density and plotted on a graph, shown below as Figure 2.

Aliquots were taken every hour of the cultures which were set up as before,100μl of ONs were used to inoculate two sterile LB + 40mg/ml Cml making up a total volume of 4ml in 5ml flasks which were then incubated in both light and dark, at 37C with shaking, as follows:</p>
JM109 – RLS.lacZ.YFP (Light/Dark)
envZ – RLS.lacZ.YFP (Light/Dark)
JM109 – RLS.lacZ (Light/Dark)
JM109 - lacZ Control (Light/Dark)
For each sample at each of the time points, Abs420 / reaction time was calculated and plotted onto a graph, shown below.

Munich,2017,Team:Munich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"insically Disordered Proteins(TDPs) to test them with our purified Cas13a, to check its activity and stability when used together with TDPs. From our team, Dawa did the characterization of the TDPs that were sent by the team TU Delft.  Both our teams were using Cas13a but from different strains. Our team mostly used Leptrotricia buccalis and Leptrotricia wadei Cas13a for our experiments. We did also tried the Leptrotricia shahi but we could not purify it properly for our experiments. Team TU Delft used the Leptroticia shahi Cas13a for their experiments.
During the characterization of the TDPs, Team TU Delft found that whenever their Cas13a was dried in combination with a TDP of the type CAHS, the resuspended Cas13a would start cleaving RNA even in absence of the target RNA, hence losing its specificity.  We therefore did the characterization of the TDPs they provided with our Cas13a (Lbu) and repeated the exact same drying experiment with the CAHS protein, in order to corroborate our results and to find the cause of such an unexpected outcome. As observed in figure 1, we also got the same unexpected results when Cas13a was dried with CAHS TDP.

iGEM BOKU Vienna
Michael and Julian from the iGEM BOKU Vienna Team came to our lab to run some experiments on 4th and 5th of October. Their iGEM project is called D.I.V.E.R.T. (Directed in vivo evolution via reverse transcription) and they are trying out new strategies for in vivo evolution which shows potential advantages over classical in vitro methods. For this they used yeast and E.coli to demonstrate their concept. They used the flow cytometer in our lab to better characterize their constructs from E.coli and S. cerevisiae. One of our lab members explained them how to use the flow cytometer and also provided them the necessary help. It was a long day work for them but at the end they collected positive results. We also had a small gathering in the evening before they left together with the last year´s iGEMers who came to meet us. We were very happy to have them in our lab and to get to know each other's team.

Business Proposal
While the initial research and funding possibilities are considerable, approval for and production of the bandage are only likely via several avenues. Here, we examine the possibilities associated with introduction of the bandage through standard clinical trials and the faster-track of the military.
Initial Research and Funding
Academic
The initial research would involve proof of concept of 1. The efficacy of the natural phage cocktail in combating the bacterial infection in vitro, and, 2. The thermostability and efficacy of the cocktail once encapsulated within the silk bandage. This research should be possible to complete as a Masters or PhD thesis – that is to say, within 2 to 4 years – as the techniques and methods are well-known and natural phages are being employed. Natural phages can be isolated, tested for efficacy, and cultured within a week. While the cocktail will take longer to fully develop, conclusion of this portion of the research can be expected within several months. Once initially developed, the remainder of the time would be spent modifying encapsulation methods to enhance the thermostability and controlled release of the phages from within the silk bandage to the wound site and adjusting the cocktail for enhanced efficacy.
Private
Assuming the research is to be conducted privately, the anticipated cost of outfitting a lab and securing all necessary supplies would be ~$300,000 – $150,000 for equipment and materials, $150,000 for day-to-day supplies over the course of the anticipated three years. This does not include payment for three project members which can be estimated at $250,000 per year – $100,000 for the project manager, $75,000 per employee. Thus, over the course of three years, the estimated costs total $1,000,000.
This funding could be raised by investments from venture capital or investment firms, through grants, and/or with the assistance of a larger biotechnology or pharmaceutical company. Several possible grant options include: the MassChallenge Accelerator, OneStart challenge, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants, Department of Defense (DOD) grants, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants.

For the past three years, the United States Department of Defense (DOD) has been offering grants for bandages which can easily applied to combat wounds and will aid infection prevention. While the phage cocktail would need to be altered for"
British_Columbia,2018,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we would accurately and precisely receive the information we need through an interview and efficiently conduct several when writing our journal piece.
R: Interview James was extremely insightful as he provided several pieces of advice on creating an article. This interview allowed us to pause and understand where the navigation of our journal article was going to. As he emphasized public interest, our main reflection from this interview was the aspect of enticing the public in terms of our hook and our title. This interview served as a fundamental step in producing a journal article about our iGEM project.
E: Throughout our interview we were given tips to alter our approach of journalism. Firstly, he introduced a new method of writing which is called “Front Loading”. Front Loading is using exciting and important information in the introduction of the article and allowing information that does not directly pertain to the article at the conclusion. Essentially he described it as writing an article with the hope that readers read until the end, but the expectation that readers will not. Therefore, we were amazed to learn that articles incorporate marketing tactics to serve the information to the appropriate readers. Additionally, James informed us about how to appropriately approach contacting individuals within a scientific field in hopes of writing an article about them. He mentioned several probing questions if the conversation is stagnant and how to direct it if the conversation is going on a tangent. This was extremely informative to us because before this interview, when conducting interviews there were patches in the interview that were uncomfortable and/or hard to overcome. Thus, the few pointers he provided us was definitely appreciated.
A: We will use the advice James Vogl provided us and use that when constructing our journalism piece. Additionally, we are able to transfer this knowledge to the next year iGEM teams if they want to curate a an article outlining their project. Finally, when writing our wiki this serves as a great stepping stone as we are able to apply certain writing tips James shared with us to the wiki page.
DR. KATHERINE WHITE
UBC professor at Sauder School of Business, Marketing and Behavioural Science Division
A: We reached out to Dr. White in hopes of gaining insight into how social media, celebrity culture, and the internet in general influences the marketing of pseudoscience products and consumers’ choices. A specific example we wanted to discuss was Goop, which is a personal health company founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, whose products are based on shoddy scientific principles that have been repeatedly debunked.

Week Seven   13/7 - 19/7
Thank you Shield Scientific!
Sponsors, collaboration, researching indicators, updating our supervisors and some serious Beyond the Bench work sums up week seven. This week we have been busy contacting various companies and organisations in order to make them aware of our project and also determine if they would be willing to send us equipment. Armed with nothing but a list of email addresses and a mass of doughnuts we went email crazy. Overall we had a great response! Hopefully next week we will be the proud owners of SHIELDskin Orange Nitrile gloves to protect us in the lab WHILST looking pretty damn good. Fingers crossed we may be able to borrow a fancy microplate reader too. Wednesday we gave a presentation to our supervisor team in order to update them on the progress of all aspects of the project.
On Thursday we had a meeting with Paul James, our supervisor, to discuss the sequences of DNA we have designed for our toehold switch. Everything seemed to be in order, meaning we will be able to go ahead and order our DNA early next week. I’m sure the lab team who focussed on designing our toehold switches will be grateful to have a break from using NUPACK and UGENE for a while. However, the work never stops. Researching a wide range of indicators to incorporate into our toehold switch has taken a priority. Comparing the benefits of using a fluorescent protein compared with chromoproteins in both the lab and 'field' environment means a number of toeholds, all varying in indicator sequence, are currently being designed.
The Beyond the Bench side of our project is something we as a team believe has great potential. Understanding the extremely complex nature of eradicating TB in the UK, especially the South West, is challenging and rewarding. Collaborating with vets, farmers, politicians and academics will hopefully allow us to make a significant impact with this project.
Campus was alive this week with the sound of graduation! Seeing staff, students, parents and academics all dressed smartly created an atmosphere so infectious that we as a team decided to head into town on Tuesday and celebrate also. Honestly, the masses of free champagne had nothing to do with it. We had a great night and bumped into iGEM alumni on the dancefloor, they seemed approving of how we have taken to the challenge they laid down last year!

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

The interview of the catering industry manager
Q: Is the pest in the dining hall serious now? What is the main reason of the damage by pests?
A: It’s quite hard to prevent the pest but it’s under control now. As season changes, flies come frequently. Besides, our dining hall is close to a golf club, which kills pests like cockroachs and flies regularly.Meanwhile, cockroaches and other pests may be drived to the dining hall that make our work harder. Additionally, since suppliers can’t use a large quantity of pesticides to kill the pest, what we buy from them will contain some unknown spawns.
Q: What is the main way to prevent pest here?
A: First of all, there will be a staff reasonable for killing the pests around the canteen, dormitory as well as the trash bin every day. The committee of our school also hires someone professional to kill the pest regularly. What’s more, we will not purchase the vegetable that easily get damaged by pests, and it will be washed with salty water.
Q: How much does canteen spend in killing pests?
A: All in all, the school pays for it, and our aim is to make sure what we buy is safe and healthy for students. People work in our canteen work together to keep it clean, our buyer chooses some reliable suppliers, and the stuffs for washing vegetable pick out the pest inside carefully.
Q: Do you think it’s possible to kill the pests completely by doing what you mentioned just now?
A: Nobody can promise that the pest can be killed totally, but we are making the effort to control it.
Q: As we know, the canteen is using some chemical and physical methods, what do you think of using a biological way to kill the cockroach like fungus infection. Do you think it might work?
A: You need to know that canteen is not the laboratory, we are responsible for teachers and students’ health. Therefore, what we use in canteen should meet the specification and the law.We also need to get the permission of school if we use the way to kill the pests.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

BACTRICITY: Bacterial Biosensors with Electrical Output
The metabolically versatile bacterium Shewanella oneidensis adapts to anaerobic environments by transporting electrons to its exterior, reducing a variety of environmental substrates. When grown anaerobically and provided with lactate as a carbon source, S. oneidensis transfers electrons to an electrode of a microbial fuel cell. We sought to engineer S. oneidensis to report variations in environmental conditions through changes in current production. A previous study has shown that S. oneidensis mutants deficient in the mtrB gene produce less current than the wildtype strain, and that current production in these mutants can be restored by the addition of exogenous mtrB. We attempted to control current production in mtrB knockouts by introducing mtrB on lactose, tetracycline, and heat inducible systems. These novel biosensors integrate directly with electrical circuits, paving the way for the development of automated, biological measurement and reporter systems.
Experimental overview
We attempted to develop three inducible systems for electrical current production in S. oneidensis. The first is a chemically inducible system, where LacI or TetR repression of the current-production gene expression in mtrB knock-out (KO) S. oneidensis can be alleviated by the addition of IPTG or anhydrotetracycline, respectively. Our second approach uses temperature-senstive cI which would allow for an increase in electrical output in response to heat. The third is a light-inducible system based on the 2005 UT Austin biological camera.
Using the LacI system, we attempted to interact with engineered S. oneidensis in multiple anaerobic microbial fuel cells which we built, measuring the effects of IPTG on current production in wild type and mtrB KO S. oneidensis containing plasmids expressing inducible or constitutive mtrB.
Results
Wildtype vs. mtrB deficient S. oneidensis
Overview: By genetically manipulating S. oneidensis, it has been found that noticeable differences of current production can be"

Wechat Subscription Account
Only lectures are not enough to advocate synthetic biology. For idea to penetrate into everyday lives, we have to immerse people in the knowledge by publishing articles every week. We chose Wechat subscription account, a platform for professionals to spread ideas, as the media to deliver our ideas to people when they are scanning daily news or replying friends’ messages. We want people to gain synthetic biological knowledge easily and delightfully.
By making full use of this account, we successfully introduce the basic concept of synthetic biology, promote iGEM competition, and present our team project. We transformed complicated biological knowledge into simpler ideas or similes. More than 350 people subscribe us and the amount of reading in nearly each article exceeds 200. Lots of students around us demonstrate their interest to us in synthetic biology after reading our articles. We felt heartily joyful when we see our articles shared by others and when many students asked us how they could join the 2017 iGEM team. This practice definitely enhances our passion for iGEM and future investigation.
We will certainly continue to publish articles in this account, and promote iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
New Team! Presentation In SIAT
(SIAT: ShenZhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences)
During this summer, one of our team members, Yuqiao Li, has been interning in SIAT for nearly a month. By the end of her internship, she gave a presentation on synthetic biology, iGEM competition and our team’s project. Then she explained her interesting research on iGEM teams’ choices of field for researching. After reading all 2015 teams’ wiki and team lists in recent 3 years, she got a statistic result of favored choices of teams and their changing pattern (shown below). Besides, she also expounded our team project on chronic wounds to SIAT’s researchers there. After that presentation, she conversed with the university students there, and they expressed deep interests in synthetic biology, proposing that they would like to build a new team and joined iGEM in 2017! They also expressed their will to collaborate with our team SMS_Shenzhen in 2017.

Safety
Our team believes that modelling is critically important for the success of a project, and have therefore used it extensively throughout all aspects of our project. Modelling is a very useful technique for a variety of reasons. Firstly, modelling a system before carrying out experiments is a great way to avoid wasting time and reagents in the lab. This is very valuable during projects that are time-constricted, such as the iGEM competition for example! Modelling a pathway before attempting to get experimental results also highlights any potential issues in the system, and helps target areas of interest within your chosen pathway. Any unusual results found after experimental work has been completed can sometimes be explained using modelling approaches.
We wanted to share our enthusiasm for modelling with the wider iGEM community, and feel there is currently no resource of teams to easily find out about the basics of modelling. At the YSB 1.0 conference, we discussed this with other teams and they agreed with us on this issue. Therefore we collaborated with the University of York and the University of Newcastle to produce tutorial videos on three different modelling softwares, explaining what each software is used for and the basics of how to use them.
The Registry of Standard Biological Parts already has a number of protocols for various standard wetwork methods. We hope that one day, a similar concept could be introduced to modelling.
Modelling in 'R'
In this video, the University of York team discuss the pros and cons of different types of modelling software that teams could potentially used for their model. This is followed by an introduction to the concept of delayed differential equations, and a guide showing how R can be used to to model them.
COPASI
COPASI (COmplex PAthway SImulator) is open-source piece of software that can be used to model a wide range of biological systems, including metabolic networks and cell signalling pathways. In this video, the University Of Manchester team show you how to get started with COPASI by firstly creating a simple model of the first two reactions in the glycolysis pathway, followed by how to analyse something more complex
BioNetGen
BioNetGen is often applied on rule-based modelling of biochemical networks utilizing the RuleBender interface. This video by Newcastle University team provides a brief tutorial on how to build a basic model on a reaction between a substrate and enzyme.

PCR cleanup of the amplified antiTNA 1 and 2 from last Tuesday was carried out. Nano drop showed nucleic acid concentrations from 20-35 ng/ul.
Purified antiTNA 1 and 2 along with pSBIC3 backbone were digested using restriction enzymes XbaI and Pst.1:5 and 1:3 molar ratio ligation of backbone to antiTNA was done and transformed to DH5α competent cells.
In the afternoon, we repeated the digestion of CHAT and TPH1 again but with single digestion. We ran the gel with linear pSB1C3, CHAT and TPH1. It confirmed ligation of CHAT however, linear plasmids for TPH1 were shorter than pSB1C3, hence unsuccessful for TPH1.

We prepared four mini preps each of antiTNA1 and antiTNA2. Nano drop confirmed the concentration ranging from (65-147)ng/ul. We digested 4 ul of antiTNA from each mini prep with XbaI and PstI. Unfortunately, as the voltage was too high 120 mV, DNA ran out of this 1% gel so we decided to repeat the experiment at lower voltage 100mV in 2% agarose gel. Meanwhile we digested pTAC with S and P and left the digestion overnight.
No transformed nissle colonies in the plates.We decided to repeat transformation next week

Mind the Gut: Effectors
We purified CHAT PCR and digested pTac however had very low DNA yield for pTac. Hence, we carried out ligation 1:3 ligation of pTAC and CHAT.
We prepared fresh mini preps of the antiTNA1 and 2 from the previous inoculations as the old mini preps were suspected of contamination.
Friday 14th
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We ran the gel for antiTNAs but only the plasmid backbone was visible. This led us to think either our digestion had not work or because the antiTNAs are only 75bp and 100bp respectively, they were possibly invisible in the gel.
The ligated pTac:Chat was transformed into competent cells and left in sterile desk at room temperature in a dark environment.

Safety
One of the biggest concerns regarding synthetic biology in the general public is ""Will the genetically modified organism be safe for me? What happens when you release the organism you designed into the environment? What if you create something you cannot control?""
These are valid questions that need to be answered when creating genetically modified bacteria.  We tackled the important safety aspect in the project in three different ways:
(1) Teaching and trying to understand synthetic biology.
(2) Safety in the lab.
(3) Our system's safety.
Synthetic Biology Education
We understand the fear and concern of the public about GMOs. Therefore we wanted to expose the public to synthetic biology.
We gave lectures to teens and adults from different backgrounds about synthetic biology, its great potential and safety concerns.
We also emphasized the importance of safe lab work as part of our lab activity for children.
Safety in the Lab
We took all the necessary precautions such as lab coats, safety goggles when using liquid Nitrogen and always wore gloves.
No food was allowed in the lab and there was a separate area for computer work.
The dress code was also strict- when working in the lab we wore closed shoes and long pants/skirt.
While working in the lab we used Ethidium Bromide (EB) for using gel electrophoresis and analysis. This substance is a potent mutagen that is used as a nucleic acid stain.
Therefore, we took special precautions such as working with EB only in the chemical hood, and having separate disposal for EB. We also had have a separate area on the bench where we ran the gels. This area has its own equipment such as tips, pipettors and gloves.
When performing gel extraction, we were exposed to UV light for short periods of time. To minimize the exposure we used protection equipment such as face protection shields and full body lab coats.
Non-biological Safety
Another safety aspect of our project is the chemical one.
The Azobenzene production was done using a few chemicals that needed special caution such as 70% Nitric Acid. This substance is hazardous when it comes in contact with skin. Therefore, a face shield, full suit and all the appropriate protection was worn.
Another substance was chloroform which is carcinogenic. All the safety measures was taken, including personal protection and exhaust ventilation in the chemical hood. We also used AgO,"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html,"ility. Physiological compatibility was important because we didn't want anything that could potentially harm our bacteria. Unfortunately, the pills contained a lot of filler, therefore we had to crush several  pills before we got the desired concentration of calcium. The calcium solution made using the pills was cloudy and contained a lot of debris. Transformation with this solution was successfully but had very low efficiency. We tried again, but this time we centrifuged the solution in order to obtain a clear solution.
We performed our experiment with 4 different concentrations of calcium from the calcium citrate tablets (5mM, 10mM, 50mM, 100mM). For our positive control we used 50mM calcium chloride. We followed the protocol we use in our lab to make competent cells, this protocol is available under “general protocols.”
Below are three photos of three different treatments of E. coli to produce competent cells. We tested competency by transforming with RFP (BBa_J04450) , which yields red cells. The positive control/standard (50mM calcium chloride) showed efficient transformation, which was replicated in the 50mM calcium-citrate treatment. For comparison, the 10mM calcium-citrate treatment yielded only a few colonies, though they were not red. Based on the results from this experiment and from our previous attempt, we're confident that this method has potential. Ampicillin-resistance was used as a selection marker, the plasmids containing RFP also contained a gene for Amp-resistance. The lack of red colonies does not necessarily indicate a lack of transformation, since cells were still able to grow, chances are that they did not express the somewhat toxic RFP.
We believe this protocol is cost effective, as the calcium citrate tablets cost us approximately $0.21. We submitted our data to the University of Columbia ‘s iGEM team and received  a collaboration sticker. The winner will be announced in Boston, we can’t wait to see what other teams came up with!

The strength of the promoter used means that in the presence of T7 DNA polymerase, production of the Cro repressor protein will incapacitate the production of the cI repressor protein. Thus, the presence of the T7 RNA polymerase in the system enables the switch from the lysogenic cycle to the lytic cycle.
The cI repressor protein (also known as lambda repressor) is responsible for keeping bacteriophage lambda in the lysogenic cycle through the cooperative binding of two repressor dimers to the DNA, repressing the expression of the cro gene [5],[6]. Cro repressor protein, on the other hand, controls the late stage of the lytic development. When the concentration of the Cro repressor is greater than that of the cI repressor, the lytic cycle is initiated [5],[6].
This cI-Cro circuit was synthesised removing the illegal restriction sites to make the sequence BioBrick-compatible. The sequence was cloned into a pSB1C3 and the success of the cloning procedure was confirmed by restriction with EcoRI and SpeI restriction enzymes and followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 6). The construct was also confirmed by sequencing. This BioBrick was registered as part BBa_K1846005 .
We characterised this construct by analysing the soluble protein fraction of the cell lysate (Figure 7). As cI repressor protein is produced constitutively in our circuit, we expected to see a cI repressor protein band at ca 26 kDa (cI repressor protein = 237 aa, MW: 26211.8 Da). Our control E.coli 10β cells containing the cI-Cro construct have shown the expected bands at ca 26 kDa (Figure 7, samples 7, 8 and 9). We attribute the lack of cI protein bands in our T7 Express cell lysate (Figure 7, sample 4) to T7 RNAP leakage, which would silence the expression of the cI gene through expression of cro gene in the opposite direction. Absence of Cro repressor protein bands (Cro repressor protein = 66 aa; MW: 7363.4 Da) could be due to protein overexpression and aggregation into insoluble fraction ("

Sensing Module
Overview / Rationale
In order to control the expression in a population of cells, it is essential that the signal can propagate from one         cell to another. It is therefore, important to consider the diffusion of signals. Signals should be able to pass         through cell membrane and cell wall, from cytoplasm to the outside environment, and vice versa. Adding a positive         feedback loop can enhance the transmission of the signal through the population
To ensure the knockout process occurs in every single cell, we select the diffusible signals that a bacterium can produce         quickly. This inducer is the 3O6CHSL, or AHL molecule.
Sensing Module Construct
Diagram 1. Sensing Module Construct
Positive feedback loop mechanism
Diagram 2. Positive feedback loop mechanism
Experimental Construct
Diagram 3. Experimental Construct
Our Design
The function of the sensing module is to detect the deliberately released stimulus and initiate the process of “knockout”.         Considering that the released stimulus can become diluted in an environment, a positive feedback loop is included         to amplify the signal. Thus, 3OC6HSL, which is a member of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) family, was chosen as the         inducer. 3OC6HSL, originally from V. fischeri, is a lipid molecule that can diffuse through bacterial cell         membrane, facilitating cell-to-cell communication.
The sensing module begins with the TetR repressible promoter or pTetR (BBa_R0040), which can be treated as constitutive         promoter of LuxR protein (BBa_C0062) under no repressor TetR. This segment of the biosensor works to produce an abundance         of LuxR. Once the 3OC6HSL is added to the cell environment, LuxR forms a complex with 3OC6HSL and then activates         downstream promoter, pLuxR (BBa_R0062).

Assay
To obtain a relative activity of the phytase produced by the cells with the constitutive promoter/citrobacter phytase part, we performed a phosphate assay on the produced phytase. In order to remove the phytase from the cells, the cells were overnighted and diluted 1:500 and then regrown into the end of log phase. Once at the end of log phase, the cells were centrifuged and sonicated in order to obtain the intracellular protein(with the produced phytase)to use in a phosphate assay. To perform the phosphate assay, .1 nmol phytic acid was added to the sonicated cell lysate at both a pH of 7 and a pH of 4.5. The pH of 4.5 was the literature value of pH that citrobacter phytase works best at. A colormetric phosphate assay solution was added and the OD of the solution was recorded in comparison to phosphate standards in order to obtain a measure of free phosphate in the solution.
From the above phosphate assay results, we concluded that the produced Citrobacter phytase grown in E. coli managed to liberate phosphate from the phytic acid solution. We are continuing work on performing more phosphate assays to obtain results with more statistical rigor.
As the regional jamboree approaches, we are continuing to obtain results for the phosphate assays performed on both the Aspergillus niger and E. coli phytase in order to better characterize our new phytase parts for the registry. Specifically , it would be beneficial to know which phytase is the best at liberating phosphate and iron from phytic acid. As each phytase has a different active pH range, optimum temperature, and specific activity we expect that each phytase will have drastically different results in the physiological conditions of the stomach. Our best guess of which phytase will perform the best in the conditions of the stomach is the Citrobacter braaki phytase, due to its high specific activity[1] and low pH optimum.

UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," unique fiber that can be used in applications that require the normally contradicting qualities of tremendous strength and low weight. It could be woven into thick cables for heavy industrial use or into fabrics for ballistic protection.    Silk not only has amazing properties in its strength and elasticity, it is a highly versatile material that can exist in many different forms. For example, its ability to exist as a hydrogel combined with its natural biocompatibility and controlled rate of biodegradation make it a good material for use as an in vivo tissue scaffold. Silk scaffolds could also exist as mesh woven from fibers and used for skin grafts and bandages.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
With spider silk as our basis, we started to experiment with the genetic structure of silk. We rearranged portions of the repetitive DNA code to see how it affected the strength, elasticity, and spinning capabilities using Golden Gate Cloning and Iterative Capped Assembly. Click this text to learn about this portion of our project in-depth.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this text.
Processing Silk
Engineering our silk is only half the work, creating a tangible product is the rest.
After some stumbles in the beginning of summer when our makeshift rotary jet spinner failed to work, we decided to look into different methods of spinning synthetic fibers. We tested extrusion with a syringe pump, which gave us very thin, fragile fibers. Click this text to jump into the action and watch fibers take shape from solution.

SMMU-China,2018,Team:SMMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in hospital to receive treatment. HF not only costs a huge amount of money but also reduced patients’ life quality. When consulting the experienced clinical doctors, the cruel truth was that no radical cure has been found for HF. The current treatments on HF are just the momentary relief for the symptoms, while the deterioration of heart is irreversible. On the other hand, the drugs costs a lot. Nowadays, the most promising way to cure HF is considered to be gene therapy. Thus, our team decided to work on gene therapy to solve this problem.
Determine project content
Based on these, we have consulted with our primary PI, Professor Shi Hu, who is a leading scientist in the field of Antibody Engineering. He introduced a novel nanobody termed AR185 which has been recently developed by his group and showed specifically inhibition of RyR2 phosphorylation in vitro. The nanobody, containing a camel single-domain, is known as the smallest unit that can combine target antigens. Therefore, we hypothesis that targeting RyR2 using anti-phosphorylation agents may improve treatment efficacy. We used the tech of phage display and biopanning from Frances H. Arnold, George P. Smith and Gregory P. Winter, which has just awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2018. To evaluate its potential use for the treatment of heart failure, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based intracellular antibody delivery strategy was adopt to achieve cardiac-specific gene therapy. Then we demonstrated therapeutic effect both in cell-based assays and in vivo models. Based on the truth that circulating levels of BNP was normally very low in healthy individuals and BNP level correlated well with ventricular wall stress and severity of HF, we put BNP promotor at the upstream of AR185 gene and used ET-1 to stimulate BNP promotor through a large variety of trans.
Dialogues with masters
To evaluate the feasibility of our project, we consulted professor Erwin Neher, a Nobel laureate, and Dr. Zhao Xianxian and Dr. He Zhiqing. These masters pointed out that calcium leakage was one of the most important mechanism accounted for the chronic heart failure. If our intracellular antibody performed well for the leakage, our design would obtain satisfactory improvements in treatment. While, on the other hand, they also recommended that we should explore the other mechanisms that may result into HF. Only figure out the calcium leakage problem may not be a cure for all the HF patients. To improve our project, we managed to develop our project to apply for more mechanisms after we fulfilled AR185 this year.

Data sources
During our project, we needed many data. We used data of protein-protein interactions for signal transduction pathway deciding, protein sequence and domain description for modified FGFR design, gene sequence for modified FGFR sequence synthesis, and structures or sequences of antibodies and FGF binding domain of FGFR for structural alignment. These data were acquired from Uniprot, PID, NCBI and RCSB PDB.
Uniprot
Uniprot provides sequences of many proteins and domain description of well-researched proteins. Key advantage of using Uniprot is domain description: to design engineered protein for detecting Mycobacterium without knowledge of function of each part of protein. Tuberculosis antigen MPT51 is impossible one. Uniprot provided the information of location of FGF binding domain of FGFR, which is replaced by our single-chain antibody 16A1. Uniprot also provided sequences of some antibodies to make single chain antibody sequences.
Site URL: http://www.uniprot.org/
PID
PID (Pathway Interaction Database) provides the interaction networks between protein and protein or protein and DNA through certain signal transduction pathway. This Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and protein-DNA interaction (PDI) data helped us to port Human signal transduction pathway which is activated by FGF to fission yeast. Without knowledge of PPI and PDI through FGF signal pathway, we must undergo many trials and errors of adding and removing of proteins and promoters to form working signal transduction pathway. With the data from PID, we decided to port the FGF->FGFR1->STAT1->GAS pathway from human to fission yeast.
Site URL: http://pid.nci.nih.gov/
NCBI
NCBI provides biologists with many data. We used protein sequences and DNA sequences from NCBI nucleotide database and protein database. DNA sequence is very important to us because gene sequence of original protein is required to synthesize novel engineered protein. Even we don't synthesize gene, we should know the sequence of gene because BioBrick requires not only nucleotide material, but also its sequence information. NCBI also provided us with sequences of some antibodies to make single chain antibody sequence, and many Journals through PubMed service.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"icles give the cyanobacteria a lower density than water.
Growth rate: Slow growth rates require long water retention times to enable a bloom.
Phosphorous and nitrogen: A low ratio of these substance may favour a development of cyanobacteria blooms.
Temperature: maximum growth rates are attained by the most cyanobacteria above 25°C. Thus much bloom formation is during the summer.
A possible cascade which is caused by the release of nutrients in the aquatic ecosystems is shown in Figure 8. Another result confirms the spread and the persistence of cholera through algal blooms [ Epstein PR.,1993 ]. Currently the so called harmful algal blooms are an additive for the detection of bacteria spread and their caused health effects to fauna and flora [ Ferrante et al.,2010 ] [ Barlaan EA et al.,2007 ]. The reduction of the uptake of toxic methylmercury in freshwater food webs by algal blooms confirms a positive reverse of algal blooms [ Pickhardt PC. et al.,2002 ].
Current Solution to combat Algal blooms
It is well known that cyanobacteria produce most Toxins such as microcystin under species-specific conditions which are most favorable for their growth. As a result most studies concerning this topic try to tackle the problem from this point of view. For the investigated species, they found out that the toxin production increased under light optimum condition of the relative bacteria species and on low and high pH. The usage of zinc was necessary for the increase of growth and toxin production. Dependent on nitrogen fixing respectively non-nitrogen fixing species the nitrogen and phosphorous rate in media was unnecessary respectively necessary concerning to the toxin production. Evidences of the role of plasmid, multi-enzyme complexes and peptide synthetase gene involvement in toxin production were also confirmed: e.g. knockout experiments showed that peptide synthetase genes are responsible for microcysteine production.
Major problems are still the lack of knowledge regarding to occurrence and toxicity of cyanobacterial products like the diversity of LPS structures which cause allergic as well as toxic human health problems, the extremely weak scientific basis and poorly developed procedures for valuation on health effects. The TDI (tolerable daily intake) is one of the key features on which the toxicology studies are aimed. Based on analytic and sampling problems or inadequate scientific data safe practice guidelines can be assisted for the reducing of exposure.
The human exposure to the toxins is a major point to combat the human health risk. The WHO guideline values base upon a number of assumptions which change locally or nationally according to the present situation. To fill the lack of knowledge"

Question: Can B. subtilis grow in spent medium from cscB permase transformed S. elongatus
Experiment: The cscB containing S. elongatus strain was grown in a baffled flask with BG-11 medium containing 10μg/mL chloramphenicol for two days. When the samples began to be green - after a couple of days after inoculation, the samples were induced by adding 0.1mM IPTG to the S. elongatus along with varying salt concentrations (0mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM and 300mM NaCl). Then the samples were incubated for 7 days in a light chamber at 30°C, while shaking at 250rpm and the spent medium was collected by pellet the S. elongatus. The pelleting was carried out by centrifuging the samples in 50mL falcon tubes for 30 minutes at 4500rpm. The supernatant was then moved to new sterile 50mL falcon tubes and stored in fridge until usage.  After collection of the spent medium it was combined with ATCC without sucrose in a ratio of 1:1. B. subtilis was then inoculated in the medium and incubated at 28°C while shaking at 100rpm for 14 days. OD at 600nm was measured every second day. From day six, the medium was removed and fresh spent medium with ATCC without sucrose in a ratio of 1:1 was added to the cells every second day.
Result: To test whether the B. subtilis could survive in spent medium from S. elongatus, B. subtilis was inoculated in spent medium. The spent medium was taken from S. elongatus that had grown in different environments (Fig. 15). The growth of B. subtilis in spent medium shows that B. subtilis grow best in the medium that arose from S. elongatus grown in 150mM NaCl. This correspond very well with the data obtained from the sucrose measurements. Also this shows that S. elongatus produce and secrete enough sucrose to sustain growth and development of B. subtilis in the co-culture. The fall the red curve has at the end suggests that the medium needs to be refreshed again - probably due to carbon starvation. However, it should be noted"

We ordered pdc and adhB coding sequences from Zymomonas mobilis to Mr Gene. They had the following specifications:
the sequences were taken from the online data banks, considering the most recent entries;
the organism of interest was Z. mobilis CP4 (ATCC 31821);
the sequences were codon-optimized for E. coli;
prefix and suffix sequences were added, considering that both genes start with ATG;
an additional stop codon (TAA) was addad at the end of the coding sequence, just before the suffix, in order to have a double stop codon;
restriction sites EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI and NotI had to be avoided during codon optimization (while the original coding sequences didn't have any of them).

With that said, use hashtags and interact with other accounts. What are your opinions on Instagram story take overs? I think they’re fun. Again it depends on your motive. For me, I don’t want anyone to take over my story because mine’s very much my voice. So what I was thinking for iGEM, we have a lot of different scientists and people on the team. We are such a diverse team, we cross six departments, I was thinking of doing once a week have a person take over for one day and have “a day in the life of a scientist” or “a day in management” to show that everyone in iGEM is a normal person. I think that’s really cool but- this is not based on evidence, but I’m just giving my thoughts- so I think, you want to get engagements, you want people to comment and like and you want people to reply to your stories in DMs, that helps push you towards explore pages which is how you get seen. Sorry I could go on forever about this. So the things that I notice do best, are ones where I’m being very personal and vulnerable where I’m talking about myself and being very honest. My one concern about takeovers is if it’s too many people, how can they build a connection? As long as you can do it in a way where people are still connecting, or you have like a common narrator that they’re connecting with. Or maybe you do a takeover for a week so people can start to build a bond of sorts. For a week once a month. I think just make sure, however you do the takeover, you do it so that people can still bond with the person. I have a lot of friends that when they follow really big accounts with millions of followers they don’t like their posts because they feel disconnected. Like my friends will follow meme accounts or famous bloggers but they won’t interact because it’s so disconnect, they’re like “they don’t need my like”. But with me my friends will interact because 1) I’m not that big and 2) they feel connected and personally invested in my success. So try and pull people in, almost obligate them, make them feel like they have to support you, because you need their support. Make sure you’re still fostering connection. Always remember that your goal is engagements so you can get on those explore pages. I have just under 7000 followers. So most posts will be seen by"

Mr.D -who will cure leukemia-
Leukemia is a serious disease and its remedy has been never found yet. People are afraid of it not only because it is incurable but also it is unpredictable what will happen and when it will happen. Patients have to put up with both of them.
Here we propose the convenient testing kit for leukemia which makes its symptom visible. To accomplish this we are developing leukemia disease models in ''Drosophila''. The usefulness of this kit will be evaluated by characterizing the ''Drosophila'' model. This kit may provide a guideline to overcome fear and pain which have not been immeasurable and relieve the fear for leukemia.
Our team, KIT-Kyoto challenges making a leukemia disease model in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. ''Drosophila'' is being used as many hereditary disease model because over 70% of known human disease genes have similarities to Drosophila genes.
This year, we focus on a leukemia in which the etiology and the therapy have not been established. We therefore decided to make a leukemia disease model in ''Drosophila''. We insert human leukemia genes into ''Drosophila'' genome and also fuse a green fluorescent protein(GFP) with a leukemic protein to monitor its expression in ''E. coli'' or ''Drosophila''. We expect that establishing a leukemia disease model in ''Drosophila'' will be a first step to determine the etiology and to establish the method of therapy in the future.

Emily introduced the 4 aspects of the projects and talked about Human Practices . Jermey talked about the lab aspect of the project , Mandy handled the Second Life aspect while Afshin talked about Modelling. The transition between speakers went smoothly. The video on the powerpoint screen and the narration were in sync. The video in the powerpoint presentation was a very unique part of the aGEM presentation since none of the other teams had any video in their power point.After the power point presentation was over the speakers invited the whole team on to the floor during question period. The presence of the whole team on the floor signified unity and uniformity of our team.
Although the material was presented in a clear and concise manner due to the time constraint a lot of information was placed on the audience in a small amount of time. This was commented on by the Judges. The Judges really liked the Second Life part of our project. They wanted to see more of Second Life . Some Judges recommended making Second Life the main"

We used the standard ligation protocol to ligate P38 and P39 with P45. This will test the P38 and P39 samples that we have. P38 and P39 are the hi and low constitutive promoters; P45 is RBS + GFP + terminator. So if the colonies fluoresce, then our minipreps of P38 and P39 do contain P38 and P39.

WHU-China,2014,Team:WHU-China#_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM gives me the chance to know more and do more. Ideas will never appear suddenly - after the brain storm and layers of screening we got the amazing idea finally and had a colorful life in the lab for several mouths. I joined the human practice group at the last few weeks and did some help. Thanks to my teammates and teachers, we finished it quite well. I love dancing and reading novels. My favorite novel is Harry Potter and I don't think it is childish. Life is colorful, both in the lab and outside.
My name is Lei He coming from Wuhan University school of pharmaceutical science. Because of my enthusiasm and teachers' help, I have got a rich experience of experiment. But being an iGEMer of a great team is the most exciting part.

Hi I'm Chen Xi or you can call me Fred. As a senior year student, I'm grateful to be a member of this excellent miracle-making team. My work in this project involves source gathering, plasmids design. I am so glad that our idea and the outcome can now have a chance to be presented to the world and let people know how the bioengineering can create a formaldehyde toxicity free world.
My name is Ji Yang. I am a senior student in College of life science, Wuhan University. It's a great honor to be a part of the 2014-WHU-China team. In the team, my responsibility is to assist Luo Zhengyu to construct our web page and collect some necessary text material. We would use some fancy CSS and JavaScript techniques to make our page more attractive and more creative. I wish our work could present you a clear and insight web page.
Qi Wang| Senior in Biology science Qi is really a shy and introverted girl. She does not like to talk with other members very much, but she is willing to be a good listener. A good team needs not only someone who is eloquent enough to keep us together, but someone who dedicated himself silently like Qi. And she is very serious with her work. She worked in the lab for our project in the summer vacation.
