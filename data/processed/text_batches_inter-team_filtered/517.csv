Crowdfunding and Press
An important aspect of iGEM to us is the possibility to bring the field of synthetic biology to people's attention. While holding presentations at schools certainly contributes to this, we also came in contact with the media and started and successfully funded a crowdfunding campaign.
Crowdfunding
Finding sponsors to support the project is as crucial to iGEM as it is exciting. Additionally, this year we also wanted to find personal investors that believed in our project. Therefore, we initialized a crowdfunding campaign on Startnext.
Besides the financial support, for which we are inexpressibly thankful, we also gained the chance to reach out to people and show them what our project and synthetic biology is about.
Especially our pitch video has been very well received by people as it helped them understand the project while raising their personal interest towards the topic. We had great feedback from social media and not only have we been curated by the partner page of Startnext called Sciencestarter , they even elected us to Sciencestarter of the week.
Apart from being able to communicate our project we also had a great time producing the stop motion pitch video, designing rewards for supporters and write newsletter blogs for fans. Furthermore, writing the script for the video really has raised our awareness"

Figure 5: Formation of a TEV protease from two fragments
As this was a protein based circuit, we recognised that freeze-drying the system from cell free extract, as we did with the DNA based system, would be unlikely to be possible. We found an alternative method in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMVs are lipid vesicles, made from the outer membrane, containing periplasmic solution and proteins. OMVs are constitutively made by all Gram-negative bacteria. A recent paper by Alves et al. 2016, demonstrated that enzymatic function could be protected during freeze-drying cycles by containing the enzyme in an OMV. We aimed to target the proteins in our circuit to the bacterial outer membrane, extract OMVs containing them, freeze-dry the OMVs for storage and transport, and finally re-solubilise and lyse the OMVs for diagnosis.
The bacterial outer membrane transport system is still not yet fully understood. In order to target our proteins to OMVs, we adopted the technique described in Alves et al. 2016: (1) OmpA, a membrane protein in E. coli which is known to be transported into OMVs at a high rate, is fused to SpyTag and (2) the functional circuitry component is fused to SpyCatcher and a TorA leader sequence. The TorA leader sequence will transport our protein into the periplasmic space (via the Tat translocase system), where SpyTag and SpyCatcher can form an isopeptide bond (between Asp117 and Lys31, respectively) and fuse the two parts. The circuit proteins are then taken up into the OMVs with OmpA.
As part of a collaboration, the McMaster II iGEM Team ran a 300 ns all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction. The last few nanoseconds of the simulation and the RMSF plot of residues (RMSF reflects the stability of the residue in water) are shown below. This data gave us confidence in the functionality of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, which is essential to our project.
The OMVs containing the protein circuits can be freeze-dried and then resolubilised when the diagnostic is needed - the latter step occurs upon the addition of blood."

Although this is just one comparison, it indicates that battery powered electric cars are not significantly better. At the moment, hydrogen powered cars are better in these three key aspects. In the next decade it will be interesting to see the comparison between hydrogen-powered and battery electric powered cars, and to see which has made the greatest technological advancements.

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Aspects#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," the Royal Society of Edinburgh would be supportive, a lot of the scientific community would be very much in favour [of such developments], but there is a political reluctance, because of the fears that they have about safety. We could possibly return to that question later.
J: If we are to use GMOs, this might be contributing to the life sciences sector in general. Therefore, we wanted to ask you how, currently, the life sciences sector is contributing to the Scottish economy, and also what the aims are of the SNP regarding the life sciences and synthetic biology sectors. Does it want to enhance it or what kind of support would be given, if any?
JE: The Scottish government is committed to promoting sustainable economic growth across a range of sectors, of which the life sciences is one. The ambition for Scotland is to grow the sector over time. It has been identified as an area for future expansion and economic growth. The economic footprint that life sciences represent is significant in Scotland. If you take even just one section of it, the ‘pharma’ related business in Scotland, which isn’t just pharmaceuticals, but also contract research organisations that are doing clinical trials and biopharmaceutical companies who are doing early stage research. That part of the sector alone would have a significant economic footprint of, I would reckon, about 3-4 billion pounds, and around six thousand jobs, although you would need to check that. That’s just one snapshot of the economic contribution. I think, more generally, we have got medical devices, and we have got medical diagnostics. All of that together is creating a hub of activity. I’m just trying to think of some examples of that. The American pharmaceutical company, called Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer, they made an investment into Scotland. I think, between themselves and the Scottish entrepreneurs, the Economic Development Agency in Scotland, the total investment was something like 34 million pounds. 50% of that came from Scottish enterprise, 50% came from the company. What that investment was designed to do was to bring together the NHS [National Health Service], the Universities and industry, to fund research into a number of disease therapy areas, where there is a need for new treatments. That involved the four medical schools, the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen…
J: So the major universities in Scotland.
JE: It involved the geographical health boards in those areas, bringing all that together. As the research progressed, the universities would receive milestone payments for the research. That’s perhaps an illustration that you can do very good research but you have to be able to commercialise it."

UAM_Poznan,2016,Team:UAM Poznan#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," promoters = smaller biobricks, which are more convenient for molecular cloning purposes. We have substituted original 5’UTRs of genes located downstream these promoters with synthetic sequences considering RNA structure, the RBS motif and its positioning. Our biggest achievement this year is the experiment in which we have transplanted a 39nt fragment of 5'UTR of gene 10 of bacteriophage T7 to three of four (melibiose inducible promoter is still under construction) tightly regulated E. coli promoters. It appears that all fusion promoters (araE1, xylE1, rhaE1) are still much tighter than the lactose induced T7 systems and all fusion promoters are much more responsive to inducers. One of them upon induction seems to give higher expression levels than T7 expression systems. Considering that the additional ribosome binding site in 5'UTR seems to be an universal mechanism which allows for an efficient polysome takeover in E. coli and possibly in other procaryotic systems, it opens new attractive opportunities, at least to develop very efficient expression systems for other bacteria like Bacillus, Lactococcus, and many other.
Better, and better ORFs
Degeneracy of the genetic code means that some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, thus the same protein sequence can be translated from various mRNAs. The frequency of particular codons in the gene of interest can cause expression problems because of rarely occurring tRNAs. Variation in codon usage is considered to be a major problem in heterologous protein production. It can contribute to slowing down the translational process and induce error introduction. It is believed that by codon optimization one can substantially increase the gene expression and that the optimized gene will more effectively compete for cell resources and will be more accurately translated [Kane JK, 1995]. We would like to check which approach to optimize a reading frame is the best and to what extent it can improve the expression of the optimized gene. We consider improvements of such traits as: codon usage, codon adaptation index, contexts of codons and secondary structures in coding sequences.
We intentionally started our comparisons from implementing general optimization rules, which effects can be easily compared in simple induced expression experiments.  We decided to check what is the difference in the protein synthesis rate between two very different versions of the same reading frame- sfGFP [Pedelacq JD, 2006], one composed of the most common codons (sfGFP-B, the best choice) in E. coli orfeome and another codon-mon"

Composite Parts
TA - DmpR - TfdB-JLU
The function of the composite part we have been working on is to detect and degrade chlorophenol under population control of Geneguard system.
Figure 1: The TA - DmpR - TfdB-JLU construct
This part is a combination of our Geneguard system and chlorophenol response system. Part BBa_J23107 is a constitutive promoter which could provide a constitutive expression of sensor DmpR and toxin CbtA.
This DmpR in our device is a mutant type based on the wild type DmpR used by 2013 Peking( BBa_K1031211 ) and showed more efficient and wider substrate range than wild type.
Toxin CbtA could keep the growth of the engineered bacteria in a low level. When exposed to contaminants, complex of DmpR and chlorophenol could bind to promoter Po and initiate the expression of antitoxin CbeA as well as TfdB-JLU, a monooxygenase that is responsible for initial hydroxylation of the benzene ring[1-2].

Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"-like elements. Generally, the matrix facilitates nuclear localization, nucleic acid binding, membrane targeting, and protein-protein interactions [1] the capsid mediates protein-protein interactions leading to Gag multimerization and particle assembly [2], and the nucleocapsid contains a CCHC zinc-finger motif which packages DNA/RNA and facilitates tRNA annealing [3] [4]. Studies investigating the Ty3 Gag polyprotein have shown that Gag is proteolytically processed into a 26-kDa capsid and 9-kDa nucleocapsid [5]. The Gag polyprotein of Ty3/Gypsy retroelements does not contain a matrix domain; however, they do still have the ability to form virus-like particles (VLP). VLPs represent a major intermediate step in retrotransposition reactions [6]. The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae retrotransposon, Ty1, provides a model for elucidating the assembly and structural properties of retro-elements [6]. Genomic Ty elements are first transcribed in the nucleus and then transported into the cytoplasm where the Ty RNA is translated into proteins, the Gag proteins then assemble into VLPs that encapsulate the Ty-RNA, tRNA, and Ty encoded enzymes [6].
Our project is based on the characterization of the CR2-Gag-Pro-RT VLP assembly and packaging capabilities. The first step in this characterization required us to find the specific cut sites of the CR2 protease in order to determine the substrate specificity of these protease enzymes. This determination is critical for giving us insight into the diverse and complex roles the Gag domain has on the formation of VLPs. Using this information we designed CR2 Gag amplicons that translate into proteins which are critical for mature VLP formation. These amplicons were designed with the capsid and nucleocapsid domains in mind. After purifying the proteins created by these amplicons we optimized VLP assembly conditions to determine the most efficient environment for VLP formation. We then assembled and purified VLPs in-vitro using our optimized assembly conditions. The samples were then run through a Native PAGE to determine the approximate VLP size and then visualized using an transmission electron microscope.
I. Design of the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT Constructs
Purpose: To determine the cleavage sites of the aspartyl-like protease we designed a CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct which is approximately 2 kb in size.

The guests we chose represent a range of areas of expertise, including Prof. Richard Kitney, Co-Director of the EPSRC National Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation; and prominent theoretical physicist Prof. Jim Al-Khalili.
Prof. Kitney is a biomedical systems engineering professor at Imperial College London and has been a pioneer of the field of synthetic biology for over a decade. During his episode of 'Desert Island... Science?', we spoke to him about using our human practices work in engaging young people with synthetic biology and our iGEM project and he has this to say:
We're just at the start of this revolution in engineering and biology, the sooner you can get young people interested in this field and, in my opinion, the whole of science and engineering, the better
It was really gratifying to hear a very prominent and important figure in synthetic biology confirm that our education and public engagement work is important and needed for furthering the field of synthetic biology. Prof. Kitney’s comments reflected a view that was shared by many parents and teachers at the science fairs and schools we visited: new, educational resources for aiding teachers and students in topics such as synthetic biology are necessary and these resources don’t have to be limited to GCSE-aged students and above. In the future, we could look into creating a version of our board game suitable for younger students, and a version suitable to older students, to improve the accessibility to a wider audience.
On the subject of engaging the general public, he said that:
enthusiasm is the most important thing
in learning more about this exciting new field of science; which is something we want to encourage in all outreach work.
Another figure we spoke to was Professor Jim Al-Khalili, who works in the field of quantum biology as well as promoting equality and diversity in science. We spoke with him about improving the interaction and collaboration between different scientific disciplines, to which he said:
Synthetic biology is a very good example of where a multidisciplinary approach is absolutely vital
Having a prominent public figure, like Prof. Al-Khalili, highlight the importance of synthetic biology for science and research, we hope would relieve some of the biases and stereotypes associated with the field. As
synthetic
is synonymous with
artificial
and
biology
is synonymous with
life
, we can understand why many people we have spoken to, especially shown in the visit to the Judd School, think that synthetic biology involves
designer life
. If more public figures can comment on the positive aspects of synthetic"

Overview
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
— Peter Carr, Director of Judging
Beyond the technical work on the lab, we comprehend our project exists within a world that requires us exploring aspects that involve issues such as ethics, sustainability, safety, legal framework, security, between others. These issues are complex and approached only through our human practices. Being aware of this we engaged with the communities that might be impacted by our work to invite them to shape the course of our investigation.
These social considerations were upfront in our project and integrated with the design and execution of our project, impacting in our Entrepreneurship, Wet lab, and Mathematical model work. We aimed to develop a thoughtful project with inspiring Human Practices for other teams to build upon and come up with new and creative approaches for this section, striving not only to understand how the world affects our project but also aiming to contribute to how synthetic biology is understood and practiced around the world.
Social Science Research Description
Since our Human practices involved interacting with communities to understand the social concern we are addressing, it was essential for us to approach these communities correctly by getting informed on our institution and national guidelines. This way we were able to conduct our social science research respectfully and always looking after the well-being of our cooperators.
The Mexican National Guidelines for integration and operation of the Research Ethics Committee (REC) declare the inclusion of ethical aspects as a quality indicator in social science research. The development of a bioethic culture is favorable to guarantee individual and social well-being since the discipline promotes the concepts of equity, solidarity, quality, principles of benefit, no maleficence, as well as the protection of human rights.1
Human subjects research entails risks; this makes it necessary to guarantee ethically acceptable conditions in the production of knowledge, considering that the legal framework is not sufficient to elucidate or resolve conflicts of a moral or ethical nature that arise in scientific activity.1
To protect our contributor’s human rights, respect their dignity and privacy, avoid any form of discrimination as well as ensure their integrity and wellness, we"

Why?
As mentioned in the project description , one important feature of our system is the reset of the signal once the message is received. The time between when the signal (or self destructive plasmid/conjugation plasmid) has been received and the reset (or destruction of the plasmid) is an important parameter which will allow the signal to be send to the next cell (receiver) through the consecutive conjugation system before “losing” the message. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a device which will provide enough time for the two subsequent events happen. This device has been termed the time-delay genetic circuit in this project. In the final version, the entry of the conjugation plasmid into one cell will serve as the input to the time-delay genetic circuit while the output will be the expression of the endonuclease in charge of the destruction of the signal plasmid (figure 1).
Figure 1. Black Box scheme of the Time-delay genetic circuit. The input of the device is the introduction of the “conjugation plasmid” into the cell; the output is the expression of the endonuclease which will destroy the plasmid and hence reset the signal or “message”. The consecutive arrows after the black box indicates a time-delay in the output signal. In a “message framework” (dashed orange box), two events should happen: reception and delivery of the message, during the input and before the output of the time-delay device.
As a bridge which connects the conjugation system and the self destructive plasmid, the time-delay genetic circuit described above could not been constructed and tested until the other two sub-projects had been completed. To avoid a shift in the schedule, the device will be tested using IPTG as input and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as output (figure 2). A detailed scheme and description of this device will be showed in the following sections.

Week 19
After doing some research in 2007's Cambridge team wiki it was found, that the permeability device is probably toxic to the cells and can thus only be succesfully cloned behind a very weak promotor.
Week 20
This week we grew the first blue colonies with an updated version of the indigoidine construct. We also put the permeability device behind a very weak promotor and prepared new plasmids for sequencing.
Week 21
When the sequencing results were analysed there were no mutations in the permeability device. Now the cloning of the plasmids for the parts submission started and by the end of the week we sent them for sequening.
Week 22
Unfortunately we noticed that we accidentally introduced an additional restriction site and could thus not submit the part to the registry. We already removed the restriction site and validated it by restriction digestion. Anyway we are going to try different restriction enzymes and send it for sequencing after wiki freeze.

Test
At first, we plan to make the engineered bacteria attach to some substrate materials like plastics. However, the model organism we choose to use, E. coli, cannot express bio-film protein naturally. We tested the attach property of the bacteria using materials provided by Nanjing-China, and the result is negative.
Thus, we chose Activated Sludge Method instead of Contact Oxidation Method which uses plastic substrate with working organism attached in the form of bio-film.
To test whether the engineered bacteria could grow and work in the bio-pool, we prepared 30L 1:10 diluted LB with 15g ≥10%tetracycline hydrochloride(for livestock and poultry raising) and 200mL saturated E. coli, added them into one bio-pool and started aeration as is shown in Fig. 12.

Repeat the plating for each dilution series for T1 through T8 cultures. Remember to sterilize the rod in between plates and especially between different dilutions.
Once plates have dried for a few minutes, invert and place in 37°C incubator overnight. Following this, store plates in refrigerator.
Examining the plates
Examine plates for uniformity of colonies and lack of contamination (see Figure 1-4).
For each culture (T0 through T8), count triplicate plates at one dilution that contains between 30 and 300 colonies.
Calculate the number of cells per ml of original culture for T0 through T8 cultures.
For example, the number of colonies resulting from a 10-4 dilution is 30, 28, and 32.
Mean number of colonies = 30 colonies
These arose from 0.1 ml of a 10^-4 dilution
Number of colonies per ml = (30*10^-4)/0.1
Plot log10 CFU/ml versus time (hours).
From the graph, identify the exponential phase of growth. Using two time points within the exponential phase of growth and corresponding cell numbers, calculate the mean generation time.

These include the basic components required to build each device.  The cartridge is designed to be made of a durable injectable molding plastic holding the water sample solution in a volume of approximately 1 mL giving the cuvette dimensions of about 20 mm x 50 mm x 10 mm each.  A one-way valve will ensure the sample is contained within the device, and the capsule will contain a twist tube based cap which will dispense bleach once the cartridge has been finished being used.  This will be used as one of our safety features of the device to ensure containment and no release of our organism into the environment
The device has a similar design made out of molded plastic that is rugged and durable to be able to be used in the field. The basic design incorporates a heat source to ensure the electrodes of the cartridges are at a consistent temperature, a potentiostat to do the electrochemical detection, and electronic systems for handling the data that is collected. The LED lights will be used as external indicators to the user if the test was successful or if it should be repeated.
Manufacturing Cost Analysis and Development Timeline
Once a lab-scale prototype has been optimized, we will move our product forward into a manufacturing development phase.  To accomplish this task, we will partner with industrialization not-for-profit organizations and government programs that specialize in prototype up-scale and optimization.  An overview of the cost estimations that have been made for one round of prototype development are below:
Figure 2: Cost of a development cycle to begin developing our prototype onwards to a full product.
These numbers were determined by estimating the cost of each component of the project and the cost associated with batch producing 100 cartridges.  To produce our final product several rounds of prototype and product development will have to be undergone to ensure the production of an effective product.   It is estimated that our product development will require at least five rounds of prototype development cycles as compared to other similar products in this industry.  Overall we have estimated the cost of these five rounds will be in the range of $225,000 to $275,000 depending on changes that are made to the technology through the development cycle.
Each round of prototype development will require a series of steps to design and simulate the prototype, design the molding and plastic casings for each device, assemble each component individually, and then integrate the components into the finalized system.

Project Description
Why TAGC?
The Anti Germ Coating (TAGC) is a surface coating with antimicrobial properties. It consists of a chitosan scaffold linked to nisin (antimicrobial peptide) and rhamnolipid (glycolipid) molecules.
Frequently used surfaces in hospitals or other public places are prone to host a multitude of germs. Some of them are not dangerous for humans but others might be pathogenic or have several resistances against antibiotics. Therefore, they bear some potential risks for our health and infection with these germs should be avoided.
Current solutions are based on metals like copper, silver or titanium but all of them involve the danger of releasing metallic nanoparticles. Studies show that silver nanoparticles can impair mitochondrial functions and be therefore cytotoxic to human cells [1] . Furthermore, the antimicrobial effects were not as impressive as expected. What's more, the properties of metallic coatings occur after a couple of hours, so germs could spread on the coating in this time (see Human practices) .
Our fully bio-based antimicrobial coating is the solution without a risk of nanotoxicity. Applying our coating reduces or even inhibits the growth of germs. That decreases the risk of infection caused by touching contaminated surfaces.
We expect the resulting coating to exhibit the same or even enhanced antimicrobial properties as the individual building blocks we used and thus prevent the growth and attachment of germs to surfaces of any kind.
What is TAGC?
The antimicrobial molecules rhamnolipid and nisin are linked to the antimicrobial biopolymer chitosan [2] to receive a surface with the desired antimicrobial effects. Rhamnolipids are glycolipids from Pseudomonas aeroguinosa with antimicrobial characteristics towards a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide from Lactococcus lactis, targeting mainly gram-positive microorganisms. A synergistic effect for the combination of rhamnolipid and nisin is described [3] so that the approach of using these two molecules together to generate a surface coating looks promising."
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," could decrease the efficiency of droplet merging and thus affect the overall performance of whole method. Videos shown below display the consequences of bad droplet merging parameters.
Movie 3. Droplet merging using not optimized parameters.
Figure 15. Three species of droplets after the electrocoalescence
To choose the best droplet merging parameters we relied on fluid mathematical modeling  ( click here for the model ). The output the constructed model predicted, that the most suitable droplet volume ratios for the electrocoalescence should lie in the range of 1:3 to 1:5. Based on the fact, that droplets in which biomolecule are synthesised using in vitro transcription and translation reactions are 10 pL we choose the MDA amplification droplets to be 40 pL. Movie 4 displays the droplet merging we achieved after optimizing the parameters
Movie 4. Optimized droplet merging
Movie 5 displays the generation of 40 pL droplets containing the multiple displacement reaction mix and the reinfusion of previously generated 10 pL droplets. Droplet merging occurs at the junction between two electrodes. The amplification droplets are 1.25x times more concentrated, because the reaction mixture dilutes 4 times after droplet fusion: 10 pL + 40 pL = 50 pL. The videos below show, that we achieved near perfect droplet merging without disrupting the compartmentalization or stability of the fused droplets.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content6_-_-_TEXT.html,"2012 iGEM-HS competition and made a brilliant achievement. In order to get a better popularization of iGEM-HS in China, we show these high school students some interesting iGEM-HS programs to draw their attention to this competition. Our efforts paid off. Inspired by what they saw, these high school students hoped to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM to make contributions to the development of this interesting project. They believed they can organize a next Chinese iGEM-HS team as well with our help in lab and other aspects. They wished that we can keep a long interaction and cooperation.
During the lecture there was a really positive interaction between these high school students and our team. Every student participates in the knowledge competition, answering questions related to biological safety and some lucky dogs won our special rewards. In order to have a better and deeper communication, our team members exchanged E-mail address and telephone number with some high school students who were really interested what we mentioned in the lecture.
Campus Fair
We held a campus fair and related exhibition with the theme of synthetic biology and iGEM in the Gui Huashan Building, Xiamen University on July 17th afternoon.  The whole activity included three parts——synthetic biology exhibition, game and the Bio Bang cards presentation. To help the participants learn synthetic biology is a challenging but attractive process. These high school students could enjoy the interests in science and technology, know the knowledge about biology and think over ethics in life science through our activities.
We ushered the students to our conference theatre, having them participate in any activities they are interested in and giving them attracting presents. We also gave every participant our badge. The synthetic biology exhibition was composed by some display boards including knowledge of synthetic biology, program display on iGEM, biological safety and genetic engineering. Some information and pictures were from iGEM wiki. We made this exhibition following the lecture to improve our HP effects.
Campus fair game was the most important part in order to enhance the interest and improve the popularization of knowledge of biosafety via playing. It was just like a lively and learning garden party which was composed with three parts—Riddles written on lanterns，Foldit computer games and finding the differences between DNA molecules.
In the first game, we find some riddles about gene and biology and wrote them on lanterns. Most riddles were related to basic knowledge of biosafety and lab skills. If the participant could find the answer then he would win a prize. Foldit, a computer game loved by the high school students since they can learn from entertainment, folds proteins"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," hosted a meetup in August for our fellow Danish iGEM teams: InCell from the University of Copenhagen (KU), and the Snakebite Detectives from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).  A total of seven members from these two teams joined us for breakfast and attended our meetup. This was the first ever iGEM meetup hosted by our university, so we decided to make it memorable. We took advantage of our interdisciplinary team roster, and thus designed a wiki and ethics workshop to aid our fellow Danish teams.
We utilised the broad interdisciplinary profile of our team, to have Emil S. and Lene present the perception of science throughout the history and the meta-bioethical aspects of GMO, respectively. Emil S. has a Bachelor of Arts in History, and Lene has a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. The ethical presentation was purposely turned into an ethical debate, where viewpoints of ethical conduct were exchanged and discussed. After the presentations and discussions on metaethics, it was time for the wiki workshop.
The SDU-Denmark iGEM teams have won the Best Wiki prize several times in the past. As such, we wanted to share the knowledge gained from our university's experience. To facilitate this exchange of knowledge on wiki development, we recruited our current supervisor Thøger Jensen Krogh, to facilitate presentations on how to design a good wiki page. Thøger was qualified for this task through his role as the designer of the SDU iGEM 2013 and 2014 team wikis, both of which won the special prize on both occasions. During the presentation, Thøger had arranged several exercises where the attendees got to mingle, discuss and evaluate their wikis. This resulted in a steady flow of information and constructive feedback between all three teams.
After a long day of learning and discussing, we went for a tour around campus under the summer sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams, to make the SDU meetup an iGEM tradition.
Attending Meetups
Besides hosting our own meetup, we also attended several meetups during our iGEM experience. The first of which, was the 5th Annual Biobrick Workshop in March, hosted by the Technical University of Denmark, DTU-Denmark. This meetup not only gave us our first experience with Biobricks, but also worked as a foundation for friendships across different teams.
Our second meetup, the Nordic iGEM Conference was hosted by the University of Copenhagen, UCopenhagen, and took place"

Human Practice Overview
The Human Practice part of our project is of great concern and can be divided into two major components: interaction with the public which would influence our experimental design as well as how our device would change the current social situation. The former component could be further categorized into five different areas: expert interviews, social research, safety device, public outreach, and collaboration. Through all these activities, we attempt to inform people of the cyanobacteria's negative influence on environment as well as society. Meanwhile, we want to prove our product's practical value and its applicability in the real aquatic environment. The public outreach is crucial to us, because it eventually shifts our focus from eradicating the cyanobacteria in the lakes to successfully degrading the salvaged cyanobacteria into usable commercial components. The our comprehensive design and achievements are presented in details later.
Integrated Human Practice
Field trip at Lake Taihu
Scientific research need empathy, and our team was shocked to learn through background research that due to the lack of regulation on factories dumping nitrogen and phosphorus waste into the water, the Taihu lake and its complex ecosystem has been threatened by cyanobacteria since the beginning of 21st century. Thus, we visited the Taihu Laboratory for Lake Ecosystem Research affiliated to Chinese Academy of Sciences to learn more about the background information on the current situation of cyanobacteria outbreak in China, governmental control, and practical ways to deal with them. The formal academic discussion with the researchers and the station supervisor was of great help. We learned that the current solutions could not eradicate cyanobacteria completely and backfire secondary problems such as leaving the salvaged cyanobacteria unprocessed. Comparatively, our approach of using the cyanophage lysozyme should be both cost-effective and environmental friendly. Later that day, we also collected water samples from Lake Taihu in order to gain more insights into the problem of cyanobacterial bloom.

Catechu standardisation
A successful attempt in standardising the ratio of catechu:slaked lime required for media formulation.

After interactive sessions with various paanwalas we learnt that the amount of catechu applied to paan is high whereas the amount of slaked lime applied is quite low keeping in mind its inflammatory properties.
With the above information we tried out various ratios of catechu:slaked lime so as to get the maximum intensity of the distinct red colour which is characteristic to the paan stains prevalent across the country.

From the above observations it was concluded that the maximum intensity of red colour obtained  from the solution was from the sample with 1:0.1 Catechu : slaked lime concentration. Hence, the same ratio was used for the preparation of the stock with 10g Catechu and 1g slaked lime of which 1% was used for media preparation.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," work with kit from iGEM Team Austin, Texas 2014
The development of a screening system, which was needed to test for the activity of a synthetase incorporating a ncAA, is a difficult and time consuming task. Therefore, we used a reporter plasmid, which was established and characterized by iGEM Team Austin, Texas, 2014 . It offers the opportunity to approximate incorporation values based on fluorescence proteins. The reporter plasmid codes for mRFP1 and sfGFP which are IPTG inducible. mRFP1 is linked to sfGFP by a sequence which includes the amber stop codon. mRFP1 is (if induced) expressed constitutively and if the orthogonal mutated synthetase is capable of recognizing the ncAA and loading it on the tRNA with the amber anticodon, is followed by sfGFP. Else, the expression stops at the amber stop codon in the linker.
Definition of Incubation Conditions
Decision for host strain
An amberless E. coli strain has been developed which only expresses proteins with stop codons excluding the amber stop codon. For our purpose we chose not to work with this strain. In our working strain E. coli BL21 DE3 gold the release factor 1 competes with the tRNA loaded with the ncAA. Still enough proteins with the amber as a stop codon are expressed funtionally. Moreover, the affinity of the tRNA to the amber stop codon on the mRNA is high enough to incorporate the ncAA in any target protein.
Arrival and Preparation of Test Kit with DNA from Texas
After receiving the test kit the plasmids were recovered in TRIS buffer pH 8.5. The diluted DNA was then transformed in E. coli BL21 DE3 gold cells which were cultivated on LB solid plates. After 1 Day of growth the cells were prepared as overnight cultures. Following the incubation, plasmids were isolated according to protocol.
Preparation of Chemical Competent Cells hosting the reporter plasmid pRXG
The reporter plasmid pRXG was transformed onto LB plates. Subsequently, some colonies were picked for overnight cultures. Thereof cryo cultures were prepared. The plasmids were isolated and sent for sequencing. The cryo cultures were then used to inoculate precultures and prepare chemical competent cells according to the protocol.

My ambition to be in iGEM was its prestige, how cool it was. I was very jealous of my                          friends from our 2016 team, in a good way. They just wouldn't stop talking about how                          iGEM was very cool, fun and how it’d open up so many opportunities. As being the largest                          in its branch, I knew it would be a great platform to learn about synthetic biology,                          genetics and project-making. It had taught me a lot; cooperating, with my team, general                          public and fellow scientists from all over the world. I saw how complete strangers gladly                          work together in the name of science, which astonished me the most. Also, I knew It’d be                          a blast."

Ligations of ASR-RBS + GFP and GadA-RBS + GFP worked! We miniprepped the overnight cultures of GadA - 9 samples. We digested 64 bp spacer (8/19 45C) and pSB4A5 (8/9) with E and P. Ran a 60 mL 1% gel. We digested Lpp-RBS with S and P and PCR purified. We inoculated Asr-RBS2+GFP2 and GadA-RBS2+GFP2 in SOB and on amp plates.
Day 50, August 22
We gel purified 64 bp spacer and pSB4A5 from yesterday’s digest. We then ligated the 64 bp spacer into pSB4A5, with 6:1 and 3:1 ratio. He also transformed. We prepared GadA-RBS, ASR-RBS, LPP-RBS, ASR-short, ASR-long, GadA, and GFP for sequencing. We ran PCR product of 128bp spacer on gel. Then she PCR purified. Samson re-made the M9 media, this time without cassamino acids and with thiamine.

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

Liquid Crystal Molecules Perturbations Model
The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and                     predict the process and consequence of biological systems. We developed two models, the radial                     domino model and the blooming model to describe the potential perturbation mechanism and                     interaction modes between protein particles and liquid crystal molecules. The protein density                     threshold can be calculated by this model.
Purpose
An important part of our liquid crystal experiment is to determine an optimal antigen                         concentration, so we creatively proposed two models to calculate the β2-M density                         microscopically. The trouble is that we do not know the range of antigen molecules that can                         perturb liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, we consulted the relevant parameters, proposed two                         models, calculated the range of the single antigen molecule to perturb the liquid crystal, and                         finally determined the threshold of the antigen concentration, which was consistent with our                         experimental results.

Hypothesis
Fig.4 Two possible mechanisms for β2-M to disturb liquid                                     crystal
The process of protein perturbation of liquid crystal molecules is particularly complicated, so                         we can only guess the disturbance mechanism on our own. Inspired by dominoes and the blossoming                         of flowers, we proposed that there might be two mechanisms of disruption. We called them RADIAL                         DOMINO MODEL and BLOOMING MODEL
Fig.5 RADIAL DOMINO MODEL
Simplify the β2-M and 5CB as ball and stick. The distance between each two sticks is                         equal. Due                         to the interference of the ball, the first stick next to the ball will be inclined at an angle.                         The first stick will affect the next stick until the last stick is aligned vertically.
Fig.6 BLOOMING MODEL
This model is actually an extension of the previous model. Simplify the 5CB into one side of the                         polygons. As the molecular shells increases, the angle between the two sides of the polygon will                         tend to be 90°.

How are we doing it?
LAMP is a highly specific, efficient and rapid DNA amplification technique that uses 4-6 primers that bind to 6-8 distinct regions of target DNA. This technique was shown to be more specific than colony PCR without the need for heat lysis or centrifugation steps. Since the NYU Abu Dhabi iGEM team cares deeply about biosafety, the selectivity of our system was tested using the rfbE gene, a non-toxic coding sequence required for O157-antigen synthesis. A part containing this sequence was created and transformed into DH5α in order to obtain a strain that we could use in our trials. This way, we managed to test our device without employing a toxic strain of E. coli, ensuring the safety of our project and protecting the environment of the United Arab Emirates.

The reaction temperature of 65˚C was achieved using the Peltier system supplied with a 6V, 1.5A external power supply. The reaction was visualized under UV and blue light. It is envisioned that a smartphone will suffice for capturing the output of the reaction.5
Why E.coLAMP?
Our device offers a novel method to aid in pathogen surveillance by allowing every individual to become citizen scientists. With our easy-to-use device, which can be tailored for the detection of any known pathogen or virus, our device allows for the better collection of statistics to track and prevent potential outbreaks. This information can be combined on a cloud-based app that can be sorted to provide actionable data and allow public health officials and scientists to better understand the emergence and spread of diseases.
After surveying potential device users hailing from various parts of the world, we discovered that there was a shortage of quick and reliable methods to detect pathogenic E. coli. Most available methods are time- and resource-consuming, as they require the expertise of laboratory-trained technicians. More than 70% of the survey participants indicated the need of a method to detect pathogenic E. coli in less than 30 minutes. In response to this, we tailored our device to complete a diagnostic reaction within 20 minutes from the the beginning of sample submission to the attainment of the fluorescence signal.
There is a lack of stringent government regulations regarding food safety in many parts of the world. As most food vendor stalls are not subjected to government procedures and regulations about"

Safety
safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we"

The plasmid extraction is successful. We observe the plasmid in the agarose gel (including C0079, R0079, J23116).But the plasmid strips are very strange. So we do the electrophoresis of C0079, R0079, J23116, K081009, E0430 and I13453.We find that we have to redo the plasmid extraction of K081009,C0079. Therefore, we take out our medium and repick the other colonies and put the tubes into shaker.

The plasmid extraction is successful. All the plasmid we need have already been extracted. Then Ms. Yang shows us the method of digestion. At first, we learn the use of Bio Photometer. And then we need calculate the mole of the target plasmid. At last, we put the solution to target plasmid, corresponding digestion enzyme, double distilled water and BSA into a tube (including B0034, C0079, B0015).

From part sequences in the Registry, we selected the the blue chromoprotein amiCFP (K592010), the yellow chromoprotein amilGFP (K592009), and the classic red fluorescent protein (RFP, E1010). These parts were selected due to their excellent presentation by the 2011 Uppsala iGEM team. we designed custom ribosomal binding sites for each open reading frame using the Salis RBS calculator ( https://salis.psu.edu/software/ ) to give consistent medium-high expression levels (designed transcription initiation rate 50k), ordered the sequences synthesized as gBlocks (IDT), and assembled them. Promoters were selected from the Anderson collection of constitutive sigma 70 promoters of various strengths. These promoters were trimmed outside the -10 and -35 boxes, and the bases in the interior region have been varied to limit recombination when multiple promoters are used in the same system (Pr-1-5, Pr-Lac, Pr-Tet). For details on the promoters, see our Parts page.
The calculated rbs elements were approximately 4x the calculated value of rbs B0034 (used universally by the Uppsala team). We therefore chose the relatively weak promoter Pr-2 to drive the constructs (Parts: Figure 4). While the amilCP plasmid produced intensely blue colonies after 24 hours of growth, the amilGFP and RFP plasmids only developed slight colouration over several days. We therefore modified our parts as follows: for RFP and amilGFP, the engineered RBSes were replaced with B0034.
We realized that taking the time to choose the  right promoters from the beginning would be important for our later work. At the early stages of our lab training we noticed that plating cells transformed with the RFP expressing plasmid J04450 (also using B0034) developed strong colour but were noticeably smaller than colonies not expressing RFP. We also noticed that a few serial passages of  cells containing J04450, resulted in a fraction of the plated cells that had lost RFP expression altogether. This made us worry that too strong colour expression might be toxic leading to slow growth and plasmid instability. In contrast, we also worried that too weak promoters would not produce the intensity of colour that we would need for convincing visual effects.
The approach we eventually decided on was to combine all of our synthesized promoters into a single ligation mix containing our three cut parental colour plasmids and let nature sort out the problem by providing us with a range of"

ithin our community, and surrounding Northern communities, there is a collective absence regarding interest in synthetic biology. Furthermore, our team is dedicated to sharing the field of synthetic biology with the public, but especially young learners to garner interest and excitement about the amazing world synthetic biology has to offer. With all of our team members haven grown up in Northern British Columbia, we reflected on our elementary and high school experiences, and recognized that what was collectively missing was enthusiasm for science and introductions to the ample fields that exist. Therefore, we wanted to have a synthetic biology presence in our community and those surrounding to introduce eager learners, and youth specifically to synthetic biology and its vast applications.
This year, our team brought ‘Synthetic Biology to the North’ in the following ways:
Northern Education
Activity Book for Elementary School Students.
We created a synthetic biology activity book for use in elementary schools. Each activity we included is interactive and fun, meant to introduce young learners to introductory synthetic biology concepts and how to follow scientific procedures. Every activity includes background knowledge the teacher can use to explain the science behind the experiment as well as learning objectives to highlight the most important points, it also includes procedures and materials. We wanted to make sure this could be used in all elementary school classrooms so we made sure that all required materials are inexpensive and easily obtained! Once the book was developed we reached out to both private and public elementary schools across Northern BC, including our hometown Prince George, and over 15 other towns spanning the region. Our outreach was enthusiastically received and elementary school teachers were eager to use the activity book in their classrooms!
Science Alliance Camps
In the summer months, our local museum runs science camps for kids of various age groups. This year we collaborated with the Science Alliance camp for kids aged 4-6. For each camp in July and August members of our team were welcomed as guests to teach the kids about DNA. For each group we first talked about DNA in a fun and interactive way then walked the kids, in pairs, through a strawberry DNA extraction. We then built tooth-pick and marshmallow DNA double helices. For this we talked about the fundamental structure of DNA and proper base-pairing. We then used the vacuum chamber to “blow-up” the marshmallow DNA. These"

A funny workflow of our synthetic biology model!
Alkanes Pathway:
The alkane production works trough the Lux Operon usage. This construct contains 4 genes, which we can separate into three sub units.
The first subunit, the FAR complex, is responsible for transforming fatty acids into fatty aldehydes by the transgenic cell.
The second subunit, the BBa_K590031 biobrick, designed by the 2011 Washington iGEM Team, transform aldehydes into alkanes.
The final alkane has a variable chain length, which is dependent on the fatty acids lenght provided to the transgenic cell.
That's where the K654058 biobrick synthesized by the 2011 Utah State University takes the spotlight. The K654058 biobrick has genes coding for enzymes that cleave and stop the process of fatty acid elongation by the cell. The C14 fatty acids formed yield C13 alkanes, almost exclusively.
The synthetic biology construct we have couples the production of alkanes from fatty acids using a trangenic E.coli resitant to fatty acid rich medium because of tocopherol production.
Simplified representation of the alkane complex function. K654058 in blue. Alkane formation in red. Adapted from HOWARD, et.al. 2013.
Tocopherol Pathway
The second part of our project involves the cloning of the tocopherol complex. There are 2 necessary composites: FPP and IPP for the successful transformation.
Our first gene encodes a synthase that condenses FPP and IPP into a single phosphate.
A reductase then acts on the composite and transform it into yet another phosphate.
A transferase enzyme then combines the previously formed phosphate with homogentisic acid, resulting in a benzoquinol.
Finally a cyclase is needed for last step, resulting in the tocopherol synthesis.
There is also an encoded enzyme that catalyzes the homogentisic acid formation, allowing the bacteria to work more efficiently.
Biobrick Evaluation
Since our project is using a biobrick designed by the 2011 Washington, we wanted to first check if the parts we received were indeed functional.
To do that, we transformed E.coli cells with the PetroBrick composite from their project ( BBa_K590025 ). First we amplified the part with the transformed cells growth and miniprep. Then, using the purified plasmids, we transformed another batch of E.coli and inoculated these ones into optimum medium.
This biobrick basically"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," team went to MIT for a basic wet-lab training with Prof. Natalie Kuldell, who used to teach Genetics/BISC 219 labs at Wellesley.  Those unfamiliar with synthetic biology received an introduction to the field, and we watched a videotaped presentation from the MIT '06 iGEM team, to gain a better understanding of how the iGEM competition format worked.  Also, we were given an extensive introduction to what is expected in the human practices portion of the iGEM competition, and another introduction on doing interdisciplinary research (the different perspectives between engineers and lab scientists).
Even better, after that we were able to participate in two different basic wet labs, one that is based on the Eau d'Coli lab, and another lab in creating beta-galactosidase assays.  My lab partner, Consuelo, and I both realized that the experience was immensely valuable and incredibly eye-opening.
Wendy and Nicole working hard in the wet-lab.
We both agreed that several factors led to efficient completion of an experiment: labelling, following instructions, and communicating.  We ran into problem again and again when we repeatedly mislabeled the tubes and confused our reagents, forcing us to restart repeated.  We also found it at times challenging to follow the instructions in the format they were written in, simply because while reactions were happening we didn't have time to both read multiple paragraphs and pipette every 15 seconds.  The wet-lab experience was eye-opening, and made us realize if the ELN is to be implemented that several features, such as highlighting, and labeling tools, among many others, needed to be added.
Casey and Linda working hard in the lab too.
Wednesday, 6/6: Today my group- Kara, Nahum, and I- started working on a powerpoint presentation in preparation for the brainstorming meeting with Orit tomorrow.  We are working on researching past research in development of ELNs, and dividing up functions based on modality.  Casey and I are also looking up research related to microinteractions that can be performed on the beast.  We are particularly interested in Sifteo cubes and PaperLens.
Thursday, 6/7: Today we had a meeting with Orit on things we learned about the ELN, and presented to her in a format of a Powerpoint.  Since this is a preview of things we will be presenting about on Monday, the meeting was rather short.

After carrying out the transformation protocol on 20/8/2018, the plates were left for overnight incubation. After ~14-18hr incubation, the following results were observed:
All colonies on X-gal plates were white, possibly suggesting that LacZ was disrupted and kanR is present in the cell. However, to exclude false positives, a crucial control is required: BL21DE3 on LB+X-Gal+IPTG, to reassure that the parental strain has intact lacZ in the first place.

Friendship with PKU_Beijing Team & Tsinghua Team
PKU_Beijing Team visited us on July 25th, just 3 days after the solar eclipse. It was a pity that they didn't enjoy the very rare chance together with us, but we had a nice time discussing iGEM affairs, hunging out to NanJing west Road and ChengHuang temple. PKU team has really helped us a lot sparing nothing to share their winning experience and failure lessons as well as project design and experimental techniques. We have benefited a great deal from their thought exchange. We also shared our inspirations knowledge and exploration with them, including the experience learnt from the 2009 iGEM Workshop in London. We also showed them our lovely and robust lab, Bio-X Center, presented them the research projects in detail, and let them try our advanced technologies.

During the divulgation sessions in which we explained our personalized                             sensor project, we noticed that many people were surprised by the fact that the sensor would                             be built upon their DNA sequence.
As we decided to keep the focus of our education and public engagement                             activities on the necessities of the people who participated in it, we realized that we                             could do some kind of workshop to let them know the information storage capability of DNA.                             This is how the DNA information storage workshop was born. You can check the script created                             to encode a written message into DNA .
Natural information on DNA:
We prepared a postcard to explain how many information                                         is stored in the genome of a single cell or in a single human body. To give                                         sense to that large amount of data we calculated the quantity of DIN-A4 papers                                         that would be needed in order to write all the DNA sequence of the genome of a                                         single cell in a standard font (Courier New, 12) and standard margins. This                                         way, everyone without biology or computation* knowledge could also imagine the                                         quantity of information.
*(sometimes the quantity of DNA information is expressed in bytes, which is not suitable for the general population, especially                                         older people). It turns out that a normal somatic human female cell has 2                                         dotations of 23 chromosomes (including 2 X sex chromosomes) and mitochondrial                                         DNA. This is a total of two times 3,088,286,401 base pairs, according to the                                         latest human genome sequence release (GRCh38.p12). A single D"

), to cause various genome modifications and rapidly select for cells with increased
3HPA
productivity (Figure 9). (See also link to ori characterization of the part collection for a description).   We looked into literature and found 16 possible genome modifications for
3HPA
production made by other groups.   Table 2 shows a list of all modifications.   Our plan was to order oligos for each of these modifications, leading to upregulation, downregulation, deletion or site-directed mutagenesis of the respective gene.   The aimed modification for each gene is shown in the table. For the next step we decided to use natural transformation for integration of these oligos into the strain.   Because each cell will take up different numbers and different combinations of oligos, we will get a population of genomic variations ( link to method section of Strain Engineering ).   The genetically diverse population can then be put into
FACS
and we can select for cells with the strongest signal and thereby the best productivity.   Finally, the whole cycle of
MAGE
and
FACS
can be repeated, leading to continuously improved pathways. We believe that the combination of
MAGE
-
FACS
with the fast growth of V. natriegens will speed up the process of metabolic engineering and pathway optimization significantly!
Figure 9: Our workflow for directed evolution via MAGE-FACS
To use the fast growth of V. natriegens we designed a workflow for directed evolution. It combines MAGE with FACS and starts with the introduction of oligos for genome modifications into our strain. The usage of randomized oligos with variable bases increases the genetic diversity. By using FACS together with our biosensors we are able to rapidly select the most promising strains and can analyse their genetic composition. This finding can be re-feeded into the DBTL-cycle to start a new round in the workflow leading to a continously improved pathway.
Outlook
In our project we try to accelerate the process of metabolic engineering in all of its facets and thereby find a suitable pathway variant to achieve high
3HPA
productivity.   Nevertheless, there will still be many possibilities to further improve the production of
3HPA
in V. natriegens. Table 2 shows a list of 16 genome modifications, that were made in other organisms with the same or a similar pathway to direct the flow towards

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Interview2_-_-_TEXT.html," say: “No! Everything, but not our food!”
Q: But if we now consider that we can show drastic advantages and we can disprove the problems of coexistence then would it be best to leave people their economic freedom and allow genetic engineering of plants?
A: Well we are talking about a trend. If 135 national counsellors say “No” to GMPs then we’re talking about a trend. And if we go further down to the people the percentage will be even bigger. We had of course also people in the parliament that wanted to forbid genetic engineering once and for all, including the research. My position there is to keep the research safe and wait for the breakthrough. Cultivation experiments however, the ones that are prohibited, should be done in big agricultural states not here in Switzerland. But the research is important and we want to preserve it.
Q: How do you explain the paradox that medical GMOs that are used for drug production are accepted, but genetically modified plants are handled completely different?
A: There is a large difference between extraordinary situations, in which people will allow much more, and ordinary situations. The most important thing for people in Switzerland is their health, they want to stay healthy and eat healthy food. Nobody wants to take risks and until now no one has shown that GMOs are risk-free.
Q: Do you think that the farmer’s association was one or even „the“ driving force to get to this Gen-Tech-Stop?
A: Yes, you can say that. People have confidence in us as the farmer’s association and this brings large responsibility. Agriculture makes a large part of the beauty of Switzerland. People come to Switzerland because of our quality of life which is certainly determined also through our beautiful nature. And nature on the other hand is shaped by agriculture. And in the end it is the farmers that will be affected the most from genetic engineered plants, because if the consumers fear GMPs it will directly impact their buying behaviour and this could be negative for the farmers.
Q: We see you are not a fundamentalist. But do you see also the potential of GMOs, like for example ""Golden Rice""?
A: Yes, i think genetically modified plants have a large potential. But I think we have to carefully examine everything. We are currently running towards many big challenges, like climate change and increasing population. We may in the future be in need of plants that can grow in dry conditions. But we now have no hunger in Switzerland; nobody in this country knows the problem of hunger. So the potential is found more in the Third World.

  In order to promote the concept of synthetic biology, iGEM teams from SUSTC went to several high schools to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM competition. Here is their performance in Shenzhen Foreign Language School.
  
  Yicong Tao and Zishan Wu did most of the presentation. Here's what Yicong felt after his speech:
   ""I went to Shenzhen Foreign languages school with iGEM - Shenzhen B's team members to introduce synthetic biology to high school students. We gave a presentation that was carefully prepared in order to make it as easier to be understood as possible. Though the students there didn't know much about biology, even genetic engineering, they were very interested in our presentation and asked a lot of questions about synthetic biology and our participation in iGEM. In short, our trip was a huge success.""

IIT-Madras,2016,Team:IIT-Madras#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,") in 2001 for generating awareness about the importance of genetic resources to food security. Dr. Sahai is founder Chairperson of the Gene Campaign which is a leading research and advocacy organization, working on issues relating to food, nutrition and livelihoods.
In our skype interview with her. She talked about technical, economical and political issues of GM technology as such and in the context of India. Her views can be described as followings:
In Genetic Modification technology, we perform changes in the genetic makeup of cells e.g. adding extra genes form different species or deleting a gene. Such gene alterations can have new unwanted product and it has been found in case animal models, mice models, which were fed with GM foods. There are serious Bio-safety issues with GM organisms. Certain parameters are almost impossible to be tracked such as the changes in the genetic makeup of cells over generations e.g. jumping genes, confirmation of the desired genetic changes in the cell over generation, huge cost for genome wide sequencing to see if the modifications has not happened in other part of genome. Overall, Bio-safety tests should be more stringent and should give information regarding genome and gene propagation. From economical and political point of view, any technology should not be thrown upon the public, its adoption should be done democratically, which is only when it's requirement and necessity is felt. Therefore, it is necessary to perform cost & benefit analysis on any GM product. As GM technology possess certain risks like any other technology, risk & benefit analysis should also be performed. If we look at the journey of GM technology, it hasn't done any significant benefit to the community yet. So, we might need to start looking for alternative ways to solve our problems e.g. use of pest control measures instead of Bt in Bt-cotton or pesticides. The biggest problem of the Indian agriculture system is water crisis because 70% of our agriculture dependent on monsoon.
On the issue of past and present Indian governments handling field trial, permission for cultivation of GM crops, she believes that open field trials are done with carelessness and there is a huge risk of spreading of GM seeds into environment. Farmers should be consulted before doing field trials in their field. They should also be well informed about the implications of GM crops.
When asked about the awareness regarding GM technology implications among consumer and farmers, she asserted that awareness level is very very low and there is a need for public and private funded awareness programs and workshops to educate farmers and consumers. Regarding the patent regime in the country, she was completely the monopolization of seeds via GM seed patenting as they would increase the cost of seeds and"

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," Only few people claimed that they were not interested in it and far less people said they didn't like biology at all. Considering that our high school students are under so much pressure from National College Entrance Examination and some high school are too poor to afford technologies and apparatus, our results indicated a really good reality that almost everyone was willing to accept this new science and technology.
Second, as for how to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology, we summarize two points.
On the one hand, popularizing iGEM and synthetic biology via internet can reach a good effect because nearly half of these high school students said they heard iGEM and synthetic biology from the internet. We all think wiki is really a good platform to popularize synthetic biology and communicate with other iGEMers. What's more, publishing more books relating to synthetic biology and iGEM is also a good conduit to let synthetic biology and iGEM known by other people, especially the young.
On the other hand, teacher and parents seem to have difficulties in accepting a new technology in China or in the whole world so that students can't learn some interesting and impressive new science and technologies from adults. It's very common in China but we, as a new generation, should try our best to realize the rapid changing of our society.
Future plans
Finally we drew some conclusion to improve our survey next time. In order to obtain results that are more valid we should launch a more widely circulated survey. In addition, perhaps more copies can be distributed at random to the general public. On the other hand, it's really important to make an effective and smart questionnaire to get a more cogent result. Maybe we can make two kinds of questionnaire to hand out before and after the lecture to compare to get a better conclusion.
Collaborations
First
We collaborated with Purdue iGEM team to create a definitive characterization standard for the parts registry. All the teams participated required to fill out a survey which about the important items in the registry page. Purdue iGEM team worked out a standard protocol which contains all of the details. The other teams need to complete it better or put forward some questions and problems. To make this work easy, we had a video meeting with the Purdue iGEM team and USP Brazil team though the GOOGLE HANGOUTS. It really helped us to exchange the opinions just like face to face.
As we know, the members of this collaboration are currently over 50 teams so that it is the biggest collaboration in the iGEM history. We feel awesome about what we did!
Second
We provided parts BBa_C0061 and"
Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week6_-_-_TEXT.html," silico where these parameters were changed to study the effect on such a system. The results can be summarised as follows:
Increasing the total repressing 'araC' (or equivalent repressor usually present in the cell) ten-fold reduced the rate of output at a given time and the lowest input concentration from five-fold.
Reducing K_x one-hundred fold shifted the concentration at which rate of output shifted from low to high, and a reduction to nearly zero of the lowest concentration rate of output was seen. This is possibly because at the time taken the rate of output was not in the vicinity of the steady state maximum. However, reducing K_x implies increased affinity of repressor for its sequence upstream of the promoter, so it would be expected to shift the input concentrations required to get an 'on' response.
Changing K_a also shifted the 'switching level' concentration, but towards lower concentrations. Expected this as decrease in K_a increases arabinose-repressor affinity. Also the 'basal' level of output was returned to 0.1 because this system will build to the maximum rate of output for a given concentration faster.
Decreasing K_p did not shift the switching position (disappointing as it is hoped that different activator-promoter combinations will switch at different input levels), but did raise the rate of output at the lowest concentrations significantly. Decreasing K_p increases activator-promoter affinity in effect, so it would be expected as the system will respond to small levels of activator produced strongly.
Increase in d_p, the rate of activator degradation, meant that the time taken to reach a steady rate of output production was longer.
The rate of output production chosen was that at the greatest time. Whilst this was not necessarily steady, we are looking at the potential visible outputs and what is important is the visible output after some length of time, not when we can be sure that the system has reached steady state.
Wet Work
Melanin pigment production
Examined the control plates made on Friday:
The picture clearly shows that the pigment production is due to the transformed cells, rather than conditions in the plate, or interactions between cell and the plate.
Making MelA BioBrick
The first PCR was carried out to removve one of the PstI restriction sites. (primers A/B and primers C/F) The first attempt only A/B worked, so this was repeated using Touchdown PCR, with two samples for each primer pair (one with DMSO and one without). The PCR was left running overnight.

Note: Each sample was documented as to which well it was placed in. This was useful information for comparing conditions and reactants of the PCR so that if an experiment was repeated, it could be improved for better results.
8. The lid was put on the well and set so that the samples are starting closest to the negative (black) end so that the samples would run toward the positive (red) end.
9. The voltage machine was set so that it read between 100-120 V so that the separation could occur in a timely fashion.
10. The gel was run until the dyed bands were approximately halfway through the gel.
11. The gel was removed from the well and then ultraviolet light was used to compare the ladder to the samples that were run.
12. If the band was in the correct region for the desired product, the experiment proceeded to gel extraction. If not, PCR was repeated altering one or two of the reactants in hopes to improve the end result.
Gel Extraction
Purpose: Gel extraction is the next step after the desired results from gel electrophoresis have been obtained. For this procedure, the band from the gel is cut out and then the gel is dissolved and filtered so that only the DNA from that segment of the gel remains. This DNA is then used for subsequent experiments and can be sequenced when it is inserted in a plasmid.
Procedure:
1. Microcentrifuge tubes, equal to the number of samples that were extracted, were weighed and recorded.
2. An extraction knife and tweezers were wiped with ethanol in order to remove any contaminants.
3. The desired bands of the gel were cut out and put in to the pre-weighed microcentrifuge tubes.
4. The tubes were weighed again, with the gel inside of them.
5. Three times the weight OF THE GEL in µL of Agarose Dissolving Buffer (ADB) was added to the tube.          Example: If the microcentrifuge tube was 0.98g and the tube with the gel was added weight 1.28g, then 90 µL of ADB should be added to the tube.
6. The gel was left to dissolve in an oven at 60 C until the agarose was completely dissolved. It was periodically taken out of the oven and vortexed to assure that all of the gel was adequately dissolved.
7. After the gel was completely dissolved. The contents of the centrifuge tube were added to a Hi-Bind column and then"

We also sent them twenty sterilized samples collected by a Local Public Health Organisation from different wells - this organisation has also provided data on arsenic concentrations gained from flame atomic absorption spectrometry measurements.
Method of testing
The contact person of Team Edinburgh 2006 sent us the protocol should be used according to their experiments. We collected samples from two wells which were known to contain elevated arsenic concentration (Szegfű and Madách street, Békéscsaba, Hungary). Find these places using Google Maps: [3] , [4]
We used DH5 alpha E. coli cell line with lacZDM15 mutation as host cells, than we prepared a medium consisting of:
2.0 g/l peptone
0.1 g/l yeast extract
0.3 g/l K2HPO4
2.1 g/l NaHCO3
a pinch of the indiciator powder: Bromothymol blue
10 g/l lactose
Autoclaved or filter-sterilized water sample dilutions
We spiked these media with transformed bacterial cells containing the arsenic biosensor system, and incubated 24 hours at 37°C.
Results
We received that the part works also on real world samples, not only on samples made of water and sodium-arsenate. The colour change of Bromothymol Blue seemed to be directly proportional to the concentration of arsenic. According to the reference dilutions made from Na-arsenate and MilliQ water the concentration of arsenic in our collected samples is at least 15-fold higher than the WHO recommended limit (Fig.1., Fig.2., Fig.3.).

The Adventure of Baxter Bacteria
Overview
One of our main goals was to create a lasting impact on society's perception of synthetic biology.  What better way to influence children and adults than publishing a book? The Adventures of Baxter Bacteria teaches young children about the potential of synthetic biology in a fun and creative story.  The narrative recounts the wonderful journey of Baxter Bacteria and his pet plasmid, Vector, as they travel through the world facing many challenges.  Included at the end of the book is a parental guide designed for parents to not only teach their children about synthetic biology but themselves as well.  Terms such as plasmid, bacteria, and virus are all explained making the book a powerful learning tool for all ages.  What happens to Baxter and Vector in their big adventure?  You will have to read it for yourself to find out!  And it rhymes :)

1.Summary
Recent research proves, NO-cGMP pathway has important significance to angiocardiopathy's treatment. Target related to the pathway has recently been widely discussed in drug research and development. As members of Modeling team of iGEM in South China University of Technology, we hope to explore NO-cGMP pathway on the aspects of mathematical theory and model.
We analysed the pathway's primary link's situation,including using ODE to analyse the process of NO activating sGC and Michealis Equation to analyse cGMP's synthesis and degradation.
According to the differential equation derived from the theory, we got the relationship between the yield of sGC in different states,the yield of cGMP,  the production and degradation rate of cGMP and time,and the relationship between the yield of bioactive sGC, cGMP and NO by using Matlab programing. In addition, we studied the effect of different feedback inhibition levels of cGMP on the amount of the above, and the relationship was used as the feasible criteria for the study of this pathway.
Due to the limitations of our students' own level, the process of producing PKG in the cGMP can only be based on the experience of the usual mathematical modeling, using the normalized method and Hill Equation for a little analysis.
In order to study the relationship between the amount of cGMP and sGC, we also use Matlab to draw the image of the relationship by using the fitting function, so as to have a more intuitive understanding of the process.
Although scientists are not thorough enough about the study of Lentivirus, the iGEM modeling group still wants to use the existing model to establish a mathematical model to describe the process of gene transfection and combination in cells.
2.Theory
2.1 NO activates sGC
NO activates sGC from substrate state D1 to activated state D2. sGC is a kind of heterodimer whose center is composed of two subunits, which are called the α and β subunits of ferroheme. NO stimulates sGC by combining sGC’s ferroheme(300-700 times). Recent research shows the combining mechanism is involved with two steps: During the first step, NO combines substrate sGC to"

In order to address this, we included an IPTG inducible promoter into the plasmids to allow for IPTG induced expression of protein.  Introducing IPTG into the cell media would activate transcription and subsequently production of protein.
Figure 4: An example of a lumio gel done on a DXS synthase precursor experiment.
For an initial product test, we scraped three colonies from our plates containing bacteria with the latex operon and three colonies from our plates containing bacteria with our DXS Synthase product. Protein extraction was done on the soluble fractions for all 6 cultures, as well as the insoluble fractions for all DXS colonies. Our protein extract was run on a LUMIO gel, with DXS Synthase and the Latex Operon both appearing within the soluble fraction(Figure 4).
Although we confirmed the synthesis of both proteins in our initial constructs, we quickly realized that we needed to Gibson Assembly our DXS Synthase gene into pUC19 as an alternative backbone.  This is owing to the fact that both pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 share the same ORI, which could result in homologous recombination of the plasmids when both are transfected into the same cell.  Consequently, both the latex operon and DXS plasmid needed to have a different ORI. Primers were reordered to complete PCR, Gibson Assembly, and PCR cleanup for pUC19 and our DXS synthase gene.  The finished pUC19+DXS construct was then miniprepped and transformed into the T7 express cells containing the latex operon.  Colonies grew successfully on LB plates with ampicillin (pUC19) and chloramphenicol (pSB1C3) resistance, as expected. These colonies were then grown up in liquid culture for latex extraction.

After E. coli cells have been transfected with both plasmids, a supplement of magnesium sulfate, IPTG, and glucose is necessary to induce protein expression, activity, and cis-p"

For cloning into this plasmid, we removed our genes from PSB1C3-HNS, PSB1C3-HNS-T108I, PSB1C3-PotB59/PomA plasmids with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with the same enzymes. We transformed ligated products into BL21 bacteria strain that we know it has T7 RNA polymerase.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be 360 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands are expected to be at 744 bp line for HNS and HNS-T108I, 2045 bp line for PotB59/PomA.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes for cut-check.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly_-_-_TEXT.html," Plug 'n' Play assembly standard can be found here (BBF RFC 80).
How it works
We have demonstrated that successful assembly of up to six biological parts in one reaction is possible e.g. (BBa_K678068) . The entire process of combining six BioBricks is illustrated in the figure below. The number of BioBricks can be adjusted as preferred and for instance mutations can easily be introduced by customizing the standard.
The procedure of assembly
Please refer to our Plug 'n' Play with DNA assembly standard BBF RFC 80 for a detailed protocol.
Pre-produced PCR products are selected from the Plug 'n' Play kit.
USER enzyme mix and buffer is added. This will remove the uracils, resulting in sticky ends on all BioBricks.  The BioBricks and the backbone plasmid have matching sticky ends, and will self-assemble.
Chemical transformation of E. coli. The time of the final incubation of the transformation mix can be reduced to 30 min when using ampicillin as antibiotic resistance marker and still results in a high number of transformants.     If a part is not included in the Plug 'n' Play kit a simple PCR amplification can be performed on the part intended for the assembly in accordance to the Customization .
Plug 'n' Play benefits
Improvements of BBF RFC 39
No need to use a USER cassette, thereby completely avoiding the use of restriction enzymes and increasing the flexibility of the system.
Standardized linkers
What you get
Rapid assembly of biological parts
A well documented system
Assembly of multiple biobricks in one step
No illegal restriction sites
100% restriction enzyme free
100% DNA ligase free
High fidelity ensured by PfuTurbo® 7x Hotstart DNA polymerase
Directionality of inserts are supported
Any vector can be made Plug’n’Play compatible
Suitable for large scale high throughput projects
Vectors for Plug 'n' Play have been prepared by PCR ensuring 100% linear fragments. This means that the occurrence of false positives after bacterial transformation can be completely avoided (2).
The USER compatible backbone vectors were made by PCR amplification with primers containing the standardized linkers 6 and 1.  For all the PCR reactions it is important to remove the template vector before utilizing it in the USER reaction to avoid inauspicious transformations and false positives. The template can be removed by DpnI treatment or by gel band purification(2).
Previous studies have demonstrated a high level of correct assembly and directionality of fragments (2,3"

During the interview, we noticed some description about nematodes in the algricultrual reference book he offered.
Then we chatted to inhabitants in their houses. They said that they often asked the pesticide retailer we had talk before for farming and killing pests. They would only care about visible pests in agricultural work instead of invisible nematodes, therefore they didn’t know much about nematodes.
We found that villagers lacked basic knowledge about nematodes. To develop their knowledge, we popularized knowledge about nematodes and the damage nematodes might do in detail.
To verify whether there was a potential possibility of nematode problem by ourselves, we also brought soil and plant samples back from Ceyu Town and did further analysis in our laboratory to help local villagers know about pest situation in there farmland. We acquaint lots of kind villagers who supported us warmly and gave us abundant suggestions and feedback during the investigation. This trip also makes us get the chance to learn about the situation in the practical production process so that we can combine our project with the reality smoothly. Meanwhile, we helped local residents a lot in many ways – we have learned that local agricultural workers don’t know much about invisible pests so they won’t be able to take emergency measures when they face to nematode problem. So it’s important to popularize damage that nematodes will make and design a thorough and emergency plan in the future.

Safety mechanism
In order to have a further understanding of other countries’ policies of bio-safety, we surfed the homepage of the iGEM 2015 and had a brief understanding about other teams’ project. We collected the teams which had the correlative subject with our team and e-mailed them in order to communicate with them about topics related to the human practice. We asked them common plant diseases in their country and the related laws and regulations of bio-safety. The questions are shown as the following.
Did you do any survey about agricultural disasters? If you did, what kind of disease did the crops suffer form?
Does the government have any policies or laws about the protection of farmers’ right?
Does the government have any policies or laws about the bio-safety?
How about the usage of pesticides?
According to the email replied, we have a brief understanding of how other teams do human practice. The most common forms are interviews, questionnaire surveys or others alike. In addition, they told us about the situation of plant diseases, the usage of pesticides and the regulations about bio-safety"

MiniTn7. Overview
Development of BioBrick parts relies heavily on the use of a set of plasmid vectors that are only replicative in Escherichia coli and the enterics. While this approach has been successful for many projects, there are a number of concerns that we believe should be addressed in order to augment the palette of possibilities that can be exploited in Synthetic biology based on standard parts.
Plasmid stability. Although many plasmids are relatively stable in a culture setting, it is customary to maintain antibiotic selection to prevent plasmid loss, but this is often not possible in an industrial setting or in the environment. A small subpopulation lacking the plasmid may quickly overtake the culture, especially after repeated subculturing, because of the relief of the energetic burden of plasmid replication.
Plasmid copy number. Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements that occur in a variable number of copies. Plasmids generally used in iGEM range from 15-20 to nearly 2000 copies per chromosome. In addition, the plasmid copy number may fluctuate from cell to cell due to drift in the replication process. On the other hand, many Synthetic biology projects require rewiring regulatory circuits with components that are not meant to be present in multiple copies. This may provoke unwanted effects, such as the titration of trans-acting elements, that lead to a decrease in the robustness of the resulting circuit.
Potential for horizontal transfer. Plasmids have been shown to mediate horizontal transfer by conjugation or transformation. The possibility of horizontal transfer of plasmids, including drug resistance markers, make plasmid-bearing strains unsuitable for applications involving the release of bacterial strains to the environment.
