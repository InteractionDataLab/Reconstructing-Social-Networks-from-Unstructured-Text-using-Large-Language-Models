Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," VR iGEM primers (Figure 18). As can be seen in the image, there is a strong band near the 1000 bp mark where we would expect to see it. Next, we set up a large (250-500 mL) liquid culture for each of the cells expressing the chromoprotein then extracted the expressed protein using 3 mL HisPur Ni-NTA nickel columns . The extracted protein was then dialyzed and concentrated using microfiltration centrifuge tubes in order to perform heat tests.
To heat test the extracted protein, we pipetted 3 ul of the concentrated protein onto a sheet of cellulose paper with wax wells printed on it. After it dried we pipetted another 3 µl into the same well (Figure 19). Once it was dry for the second time we put it into the oven that was preheated to 55 °C. CupidPink, VixenPurple, and TinselPurple lost their color at this temperature but after 2 minutes PrancerPurple still has some of its color so the temperature was raised to 60 °C. It took 1.5 minutes for the oven to heat up to this temperature and by the time it got up to 60 °C PrancerPurple has lost its color (Figure 20). We then took the chromoproteins out of the oven and let them sit on the bench. After sitting for 3 minutes they had regained none of their color, but when rehydrated with 1 µl of milliQ water they regained their color (Figure 21). These chromoproteins were then heated again but instead at 40 °C for one minute. No color change was observed and so the temperature was raised to 45 °C and CupidPink, TinselPurple, and VixenPurple lost their color in between these temperatures around 42 °C. PrancerPurple still had its color at 45 °C after a minute it was raised to 50 °C and it began to lose its color. The chromoproteins were then rehydrated with 1 µl of milliQ water and they gained their color back. This test shows a reversible color change that is seen at a relatively low temperature. Interestingly CupidPink did not change to purple and then lose its color like we saw in cell lysate testing.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#DesignProcess_-_-_TEXT.html," out below are the developments the team has made over the summer, in tackling our aim and objectives.
RiboSense
Having decided that we wanted our project to be centred around biosensing, we realised that what we did would need to be compatible with what was already in the registry, as well as any subsequent sensors that people might develop. We therefore went through the registry, and the wikis of the last three years, scouting for sensing parts made by other teams. We found a wide variety of inducible promoters, but very few riboswitch-based sensors. Through our own research, we have found that, whilst there may only be a dozen or so well characterised riboswitches at present, they hold a great deal of potential. We draw this conclusion from the wide availability, and high degree of specificity of the nucleic acid aptamers already on the market. Given that riboswitches are effectively aptamers whose alternative conformations either affect access to regulatory cis sequences, or which add or remove hairpins and other terminator constructs, we believe there is potential for these to be used in the rational design of new riboswitches. We then searched for new riboswitches to characterise and submit and found these two papers: Breaker et al (2012) , and Dann III et al (2007) .
The reason that we chose to work with two riboswitches is because of their differing mechanisms. The fluoride riboswitch turns on its reporter in the presence of fluoride, through the removal of a rho-independent terminator. This is because its in vivo role is to switch on production of a fluoride efflux pump as the [F-] increases above safe thresholds.
The structure of the fluoride riboswitch in the presence of fluoride as characterised by Breaker et al (2012) DOI: 10.1126/science.1215063
The structure of the fluoride riboswitch in the absence of fluoride as characterised by Breaker et al (2012) DOI: 10.1126/science.1215063
The magnesium riboswitch on the other hand has an influx pump as its effector. Its state in the absence of Mg2+ is to therefore form an antiterminator, this is removed by the anti-antiterminator that forms in the presence of Mg2+.
The structure and mechanism of the Magnesium riboswitch as characterised by Dann III et al (2007) DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.051

Our Team
This year we have a very diverse team of people, with individuals in all years of study, and from varying faculties across campus. Our team consists of undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and advisors, who have all come together to create our FerriTALE. Each team member worked on a separate aspect of our project. There was a team for our detector , reporter , linker , modeling , prototype , and human practices . Some of us dedicated our time to one part of our project, while others tried their hand at everything. Each team member brought their own skills and knowledge, and sacrificed their time to make our FerriTALE become a reality. To get to know each team member and their contributions, click here . There are lots of ways to get in contact with us; try clicking on one of the links below to email us, go to our Twitter, Facebook, or our university website!

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara_-_-_TEXT.html," is T7 promoter  (BBa_I712074) which is strong promoter from T7 bacteriophage. For strong transcription T7 promoter expression system is chosen. In downstream of promoter there is RNA thermometer(ROSE) coding region which determines the transcription of our lysis composite part. RNA thermometer (BBa_K115001) is temperature sensitive that at 42C translation initiates. That means, up to 42 C RNA thermometer is in dimer form and at 42C it becomes linear. In downstream of RNA thermometer, green fluorescence protein(BBa_E0040) is ligated. This ligation is done to measure expression level and to comment on RNA thermometer efficiency. The last ligate to this composite is bacteriophage 21 lysis casette (BBa_K124003). This lysis casette induces lysis in E.coli. This gene cassette consists of the S protein (Holin), R protein (Endolysin), and Rz protein. When translation initiates at 42 C then the following coding gene begins to produce the proteins which lyse the cell.
iii) Modelling
In MethanE.COLIc project, this composite is modelled to lyse and kill the bacteria when switched on at 42C. In experimental design, we ligated this composite without lysis casette (with promoter, ROSE and GFP) We planned two control groups. One is T7 promoter and GFP ligate, this is designed to measure expression level of T7 promoter by reading the GFP expression. The second control group is T7 promoter, ROSE and GFP ligate, this is designed to measure the expression level of T7 promoter with ROSE ligate at 37 C. The device experiment is done with T7 promoter ROSE and GFP ligate at 42 C in which  the GFP expression is expected.

Device Experiment Results
-Flask experiments
In characterization experiments, we choosed temperature sensitive RNA thermometer (BBa_K115001) and modelled the experiments on GFP measurements. RNA thermometer is a temperature sensitive DNA part that up to 42 C it forms a dimer. This dimer formation prevents polymerase readings that the translation is obstructed. At 42 C the linear form of part forms and translation initiates. This part is submitted to parts registry by iGEM 2008 TUDelft team and the experience of part is represented as none. We modelled the characterization of this part by planing two apart control groups.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," The catalytic activity of esterase gene, regulated by a library of ribosome binding sites was measured using cell-free expression system in bulk or CAT-Seq approach and compared side by side. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized BBa_B0034 corresponding to mean strength of 1.
It’s known that stronger ribosome binding sites increase the yield of translated proteins and in therefore increase the number of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides. This increase of nucleotides is inversely proportional to the assigned mean methylation score of the sequenced DNA template. Based on this fact, the activity results can be extracted from mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) and correspond to ribosome binding site strength. The catalytic activity sequencing results were compared to earlier, in standard sized reactions measured RBS strength results. The comparison once again concludes the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The ribosome binding site strength, extracted from the DNA sequence in a form of reference nucleotide count correlates with measurements made with accurate standard assays. These results display the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the strength of regulatory sequences and its ability to assign accurate phenotype to genotype linkage.
Toehold cross interaction assessment
Toehold regulatory sequence library constituted of the different toehold and trigger pairs was constructed subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was sequenced with Nanopore. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count in the sequence) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different regulatory sequence were filtered and extracted.
Figure 3. The evaluation of Toehold-Trigger riboregulatory sequence orthogonality using CAT-Seq. The catalytic activity of esterase genes, regulated by different Toehold switches were measured using CAT-Seq. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded regulatory construct DNA template was filtered and essigned. Low methylation scores correspond to actively expressed protein and are only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present verifying the already measured orthogonality of regulatory parts.
The Figure 3 displays the mean methylation (reference nucleotide count) scores assigned to each barcoded toehold-trigger construct read. Based on the results, low methylation score is only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present. This means that esterase was expressed and catalyzed the conversion of substrate nucleotides. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results. Based on"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

iGEM being a competition between students, we worked as independently as possible. Once having been taught all the useful procedures, we did them on our own and analyzed the data before presenting them to the instructors and teaching assistants on our weekly meetings. We also planned the experiments needed to be done each week.
Being a small group, each student specialized on one part of the project, such as using the MITOMI or creating the T7 promoter variants. This allowed us to spend less time on learning the procedures; especially true for the microfluidics setups. The different parts of the project are detailed below, with the name of the student that worked on each task. The teaching assistants were assigned to the different tasks based on their personal competence; this does not mean that they completed the task, but rather that they taught us how to do it and answered our questions relative to it.

A lack of developed infrastructure for traditional diagnosis after screening such as high-quality cytology labs, transportation of samples to be observed by a specialist or methods of processing results
A large urban-rural development divide means that although treatment options could be available in cities for the majority of the population it is too far away to be accessed easily
Our tool overcomes these problems.
Our test is cheap and it doesn’t require high-quality cytology labs or complex infrastructure, or trained personnel to interpret - currently interpreting cervical smears is extremely difficult and several years of expertise and education which is not always available in developing countries. This would allow our test to be used by governments with various competing health needs.
It’s portability means that healthcare workers can reach out to rural communities with kits to carry out the screening and deliver results within hours. This means the large administrative task of carrying out any medical screening is streamlined for the less developed country. The early diagnosis provided by our test has the potential to reduce high cancer mortality rates.
Furthermore, developing countries are likely to improve their healthcare provision and a cheap screening test for cancer would become increasingly important. As the population ages, cancers will be responsible for more deaths.
Pre-invasive cervical lesions can currently be excised by the loop excision electrosurgical procedure, which can be carried out in an outpatient-setting, under local anesthetic. It has a cure rate of 80-95% with very minimal specialized equipment.
Cervical cancer also has miRNA biomarkers. [42] For cervical cancer, the lack of a viable screening program, rather than a lack of treatment options or accessibility is a key to the high cancer mortality rates in these countries compared to more developed countries. [41]
In the case of NSCLC treatment is generally palliative since it is rarely detected early enough for curative treatment. In less developed countries, palliative care is expensive and inaccessible since healthcare systems prioritise chemotherapeutic drugs to patients with a chance of survival. [43]
Although there is no low cost, quick and relatively easily treatment to excise NSCLC tumors (patients generally have to undergo a lobectomy to remove part of the affected lung), the development of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lobectomies could cut costs for tumor excision in the long-term. [44] This form of lobectomy uses cameras and surgical instruments used through very small incisions. Whilst it involves equipment that is more expensive to purchase initially and highly trained surgeons, the benefits of a lower chance of infection and a shorter hospital stay eventually outweigh this.

The graghs above show that when multiple enzyme B and enzyme C respectively, the productive rate of HBP and the consumption rate of DBT almost stay the same. But regarding the quantity of the intermediate, with more expression of enzyme DszB, the reaction becomes more stable.
We can get a linear inequality equation based on the level of importance of three enzymes: DszB>DszC>DszA.
Under real conditions, we could regulate the intensity of the promoters in order to regulate the enzymes’ proportion.
3. Water-Oil Ratio Model
The process of fermentation is shown as below:
3.1 Theories
Recently, the studies found that the number of DBP and HBP stored in the cytoplasm is determined by the cytoplasm and the distribution coefficient of oil phase and water phase. We managed to derive the best proportion of water and oil in the reactor to optimize our system.
We collected information and listed the distribution coefficient of DBT and HBP in different phrases by searching the literature:
3.2 Related parameters
Distribution coefficient refers to the proportion of the components in two phrases, in the condition of equilibrium and certain temperature.
3.3 Modeling
Hypotheses:
1).The volume percentage of the cell constantly maintains at 3%.
2).The stirring rate is fast enough to approach the chemical equilibrium and materials transfer balance at a fairly quick speed.
Construction:
In order to meet the actual need of making the remaining DBT least while maximizing the product HBP in oil phase, we establish the following models in order to eliminate the remaining DBT in the oil and preserve the HBP as much as possible:
In the initial state, the amount of DBT is a constant:
In the final state, the amount of HBP becomes a constant:
Assume that the volume is 1, then:
Substitute the known quantity into the equation, we get:
Which are equal to:
According to the actual demands, we define:
Which are:
Substitute the known quantity:
We can derive: xH2O≤0.08818349 or xH2O≥0.470590405
Because we can not calculate a result to satisfy both two optimal solutions, we take aonther new evaluation method.
Definition:
M1 represents the level of importance of DBP: 
M2 represents the level of importance of HBP: 
Because the toxicity of organic solvent has direct impact on the living of bacteria, then:
M is a parameter that has a positive correlation with the optimization of the whole system.

As for the problems we had encountered in the wet lab, they kindly offered us with practical solutions, helpful advices, and their first-hand experience, which significantly elevated the efficiency of our experiment process.
Modification on Enzyme Choice -- Interview with Director of Research of Beijing Smistyle Sci. & Tech. Development Co., LTD.
According to our research findings, Xynase, an enzyme from cellulase enzyme system, had been applied to substitute the variable D2 domain of flagellin FliC, and the adapted falgellins were successfully assembled into a functioning nano enzyme stick. Then it occurred to us to use the cellulose system to build a prototype to test if our approach can increase the catalytic efficiency. To better define the contrast group for comparison and to better portrait the actual using condition, we contacted Beijing Smistyle Sci. & Tech. Development Co., LTD, whose products covered all three enzymes in the cellulase enzyme system. We made an appointment with Doc. Zhao Lifang, the director of research of Smistyle.
With director of research at Beijing Smistyle Sci. & Tech. Development Co., LTD
Doc. Zhao listened to our power-point presentation attentively, and expressed her sincere appreciation for our project. Nevertheless, she indicated that the application of our improved system on cellulase enzyme system wouldn't fully exhibit the advantages of our improvement. The cost of manufacturing these enzymes had already been optimized to be very low, which made it economically unwise to go through sophisticated recycle procedure for repeated use instead of simply producing a large quantity of them as disposable additions.
At the end of the interview, Doc. Zhao shared her thoughts on more suitable application for our system. Obviously, our target enzyme should be the ones that are hard to produce but highly valuable. This would make the choice of recycle with our system preferable than producing in quantity with a high cost. With these guidelines, we selected PETase , which can hydrolyze PET in low temperature.

Therefore, we constructed a series of vectors containing different strength promoter followed by the standard RBS(B0034) and CheZ. According to our result of swarming assays, we found that the state of tumbling and swimming reaches its balance point adjacent to fairly weak promoter strength. Finally we decided to choose promoter J23117 as our final promoter choice. However, we have limited time to give details about the correlation between the concentration of cheZ and the size of swarm rings. We will confirm this conclusion by constructing IPTG inducing promoter-GFP fragment in single copy plasmid in further research.

HUST-China,2015,Team:HUST-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," materials will bring new dynamic to this study. Therefore, he believed that our idea of using microorganism to reinforce sandy soil in the ocean was very impressive and creative.
Our teammate was visiting the Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Research Institute.
Suggestions
Prof. Wang also offered us some professional advices. To help our product sinking in the ocean, he suggested us to employ some weighting device. To make it more convenient for fish to live and hide in the reef, we can make our product porous by using molds; the resistance to pressure of our product and its reinforcement effect also need to be tested and strengthened to adapt to the complex marine environment.
At last, Prof. Wang reminded us that the efforts of fishermen are also very important for the maintaining and managing of artificial reefs. Especially in our project, the microbial artificial reefs may take longer time to show the effect and require constant nurturing. Therefore, we need to arouse the enthusiasm and participation of fishermen and inform them the importance of artificial reefs in ecological restoration, thus, a field practice to a fishery is imperative.
Field trip to Zhoushan Fishery
When we arrived at Zhoushan Fishery, we were impressed by its scale and prosperity. However, further investigation also revealed its problems. Due to ecological damage, the total fishery output has dropped tremendously in past years, thus the restoration of ecology will be very important to the future development of fishery. Statistics has already showed the great ecological and economic benefits brought by artificial reefs. Therefore, in the premise of ensuring safety, our project of building artificial reefs with synthetic biology methods will bring factual benefits for the fishery and fishermen.
Zhoushan Fishery
To gain a full view of fishermen’s attitude and understanding to artificial reefs by biological method and ecological restoration, we issued questionnaires and conducted interviews among local fishermen and practitioners.
Field trip report and questionnaire analysis (Click to see details)
1. Research purpose
During our visit to Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Prof. Wang emphasized that the efforts of fishermen are vital to the maintaining and managing of artificial reefs. To ensure that our project can be actually put into use in fisheries, we need to arouse the enthusiasm and participation of fishermen and inform them the importance of artificial reefs contracture and ecological restoration. Therefore, we hope to get a clear view of fishermen's work environment and their actual attitude towards artificial reefs.
Fisherman is filling the questionnaire.
2. Object analysis and obstacles
Fishermen at Zhoushan Fishery were cooperative to our investigation. However, most of them were not well-educated due to poor economic condition. Therefore, when asked questions about technology"

Answer: The starting point of your project is very good. According to my understanding, the registry on iGEM online does have a lot of deficiencies, and some information even has errors. So, this is indeed a problem which is both distressing and worth solving. As for the suggestion, after the user finishes searching for the information of the biobrick, you can also provide some other biological components related to the biobrick. In addition, when searching for biobricks in the database, I hope that you can provide more ways and means to make it more convenient for users.
Consulting the lawyer and Our statement
Considered that BioMaster may involve with intellectual property issues and issues for users, we deliberately visited Mr. Zheng Yonggang, Senior Partner and Director of Sichuan Shangsheng Law Firm who has handled many related events and has rich experience in this field. He indicated that since these databases are open resources and there’s no confirmation on these databases that we are able to use it. No intellectual property issues are involved. We checked carefully on every database we integrated to avoid any missing possible regulation on the property of database. At the same time, we made a statement mentioned clearly what we integrated and we have no commercial intentions.
Details of Consult and Our Statement
Conversation with lawyer
Question1: Does BioMaster cause any infringement when using data and providing links to related documents from other databases?
Answer: If related resources are open to everyone and there’s no statement, using related data will be fully reasonable and legal. What’s more, BioMaster only provides references and the original links which is open on the related websites. So there will be no infringement.
Question 2: If users cause some influences on the project or others via using data in BioMaster, is BioMaster responsible for it?
Answer: Since the software is free and there is no interest dispute between the two parties. Users should use the voluntary principle when using it. Therefore, even if there are adverse consequences, the software provider is not responsible.

After a successful test reaction at 10uL, we repeated our linearization PCR with a volume of 50uL. Our confirmation gel indicated a successful linearization, although some of the sample streaked above the 10 kb ladder.
We then attempted a transformation of our new chemicompetent Y. lipolytica using our control D17 plasmid. Our transformant cells were then incubated in liquid selective media for outgrowth. We also attempted a transformation of our linearized PCR product from the 50 uL reaction, but later realized that the linearized plasmid was unfit for expression of any genes at this point and so the transformation plate was discarded.
Created YNB+CSM-Leu medium (leucine-deficient) and YNBcasa (uracil-deficient) medium. Attempted to transform Y. lipolytica with pXRL2, ultimately to test if we can miniprep yeast with our protocol. Unfortunately there was no obvious yeast growth on the transformation plates.

Thesis week is upon us! This time around, we struggled a lot less to work as a group and write as a group. The early organization probably helped. We turned in a much more cohesive paper.
We received an invitation to speak at TEDx! This is exciting. We get to tell people about our project, but we also get to bring more attention to the unmet need for modern contraceptives! Our team is really happy about the opportunity to present on such a large platform.
In lab, we had some successful yeast and bacteria transformations, some successful Gibsons, and confirmed Y. lipolytica’s antibiotic resistance.
We also finally received IRB exemption for our questionnaires! This means we can now officially use our questionnaires to gather information about the women who may not have adequate access to modern contraceptives.
This week we carried out more inoculations of pUC19 and pXRL2. After confirming growth in the liquid cultures, we miniprepped both sets of plasmids and got very good results on the nanodrop. Using the most concentrated cultures, we sent out our samples for sanger sequencing. We also carried out another Colony PCR of our old"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management"
METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," we                  were aware of this information during our experiments, we made sure to wear a lab coat, mask, gloves which we discarded after working                  with EtBr (Thermo Fisher Scientific, n.d.).
Environmental Impact:
During these stages of our project, our bacteria are always kept in the lab and therefore do not pose any risks to the                  environment. However, when our project Bio-E evolves into a product, like the using of the system in a biorefinery, there is                  certainly a chance that they may make their way to the environment. (ex. to the soil, potentially harming soil microbiota)                  One way we prevented this is by using genes that are totally harmless and actually can counter some of the of toxic chemicals.                  The gene FucO is a part of the bacteria’s own metabolism to fight harmful substances such as the furans whereas GSH is a part                  of each and every living tissue, responsible for the scavenging of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, even in                  the unlikely event of our bacteria contacting the environment, our engineered bacteria shouldn’t pose any risks. Moreover, the                  bacteria we have used, E.coli KO11 and DH5-alpha are strains of bacteria that are specially engineered with all these concerns in                  mind and are non-pathogens that do not have any detrimental effects on living cells.
Safe Shipment:
Safe and secure shipment is important for preventing part submission delays and blockages. Our genes were totally safe, not                  containing dangerous genetic material as they were classified as BL-1. We submitted our parts with standard DNA Submission Kit                  and followed the iGEM DNA Submission protocol. The labeling was visible and clear in addition to the clarification: “non-hazardous,                  non-regulated, non-infectious, for research purposes only”.

HUMAN PRACTICES
Overview
Our project focused on a current problem that is not given due attention, depression and anxiety disorders. There is a large number of uninformed people on the subject, since many are barely aware of the symptoms or causes of a depressive or anxious disorder and due to the above, people tend to normalize these diseases by letting them pass indefinitely without giving them adequate treatment.
In addition to developing a psychobiotic that can combat the adverse effects of stress that causes inflammation in the body and leads to depression or anxiety, the team wanted to take advantage of their intervention in the topic to help create awareness layers through social networks and thus promote the preventive culture and encourage people to ask for help when necessary. On the other hand, several events were created in our community where experts on the subject were invited to give the public the opportunity to express their doubts and share their experiences. From our human practices and the feedback obtained from these, the goal of our project was shaped to become what it is now.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Find out the initial thresholds by measuring RFP intensity
(4) Provide experimental data for modeling part
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.3.
Fig.3 The gene circuits of threshold device.
(1) Part:BBa_K808000 AraC-PBAD is used to control the expression of inhibitor proteins, The concentration of inducer arabinose is regarded as an input signal, and the red fluorescence intensity controlled by in-promoter is the output.
(2) Two combinations of inhibitor and in-promoter are selected to prove the concept of plasmid quorum sensing. Due to the limit of time, we measured 1-2 circuits. [see inhibitor mechanisms]
(3) RFP is used as an indicator since it's easier to quantify compared with the killer gene.
(4) The inducible promoter PBAD and the in-promoter express towards different directions, a terminator B0015 is added between the two promoters.
We assume that:
Different concentrations of arabinose will induce inhibitor with different concentration of inhibitors.
The high concentration of inducers can simulate high concentration of plasmids due to the same effect of producing more inhibitor proteins.
By adding different concentration of arabinose, we can measure the fluorescence intensity of RFP and find out the relationship between the arabinose and RFP intensity and the initial thresholds under the control of certain inhibitor proteins.
Second step
In order to find out the concentrations of inhibitor under different concentrations of arabinose and use the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit. Inhibitor is replaced by RFP and induced based on the same condition. The concentration of inhibitor can be represented by measuring the fluorescence intensity of RFP.
Goal
(1) Represent the concentration of inhibitor by measuring the fluorescence intensity of RFP.
(2) Derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit
Part Design
The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Fig.4 The gene circuit constructed to find out the concentrations of inhibitor induced by different concentrations of arabinose.
We assume that:
More arabinose added, more RFP expressed which can stand for the concentration of inhibitor, and vice versa.
Fig.5 The relationship between the concentrations of inhibitor and plasmid number.
Thus we could find out the relationship between the concentration of arabinose and inhibitor.
Third step
We use plasmids with different copy numbers to simulate the concentration of plasmids losing on different levels. Three kinds of plasmids, pSB1k3 (100~200 copies),"

Market analyze
Swot analyze
Strengths:
Our solution has modular design, that can be easily modified according to the specific pathogen genes that to want to target.
We want to offer a new solution to fight bacterial infections.
We build strong partnerships with key market leaders to push our project further in the different aspects (Hospital, Lab, Regulator).
It is a huge market size.
Weaknesses:
We have to engineer an efficient bio-containment system to be able to spread our solutions (we already have an approach).
We encounter few stability problems that we still have to fix.
Opportunities:
We created a new approach in a inflated field, it is huge market and many companies are working on it.
We are working on an patented application with the Technological Transfer Office of our university.
Threats:
To have a go to market we have a lot of process to go through. This solution require heavy preclinical studies and clinical studies.
The legal frame for GMO and CRISPR based therapeutic solutions.
There are already on the market a similar approach that use a engineered plasmid, however their vector is different since they use phages as vector.
Our field approach
From the very beginning, we wanted to work on a real solution to address a real problem. The only way to understand what we were potentially going to face was a trip in the field! For this reason our colleague Sara, medical student and iGEMer decided to go to Benin on a humanitarian trip.
The Benin was not choose by hazard, we talked with our partner the Belgian Red Cross to organize this trip. Benin is heavily affected by cholera and salmonella outbreak. Through our contact with the Red Cross Sara were able to visit the infected camps in the north of the country.
It was a life-impacting experience that allowed us to help local people and even more important to collect data on epidemics! We had the advices of several local microbiologists and doctors to better understand the local conditions. One of our learnings was for instance to graphically explain how to use our solution, rather than a written explanation due to the low literacy level. This may seems like a detail, but all this kind of information is crucial to develop a real solution.
Once again we were glad to see that our project impressed many people and the terrible situations we saw pushed us once again to do our best to achieve our project. We can have an impact and we have a potentially interested public!

We suggest relocating the HA-tag in the protein structure to the place closest to the outside of the cell’s outer membrane. After expression of this variant of ZAP, fluorescently labelled Anti-HA anti-bodies could be added to the E. coli. The level of fluorescence determined by FACS would provide more insight in the antifouling properties of the ZAP coating.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html," the main theme that we tried to address is the scientific approach of working on complex systems top-down to understand them by studying the subsystems (both components and interactions).
The most open-answers indicated that although the reductionist approach might be limiting, it will bring us far towards discovering the secrets of life. Some blended this answer with an additional statement saying that when the top-down approach is combined together with for example systems biology and holistic approaches, we will/might discover the principles of life eventually.
Although not everyone agrees on the relevance of this question because we cannot know what the future will bring us, we intended to make people aware of this issue and able ourselves to think about this issue and its possible consequences to prepare ourselves independent of the eventual outcome. The big differences within our sample group show the importance of thinking about these subjects.
Graph 2.
2. Various people think that reductionism challenges the tradition which holds that life is valuable because it is more than ""merely physical"". The special status of living things and the value we ascribe to life may be changed by reductionism. If we assume that a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of life necessarily decreases the value life, should we then pull back from the pursuit of understanding life?
Yes, because we can not foresee the implications that this knowledge might have
No, understanding life is more important than the possibility that reductionism devaluates life
No, because I do not believe that biology can change the meaning/value of life, the dimensions of the human experience cannot be explained exclusively by physics
Other:
It is important to point out that this question is based on a hypothetical situation that might or might not occur in the future. The majority (82%) would not pull back from the pursuit of understanding life, mostly because they believe that the value of life cannot be changed by research, but also because understanding life is more important than the possibility of decreasing the value of it. Researching the principles of life should go on, the values and meaning of life will not be harmed because life cannot be explained completely by physics, says 56%.
The mass of the synthetic biology community agrees that the possible consequence explained in the question is either irrelevant or insignificant compared to the importance of research in this field.
The other-answers:
Of the 25 people who chose the other option, the plurality does not agree with the assumption made in the question. Most of them argue that understanding life does not necessarily devaluate life and some feel that it only enhances its value because it shows why we value it.
One statement says that ""life"" is just a description of a class of interactions, and therefore"

The basic principle of protein reporter device is the same as the RNA reporter. First, we fuse split RFP with anti-His tag antibody light chain and heavy chain. Second, we fuse His-tag sequence with our target protein sequence. Once our target protein sequence being tranlated the anti-His tag antibody will binding on the Histidine tag. And then with combining of the heavy chain and the light chain, The split ERFP reconstruct and make brightly fluorescence.

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

NUDT_CHINA,2018,Team:NUDT CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," related to both universities and enterprises. Can you give some suggestions to avoid the ""blank"" area?
Dr. Zhou: Much of the reason for the ""pilot"" area actually lies in the role of government. While protecting the intellectual property rights is to protect the benefits of universities, the cost of subsequent transformation is very high, which is related to the cost of patent and development. Foreign commercial interests are only granted to a company, and the risk of success or failure is shared. In our country, patents have not really transformed.
3. If the improved protein degradation method in our study is introduced, can it play a significant role in diseases such as malignant tumors in the future?
Dr. Zhou: If the improved protein degradation method in the subject is applied, the following problems should be considered:
a) Can protein degradation last functioning?
b) Are there any incidental effects of unknown after degradation?
c) To what extent can the degradation be? How do you control that?
d) Can the degradation cause cell idle?
e) Concerns about sensitivity and specificity
Try to think about the dynamics of the control network and choose a clear application point.
If these problems can be solved, this method will play an important role in the application of diseases such as tumors.
After collecting the market-based information above, we had the idea of degrading target proteins related to some diseases. The cell experiment would especially focused on the problems mentioned by Dr.Zhuo and we would work more on the possibility of transformation process.
Speeches at Streets & Survey
To make our work responsible and good for the world, people’s attitude is an important factor. We did a survey of people’s cognition of traditional curing methods of tumor, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease and potential methods using PR PREDATOR. In addition to investigating this issue, we worked hard to engage with people by delivering speeches at streets. We inspired people by introducing our project in its future application and raised their awareness of preventing the fatal diseases mentioned above. The results of survey and details about speeches can be seen on our Education Page .
Through the survey and engagement with the public, we had a clear view of people’s attitude towards “target therapy” and the future application of PR PREDATOR. Since many of people involved had a positive attitude to our project, we would continue working on experiment and try to exert a greater influence in maintaining health.
Knowing that most people were still not familiar with the degradation process, we made a Wechat questionnaire for publicity including basic knowledge of proteins in human cells and challenging questions related to our project, which could achieve greater publicity step by step.

pCMV/myc/mito.GFP construct of MLS fused with GFP, provided by manufacturer to serve as positive control for MLS.
Characterization for CMV
CMV-GFP-PolyA in pSB1C3 construct for testing CMV functionality by expressing GFP.
pEGFP-N1 construct for expressing GFP in cell, serve as positive control for GFP expression.
GFP-Poly in pSB1C3 construct without CMV for comparing response brought by CMV.
Staining
All of the constructs were transfected into HEK 293FT cell. We stained mitochondria with Mitotracking dye and fixed the cell. Under fluorescence microscope, we could see the position of the mitochondria and the GFP. By merging the image together, we could determine whether MLS is targeting GFP into mitochondria.
Transfected cell was stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen), a rosamine-based stain, to stain the mitochondria. When they entered live mitochondria, they would be oxidized and bind with peptide to give a fixable fluorescent complex, which can be observed under fluorescence microscope and be retained after fixation.
The manufacturer’s standard protocol was used with staining solution of final working concentration 200nM, and was incubated for 20 minutes under a humidified atmosphere, containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C during staining.

Our trace journey of artificial life in Beijing TSINGKE Biotech allowed us to grasp the                         standard                         process of primer                         synthesis. Previously, TACG BioTech had explained the process and principles of conventional gene                         synthesis. We are                         equally curious as to how commercial gene synthesis works. In order to better understand the                         field                         of                         gene                         synthesis                         in a more integrated way, we came to GENERAL BIOSYSTEM (Anhui) Co., Ltd.
Dr. Du Pan, Minister of Department of Gene Synthesis, led us to visit their molecular probe                         production                         workshop,                         conventional primer synthesis workshop and gene synthesis workshop. During the visit, we                         learned                         that                         the process                         of                         industrial gene synthesis is to first design and synthesize primers with complementary                         sequences,                         and                         then use PCR                         to combine multiple primers to amplify a double-stranded DNA fragment, and finally sequence the                         correctness of the                         synthesized DNA. Usually this cycle takes around a week. Plus, he also compared the current gap                         between                         China and                         the world in the field of commercial gene synthesis: gene synthesis companies represented by                         TWIST                         have                         implemented                         chip-based high-throughput primer and gene synthesis, reducing the cost of primers to 1                         cents/bp,                         while                         currently                         Chinese companies can decrease the cost to an extreme of around 3 cents/bp. At present, China's                         gene                         synthesis                         industry is overly dependent on human labor, nonetheless, there are already automated gene                         synthesis                         workshops in                         foreign countries. Dr. Du told us that although they are now building an automated gene                         synthesis                         platform, there                         is                         still a long way to go before the realization of actual production.
At the end of our visit, we introduced them to our project --- design and synthesis of the                         minimal                         mitochondrial                         genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dr. Du praised us for our courage to take the challenge of                         splicing                         complex                         mitochondrial genes. He thought that if we should succeed, it would be a positive                         demonstration.
Moreover, we also consulted Dr. Du about the difficulty of splicing fragments with low GC                         content. Dr.                         Du professed                         that the high AT regions of the genome are often the ones where gene segments are rearranged.                         Hence, He                         advised                         that                         we use the E. coli chassis, such as E.coli GXL-10 strain"

Concentrations of LacI mRNA, protein, dimer and tetramer versus time are plotted in Figure 4. Since dissociation constant (Kd) of LacI-LacI monomer interaction (77nM) is mush larger than that of LacI dimer-dimer interaction (0.1pM), steady-state concentrations of LacI mRNA and protein are in different scales with that of LacI dimer and tetramer. Due to very large Kd of LacI dimer-dimer interaction, LacI protein would finally exist in form of tetramer in the system (concentration of LacI dimer is several orders of magnitude lower than the scale of the left Y axis and thus be ignored).
Figure 5 shows dynamic behaviors of plasmids in our model. Since only one copy of plasmid DNA0 was transformed, its quantity increases at the very beginning and decrease soon because all DNA0 will bind with LacI tetramer and no free plasmid exists. The process will end in one hour and quantities of both DNA0 and DNA1 enter into a stable level. It is worth mentioning that the stable concentration of DNA1 is about 380 nM, a little lower than its maximum concentration 475 nM. It is owing to reproduction of E.coli cells. After quantities of E.coli cell go into its stable stage, its concentration will continue to increase until the maximum setup value.
This basic example proves great success for iGAME to automatically model genetic regulatory systems. It shows real biological process in a qualitative manner and give suggestions for users to adjust their experiment plans.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," linearize Z0421 as we are currently in the process of inserting its reporter (Z0507) into a yeast shuttle vector.  We will linearize this part along with its promoter and the LexA activator parts (Z0279 and Z0842).
Both BstEII and PstI have concentrations of 10 u/uL. Thus, 1 uL of each should be able to completely cut 10 ug of DNA in 1 hour at 37 degrees.  As before, use 5 uL BSA and 5 uL 10x buffer, which would be H for PstI and either D or Multicore for BstEII.
During linearization, use PstI for pRS304*, BstEII for pRS305, and PstI for pRS306.  BstEII is listed as having best efficiency at 60 degrees Celsius, so we placed it on a heating block at that temperature.  PstI, on the other hand, is most efficient at 37 degrees C.
Both spent roughly 1 hour and 9 min at their respective temperatures.  Placed parts with PstI on heating block at 65 degrees for 25 min. to help inactivate the enzyme.  Note:  due to some misordering of the tubes, it appears that the digest of Z0277, which contains BstEII, was accidentally placed on the heating block for an additional 25 mins, meaning that it received almost a full additional half hour of enzyme activity.  Hopefully this will not affect the outcome too greatly.  Placed all linearized DNA in the freezer in preparation for the yeast transformation.
We also decided to start cultures of parts that we were going to culture last night (pRS306, Z0842, Z0507, and Z0279).  In addition to these parts, we decided to miniprep the 19 remaining parts that were successfully transformed last night.  As such, we made cultures for these parts as well.  Note that all cultures are grown in 16 mL culture tubes with 10 mL of LB except for 8 parts, namely P0450, P0453, P0454, Z0375, Z0378, Z0379, Z0402, and Z0038.

Aim of the experiment:: Measurement of Renilla luciferase reporter activity of GAL4 and LexA based light-switchable promoter systems.
Procedure:
Renilla luciferase reporter activity assay was performed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega after manufacturer's protocol.
All values has been normalized to OD600 and dilution factors.
Theobromine Assay: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Proof of caffeine synthase function by adding theobromine and SAM to S. cerevisiae culture transformed with pTUMcaffeine_expression_cassette.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

This year’s team was led by PD Dr. Bertolt Gust and PD Dr. Elisabeth Fuss. They provided the needed laboratory support and managed       main communication within the university. The student team was coordinated and organized by Brian Weidensee and Nikolas Layer as         student leaders; the original project idea was designed by PD Dr. Bertolt Gust and Nikolas Layer.                      All student members participated in the project development with the special contribution in gene block and part design by Lukas Fuhs and Nikolas Layer.
For laboratory execution, we divided the project into three parts: The chemical synthesis was done by Alexandra Haake, Marcel Conrady, Madeleine Heep, and Michael Krummhaar. Lisa Dussling contributed the in-silico analysis and the bioinformatics model while Marcel Conrady, Lukas Fuhs, Madeleine Heep, Mirjam Gneiting, Milena Krach, and Michael Krummhaar were involved in cloning, biochemical analysis, and compound production.                      Milena Krach, Brian Weidensee, and our intern Fan Zhang were responsible for procedure and data submission of the iGEM 2017 interlab study.                      For our this year’s YouTube collaboration project we want to thank all participating iGEM teams and Hannah Brasse for the realization and organization. Hannah Brasse, Lukas Fuhs, Mirjam Gneiting, Madeleine Heep and Milena Krach produced our own video for the channel. All educational projects embedded in our Human Practice project were mainly organized by Vic-Fabienne Schumann and Brian Weidensee with the engagement of the whole student team with special thanks to Marcel Conrady, Madeleine Heep, Milena Krach and Brian Weidensee for supervision of our internship student Fan Zhang.

Figure 13 shows that the pSB1C3-pgmB clone did not feature the pgmB insert at 707 bp after QC-PCR. Only the restricted pSB1C3 plasmid is present at (2070 bp). The pgmB insert of the positive control should consist of two distinct bands since the illegal PstⅠ restriction site should be still present. The positive control doesn´t seem to be in possession of the illegal restriction site as displayed on MegaBac v9 database . QC-PCR didn`t seem to have been necessary. The presence of pgi without illegal EcoRⅠ restriction site was confirmed by sequencing of the BioBrick.
Figure 14:  Digestion control of plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli cells that were transformed with pSB1C3-glmM and pSB1C3-glmS after Quick Change PCR. The clone transformed with pSB1C3-glmM shows two bands at 2070 bp (restricted pSB1C3) and 1346 bp (glmM) thus indicating that the illegal restriction (XbaⅠ) site is not present. However, the positive control also shows these two fragments instead of an additional fragment deriving from the illegal restriction site that should be still present. The pSB1C3-glmS transformed clone demonstrates the expected result and shows two correctly sized bands for pSB1C3 plasmid at 2070 bp and glmS insert DNA at 1800 bp. Additionally the positive control shows the three expected bands because glmS insert DNA is cleaved to a 1000 bp fragment and a 800 bp due to the still present illegal EcoRⅠrestriction site.

However, this would require much optimization to achieve stable and comparable signals. Genomic integration of the synthetic constructs would greatly enhance stability; this would remove potential issues such as plasmid loss or differences in plasmid copy count.  An important additional note is that although our tested CCP1 promoter clearly worked, its sequence did contain a single base mutation. Whether this difference has a positive or negative effect on the fluorescence would have to be confirmed by obtaining the correct promoter sequence.
A potential improvement to make our sensor more convenient would be the use of a different visual reporter. A suitable visual reporter for our purpose would be bright enough to be seen by bare eye, sensitive, quickly formed and stable. It would also be good if no additional cofactors were needed to reporter molecule production.
The duration it takes for the fluorescent signal to develop could be another issue. To assess this, more time points for our flow cytometry would be beneficial. However, as median fluorescence values from flow cytometry didn’t increase when increasing the induction time to 4 h from 2 h, it can be assumed that the response itself is quick, and increases of fluorescence over a longer time period are mainly due to increases in cell density. In addition, doing the measurements with multiple replicates would give as accurate information as possible about the expression profiles of the promoters in different induction concentrations. In particular, for low expression levels, values normalized to uninduced values are greatly affected by small errors. To this end, although microplate reader experiments proved to be useful in giving some general information about the expression trends of the constructs, cell clumping was a considerable problem, as several replicates of a measurement could be rendered inaccurate by the scattered reads.
Even if it eventually turned out that our promoters were not functional with microcystin induction, it wouldn’t mean that they couldn’t have other applications. As the basic idea of our promoter devices is to respond to oxidative stress they could be used for other applications centered around this idea. Our hypothesis was that in fresh waters, microcystin is one of the strongest factors causing oxidative stress, and thus, our promoters would give a signal relative to its concentration. However, there are many other agents that cause oxidative stress, and thus our device could be used for studying their combinatory effect and monitoring stress levels in form of a fluorescence signal. A general oxidative stress sensor like this could be used for example for easy monitoring of stress in yeast cell cultures when optimizing its growth conditions.

In an effort to extend our reach into our university and city communities, the University of Ottawa iGEM Human Practices Team partnered up with Let's Talk Science for the 2014 season. Let's Talk Science is an award-winning, national organization that creates and delivers programs to engage youth and educators in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). As a team, we recognized that our interests as Policy and Practices overlapped with the interests of Let's Talk Science in educating youth about the possibilities that science, including the field of synthetic biology, brings. We established communication with the Ottawa Chapter of Let's Talk Science and a great partnership was established for the 2014 season.
Through our collaboration with LTS, we were able to set up an iGEM station at the Let’s Talk Science Challenge, an annual event that brings together a large group of students from Grades 6, 7 and 8. These students participate in a science trivia competition for the first half of the day and face-off in a design challenge later in the day. By setting up a station at this event in Ottawa, we were able to reach tens of elementary-aged students and introduce them to the concepts of synthetic biology in a fun and engaging manner (see below). In return, our iGEM Team members volunteered their time to help score both the trivia competition and the design challenge.
Our booth at the Let's Talk Science challenge, featuring Mr. Cool's Microscopic Adventures books (uOttawa iGEM Human Practices 2013), a Think Challenge that asked participating young students to think of the craziest idea synthetic biology could help us achieve and a bracelet-making activity that was based on a 'DNA code' where different colour beads represented the base pairs in"

<p style=""text-indent:24pt""> We also obtained secondary structure analysis from the result of Phyre2. Since the 2A residues structure which has a length of 39 aa is our interest, so we carefully looked into that and found about half of residues are disordered and another half are mainly α-helix and a short β-strand (Fig. 2). Thus, we have reason to believe that the 2A residues does little impact to our Cry4Aa toxin, and it's feasible to use 2A peptides as a link between Cry and Cyt toxin for co-expression in a single vector.</p> <p style=""text-indent:24pt""></p>

Project Description
pH based bacterial systems, wherein response is dependent on the pH of the medium have been explored rarely in iGEM (NYMU-Taipei(2008), Wisconsin-Madison(2010) others). pH based sensor systems have potential use in bio-remediation, gut-microbiota engineering, fermentation et cetera.
pH based systems present various other challenges with respect to biobrick usability, pH dependence of reporters and lack of characterization.Our aim is to create a simple pH ""bacterial"" meter, not unlike a pH strip used in chemistry. We hope for this to be a template for future projects and applications

We are grateful for strong support from Shenyang Stemsoft Computer Service Co., Ltd, Shenyang International Software Park and Jiangsu Mole Bioscience Co., Ltd.
Collaborations
We really appreciate LZU-China’s help in 2015’s iGEM competition. LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.

Description
Protein purification is important to both biopharmaceutical production and scientific research. Producing recombinant  proteins with high purity is essential for protein drug-based therapies, protein structural analyses and functional studies. Most currently used protein purification techniques, such as commercial resins conjugated by various ligands, different types of chromatography and ultracentrifugation, require expensive investment, special device or tedious procedure. Meanwhile, they have different flaws in getting purified proteins, such as low specificity, long-term operating procedures and harsh conditions to sacrifice protein activity; thus, many of them, even with their combinations, cannot meet the required protein purity and quality for many applications. For instance, affinity chromatography is reputed for its high affinity, but tightly bound proteins typically require relatively extreme eluting conditions to disassociate from affinity columns; ultracentrifugation or size exclusion separates samples based on molecular weight difference, but they can co-purify other proteins and large molecules of lipid or nuclear acids. Thus, developing fast, easy to operate and economic approaches to purify recombinant proteins with high quality is urgently needed.
Fig.1 Purification progress by using the Nickel column
Our team developed a novel protein purification approach that eliminates most weaknesses of other techniques. Our method is based on the highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation between Spytag (a peptide with 13 amino acids) and Spycatcher (a peptide with 116 amino acids). We also take the advantage of a magnetic bacterium AMB-1 that can produce magnet particles, also called Magnetosome, covered by a bilayer phospholipid membrane, in which Mms13 protein is anchored. We generate Spycatcher-Mms13 and express this fusion protein in AMB-1 bacteria to make Spycatcher linked to the Magnetosome. A protein of interest with a Spytag at its N- or C-terminus is expressed in E. coli and present in bacterial lysate. The Spycatcher-Mms13-linked Magnetosome can specifically and covalently conjugate to the Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet. Due to covalent linkage, stringent"
Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," glance at what Tsinghua-A did this fall
    First we made a trial within university. We let the project step out from our discipline. We held a cross-discipline seminar delivering lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project, through which we harvest massive creative ideas and comments. Click to see in detail.
Figure 2: Seminar on campus
    Then we made our way to the public. Before it, under the guidance of biotechnological company’s planning staff, we got fully prepared by making related resources including exhibition boards, leaflets, souvenir stickers and postcards ready. What’s more, to make the activity more interactive and engaging, we took fully advantage of our visualization tool, the two games derived from project idea and modeling results. We optimized their function under the guidance of professional game designers from ‘Perfect World’. Click to see in detail.
Figure 3: A visit to Perfect World
    Finally, we made a hit at China Science and Technology Museum by holding a workshop named “Deciphering Life” that targets both adults and children. We propagated synthetic biology to adults by displaying exhibition and delivering explanation. For children, we had playful workshop activities including engaging art design, DNA model building and web game section with the hope to inspire their affection towards science and research. We got precious feedback from different groups. Staffs from the museum reminded us about the rigorous nature of science and we should balance between rigorousness and joyfulness when we choose the methodology in our activity. We were also inspired by children for more possibility in considering the influence of spatial factors on population interactions that may be helpful for our future work. Click to see in detail.
Figure 4: Exhibition at CSTM
    On campus, we also discussed our project with professors in the field of microbial biology. We finally confirmed three characters (farmer, warrior and beggar) for our project together.

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," twofold. This suggests that the enzyme (rather than substrate) is the limiting component in catechol degradation by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. This result corresponds with our hypothesis that the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase active site iron is reduced upon catalysis, rendering our enzyme inactive. The samples in Figure 3 were carried out in double distilled water. However, duplicates of the readings were measured in a buffer (20mM Tris pH 8.0). We do not observe a significant difference in 2-HMS production in samples containing buffer compared to samples containing double distilled water.
Figure 3.  The production of 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde by different concentrations of S30 extract. Green and red lines are 2µg and 4µg respectively of S30 cell extract from cells expressing catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. The blue line is 4µg of control S30 cell extract.
Conclusion
We have successfully show that our E. coli cells carrying the K118021 biobrick is capable of converting catechol into 2-HMS. Moreover, the reduction Figure 3 shows a reduction of 2-HMS concentration in the solution. It is more than likely, considering that 2-HMS can be metabolized by the cell, that the soluble metabolic machinery of E. coli is metabolizing 2-HMS into its breakdown products. This is a feature of the system that we intend to exploit in our remediation project.
With this in mind, it is inefficient to utilize a single turnover enzyme such as catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in an industrial setting. We have identified a protein that will reduce the iron that is oxidized in the conversion of catechol to 2-HMS. The gene coding for this enzyme (xylT) codes for a ferredoxin protein, and is located on the same operon as xylE in Pseudomonas putida1</i>.
We intend to introduce ferredoxin to our bioremediation project next year with the aim of increasing catechol 2,3-dioxygenase efficiency by allowing it to catalyze multiple turnovers of catechol to 2-HMS

Besides that the concentrations of 10 and 80 ng/µl seem to work sufficient, which suggests that there is a wide margin in the amount of nisin which should be added. The only risk with this are concentrations on the high end of the spectrum, like the 80ng/µl condition. During the experiments to obtain this data, the growth of the highest 80ng/µl condition seemed limited. This is in agreement with literature, as nisin is known for its anti-microbial properties in higher concentrations [Zhou (2016)] . Nevertheless, this shows the usability of this promoter in conjunction with the pNZ8048 expression vector.
Considerations for replicating the experiments
Besides these efforts, we also attempted to characterize two popular promoters from the registry in L. lactis. We successfully combined these parts with a RBS and GFP/RFP. The final step, which was ligating it together with a terminator into pIL252 was probably also successfully performed. However, we were unable to confirm this due to problems with the plasmid isolation from L. lactis.
Although we did not measure any fluorescence in our experiment we cannot be certain that this is, because the plasmid might have not been transformed successfully into L. lactis. Moreover, we learned later that measuring GFP in the regular growth medium of L. lactis does not work properly due too high background fluorescence of the medium. If you want to measure GFP you need to use a chemically defined medium as was done in the experiment described above.  We did not pursue getting data for these promoters intensify since the chances of them working in lactis are not very high. Therefore, we decided that our time was better spend developing new promoter parts and add them to the registry.
We hope that this toolbox and its information is a helpful step towards the better use of the L. lactis bacterium in the iGEM future.
Spacer acquisition
Construction
We planned to make this part from a combination of synthetic DNA(gblocks) and segments of the S. Pyogenes Cas9 operon from the plasmid pWJ40. We obtained these part by PCR reactions with the pWJ40 plasmid as template. The gblocks were used to remove the prohibited iGEM restriction sites and introduce the hCas9 mutation, I473F. All the parts were put together using gibson assembly. After transforming the assembly product, we performed several colony PCR's on the resulting colonies. We did this with the same primers that were used to construct all the separate fragments"

Therefore, in the model, we assumed 50g of polyurethane in 1kg of SRF based on the estimation. If we put 1kg of waste into a 5L bioreactor, the approximate concentration of polyurethane would be 5mM. Here is the simulation result:
The modelling result shows that we can efficiently degrade Polyurethane in SRF even in industrial scale. 5mM of polyurethane dispersion can be efficiently degraded in 15 mins. The final concentration of ethylene glycol we produced would be 20 mM that is under the toxicity limitation, this proves that our bio-reactor can maintain the efficiency without the toxicity effects.
As for the implementation of MAPLE system, the polyurethane degradation enzymes in our system are very efficient. Therefore, we need an efficient filter which removing ethylene glycol from the system.

2.0 P(3HB) synthesis model ▼
This section is about modelling the plastic-synthesising E.coli developed in our project.  The plastic that this module synthesises is the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, also known as P(3HB).  The content below shows the process of building, designing and optimising the model.  Also, the considerations, assumptions and limitations will be discussed.
The model was built and simulated in Simbiology, a Matlab package designed for modelling biological systems.  In our model we have a compartment (labelled ""E.coli_1"") that represents our engineered cell.  The compartment contains the reactions and species that interact with the polymer synthesis pathway.
Here is our model for P(3HB) synthesis. It is part of module 1, this model uses glucose from waste as the input. Here we have the phaCAB operon, which convertsthe metabolite acetyl-coA into poly-3-hydroxybutyrate. We integrated our synthetic pathway into the metabolic pathway. This allowed us to quantitatively predict the P(3HB) production over time. More details about the metabolic model can be found in Module 2 .
Firstly, consider the model concerning the synthetic pathway. This model does not take into account the existence of the metabolic pathway present within the bacteria. The synthetic pathway is mainly used for a sensitivity analysis by assuming minimum interference to the cell metabolism. The pathway is rearranged for clarity.
The pathways on the right half of the cell are genetic"

5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
In order to determine the best concentration of mutagen to use, we infected the E. coli in 5 tubes with 0ul, 10ul, 50ul, 100ul, and 200ul of our mutagen, 5-bromodeoxyuridine.  We then added 6uL of 5.3 phage stock to each tube, allowed it to incubate for 20 minutes, and purified the phage.  Next, we made a dilution series and performed a spot test and found that when the mutagen concentration is increased, the concentration of phage is decreased.
We then performed titers from -6, -7, and -8 of phage from our dilution series with x8 top agar.  There are a couple plaques on each plate.
5.20 T7 Minor Capsid Protein PCR
In order to sequence the T7 minor capsid protein, we had to amplify the gene using PCR. We first isolated the DNA by boiling phage in a PCR machine and centrifuging it for a minute, leaving the T7 DNA in the supernatant.  Then we added ddH20, TAQ buffer, dNTPs, the forward and reverse minor capsid protein primers, the template DNA from the supernatant, and TAQ polymerase in a PCR tube.  We ran 35 cycles of PCR and then froze it.  To make sure we isolated the T7 minor capsid protein, we ran it with gel electrophoresis and found a single band that corresponds with the the proper base pair length.  This showed that we successfully cloned the T7 minor capsid protein gene.
3. Next Steps
Our next steps are to 1) Sequence the minor capsid protein and 2) Start the mutagenesis process in order to select for smaller phage.

UNAM-CU,2015,Team:UNAM-CU#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," conjunction of these factors emulates the influence of lifestyle on glucose dynamics, these must be considered with the dynamics that result from the metabolism, which also involve the protein regulation of the insulin. The glucose regulation was considered as being the result of an exponential equation with a steady state at an specific vale xb, which should be considered as the value
Figure 3: A simulation of how the glucose consuming activity should be represented in the body, considering Xb as the optimum point for those kinds of activities, which also is considered to be the maximum value in the graphic. The present graphic was obtained using the program Geogebra with an input of an proximate function that represents the changes at every blood glucose value
that optimizes the body functions. The system that could represent this later development should be represented as follows:  Ax(e^(x−xb) − 1)
It is remarkable that when we equal this function to zero, we get a steady state when x = 0, xb, where zero is a repulsive state and xb is an attractive point, causing that our glucose levels tend to xb. The final section to cover with our model on glucose involves the influence generated by the insulin in our body over glucose changes, x∞(x,y), it relates to the changes on the glucose level in association with the insulin present in the organism. When generating a function that involves all previous modules, the next equation was developed:
Insulin
The insulin quantity depends on two principal factors to consider, as the insulin is produced as a response of high levels of glucose, one important factor is the glucose already present. On the other hand, there must be a limit for insulin production, which might be named as y∞ , when the insulin present in the body reaches this quantity, we can see an important decrease on the insulin production rate. When estimating the value in which y reaches an equilibrium, we developed the following.
Figure 4: A similar methodology as the one followed in the previous graphic is used to represent the expected response when starving, it is noticeable that when reaching the optimum value for glucose in blood, the starving response is almost unnoticeable. The starving response is an emergency alternative that requires the usage of the main reserves and activates when glucose is dangerously low
it is remarkable that when xy = x, the resulting exponential would be 1, which translates on a y∞ that equals ym 2, an half of the maximum quantity of insulin. The values of this function are contained in the range [0, ym] which makes sense as both are logical limits to the insulin in the organism."

Discussion:
mCherry expression in HEK293 cells was validated:
In FACS ARIA we were able to see that although we had low transfection efficiency, 23.1% of cells expressed mCherry.
In fluorescent and confocal microscope we were able to detect mCherry fluorophore in several cells.
Although, ew do not have a proof of apoptosis, we can see some background red-flourescene in our images, cells that undergone apoptosis will dispese their expressed m-Cerry in the media, thus the fluorescence will not be as focused as seen with localized living cells using confocal microscopy, rather there will be a background of red-flourescene, hence we may cautiously say that some of the cells that have expressed m-Cerry, have undergone apoptosis as well. This notion will require further validation.
When we used APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit we run into several issus:
The process of transfection and APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit procedure could influence test results, since in both of these procedures cells may die.
Co transfection efficiency has a major rule in the success of our apoptotic induction, in this experiment the co-transfection efficiency was low but we didn't had the time to repeat it.
APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit was calibrated to Jurkat cells. Since we are working with a different cell line further calibration is required.
Conclusion:
In this experiment we saw that pMLPm can be activated in HEK293 cells by dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex, since we were able to validate mCherry expression in several methods.
In HEK293 cells we did it when both gRNA and dCas9-VP64 are expressed by CMV promoter, our next step is to regulate pMLPm promoter activity in C8D30 cell line when dCas9-VP64-gRNA comlex is expressed by A1 reactive astrocyte specific promoters (pTimp1 and pSteap4).
In order to prove that the exogenous reverse caspase3 that was chosen in our design can trigger apoptotic death when it is regulated by pMLPm promoter, calibration on APC Annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit is nesseccery.
