Interaction analysis
When you use interaction analysis for a Part on the design platform, any other parts or protein that might interact with the chosen part will be displayed and can be added to the platform. We had built an interaction database ourselves, the sources of data were iGEM Registry and STRING Database. Scores for parts come from the STRING Database.
Simulation & Plasmid Design
S-Din allow our innovative users with fascinating idea to combine various genetic parts together to form a brand-new genetic circuits that may never exist before.To help them have a deeper understanding of how the genetic system that they created works, we construct an ODE system to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the genetic system mathematically. The main challenge of simulation is the uncertainty of genetic circuits since the users can construct them arbitrarily. Therefore we built a rather generic model capable of simulating various genetic circuits.
After your Design, you can choose to convert your circuits into Plasmids (Customizable) for further synthesis.
Techniques
As a web application. Django with Python 3 was choosen for back-end which is fast, strong, robust and friendly to developers; MySQL with Django models binding give us fantastic database support; Algorithms including Word2Vec, K-D Tree are also coded in Python 3 with the famous SciPy. For front-end, we build the view with customized Semantic UI, and control the logic behind beautiful widgets using jQuery. Some other open-source JavaScript libraries are also used to build the site, such as Chart.js for chart, jsPlumb for links in the design page, etc.. Advanced TypeScript was used to build the interesting game BioLab Rescue, hope you will enjoy it!
Wet-Lab Validation
Overview
At S-Din, we want to help bio-builder design genetic circuit seamlessly and simply. After we finish building it, we carried out a validation experiment of this workflow. We tested the efficiency and reliability of S-Din in this wet lab validation, and the experimental data can also validate the simulation part in our software.
Motivation
In the recent few decades, due to the depletion of the ozone layer, the potential risks of skin cancer and cataract has been growing. Our journey with S-Din began with a curiosity of how to detect UV. But we didn’t have a clear idea and didn't know where to start. Luckily, S-Din can light up one's path.

Trieste,2012,Team:Trieste#project#overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"flor) as the host organism for our platform. This particular strain      has been used as a probiotic for decades and its beneficial effects      on human health are well documented. We introduced into the strain a      gene guard system based on an inducible cumate gene guard switch and we      trasformed it with a particularly designed plasmid for protein expression.
The gene guard system is divided in two parts:
the killing mechanism
the regulating pattern
The killing mechanism is placed on the  same plasmid used for protein     expression. It consists of two different proteins, T4 Holin [1] and     Cathelicidin LL-37 [2] ,     both toxic for prokaryotic cells. These antimicrobial     proteins are both regulated by a cumate responsive promoter (T5 promoter     Cumate Operator [3] [4] )     placed upstream the structural genes. Holin is the     biobrick BBa_K112000 designed by group iGEM08 UC Berkeley. This protein     comes from bacteriophage T4; it is a small membrane protein which     depolarizes and permeabilizes the membrane allowing the secretion of     Cathelicidin LL-37 to the periplasm. Cathelicidin LL-37 is an antimicrobial     peptide produced by human macrophages. It has an amphypathic structure     that allows it to associate with bacterial membrane and form pores which     lead to cell lysis; its presence in the periplasm is pivotal for its     killing effect. As an alternative killing mechanism the complex T4 Holin +     Cathelicidin LL-37 can be replaced with TSE 2 toxin, a standard biobrick     BBa_K314200 designed and characterized by Group iGEM10 Washington. TSE     2 arrests the bacterial growth.
The cumate-responsive regulator CymR [3] [4] ,     which regulates the expression of the T4 Holin and Cathelicidin LL-37,     will be introduced into the bacterial chromosome by recombination using     the UPO-Sevilla miniTn7 Biobrick together with the helper plasmid pTNS2     which codes for the Tn7 transposase.  The regulator cassette consists     of a constitutive promoter (J23100) and the cymR gene, put in tandem     in order to increase the quantity of the repressor  to tightly control     toxin expression.
No Cumate Expression Mode:
CymR is continuously produced. It binds the cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate"

Introduction: Science Fiction and Human Practices
Context and Narrative
As the summer weeks went by while we were working in the lab, we realized that we were beginning to adopt a tunnel vision mindset.  We became so focused on the various technical details of how to jump through the next hoop of the project that we lost sight of what this project meant to us and the potential that it had.
In order to get new perspective on this project, we decided to have a team workshop to discuss the potential implications of our project in the distant future. With the help of our Artist in Residence, Megan Daalder, we worked to create science fiction narratives based on potential applications of our project. Although slightly fantastic, the stories that came out of the workshop led to a very interesting discussion of the role of science in society on a broader level. Talking about future implications of scientific breakthroughs in a narrative context helps us to connect more personally to new technology and is fun way to discuss these topics that can lead to a deeper understanding.
Workshop Structure
We started by discussing scientific ""storytelling"" at many different levels. How is the story of synthetic biology told by iGEM teams? How do we tell the story of how a technology might work in the future in a grant proposal? How do we tell our scientific story in a lab report or scientific paper? Where does science fiction belong in these sorts of stories?
We were asked to imagine potential futuristic applications that might stem from the results of our project. We filled out templates for possible industrial and therapeutic advancements in the years 2025 and 2050 based on our project. Many of these were somewhat fanciful, bordering on science fiction, but they broadened the scope for thinking about the magnitude of impact that science has on society.
We then exchanged papers and read over each others' predictions. We chose the predictions that we found to be the most interesting, and took 15 minutes to write brief narratives about our chosen scenarios. We took turns sharing our short stories with the"

Digested P58 and 59 with EX, P45 with XP, P53 and P54 with ES, and P38 and P39 with SP. We plan to ligate:
P53/54 with P58/59. This will give us RBS + LacI/TetR + terminator + pLac/pTet + RBS + GFP + terminator.
P38/39 with P45. This will give us Hi/low constitutive promoter + RBS + GFP + terminator. This is to test whether we actually have P38 and P39.

We now performed a large scale protein extraction on the CP culture. We spun them down in the centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes (make sure tubes are balanced). We then poured of the supernatant and poured a bit of LB into one of the tubes and vortexed it. Then once all the pellet was off the bottle the LB and cells were transferred to the next bottle and so on until the LB and cells were poured into a 50 mL tube. Spin in centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes. Weighed pellet after and added 12 mL of cell lysate because pellet was 1.2 g (add 10 mL/g of cell lysate). Then added 100 ul of lysozyme and 50 units/mL of benzonase (can also add RNAse and DNAse). Then vortex until pellet is resuspended and place onto vortex for 10 minutes (remember to tape so it doesn't fly off). Spin down at 11,200 rpm for 10 minutes in centrifuge. Then follow the protocol on Jesica's lab bench to wash the column and add the protein.

After we did the three washes we noticed there was not a pink color in them so we decided to re run the gel from this morning but instead with the extracted protein washes to see if the chromoprotein was the protein we extracted. The gel shows that our chromoprotein is present in our protein extraction (large dark band) which is exciting but also interesting because there was no color seen in the protein extraction

Figure 14.
Cell viability
Three different MG1655 strains; WT, HRT2 and CPS (similar to above), were grown under equal conditions as when cultures were grown for rubber purification. 1 L of bacterial cultures were initiated at OD600=0.05, from overnight cultures and grown at 37°C and shaking at 180 rpm. After 5 hours of growth, cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG, 0.2% arabinose and 1 mM MgCl2 and the temperature was lowered to 20°C to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies. The OD600 was measured each hour throughout the experiment and sequential dilution series were plated out at time 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 hours after initiation. Furthermore, samples for electron microscopy were taken from the induced ON cultures.
OD600 measurements illustrate a slight impairment of growth for the HRT2 strain compared with the WT strain, whereas the CPS strain shows heavily decreased Growth (Fig. 15A) . CFU counts reflect the number of viable cells in a culture. We observed a steady amount of CFU counts for the WT and HRT2 strains throughout the experiment similar to the CPS strain, although this strain presents with a lower amount of CFU counts (Fig. 15B).
We notice that the growth rate of the CPS strains is controversial to the growth experiment presented earlier, which we cannot directly explain. Importantly, the viability of the CPS strain does not decrease upon induction in both growth experiments, which indicates that the amount of produced rubber is not toxic to the bacteria. This might be due to the low amounts of rubber produced in the cells as validated by H1-NMR.
Figure 15.
Additionally, images from an equal dilution and time point in the CFU assay are displayed below (Fig. 16). The difference in size between the colonies from the three different strains confirm the decreased growth rate of the CPS strain compared to the WT and HRT2 strains.
Figure 16.
Lastly, scanning electron microcopy indicate no noticeable difference in cell morphology between the three strains upon induction (Fig. 17). This emphasizes our prior conclusion that the bacteria tolerate the amount of rubber produced in our molecular biology production system.

Procedure
Set up the following reaction on ice:
Reaction volumes:
NEB recommends a total of 0.02–0.5 pmols of DNA fragments when 1 or 2 fragments are being assembled into a vector and 0.2–1.0 pmoles of DNA fragments when 4–6 fragments are being assembled. Efficiency of assembly decreases as the number or length of fragments increases. To calculate the number of pmols of each fragment for optimal assembly, based on fragment length and weight, we recommend using NEB's online tool, NEBioCalculator .

(Aster, 2012) All of which are major              deal breakers; not many will be convinced to pay outrageous prices for solar panels that will be obsolete in a year only to produce              little DC energy on sunny days. (Aster, 2012) So it is not a viable renewable energy source.
To bring further insult to the wound, developing novel technologies that are fundamentally different from what has been used before              is wicked by principle; by the virtue of them lacking a track record makes them uncertain which intimidates investors and authorities that would use it making it hard to convince them to fund them. Also, they have an experience curve; when those new technologies aren't              optimal yet, requires a lot of research and time. (Herzog et al., 2001)
Our solution and how it's distinctive
Since our project is based on bioethanol production from biomass, in which fermentation in large volumes is involved, our endeavour is best communicated with a prototype of a bioreactor, where our project kicks in.
We have considered all sorts of renewable energy sources; both biomass and otherwise and we decided on biomass energy since it can be implemented to real life in the best way possible.
A biorefinery is a facility where biomass is processed to be used in various industries. In this case, we are dealing with lignocellulosic material; which primarily comes from plants with rigid structures such as tree barks, brewer’s spent grain, corn stalk, rice husks and so on.
Our prototype was designed and its detailed blueprint was drawn long before it will be implemented. Our zero-waste approach sets an example to the industry.
Inspired from Çumra Integrated Sugar Facility, we held a meeting with engineers from  BTech Innovations in METU Silicon, where we worked together on the blueprint of our facility, to be 3D printed.

During our visit to one of the biggest biorefineries in Europe, Çumra Integrated Sugar Facility, we have established two way dialogues with the engineers and most importantly with the director. These dialogues were established to align what we have designed on paper to a more doable design. With the engineers, we have diligently discussed our drawings; noting down the points we remained weak and making the calculations to achieve our approach of having no waste output from the refinery. After our visit, we have done further research to construct a prototype, compatible with real-life situations.
The important thing for us was to design a product which"

Future Policy Makers Model United Nations
Frequently we reach out to adult policy makers to discuss our projects, this year we wanted to tap into the future policy makers and get them excited about our work before they become policy professionals. To create an accessible and relevant outreach program we followed the Outreach Planning Guide . An overview version of the guide can be found on the Database Page page
Find Communities
The ultimate goal of bioengineering projects is implementation. However, in order for any work to leave the lab researchers need approval from policy makers. This year, we partnered with William & Mary Model United Nations to ensure the next generation of domestic policy makers, WHO officials, and international law makers have an understanding of synthetic biology.
Evaluating Interest & Understanding
To ensure our product and presentation matched the interests and current understanding of the high school students coming to Model United Nations we connected with Ashley Shang, the Undersecretary-General for General Assemblies. Shang coordinates the nearly 1,500 students who attend William & Mary High School Model United Nations. Students come from 60 high schools from across America for the event.  In our meeting we determined most of the attendees have taken high school biology, and are familiar with the basics of DNA replication but that gene editing technologies and applications would be new. Fortunately for our team, students participating in Model UN are expected to do substantial research prior to attending the conference. This gave us a unique opportunity to guide student learning before they attended our official presentation. Ashley connected us with Julie Vu who heads the WHO committee and she created a Background Guide directing students in their research and pushing them to explore synthetic biology topics. This background guide gave us amazing access to our target community.

Although the gas burner is a common combustion apparatus we are all familiar with, it can cause a massive disaster if used improperly. We made all-out efforts to keep all the flammable items away from the flame and not to pass behind a person who is using a gas burner.

Q2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
NO. Currently we have no BioBrick which raises any safety issues. The BioBricks we made this year are derived only from lab-safe strains of Arabidopsis thaliana and E.coli.
Q3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes. We submitted the experiment plan to the Environment, Safety, and Health Organization, Kyoto Univ. ( http://www.esho.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.php ) and were allowed to operate genetic modification of the bacteria under the Biosafety level 1(. Experiments were planned following the safety guidelines of the university ( http://www.esho.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wp-content /uploads/2008/05/25_01.pdf). These guidelines are based on national laws and this includes several regulations on GMOs ( http://www.bch.biodic.go.jp/hourei1.html ). We carried out our experiments in the students-laboratory of the Graduate School of Science / Faculty of Science, Kyoto Univ, which has its own department for safety and environment. All of the lab members received training for PCR, culture of cells, miniprep and etc., the minimal genetical operations and use of autoclave.
Q4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety"

Golden Gate Cloning
Conventional cloning methods utilise restriction enzymes that recognise symmetrical or palindromic DNA cut sites. This site is then cleaved, exposing sticky ends for use in re-ligation. Our basic BioBricks containing the subunit proteins for our hydrogenases were formed using this method. These genes are naturally found in a single gene cluster in Shewanella oneidensis, transcribed together to ensure that the subunits are expressed at the same level.
Once we had successfully cloned our individual subunit parts for each hydrogenase into the BioBrick vector, we had to combine these genes into a single vector under the same promoter. This meant removing the inserts from pSB1C3, connecting them in the correct order, and re-ligating them into our vector. To do this we used an alternative method known as ‘Golden Gate cloning’
Golden gate cloning utilises type IIS instead of type IIP restriction enzymes. These are restriction enzymes that recognise a DNA sequence outside of the cut site. A cut site which is non-specific, allowing for custom overhangs. This means that during ligation between the inserts and their vector, the recognition site for these enzymes will be removed, eliminating the scaring that occurs during cloning with conventional restriction enzymes. In designing our individual gene parts, it was important to include cut sites within our BioBrick prefix/suffix that would allow for ligation of the parts in the correct order in the final gene cluster; while ensuring that no enzyme recognition sites were present within the sequence between cut sites.
Preparation for this method started with our design for gene synthesis by IDT. Restriction enzyme sites were added to either side of each individual subunit gene that would result in complementary sticky ends for adjacent genes. Ensuring they would be re-ligated in the correct order of the cluster. Golden Gate recognition sites for the BsaI enzyme were removed from internal sites by base substitutions that did not alter the amino acid sequence. In each gene part the iGEM BioBrick prefix and suffix was also included.
For example, once cloning of the FeFe hydrogenase subunit genes HydC, HydB and HydA into BioBricks was complete, we had to create our FeFe gene cluster. Due to cleavage"

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Modell_-_-_TEXT.html," system supplies the modeling with another advantage. We only need to simulate the reactions that are rate-limiting. In case of our model we state that only the BPA concentration is limiting while the enzymes and the NADH are present in surplus quantities. This allows to simplify the first reaction a great deal, as it is not necessary to simulate the electron transport in the Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. The third, and by far most important advantage of cell-free modeling is, that we do not need to make a lot of assumptions regarding the system we want to simulate the reaction in. When modeling a reaction in a cell there are a lot of parameters difficult to estimate, for example the contribution of the reactants in the cell or what signaling networks might be triggered by the reaction of interest.
First reaction
The first reaction is the degradation of BPA by the Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system (the components of this system are cytochrome P450 (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo>), ferredoxin (<partinfo>K123001</partinfo>) and ferredoxin reductase (<partinfo>K525499</partinfo>)). The velocity of the BPA degradation can be calculated by Michaelis Menten enzyme kinetics:
(1)
The velocity V1 was calculated dependent on the enzyme concentration and the kcat-value of the monooxygenase system which was 3.9 min-1( Sasaki, 2005b ).
Second reaction
In the second reaction the NAD+-dependent DNA-ligase from E.coli (<partinfo>K525710</partinfo>) is used to transfer the molecular beacon from its closed state (bcs) to its open state bos. It can be described by the following reaction scheme:
The rate of a reaction with two substrates is calculated by the following equation (assuming initial product concentration is 0):
(2)
where KiA is the binding affinity of the inhibitor to substrate A, KmA and KmB the Michaelis-Menten constants for substrate A respectively B in the specific reaction. So the amount of the molecular beacons open state is described by the equation
(3)
For this we assume that the molecular amount of NAD+ is equal to the molecular amount of degraded BPA less the amount of beacon in open state. The required electrons for the degradation of one BPA molecule, more precisely for the activation of the oxygen in the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system, are released by the oxidation of one molecule of the cofactor NADH. The transformation reaction"

With the interviews: Q1 - What do you think of the water quality and pollution situation at the present? Water pollution is serious, current water quality is high but there is sewage pollution and the impact of enterprise factories is large.  The Quality is not as good as before.  Not satisfied, some of the scenic spots are good, and to the rural areas, many of the rivers have a small.
Q2 - What do you think about water quality testing methods at present? Water detection methods have been developed to take real-time monitoring of high-tech pipeline...The advantages are high precision and fast data. The disadvantage is the price is too high.  I don't understand that, I think it's the EPA. I've never measured water quality before, but if I have a handy detector, I really want to go.  We usually test ourselves. Take some water samples, buy their own reagents, test the water and compare to tables to determine water body pH value and nitrogen content and oxygen content.
Q3 - If we developed a bioreactor for testing would you like to use it? The advantage of biological detection is it is convenient and inexpensive. We could use it to call the social water monitors, monitor the surrounding waters irregularity, and detect oxygen for aquaculture farmers.  The price right now is too high, but we will certainly consider the use of it.  I would like that, especially if I could install it and not have to change it a lot.  I think i can be used for specific analysis. There are few people who wash things or drink directly from wells or rivers, but if you look at the poor areas without the use of tap water who can only use water in the natural environment then being able to use a detector that is convenient and reasonably priced would be good for the whole country.
Q4 - Do you have any suggestions for our products? I think the most important thing is quality, price and accuracy.  The product needs to be not to expensive to die, I hope precision is as high as possible.

Valencia_Biocampus,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results3_-_-_TEXT.html," performed experimental evolution tests. We started by comparing the growth of the original Bac2 strain and the cheaters, at different concentrations of antibiotic.
In all cases the curves were similar: Bac2 and the cheaters grew at a same rate up to 265 minutes, after which a variation in the growth pattern was observed: the cheaters started to grow faster.
Figure 3. Growth pattern of Bac2 and the cheaters in separated cultures.
After that we decided to characterize mixed cultures of both Bac2 and the cheaters (50% each, adjusted in terms of O.D), both let grown together. Under these conditions, the growth pattern was as follows.
Figure 4. Growth pattern of Bac2 and the cheaters mixed in the same proportion
in the same culture.
We took aliquots at time 0’, 165’, 340’ and 24h and spread them on solid medium in order to check which was the predominating population. We performed the same experience at 37ºC and 40ºC and we carried out colony PCR with oligos amplifying the Bac2 insert in order to tell between honest and mutant colonies. We obtained the following results:
- At 37ºC, and after 165 and 340 minutes, Bac2 were clearly predominant over the cheaters (the initial rate honest:cheaters was 1:1). That suggests that at this temperature the growth of the cheaters is not favoured, probably because the larger size of the plasmid of the mutant strain, which is bigger than the original Bac2 (Figure 2), or the presence of un-optimal sequences, such as two replication origins.
Figure 5. Percentages of Bac2 and the cheaters at time 165, 340 and 1440 min
at 37ºC determined by colony PCR.
- In the 40ºC experience, at time 0 minutes, as expected both clones appeared in the same number, but after 165 minutes the percentage of Bac2 had started to slightly decrease (44%) and after 340 minutes they only appeared in a very low rate (4%). These tendency was confirmed after 24 h, when no Bac2 were detected.
Figure 6. Percentages of Bac2 and the cheaters at time 165, 340 and 1440 min
at 37ºC determined by colony PCR.
Taken together, these results clearly indicate that both original Bac2 and cheater clones exhibit different growth rates and, when combined at high temperature, mutants tend to grow faster and/or inhibit the growth of Bac2. This leads to a"

Outline
Mathematical modeling and experimental research are relatively complementary to each other. Biology have gradually became a qualitative field of research. In our study, we made respectively three models to quantify the peptide accumulation with S. aureus proliferation under the four types of Agr system, to predict the gene expression pattern of the four types of Agr system, and to simulate the gene expression of AimR-AimP system. To help readers understand our modeling theory, we also wrote attentions for all the modeling process.
Model 1. Peptide concentration accumulation model of Agr sender systems
Introduction:
In order to quantify the peptide concentration accumulation with S. aureus proliferation under different conditions, we regarded the each S. aureus as isolated unit. This prediction will be incorporated into the equation to calculate（simulate） the total protein amount at the community level.
Figure 1. The agr-Quorum Sensing Sender System of S.aureus
The Agr-QS system is a quorum-sensing system in S. aureus and typical for Gram-positive bacteria. As shown in figure 1, when the transcription factor from AgrA phosphorylation binds with P32 promoter, agrB and agrD were continuously promoted to express AgrB and AgrD respectively[2]. In the Agr system, the protein of interest production process is briefly shown as below：
Modeling:
Our study is based on the quorum-sensing system of Gram-positive bacteria. In order to model the biological law of S. aureus, the prioritized task is to quantify the peptide accumulation with S. aureus proliferation under the four types of Agr system.
Assumption:
1. P32 promoter is always in large quantity and that its binding to the transcription factor from AgrA phosphorylation happens on a faster time scale to promote the genes downstream to express.
2. The product never binds with the free enzyme.
3. The conversion between enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product is much faster than that of association and dissociation events.
We tried to use Michaelis-Mentin kinetics equation[3] to predict the peptide production rate. We made several modifications on the equation to accommodate the transcriptional regulatory mode of the P32 promoter.
Attention:
1. [P32:F], [mRNA] and [P] represent the"

The Scrubbing of MeBr produced in WS 4-1 gives WS 4-5 that is similar to WS 4-7 of the Hoffmann La-Roche process. Since WS 4-5 is the largest and needs pre-treatments, it makes up the majority cost of the overall process [1].
Table 3 Waste Streams for the Monsanto process
Figure 8 PMI of the Monsanto process
The Ajinomoto process generates 5 WSs: 1 solid WS and 4 aqueous WSs, with the total waste for all WSs being 3879.37 kg per 100 kg of L-DOPA synthesized; with 59.34% of this waste (2301.85 kg) being contaminated water. The Ajinomoto process is characterised by the absence of any hazardous chemicals. The solid WS is recyclable and four aqueous WSs are treatable by biological methods, with the main challenge being compliance with the standards of discharge set by Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) [1].
Table 4 Waste Streams for the Ajinomoto process
Unfortunately, information for Sankyo's WSs were unavailable, and although we did learn from one of our industrial interviews that accurate extrapolation does require a full view of the industrial process, changes to the synthesis may be made in scaling up for manufacturing. For example, side reactions may increase, as physical parameters change with increasing volume of reagents, causing diminished purity that requires further treatment before shipping. Consequently, we could not get an accurate estimate for the waste caused by the Sankyo process.
c.E factor:
Another metric that ties together numerous waste components in the broader context of production is the Environmental factor (E factor), defined as:
It characterizes the synthetic process on a practical level, proving useful for assessing the contribution of separate elements as it uses the mass of the products as a common denominator, with the number of Waste streams directly affecting the E factor [1]:
Figure 9 E factor of Hoffman La-Roche WS
Each waste stream can be characterized by its E factor; the higher the E factor, the higher the waste produced to synthesise a particular chemical, and thus the greater the negative environmental impact. The ideal E factor is zero. Unlike atom economy, which evaluates the theoretical waste of raw materials expected to be generated in a"

PROBLEM STATEMENT
SYSTEM OVERVIEW
COMPONENTS
Problem Statement
Presently, it is difficult to tune genetic circuits to respond to environmental stimuli in a precise manner due to the amount of signal noise that accompanies many environmental cues. Traditional promoters operate via an intensity-dependent input-output system that accepts input from both the desired stimulus and excess noise. To combat this, most inducible systems are designed to respond to a chemical such as IPTG or arabinose to function as transcriptional switches.  These chemicals are expensive and irreversibly turn expression on in induced cells.
We have designed a genetic circuit that responds to frequency as opposed to intensity. This allows us to finely control expression by having the system only respond to specific and intentional variation in stimulus frequency. Thus, our system serves as a more robust response system to minimize noise by only responding to signals that fall within a set frequency range.
The specific circuit we designed employs a genetic AND-gate to combine discrete high-pass and low-pass filters for temperature fluctuations into a band-pass filter. The high-pass circuit only allows downstream transcription when the frequency of temperature variation is above a certain threshold. Conversely, the low-pass circuit allows downstream transcription when the frequency of temperature variation is below a different threshold. Combining these two circuits leads to a tunable frequency range for expression. In addition to being less sensitive to noise, this system also avoids the need for expensive or toxic chemical inducers.
Additionally, many natural phenomena are cyclical, so cells that respond to a frequency of stimulus may be more well-suited to respond to such stimuli than traditional amplitude-based expression platforms.
System Overview
We designed a modular, tunable system that could in the future be customized to respond to different kinds of oscillatory input signals (light, heat, small molecule, etc.) and different frequencies. For this project, as a proof-of-concept, we focused on a response to variation in temperature. We sought to not only show functionality and specificity of such a system but also to characterize baseline rates"

One hour after transformation chloramphenicol was added to the transformation reaction and it was incubated in a 37 degree shaker.  Transformed cells were examined at various time points under a fluorescent microscope.
Fig 11. Fluorescent detection of HPV target sequence with SeeDNA technology. Cell transformed with the pSB1-C3-K584001 HPV Detector plasmid that had been mixed with either HaeIII digested pBluescript plasmid (left) HaeIII digested pBluescript+HPVtarget target plasmid (right) were imaged at the indicated  times post transformation.  DAPI staining of DNA served as an aid to focus on cells in the absence of widespread GFP fluorescence at early time points.
Within a few hours of transformation single fluorescent cells were visible in the sample to which the digested HPVtarget plasmid had been added (see Figure below), but not in the control sample.  Following an overnight incubation, bacterial growth has provided massive signal amplification with large numbers of green cells visible, but again no cells were present in the control sample.
Identification of GFP positive cells directly after transformation should provide a very accurate, quantitative measure of the amount of target sequence in a sample.  Essentially this is a digital detection system analogous to digital PCR, but with expression of a reporter gene at high levels from a high copy number plasmid providing the signal amplification.  Fluorescent detection thus permits quicker and probably more quantitative DNA detection that can be visualized with a fluorescence microscope or by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

Towards Proof of Principle
In this project we have devised a strategy for constructing plasmids which can detect specifically a genetic sequence and give a readout when transformed into E. coli.  As the method by which the plasmid was constructed was novel, full details were not disclosed to keep the possibility of patenting open.  However the results presented here for two different DNA detector plasmid demonstrate clearly that the system works.
Plasmid samples which were incubated with the target sequence gave a large numbers of colonies when transformed (typically >100 CFU per plate).  Whereas controls, which lacked target DNA, when incubated with the plasmid, gave little or no colonies when transformed.  Slightly less efficient, but still conclusive, results were achieved with a double stranded DNA target compared to single stranded oligos.  We have gone some way towards demonstrating the specificity of the system for a target sequence.  We have also begun the process of optimizing the system to increase its sensitivity"

In the year 2011, the iGEM main page had a security section, which stated
""As a participant in iGEM, there are three things you can do right now to help us secure our science:
Fully answer the safety questions that demonstrates that you have thought about how others could misuse your work
Contribute to community discussions on what needs to go into a code against the use of our science for hostile purposes (see A Community Response)
Look into what security provisions, such as laws and regulations, are already in place in your country (see Working within the Law)""
(iGEM Security Page 2011)
While the answering of the safety questions is already obligatory, we addressed the laws and regulations as well as the contribution to a community discussion with our analysis and report.
We wondered, why we did not find any biosafety, biosecurity and dual use definitions within the iGEM safety page 2015. A specific security page was not established in the manner of 2011. iGEM offers many regulations and risk assessments concerning biosafety and provides a great infrastructure with its interdisciplinary expert team, the biosafety commission. We want to complete this biosafety and security aspects by finding guidelines for the safe distribution of information and the dual use in research. We propose the implementation of definitions in the safety page and questions aiming for biosecurity and dual use risk assessment in the obligatory safety forms. iGEM has a unique potential in reaching out in education of young researchers to contribute to a responsible research community.
We performed the risk assessment for our project. In addition to our public outreach and several expert contacts, this analysis results influenced our project significantly. The findings broadened our horizon in the context of interdisciplinary collaboration and communication with the public - to build up to the trust put into us.
We believe, that iGEM can be a role model in raising awareness of biosecurity and dual use risks - for a better international collaboration to create beneficial knowledge.
We briefly summarize our findings on these pages. The detailed report is available as a PDF.

Definitions
Legal institutions in Germany, the European Union and the United States of America define the term dual use as the risk that chemicals, organisms or technologies can be misused for military purposes. This definition originates from the bioweapon convention in 1972. A point of view more adapted to recent developments in technology and the uprising discussion about research with biosecurity"

In the absence of Autoinducer-2, LsrR repress the LsrR promoter to bind LsrR-Binding Site. In the presence of AI-2 extracellular AI-2 is imported into the cell (cytoplasmic AI-2) via LsrACDB transporter, where it is phosphorylated by LsrK. LsrK is a kinase responsible for converting AI-2 to phospho-AI-2, which is required for relieving LsrR repression. Phospho-AI-2 has been reported to bind to LsrR and relieve its repression effect on the lsrR promoter.
3. Toehold System
Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.New classes of regulatory components that offer wide dynamic range, low system crosstalk, and design flexibility represent a much-needed, enabling step toward fully realizing the potential of synthetic biology in areas such as biotechnology and medicine. (Khalil and Collins, 2010).
Engineered riboregulators consist of cognate pairs of RNAs: a transducer strand that regulates translation or transcription and a trans-acting RNA that binds to the transducer to modulate its biological activity. Riboregulator designs can be classified according to the initial RNA-RNA interaction that drives hybridization between the transducer and trans-acting RNAs. Reactions initiated between loop sequences in both RNAs are termed loop-loop interactions, whereas those that occur between a loop sequence and an unstructured RNA are termed loop-linear(Takahashi and Lucks, 2013).
A common limitation for riboregulators has been their dynamic range (Liu et al., 2012). Previous prokaryotic translational riboregulators have typically modulated biological signals by up to a maximum of 55-fold for activators (Callura et al., 2012) and up to 10-fold for repressors (Mutalik et al., 2012). In contrast, protein-based transcriptional regulators have demonstrated dynamic ranges over an order of magnitude higher, with widely-used inducible promoters regulating protein expression over 350-fold (Lutz and Bujard, 1997) and sigma factor-promoter pairs providing up"

Sharing
The following is our Human Practice proposal.
Abstract
We propose a new practice in sharing biological parts whereby it is the duty of the users to consistently report back to the registry on the quality of their part and to make their best effort to replace it in the registry if it is found to be faulty or non-functioning.  To encourage this dialogue between the registry and its users, we suggest making it a requirement of iGEM teams that use biological parts to note on the part webpage whether the part worked as expected via a revised rating and review system.  Further incentive for user-participation could be achieved through the creation of an additional Gold metal criterion requiring iGEM teams wishing to acquire this award to have replaced a missing or faulty biological part by contacting the initial submitter and restoring the part to a functional biobrick form.
Introduction
The rise of Synthetic Biology over the last decade can be largely attributed to the dedicated community of users who have elected open-disclosure as a means of promulgating this nascent subject.  Collaboration and contribution to publicly accessible websites (such as OpenWetWare and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts) have allowed the field to progress at a rate unimaginable prior to the advent of the Internet.
This newfound willingness to disseminate previously coveted methodology and resultant data prior to publication (via online means) mirrors the rise in popularity of social networking websites, such as Facebook and MySpace: social networking users are willing to publically publish extremely personal information. *
A benefit to this type of research design is the ability for researchers to quickly and easily post relevant methodology and data that can be instantly utilized by other scientists worldwide.  However, this type of instantaneous submission can often be detrimental to the quality of information being published, which is precisely why a standardized peer-review process is required for publication in a scientific journal, such as Nature.
Peer-review (or “self-policing”) can be obtained in the aforementioned types of delocalized online communities; however, achieving it requires both an immense amount of frequent user involvement and a vast user base with expertise in each area of discussion.  Further hindrance to online content quality includes the allowance of anonymity on most online sites as well as an inability to ensure quality of content over time (i.e. if a piece of material previously published remains accurate/reliable in the future).  The former challenge"

Human Practices - Silver Award
Education
BioMech
Synthetic Biology is severely under-taught at all stages of education, occasionally certain syllabi will lightly touch on certain concepts, but only to briefly move on without any real depth into the topic. One of the aims of our human practises is to address this by providing easily accessible synthetic biology learning resources such as a board game, open to teachers and students alike. This lack of focus on synthetic biology is not only seen in lower levels of education, but further up the age ladder at university. Very few universities offer modules in specifically synthetic biology which is why we have taken steps to implement a module in our own university.
BioMech is an educational synthetic biology board game, designed by the 2016 Exeter iGEM team for students aged 14-18. The concept of the board game was developed early on in the project, with the design informed by a year 10 work experience student. The board game was then tested with GCSE students from two schools, the feedback from which was used to tailor the game around the current knowledge of year 10 students. The intention is to introduce the concept of synthetic biology to a younger age group in a fun and engaging manner. In order to make the game widely accessible despite needing a physical copy BioMech has been uploaded to our wiki, and is able to download with printing instructions for free. We hope that BioMech will inspire students to further their own education independently given that there is currently very little taught on the topic prior to university level.
You can read more about BioMech here.
Synthetic Biology Module
Continuing with the theme of responding to a lack of education in synthetic biology, we also looked at university level education. Due to the lack of any type of formal synthetic biology teaching here at the University of Exeter, we have created a second year synthetic biology module to implement in the Biosciences department. During the design process we managed to talk to multiple academics about their thoughts on the process of implementing new modules into the syllabus, and how it could be made more efficient in the future. It will be available for second year Biosciences and Natural Sciences students to take from September 2017.
You can read more about the module here.
Public Perception
Desert Island... Science"
Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"A huge part of the costs of bTB is the compensation paid to farmers. When a cow tests positive for bTB, further testing is carried out, and then it is slaughtered if still found to have bTB. The UK government compensates the farmer for any cattle slaughtered. Although this sum is often much less than the actual value of the cattle, it costs the UK a huge amount every year. In 2009 total compensation costs were over £50 million[8]. The carcasses of slaughtered cattle are checked for bTB, and any that do not have tuberculosis lesions in more than one organ or body part are sold into the food industry[9]. This helps to reduce the compensation costs by a small amount.
DEFRA employs vets to perform regular tuberculin skin tests on UK cattle. This occurs every four years in low risk areas, but can be higher in areas with a major bTB problem. If a herd is found to contain any animals which react positively to the skin test, restrictions are imposed upon the herd and another test is performed in 60 days. This testing continues every 60 days until the herd is proved to be clear in two separate tests. The UK government provides information on the average amount testing costs every year. The current test costs approximately £5.90 per animal in 2001/10 [8].

General Safety and Bio-Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
All experiments performed in our lab are supervised by either PhDs or professors that are currently working at the Inferfaculty Institute of Biochemistry. Their expertise reaches from genetics over molecular biology to structural biology. In case of questions concerning the handling of chemicals, devices, or biosafety the supervisors were always available. The procedures used in our lab were conducted based on protocols that are well-established throughout the scientific world and were performed in a biosafety level 1 laboratory, as requested by German law ("" Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (GenTG) "" [law for the regulation of genetic engineering]). In order to enable replicability and to avoid repetitive errors, all experiments done in the lab are documented in a common lab notebook that was handed to Professor Dr. Ralf-Peter Jansen at the end of each week.
Joining regular briefings concerning lab safety is an essential element of our education at the University of Tuebingen. In addition, Professor Dr. Jansen gave a special talk about biosafety to all members of our team.
Since the E. coli strains used within our project were specifically optimized to not carry out any pathogenic, toxicogenic, or colonising activities and due to the harmless nature of our parts we do not foresee any security concerns in the event of the realization of our project. Furthermore, a main part of the experiments done in our lab is based on the use of purified proteins, thereby minimizing the risk of any contaminations with genetically modified organisms. There is no reported harmful activity of the proteins used in our studies,"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

DNA Purification
This protocol uses the commercially available SanPrep Column PCR Product Purification Kit from Sangon Biotech(Shanghai) Co.,LTD. We have made some adaptation and for detailed user-guide and list of required reagent, see SanPrep Column Plasmid Mini-Preps Kit handbook.
Preparation. Add ethanol into Wash Solution;add isopropanol into Buffer B3; make sure Buffer B3 doesn’t appear sedimentation.
Add Buffer B3(5 times the volume of PCR reaction solution) into PCR reaction solution.
Centrifuge at 8000rpm for 30s.Discard the flow-through.
Wash the Spin Column with 500 μl Wash solution and centrifuge at 9000 rpm for 30s. Discard the flow-through and place the Spin Column back into the collection tube.
Repeat step 4 again
Place the Spin Column back to the collection tube and centrifuge at 9000rpm for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. Discard the flow-through.
Transfer the Spin Column to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 15-40μl volume of Elution Buffer to the center of the membrane, incubate at room temperature  for 1 min, then centrifuge at 9000 rpm for 1 min.Store the DNA solution properly.

We successfully improve characterization of parts BBa_K309016 —GFP with introns used in C.elegans. What’s more, we optimize the sequence to make the coding sequence stats with “ATG”. The optimized GFP is submitted.
We construct a str-1::Chrimson::GEMgeco::GFP fusion gene and inject it into C.elegans. The function of GFP is to localize the neuron AWB with the help of promoter str-1.
We capture the image of GFP specifically expressed in AWB with confocal microscope and clearly observe AWB even its dendrite.

This is the first step of the product recovery. Before applying the fermentation broth to the column it needs  to be fluidized. The fluidization process is described in greater detail during the next step. An important   parameter for the creation of a stable bed is viscosity, should viscosities of the different buffers used vary   in a degree that destabilizes the bed an inert viscous liquid will be added..

The expansion is achieved be applying 10 bed volumes (BV) of column buffer (20 mM (4-(2-  Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt) (Na-HEPES) and 500 mM Sodium chloride   (NaCl)) at a flowrate of 300 [cm/h], which is recommended, though flows between 200 and 400 [cm/h] has been shown   sufficient. The composition can be viewed in   table 8. Determination of the BV relies on the production (see  equation 1), it has been decided to produce 2 [g/batch] of the peptide aptamer. This decision will be   elaborated in the decription of the elution step (C1.4). Reference: NEB-impact

Cleaning an oil spill comes at a hefty price; costs can snowball up to $21.47 per liter oil (Etkin, 2000). A big spill is next to              impossible to deal with; since it is impossible to mobilize the body of labor needed and the technologies to clean up soon enough              (Suzuki, 2016). Available ""technologies"" consist of burning the oil or using chemical dispersants (Suzuki, 2016). Such techniques              are crippled; they can't get rid of large spills, nor they work in icy waters, or where waves run amok (Nikiforuk, 2016).
Figure 2: Efforts to clean an oil spill. Retrieved from: https://www.wired.com/2015/05/oil-spill-off-santa-barbara-going-kill/
Oil spills are disastrous, they kill all the aquatic birds they come in contact with by sticking to birds' feathers, making              them heavier which limit their movements, causing either their inability to catch prey or reducing their mobility in water              leading to their death (Nikiforuk, 2016). They also wreck the marine organisms' habitat (Moore, 1974).
Fossil fuels and their combustions in energy conversion devices are the primary causes of the pollution of the atmosphere (Radovič, 2006). This pollution can be divided into two; primary and secondary (Radovič,2006). Primary air pollutants, which are COx, SOx, NOx, and particulates of very fine soot and ash particles, are all harmful to the environment (Radovič, 2006). Whether it's the potentially fatal CO or SO2's strong acidity causing acid rains, these pollutants are immensely harmful (Radovič, 2006).
Carbon emissions are so harmful that, in 2010, 4,5 million people died from it (Rathi, 2015). This makes air pollution related to carbon emissions more deadly than wars, murders and traffic accidents combined (Rathi, 2015).
Carbon monoxide; the most poisonous gas that is a product of incomplete combustion of any fuel (Radovič, 2006). Urban cars and vehicles are the culprit, since fossil fuel combustion vehicles are incapable of burning fuel fully when cold, which make up the majority of their use scenarios, they incompletely burn fuels the most (Radovič, 2006). It's estimated that some 100 million tons of"

Characterization of recombinant effector proteins
Figure 1: Effectors
For the development of a transgenic water filter it is an essential task to create a collection of well described and functional effector proteins which are either able to bind ( BioAccumulation ) or to degrade ( BioDegradation ) xenobiotics which are present in the aquatic environment. This task was completed by the production of relevant effector proteins in E. coli and their subsequent purification and characterization. Deliberately we have chosen some well established BioBricks from the last years such as a laccase (<partinfo>BBa_K1159002</partinfo>) or the catechol dioxigenase (<partinfo>BBa_K648011</partinfo>) to improve these BioBricks. Beside these improvements we also added new BioBricks to the registry which we characterized in vitro such as the erythromycin esterase (EreB) (<partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>) or the NanoLuc luciferase (<partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo>) which will be a useful tool for subsequent generations of iGEM students. For technical questions on our experiments, please see protein biochemical methods for further information. Beside these experiments with recombinant proteins we also characterized our stable transformed moss strains ( see PhyscoFilter section ).

The Biolink project promotes the open source and educational spirit of iGEM. Our 3D printer, the Biolinker, is made of K’NEX construction toys, a DIY solution that is both easy to build and efficient in doing its job. Through policy and practice we try to position our project within the synthetic biology industry and academia, as well as observe socio-economic perception and feedback. We accomplish this by analyzing and interviewing stakeholders, treating ethical and regulatory issues, and building a business plan around our project.
Synthetic Biology in our Project
During biofilm formation, bacteria produce an extracellular matrix made of amyloid structures. These amyloid structures are curli fimbriae, composed of intertwined filaments with a thickness of approximately 4-7 nm (Nguyen, 2014). Therefore, curli production helps bacteria bind to each other in natural biofilms (Taylor et. al. 2012). There are two distinctive operons involved in this highly regulated pathway; csgBA and csgDEFG. The csgBA operon encodes for two proteins: CsgA and CsgB. The csgDEFG operon encodes for the proteins required for the transport of CsgA and CsgB to the cell surface (Dueholm et al, 2011).
On one hand, CsgA is an amyloid protein that acts as monomer for curli formation. On the other hand, the protein CsgB in an integral membrane protein, which binds CsgA to the cell; CsgB acts as an anchor for curli formation. CsgA is transported as an unfolded protein to the extracellular matrix. Once outside the cell, it aggregates with CsgB and the self-assembly of these aggregates form the amyloid fibrils. When CsgA comes in contact with CsgB, the fibrils bind to another cell and the process is repeated again until an entire network has been created (Barnhart et al, 2006).
In our project, we designed an inducible system for synthesizing CsgA in biofilm-making deficient cells. Besides to that, we aimed to create a customized biofilm. To do so, we designed different biobricks that contain a peptide tail attached to the sequence of the biofilm protein CsgA that provides a specific surface affinity. In the end, we planned to use our engineered cells (which also express a fluorescent reporter) for printing in different layers; printing biofilms in 3 dimensions.

The decimal point between mL and uL or between uL and nL will always be marked somehow (usually with a line, sometimes by change between red numbers vs. black numbers). DO NOT EVER TWIST THE KNOB PAST THE UPPER AND LOWER LIMITS FOR THE PIPET!
3) Slide the bottom end of the pipet into a clean, autoclaved tip of the appropriate size. You can tell if a tip box is autoclaved because it will have a stip of autoclave tape with black stripes. Press down firmly so that when you pull the pipet back up, the tip remains fixed to the end of the pipet. You should keep tip boxes closed when you are not working with them to prevent contamination.
4) Push the plunger (knob on top) down with your thumb until you feel some resistance. This is the pipet’s “first stop.” Do not push past this stop yet.
5) With the plunger pushed to the first stop, insert the tip into the liquid you want to pipet, just below the liquid’s surface. (Minimizing the tip’s contact with the liquid helps prevent contamination). Do not allow the sides of the pipet to touch the inside of the container! Remember that only the disposable plastic tip is sterile
6) Slowly lift up your thumb to allow the plunger to rise back to its starting position. If you do it too fast you will create air bubbles that can throw off the measurements. As you let the plunger back to its starting position, the pipet will suck up the desired amount of liquid. If you are pipetting from a small container such as a 1.5 mL tube you may need to move the pipette downward as you do this in order to keep the tip under the surface of the liquid.
7) Remove the tip from the liquid. Keep the pipet completely upright at all times when there is liquid in the tip. Turning the pipet upside down or sideways will cause liquid to fall into the body of the pipet, ruining it.
8) Look at the liquid in the tip to make sure you actually pulled it up! There should not be any bubbles.
9) Lightly touch the pipet tip to the side of the new container just above the level of the liquid. Again, do not allow the sides of the pipet to touch the walls of the container! Only the disposable plastic tip is sterile

Only limited amounts of Cd in products are recycled. Cd in consumer products primarily ends up at dump sites or incinerators, exposed to the environment (Fig2, Fig3). As it’s exposed to the environment, it has been very close to living organisms. Leafy plants such as tobacco, rice, and lettuce can soak up Cd as if it were any other soil nutrient. Through tobacco smoking, smokers have 4-5 times higher blood Cd concentrations and 2-3 times higher kidney Cd concentrations than non-smokers. Besides tobacco smoking, diet is the leading source of Cd exposure for the non-smoking general population. The rice absorbed the Cd, and then the Cd accumulated in the people eating contaminated rice. Unfortunately, in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and other countries of Asia, rice is the major source of diet. It means the main route of environmental Cd exposure for the general population is through the consumption of contaminated food.
Fig.2. Contaminated soil
Fig.3. Cd pollution degrees in China
With other nutritional stress like Fe, Zn, or Ca deficiencies, high dietary intake of Cd can leads to associated human Cd diseases. As a non-essential element for human bodies, Cd shares the same period in the periodic table with Zn, which is an essential metal for human bodies. They share a common oxidation state (bivalent) and are almost the same size when ionized. Due to these similarities, Cd can replace Zn in many biological systems, in particular, system that contains softer ligands such as sulfur. But Cd forms bonds up to ten times stronger than Zn in certain biological systems, so it’s notoriously difficult to remove from other compounds. The estimated half-life of Cd in the human system exceeds 15 years. The prolonged intake of even small amounts of Cd leads to skeletal damage and dysfunction of the kidneys. That makes them toxic in mammals.
Most researchers took the Itai-Itai disease (Fig4) as a favorite example when discussing about Cd contamination and human Cd diseases, for it’s the first documented case of mass Cd poisoning in the world. The name coined by locals describes the screams due to the severe pain in bones. It’s still one of four major pollution-related diseases in Japan now.

In a 2 and 3 BabbleBrick system the probability of a false positives occurring was reduced by     approximately 20 and 30 times respectively, although the numbers are too large to compute,     this new method has the possibility of lowering the maximum false positive error of the previously     used checksum by one or more orders of magnitude.    If continued further, research should also be done in to the reconstruction of data after it has been lost.

We initiated contact with Stanford-Brown this year with the intention of interviewing one of their supervisors, Prof. Lynn Rothschild. We were interested in hearing                 about her opinions as well as experiences with diversity and equality in science. Unfortunately we were never able to find a mutually suitable date to carry out the             interview. However we were able to organise a collaboration with her team.

We are very thankful to Stanford-Brown for their contribution, as it has helped our work get further recognition on an international scale.
We are also proud and grateful in saying that we have helped and been helped by various other teams in this years iGEM competition. Utilising other teams equipment and different ways of thinking towards solving problems has provided us all with some great data and innovative solutions to some problems we have encountered. We are confident that what we have achieved will benefit the iGEM competition as a whole.
Good inter-team communication is a vital factor in all disciplines and at the core of the iGEM spirit. We hope to have contributed to this in several ways."

Early Results
The most of our relevant results are described in the Proof of Concept page.
Here are some of our first experiment results that guided us through our development, and finally, our results with sexually transmitted infections vectors.
First study of the ATP-aptamer’s affinity in liquid
In this experience, we used some modified aptamers. They were functionalized with a FITC, so they were fluorescent.                                     Fluorescence was stopped by the reverse-complement of the aptamer,                                     which was holding a quencher: a molecule that switches off the fluorescence by the                                     Fluorescent Resonnance Energy Transfert (FRET) phenomenon.
We studied how the ability of ATP to chase the quencher away. As the target (ATP) and the quencher are in competition to bind the aptamer,                                     the emitted fluorescence is a good estimation of the proportion of aptamers that have linked an ATP.
Fig 1.
As can be seen here, there is a good response of the system to ATP. With a Kd of 330 µmol.L-1 (target concentration able to be fixed by the aptamers).                                     This is not particularly efficient. We think that the quenching oligo is disturbing the aptamer, lowering its sensitivity.
The next step was to try this on paper.
Study of the impact of various solvents and blood proteins on the fluorescence emitted by fluorescein
In this experience we wanted first to test what is the impact of non-isotonic solvents on the emitted fluorescence. We obtained no significant differences of fluorescence emissions between assays when me mixed blood with PBS buffer or with NaCl. Although, we tried to compare the fluorescence emissions between blood and plasma. The results were more interesting.
Student statistical tests were performed for each concentration of fluorescein. It was concluded that blood filtration to remove especially red blood cells which could mask the                                     fluorescence is proven to be very important: the fluorescence emitted is between 2 and 11 times larger in the case of serum compared to"

In synthesizing any designed system of engineered protein, one must able to oversee and predict regarding its performance and behaviour. In analysing the protein, one can apply principles of mathematics and engineering in doing so. Reaction kinetics study can be largely described as the study of reactions regarding their performance such as rates, effects of various variables, etc. In this report, the kinetics of the designed protein will be evaluated based on existing literature. Mass transportation principle, such as Langmuir-Hill or Michaelis-Menten equation, will be loosely applied and adequately correlated for the resulting models. Mathematical models and non-linear regression will play roles for the protein. Out team hopes that this mathematical modelling analysis for the protein will shed a new perspective for the synthesized protein’s function and enlighten some parts of our project.
Qualitative Overview
Figure 1. The figure above describes the event of diphtheria toxin initial binding to the HB-EGF receptors in human epithelial cells. Attached toxin will inhibit protein synthesis and result in apoptosis.
Figure 2. The figure above describes the difference between the chimeric protein performance’s regarding of its reaction with diphtheria toxin.
Thus, in overseeing the entire performance, it can be divided into three parts:

UNIFI,2017,Team:UNIFI#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"'s not working for 5 of our 9 DNA fragments!!
September:
It has been full of work: we reached the first good results in the lab for the Bielefeld project, and for our too. Moreover, we organized two conference calls with two professors which have been very stimulating and interesting.
04/09 – 25/09 → In this very looong period, in the lab we did a lot of PCRs on IDT’s fragment to amplificated them to perform the Gibson assembly reaction more efficiently. With hope we tried to assembly the system 1 fragments but we failed. Since we consumed the majority of the fragments, we had to re-ordered the more puzzling sequences at the IDT once again.
05/09 → Skype #7: tips for the Conference call with professor Dirk Stermerding, and about how to find other experts in our country to help us with various aspects of our project, like how to handle the public engagement and what should be considered before writing down a survey.
18/09 → Skype #8: Team Bielefeld gave us various advice and tips to improve our PCR results, electrophoresis’s run and other practical stuff. The best part is that they shared with us the protocol for aquacloning, a pretty unexpected technique that we welcomed with arms wide open.
20/09 → Skype call with Prof. Dirk Stemerding, senior researcher at the Rathenau Instituut (NL)
25/09 → Skype #9: We must sadly announce that we had to cut off our third vector from the project because we had tried all the possibilities, but seems like PCR (needed to extend the sequence lacking of some bases) didn't work in any way this time. Bielefeld team shared with us a protocol to make competent cells for thermal shock, because during the summer we had some problems with our protocol CaCl2-based due to high external temperatures (the average of max temperature was over 30°C for the whole summer!)
26/09 → We experimented the acquacloning reaction: it magically worked! The day after, we carried forward acquacloning reaction with some device (extension and ligation).
27/09 → First positive results for Bielefeld project. Conference call with David Kong about science art! David Sun Kong, Ph.D., is a Synthetic Biologist, community organizer, based in Lexington, MA. He is the Director of the MIT Media Lab's new Community Biotechnology Initiative.

As one of the members in our team and student in this school, QianQian Tao shared her own experience of teaming with NUDTers. The students present raised many questions about details in competition. We also distributed brochures named SPACESHIP E.coli made by team OUC-China, hoping to increase publicity of synthetic biology.
Speeches at Streets & Survey
This year, we provide an innovative way of protein degradation, which can be developed as a brand-new option in curing diseases. We prepared and delivered speeches at streets about the causes, symptoms and curing methods (including traditional ones and new, potential ones) of tumor, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, trying to enhance people’s familiarities with these fatal diseases and inspire them with methods using synthetic biology. For example, we talked about traditional ways of cancer curing (chemotherapy, radiation and surgery), analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of them, compared these matters with “target therapy” and finally introduced our project, PR PREDATOR, to people.
Poster made by our team in street!
Questionnaires were given to passers-by！
Besides, we did a survey of people’s cognition of diseases mentioned above. We had collected 77 papery questionnaires and 51 ones online in total. After analyzing the data, we concluded that:
1. most people believed traditional cancer curing methods caused damage to normal cells. (Q4)
2. 71% of them thought targeting at proteins of tumor cells could be a new way in the future, and only 8% of them chose the injection way.(Q7)
3. only about 1/6 of people understand the mechanism of the degradation of abnormal intracellular proteins. (Q13)
4. people’s attitudes towards future application of PR PREDATOR varied, but were mainly positive or neutral, some of whom even provided cutting-edge information. (Q14)
Through the education at streets and the engagement with the public, we had a deeper and better-rounded understanding of tumor, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease which were posing threat to humans’ lives. By combining the academic knowledge with ordinary life and inspiring people with innovative curing methods, we believed that the future application of target therapy as well as our PR PRADATOR would be wider and could exert a greater influence in maintaining health.
Q4: Which of the disadvantages do you think is the biggest one of chemotherapy and radiation tools in cancer curing?
Q7: Which of the methods do you think can be a new way of curing tumor and cancer?

Alhoewel de Steen der wijzen nooit gevonden werd heeft de zoektocht ernaar alchemisten ertoe gedreven om een veelvoud aan stoffen en hun interacties in hun laborotorium te onderzoeken en aan testen te onderwerpen. Deze experimenten hebben tot het vergaren van veel kennis geleid die men ook heden ten dage nog terug ziet in de chemiewetenschappen, metallurgie en farmacologie.
Levend in een tijd waarin empirisch onderzoek steeds meer mythen heeft ontkracht zijn we gaandeweg ons geloof in een “Steen der wijzen” verloren. Toch zijn we nog steeds op zoek, men kan zeggen op een ware queeste, naar soortgelijke remedies als voorheen; niet alleen om individuen langer gezond te laten blijven en hun levensduur bovendien te verlengen, maar ook naar manieren om door de moderne mens gecreëerde ecologische problemen op te lossen. In tegenstelling tot vroeger tijden geloven we vandaag de dag niet meer dat deze antwoorden verborgen zijn in mystieke voorwerpen. Niettemin kunnen we ons laten inspireren door de oude alchemisten om nieuwe methoden te ontwikkelen die ons in staat stellen de uitdagingen voor onze samenleving aan te gaan.
Laat ons je meenemen op een reis waarop je een nieuwe klasse aan moleculen zult leren kennen met het potentieel de synthetische biologie te revolutioneren; de groep van niet-ribosomale peptide synthetasen. We zullen je kennis laten maken met de verrassende veelzijdigheid van deze moleculen en hoe we peptiden kunnen maken met verschillende functies zoals, bijvoorbeeld, het hergebruiken van goud afkomstig uit afgedankte elektronische apparaten!

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).
Our team researched how factors beyond the bench can impact the potential of an iGEM project and more broadly synthetic biology to make a positive real world impact. After realising that bioremediation of chlorinated solvents had potential not just as an iGEM project but as a solution to the pollution faced by the Environment Agency, we decided to investigate: How can an iGEM Project change the real world? Our broad approach allowed us to explore many areas as facets of this question, including intellectual property, practicality (including safety), and public participation. The result was a far-reaching Policy and Practices project which impacted on almost all aspects of the scientific project and addressed a question of interest central interest to our scientists and hopefully to other iGEM teams! Our research into Intellectual Property policy strongly influenced our decision to encourage other iGEM teams to use our novel ‘BioBead’ containment system; our research into safety drove the design of the DCMation prototype; our research into the environmental problems posed by chlorinated solvents has constantly guided all aspects of the scientific project. We hope our approach will encourage others to consider the non-scientific factors which impact the success of their project, to take these seriously, and to realise just how much good an iGEM project really can do!
See our Policy and Practices page for details on our approach, evaluation and its influence on our project.

We hypothesized that the homologous sites were large and should be shortened using new primers or the amount/concentrations of the used constructs in the mixture could have been adjusted. 6 constructs including the plasmid is the limit for Gibson reaction and maybe did not go well.
     The next cloning approach was the conventional cloning using restriction digestion. New primers were designed for PhaA-CFP and PhaB-RFP-Term to introduce restriction sites. First, we tried to clone PhaA-CFP into the vector and transform E. coli. The acquired MiniPrep was then digested and a ligation was run with PhaB-RFP-Term.

Since science is a collective effort, one can never pursue great things                                          alone and without taking help from people who are experts in the specific                                          subjects. Not to mention the nature of iGEM projects requiring us to be                                          well-rounded, it's fair to say it's next to impossible to do it alone.

Human Practices
Beyond the lab, we were there to be a part of the society. During the making                                          of our project, we benefited from the public idea as much as we benefited                                          from any protocol or article. We strove to integrate what we have learned from                                          others to our project in order to make the best use of Bio-E, since we wanted                                          the whole world to make use of our fermentation process in the future. You can see our human practices on the Human Practices and Education and Engagement pages.
Contrary to popular belief, iGEM is much more than what meets the eye. It means to be                          conscious, it means to have a community, it means entrepreneurship. Just like all the                          iGEM teams, our experience leads us to learn that science is truly a collective endeavor.                          Here is our interactions with peers, experts, and the public.

Q-7) Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
A-7) In our project, we have used JM109 strain of E. coli, a derivative of K-12 strain encoding auxotrophy, which cannot grow in natural field.  In case of future use, the transgenic E. coli will be used under supplication of required nutrition, so they cannot grow outside the experimental field.  Also, if this two strain system for collection and attraction of cadmium ion will be used for other organisms, we must select the organisms not to be involved in bioaccumulation of cadmium.
Sammary
According to the above results, We concluded to use it, because it doesn’t have serious risk at present. We thought E.coli left environment may damage us, because we thought we design E.coli to be able to collect it. We conducted these ideas by oral presentation and oral poster session in The 86th Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of Japan at Nagahama Institute of Bio-Sience and Technology in September 17th-20th, 2014 . We got some ideas from audiences. We have been considered from these ideas. We felt the theme is difficult and complex. We clean regions polluted by the heavy metal ion by using E.colis designed by iGEM Nagahama.

We think ethics and safety on iGEM projects. iGEM Nagahama decided to do human practices to know synthetic biology. We thought that we organize many opportunity of discussion about synthetic biology with people having various background. People doesn’t have accurate knowledge about Syntheticbiology. For example, the result of recombinant genes and synthetic organisms which have new abilities. These situations have difficulty in discussing important problems, such as a question about ethics or safety. We participate in The 86th Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of Japan at Nagahama Institute of Bio-Sience and Technology in September 17th-20th, 2014 .

Fig.9 The gene circuits of Bxb1 regulation system.
The processes of the regulation circuit are described as followed:
(1) At first, because normal fermentation pH tends to be acidic, J23119 is in the direction of GadA production (alkali device).
(2) In alkaline environment (pH＞7.0), P-atp2 is induced and produces Bxb1, which switches the direction of J23119 to generate LdhA (acid device).
(3) Bxb1 will switch J23119 to both sides, and eventually the inversion efficiency of Bxb1 to both sides are the same.
(4) The final environmental pH is determined by strength of acid and alkali produced by LdhA (for acid) and GadA (for alkali).
Here we assumed that Bxb1 had reached stable condition, where the inversion efficiency of Bxb1 to both sides are the same.
Basing on processes above, the reaction equations are described as followed:
Results proved that with the application of Bxb1 regulation circuit, pH Controller could regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid and alkali (Fig.10).
Fig.10 pH level change led by Bxb1 regulation circuit. In alkaline environment, p-atp2 is induced, activating downstream Bxb1 to invert the direction of J23119. Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali.
FimE Regulation Circuit
The last fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinase FimE (Fig.11). This recombinase can only invert the promoter for one time.
Fig.11 The gene circuits of FimE regulation system.
The processes of the circuit are described as followed:
(1) Similar to Bxb1 circuit, the initial direction of J23119 points to GadA.
(2) When pH raises higher than 7.0, P-atp2 is induced and produces recombinase FimE.
(3) FimE will change the direction of J23119 to acid production. The circuit will generate acid till stable condition.
The reaction processes are:
The differential equations are:
Results proved that with the application of FimE regulation circuit, pH Controller could regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid (Fig.12)."

MiniTn7 & flip-flops
Genomic integration of flip-flop devices using the miniTn7 Biobrick Tool kit
An anticipated benefit of single-copy integration of Biobricks in the bacterial chromosome is the possibility of placing sophisticated regulatory devices in a context that closely resembles the natural situation (i.e., regulatory elements are generally designed to function optimally in single-copy). We predict that having regulatory devices in single-copy will improve their performance by balancing the concentration of cis-and trans-acting elements and diminishing the effect of noise-generating phenomena, such as uneven plasmid partitioning between daughter cells, that may cause these systems to drift from their expected behavior. To test this, we have successfully cloned the ""basic"" and ""improved"" flip-flop devices in the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon. The presence of the inserts was evidenced by fluorescence of colonies and cell pellets (Figure 11 and 12), and the constructs were verified by restriction analysis (data not shown). These constructs were inserted in the chromosome of E. coli by coelectroporation with the helper plasmid pTNS2 for functional testing. Correct integration at the attTn7 site was tested by colony PCR as described above (data not shown).

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ener, Ontario - July 17th. This year’s oGEM annual meet-up was hosted by Waterloo iGEM. From speakers representing Ontario Genomics (oGEM’s primary sponsor) and startups, we received insight into current and future roles of synthetic biology. Also held were open discussions between teams about iGEM on topics ranging from how to build a good Wiki to collaboration opportunities to even science memes - dialogue which unleashed a cascade of helpful advice, funny stories and mutual lab-work oriented commiseration. The iGEM community spirit truly was present at oGEM 2017!
Following the speaker series and group discussions on Wikis and Wet Lab collaborations, we broke for lunch. What was even better than the food though, was connecting on a personal level with other iGEM members. oGEM this year has a very diverse set of chapters with varying levels of experience, thus leading to fresh perspectives on every aspect of running an iGEM team.
Born out of this difference in levels of team establishment came a collaborative initiative designed to guide newer iGEM teams, while also sharing knowledge and advice between more established chapters. The oGEM Manual is a multilaterally collaborative handbook on how to run an iGEM team. Covering everything from iGEM-specific information like how to fulfill medal criteria and make a Wiki, to meta-skills like team-building and leadership, to more technical aspects of running what is essentially a synbio start-up initiative such as grant-writing and sponsorships outreach, to the really technical such as how to design a plasmid and protocols for basic practical microbiology lab techniques, we hope that this guide will serve many iGEM teams well in the coming years.
After the lunch break (lobster soup, you will be sorely missed), the oGEM chapters presented their project. As seen from the photo above (featuring UofT iGEM representatives explaining their incredible project for designing an off-switch for CRISPR cas9), each team spent 15 minutes explaining and answering questions about their summer project via PowerPoint presentation, akin to how we will later present our findings at the November Giant Jamboree. Many different chapter aspects - Wet Lab, Dry Lab, Human Practices, Community Outreach and more - were covered and it was eye-opening to see the various creative ways each team approached their project. DNAzymes, yeast prions, ice-binding bacterial biofilms... these are just a handful of the inspiring, mind-blowing projects oGEM chapters have embarked on this year.
Several Q&A sessions, photo ops, collaboration discussions and a whirl"

Its low price, easy to screen synthesis, the nature of stability and other advantages are widely used in the detection of molecular markers of disease. Its presence provides a new way to quickly and efficiently identify bio-makers.

principle
First of all, we select an aptamers AP273, which could best affinity for AFP. We modified a biotin at the end of its 5’ end, which could affinity for streptavidin. Because of the presence of streptavidin-modified beads, aptamer has been locked firmly on beads. At the same time, a complementary chain was synthesized in its protein binding site. We modified an amino at the 3’ end of the complementary chain which can be combined with lysine protected by BOC anhydride to link lysine to the complementary chain. Because Van der Waals forces between AFP and aptamers is stronger than hydrogen bond, due to the action of magnet lying at the bottom of the reaction system, aptamers are separated from complementary chain, one at the bottom, the other in the supernatant. At this point, with the action of trypsin, lysine can be separated from the complementary chain, and start his adventure.

iGEM '11
Discovery of the zinc finger protein
Jonathon Miller, A. D. McLachlan, and Sir Aaron Klug first identify the repeated binding motif in Transcription Factor IIIA and are the first to use the term ‘zinc finger.'
First crystal structure of a zinc finger
Carl Pabo and Nikola Pavletich of Johns Hopkins University solve the crystal structure of zif268, now the most-commonly studied zinc finger. This paved the way for construction of binding models to describe how zinc fingers bind to DNA, setting the foundation for future custom engineering of zinc finger proteins.
CEO Edward Lanphier founds Sangamo Biosciences
Edward Lanphier leaves Somatix Therapy Corporation and makes a deal for exclusive rights to the work of Srinivan Chandrasegaran of Johns Hopkins University who combined the Fok I nuclease with zinc fingers.
Srinivasan Chandrasegaran publishes work on fusing the Fok I nuclease to zinc fingers
By attaching nuclease proteins to zinc fingers, a new genome editing tool was created. The DNA-binding specificity of zinc fingers combined with the DNA-cutting ability of nucleases opened up possibilities for future research in gene therapy by allowing researchers to directly modify the genome though use of zinc finger nucleases.
Sangamo enters the public sector
In April 2000, five years after its founding, Sangamo Biosciences goes public offering 3.5 million shares at a starting value of $15 per share.
Sangamo patents zinc finger nuclease technology
Sangamo's patent, titled ""Nucleic acid binding proteins (zinc finger proteins design rules)"", ensures that any use or production of zinc fingers with attached nucleases is the intellectual property of Sangamo.
Rapid open source production of zinc finger nucleases becomes available
Researcher Keith Joung of Harvard University and Mass. General Hospital develops a method for making zinc finger nuclease proteins that bind to custom target sequences, utilizing a bacterial two-hybrid screening system to identify specific zinc finger binders to a DNA sequence of interest.

We achieved some projects that collaborated on with teams in Japan. Each team in Japan discusses with other teams regularly and actively, using Skype and Wiki on the Web. These collaborations enabled every team to share information of all teams in Japan and activate one another.
iGEM Summer Meetup in Japan (in Kyoto)
6 teams in Japan met in Kyoto University in order to practice presentation in English.  On 18th August 2010, teams in Japan gathered together in “Summer meetup”. This year, the meeting was took place at Kyoto University (Hosted by team Kyoto). The aim of this meetup was to cultivate ideas with other teams. Each team was supposed to give a presentation on their projects followed by discussion with other teams. 5 teams attended to make presentations (Kyoto、UT-Tokyo、Tokyo-Metropolitan、Osaka、KIT-Kyoto), and Tokyo-tech, delegated an observer. After the presentation meeting, we had a social party and made the bond with between teams tight.
iGEM Summer Meetup in Tokyo
On 23th August 2010, 5teams near Tokyo met in our campus. This meetup was hosted by UT-Tokyo and its aim was to have a direct discussion and see our facilities. At first in the meeting, attendants were divided in four small groups, in which members from each team explained their projects and discussed together.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html," by introducing the arrival of foulbrood in Mexico and mentioning the National Program for Honey Harmlessness and Quality, which appeals to European standards (since the EU is Mexican honey’s largest purchaser). Among these standards, Mexico asks honey producers to create antibiotic-free products.
On American Foulbrood, he called the larvae’s first 24 hours “crucial”, since it is the time their defenses are at their lowest. He remarked that there aren´t effective remedies to these diseases, only preventive methods.
He said that bee colony arson was frowned upon and claimed that wood should not be used indiscriminately . When one suspects spores are present, it is imperative to change hives and flame the boxes by blowtorch, this is sterilization.
On our own account, we found NOM--SEMARNAT/SAGARPA-2007 which sets parameters under which it is legal to start fires on forestry, agricultural, and cattle land. It allows fires for the control of bacterial diseases, after meeting several requirements.
He mentioned foulbrood incidence has declined since 2008 thanks to the Good Honey Production Practices manual which recommends changing boxes and preventive strategies for beekeepers. He mentioned MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, Head of the Department of Genomic Sequencing at the National Center for Animal Health Verification Services, who has cultured Paenibacillus larvae for identification, from samples taken in 17 different states of the Mexican Republic.
Tanus stated that it is impossible to say that there is no presence of foulbrood in Mexico without first conducting an epizootiology study in the country. He clarified that the word of a beekeeper is not in doubt; however, it might be hard to obtain real data as it is a mandatory complaint issue, so there is distrust of the producer. He shared some characteristics that differentiate both foulbrood. He also commented on the incidence of these diseases throughout the seasons.
Dr. Tanus suggested liquid application (in the form of syrup) which beekeepers could feed their hives. This syrup (sweetened water) could contain the peptides in it and be fed directly to the box. This way, nurse bees would feed on here. Since Africanized bees appeared, he claims, it is better to have interior feeding to avoid foragers. This method would also avoid product loss from environmental conditions such as the wind or sun.
He reassured us that peptides would get to the brood, regardless of the application and only the time it takes might change. Peptides cannot arrive directly since larvae do not feed on their own: on their first 3 days, larvae are fed jelly"

Das Hauptziel der „Human practice task“ (wortwörtlich menschliche Praxisaufgabe) beim iGEM-Wettberwerb ist es die Öffentlichkeit über die Möglichkeiten der kürzlich entstandenen Synthetischen Biologie zu informieren und ihr Mistrauen zu mindern. Daher versuchten wir einen Weg zu finden, mit dem wir möglichst viele Menschen erreichen und gleichzeitig eine offene Diskussion über  Synthetische Biologie anfachen konnten. Die erste Frage die wir uns stellten, war natürlich: Wie viel weiß die Öffentlichkeit eigentlich über dieses Thema? Aus diesem Grund entschieden wir uns eine Umfrage zu entwerfen und diese einerseits in der Altstadt von Göttingen auszuteilen und andererseits über das Internet zu verbreiten.
Zusätzlich beschlossen wir am 7. September einen “Informationsabend zur Synthetischen Biologie“ zu organis"

Making Molecular Biology Easier
We have designed a novel standardized assembly system, called “Plug 'n' Play with DNA” where ready to use biological parts can be gathered without the use of restriction enzymes and ligase. This will make cloning faster and assembly of expression vectors possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergillus niger ready to plug 'n' play. You can find more information about how this standard works here .
A Reporter System
As proof of concept we have created a reporter system that can be used for anything from monitoring gene expression to determination of protein localization. We expressed and localized fluorescence proteins in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans and the mammalian cell line U-2 OS with great success.
Flexibility
Standardization entails rigidity. Therefore we have written a guide that allows the researcher to customize the system, so proteins can be assembled seamless, multiple mutations can be introduced in one round of cloning etc. The only limitation to this is your creativity.
Applications
Here you can learn more about the numerous applications of the Plug’n’Play with DNA assembly standard and the research areas, where this system is especially advantageous.
Data Page
You can find an overview of our project on our Data Page . Here you also find our favorite submitted biobricks, and the biobricks we characterized during the summer.
Achievements
Designing a novel assembly standard and creating a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells are our main achievements. You can read more about our accomplishments on this page .

Tasting good:
For the Edible coli to be a bacterium considered in the context of food, it should taste good. Several flavors are a possibility, but we chose a touch of lemon:
Limonene synthase catalyzes synthesis of the terpenoid (+)-limonene from the precursor geranyl  diphosphate, which is mainly responsible for the lemon taste in Citrus Limon.

Overexpression of dxs and appY has been  reported to increase yields of terpenoids.
