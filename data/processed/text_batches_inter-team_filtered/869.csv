We are the recipient of ZJU-China's mentorship at the very beginning. Since we are all new to igem, having little experience and very basic knowledge of the correct procedures and protocols we would require to complete their lab work, ZJU-China gave advices on their team building, project design and experimental skills. Also, with primers we designed, ZJU-China helped us construct and standardize a gene that express a fusion protein of three different enzymes linked with EAAAK and GGGGS protein linker.
Furthermore, we have in-depth collaboration in public engagement activities. Together, we experienced TEDxYouth@Hangzhou, the STEM activity at ZAST, interviewed ZFDA officers and provided each other with all our resources.
This year, ZJU-China is focusing on a system and the corresponding workflow for applying biocontrol. Wish them good results!
University of Chinese Academy of Sciences
To be honest, we are a new team. Great thanks to UCAS for paving the way for our newly established team by mentoring us, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting our circuits. In addition, we learnt DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and UCAS helped point-mutating one of our biobricks.
This year,UCAS is focusing on removing the excess nitrogen in pond water. Wish them good results!"

Gene Therapy
Overview
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) iGEM 2013 team has built a fatty acid inducible system that enables inducible glyoxylate shunt to serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cells. Our vision is to introduce genes necessary for the cycle into the human body, with the aim of ultimately increasing energy expenditure in response to high circulating fatty acid levels. The idea is this would help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Because introducing genes into the human body is currently not a common therapeutic method, we thought it would be necessary to research on the details of how our project could be actually applied. Even though the application of our project may not occur in the near future, we thought it necessary to evaluate our project’s application as a potential biotechnology product. We have investigated a possible method that is under serious research in the scientific community: gene therapy. In this article, we will introduce the approach in more detail, examine the biosafety and bioethical issues, and lastly examine whether our project could be applied using this method.
Gene Therapy
Introduction
Gene therapy is a method that involves introducing changes in the genome to treat or prevent disease. In general this can be done by replacing a gene, inactivating a gene, or introducing a new gene into the body. Currently, scientists are trying to make gene therapy safer and more effective. In the future, effective gene therapy might replace the use of drugs or surgery (Handbook, 2013).
History
In 1966, Edward Tatum first published a paper suggesting the use of viruses in somatic-cell genetics and gene therapy. The first clinical trial was conducted by Rogers et al. to cure urea cycle disorder by introducing the gene for arginase using Shope"

PROJECT
-Background-
BACKGROUND
Bacteria acquiring resistance to antibiotics pose serious health problem globally. Following last year’s example, the project of Elan Vital Korea for this year also is related to MRSA.  This year, however, we have focused on early detection of MRSA infection using quorum sensing.  Below, we have briefly described the health threats caused by MRSA, and have explained the quorum sensing method.  Then, we have proceeded to the description of how we designed and implemented our experiments, and what results we have obtained.  Finally, we have briefly outlined the implication of our results and future plans.
Threats of Antibiotics-Resistant Bacteria
Infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious health threat worldwide including Korea and the United States of America.  It is a serious threat primarily because, as the name suggests, bacteria have evolutionarily developed a resistance to antibiotics.  It means, first of all, drugs don’t work. Furthermore, the spread of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria makes it more difficult to  control or contain the spread of the infectious disease, because it undermines the effectiveness of treatment.  And, it substantially increases the cost of healthcare, and the burden to society because it prolongs  the treatment period and increases the likelihood of death. WHO declared that it “threatens the achievements of modern medicine” (Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance 2014, WHO, 2014).   Antimicrobial resistance already causes 700,000 deaths every year, which number is expected to 10 million annually by 2050 (An international legal framework to address antimicrobial resistance, WHO, 2015).
What makes the problem more pressing is that the data isbased on the reports of clinical samples from laboratories, “predominantly in hospital settings” (Antimicrobial Resistance: Global Report on Surveillance 2014, WHO, 2014, p. 70), which means community-acquired (compared to health-care associated) infections and uncomplicated infections are underrepresented.

Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is a large-scale, centralized science popularization campaign organized by University of Science and Technology of China. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge and a chance to cultivate interest in biology. We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation and our explanation, then showed them some basic experiment operations, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We educated and inspired visitors' interest by allowing them to observe biochemical-related sections under a laboratory microscope. In addition,                 we distributed questionnaires to visitors to get their feedback on                 synthetic biology to improve the design of our software.

Student Open Source Conference
Motivation
The Student Open Source Annual Meeting is the first open source technology summit in China that is organized by student organizations. The main theme of the conference is understanding, participating in, and contributing to open source. The conference was held on Jun 9th and Jun 10th, when our thought had been come up with. So we wanted to introduce our thought, as well as our initial achievements to the participants of open source communities and get suggestions from them. To this end, some members of our team registered and attended this conference.
Practices
At the conference, our leader Wang Hao introduced the iGEM competition,  as well as our project - the EDITOR to the audience. Then a member of our team，Chen Lutong, showed the user interface design, functions of the editor and how to achieve them in detail. Finally, the team leader made a summary, listed the advantages of our project, and thought of the future: if there are PHY HUB, CHE HUB, etc., combining them, we will get LAB HUB, which will Facilitate scientific research better.
Integrated into the project
After the conference, we received some feedback from the audience. Based on their suggestions, we made some changes to our project"

1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our team has taken all of the necessary precautions to ensure the highest levels of safety throughout the project.
The E. coli strain DH5-alpha was used throughout our project. This is a Risk Group 1 laboratory strain of E. coli that have a low, but not nonexistent, virulence. Organisms classified as Risk Group 1 are not know to cause disease in healthy adults. Keeping with registration requirements for Risk Group 1 bacteria, all laboratory work was performed in an environment certified for Biosafety Level 1.
These strains of E. coli are generally not resistant to antibiotics. All bacteria were transformed with bacterial plasmids carrying our desired insert gene and antibiotic resistance to antibiotics commonly used in laboratories for selection (ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, etc.), but will not interfere with potential clinical treatment. Neither plasmids nor their insert genes will affect virulence, infectivity or host range. 
Bacteria was cultured in 5mL volumes and all cultures and inoculations were performed in a biological safety cabinet. As part of our project we have coordinated the receipt and library preparation of several experimental Deinococcus strains of bacteria. These strains were cultured by the Daly group at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, pelleted and sent to us. These strains grow very slowly and at temperatures warmer than the human body, so pathogenicity is not a major concern when working with these species. Regardless, DNA was extracted from them inside a biosafety flow hood with a face pressure of over 100 ft / min. Solid waste (plates, flasks, etc), liquid waste (decanted culture supernatant), and work surfaces were disinfected using 10% bleach before disposal and biohazard"

Collaborations
Cambridge-JIC team organised a workshop at the UK meet-up, Friday 4th September. The primary purpose of the workshop was to raise awareness and promote the use of open source hardware (OSH)). In addition, due to the interest raised, the team also received a lot of feedback and information on how their design could be modified to fit the purpose of other projects.
The workshop consisted of three benches:
1) Optic bench showcasing their 3D printed material and discussing the principle of open source hardware.
2) Microscope demonstration of their microscope prototype.
3) Build your own bench where their demonstrated how to build their microscope from scratch.
The workshop was a real success, and we would like to thank the Cambridge team for participating and introducing a great interactive element to the event.
Aix-Marseille Université (France) required some help collecting data for their project. We were instructed to distribute and collect as many surveys as possible on gum and GMOs.  We contacted students, family and friends, and anyone else that would be willing to participate, and our efforts earned us a silver Collaboration badge."

Overview
We attached the COX-2 (BBa_K2226003) and c-Myc (BBa_K2226002) promoters to the half of the reporter systems that yielded the best results. We were inspired by the 2015 Peking iGEM team to use nonspecific binding sites FRB and FKBP. (Peking iGEM Team 2015, 2015) (Rossi, Charlton, & Blau, 1994) (Rem, Galarneau, & Michnick, 2001). These reporter systems included the rapamycin-binding domain (FRB) fused to nLuc and the FK-506 binding protein 12 (FKBP) fused to cLuc. The fusion of the promoter to the reporter system made the nonspecific binding sites on the domains to become specific to the COX-2 (BBa_K2226003) and c-Myc (BBa_K2226004) proteins (Tomano & Nobuyuki, 2016). The newly specialized promoter-reporter system would then only come together in the presence of these two proteins. The creation of the FRB-rapamycin-FKBP complex induced the fusion of nLuc and cLuc, in turn generating light in the presence of rapamycin (Peking iGEM Team 2015, 2015).

Continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS), the constant release of L-DOPA, is sometimes used for very severe cases to prevent further symptoms resulting from the “wearing off effect.” A common application of CDS is Duodopa, a portable pump that administers a continuous mixture of L-DOPA and carbidopa, an L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, directly into the duodenum or jejunum via a surgically implanted tube.
Other treatments such as deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS), dopamine agonists (compounds which activate dopamine receptors, and drugs inhibiting the activity of enzymes that facilitate the degradation of dopamine in the brain have also been used in efforts against PD. Generally, however, surgeries can be expensive and drugs such as dopamine agonists have been found to be less effective than levodopa and wear off about a year.
What is our project?
Quite simply, our project involves building DNA circuits that produce and sense L-DOPA using bacteria. But, why have bacteria producing L-DOPA? Our answer lies in the gut microbiome; although still not fully understood, the bacteria living in the intestinal tract could potentially serve as a chassis for L-DOPA producing circuits. Similarly to Levodopa treatments by way of orally-taken pills, L-DOPA would be absorbed into the bloodstream from the digestive tract and could pass through the blood-brain barrier to the brain, where L-DOPA would be converted into dopamine.
Unfortunately, our project never reached the stage where we were able to test our circuits in any gut bacteria, be they human or otherwise, but we did build and test our circuits in lab strain E. coli.
Our project consists of two separate E. coli cells, each with its own specific circuit: one cell, the ‘production’ cell, focuses on the production of L-DOPA while the other cell, the ‘sensing’ cell, senses and reports the production of L-DOPA by the ‘production’ cell.

ChR2 and MEF-Jet was transfected into the cell simultaneously.
Method: In this experiment we should transfect ChR2, MEF-Jet and RL-TK in one time and cells were incubated into 24-wells plate. 24h after transfection, cells as experimental groups were put under pulse blue light to activate ChR2 while control ones were not taken out from dark environment until lysis. Dual-luciferase assay was conducted as normal.
Result: The figure below shows that illumination has in fact induced transcription initiation, and the result in more favorable in ECHO cells than in C3H10 cells. There are still problems that the increase in expression level is not as dramatically as we expected and the expression of luciferase started even if there is no light.
Explanations: The SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team has got two reasons for these situations: 1. Just like the reason in the front part, the high level of expression when there is no light the result of our use of pcDNA as a vector. And MEF2 enhancer lost its epigenetical function; 2. There is no EGTA used in this experiment (because we need to have enough Ca2+ outside the cell membrane so that ChR2 could function normally), and Ca2+ in the cell culture might initiate transcription automatically.
Since the MEF2 results are not as we exprected, we proceed to test the CRE-JeT promoter, which acts via a different signal pathway.
CRE-JeT promoter
Back to top ↑
The thought and method for the test of CRE-Jet part is similar to that of MEF2-Jet. The only difference between them is that in this test the enhancer before Jet is replaced by CRE, so we would turn to results directly.
1. Work as a good promoter
Result: As we expected, expression level of luciferase in experimental group transfected with CRE-Jet-luciferase largely outgrows its counterpart with pGL3-Basic. The picture below well depicts the function of CRE-Jet as a good promoter. However, by comparing the experimental groups varying in Ionomycin concentration, we get no favorable evidence in explaining calcium ions could regulate the enhancer-promoter.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Project#Microbial-History#Van Leeuwenhoek_-_-_TEXT.html," well-hidden, technical insight in the history of science. He placed the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, he could pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass.
The end of one whisker was reinserted by the use of the flame, in this way he could create a very small, high quality glass sphere. Eventually these spheres became the lenses of his microscope; the smaller the sphere, the higher the magnification. Since his technique wasn’t very complicated, he realised it was critical that no one would know how he did it. If the scientific community  knew his simple method for creating the critically important lens, they would disregard or might even forget his role in microscopy. Therefore he allowed others to believe that he was laboriously spending most of his nights and free time grinding increasingly tiny lenses to use in microscopes. However, the fact remains that van Leeuwenhoek made hundreds of microscopes.
The discoveries of van Leeuwenhoek began in 1674, when he examined samples from the cloudy water of the Berkelse Meer. (a lake near Delft which no longer exists). Nowadays van Leeuwenhoek is generally mentioned in connection with the discovery of microorganisms. However, his studies were much broader than microorganisms He dissected insects and examined anything that would fit on his microscope.
The first letter to the Royal Society illustrates this clearly, as it covers the sting, head and eye of a bee, and the structure of a louse as well as his observations of fungus that he said grew on leather, meat and other things. In 1673 his earliest observations were published by the Royal Society in its journal: Philosophical Transactions. Despite the initial success of Van Leeuwenhoek’s relationship with the Royal Society, this relationship was soon severely strained. In 1676 his credibility was questioned when he sent a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Since previously no one had ever seen single-celled microorganisms, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with scepticism. Eventually, in the face of Van Leeuwenhoek’s insistence, the Royal Society sent an English vicar together with a team of respected judges and doctors. Finally in 1680 the observations of Van Leeuwenhoek were fully vindicated by the society.
Using a Microscope

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,". Vertical axis is the ratio of GFP that is expressed in the second induction to GFP that is expressed over the entire experiment. Horizontal axis is the pulse length of arabinose induction.</legend>
Figure 8 shows how strong the leaky expression is during the second induction event. There seems robust relation between the pulse length and whether it succeeded in counting. There seems to be three patterns depending on the pulse length. This simulation result can be explained by assuming that the positive feedback loop of sigma is put into motion when the concentration of sigma exceeds a threshold. When the pulse length of arabinose is too short and sigma A is expressed less than the threshold value, the sigma A concentration will head to zero after the induction. Therefore, in any induction event, the count number remains unchanged, and very few GFP is expressed. This is the t = 1 ~ 42 pattern in Figure 8. When the pulse length is correct, sigma A is expressed more than the threshold value of sigma A while sigma B was expressed less than the threshold value of sigma B. This time, the count is accurately conducted and GFP is expressed significantly in the third induction. This is the t = 43~117 pattern of Figure 8.When the pulse length is too long, sigma B is expressed more than the threshold value. This time, the first induction made 2 counts, which is the situation we were concerned about.
Thus, the pulse length plays an important role in 3 counter.
In fact, this behavior can be explained by an easy dynamical system analysis.
<img src = ""
"" class = ""contTitle"" />
As we have seen in the previous sections, current sigma-recounter depends much on the pulse length of the arabinose induction; when the pulse length is too long, it would count 2 or more (if there is). We will show below the 2 counter's figure that the pulse length is hypothesized to be too long.

However, with a little improvement, our counter would not count more than 1 by a single pulse, as long as the pulse length is long enough for it to count. You want to make a construct that is not affected by the pulse length. Shown below is such an improved construct.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," London 2010 (see the charts above), general public in Korean including high school and college students show higher percentage of people who have been informed of and/or interested in synthetic biology.
But comparing the results with those obtained in Hong Kong, Korea’s Asian neighbor, the level of public awareness of the synthetic biology among Korean population are substantially lower than residents of Hong Kong. It is rather surprising considering that the Korean government has demonstrated that it has a strong desire to drive growth in the synthetic biology-related industries. In August 2011, the Korean government has selected the synthetic biology as one of the ‘Global Frontier Businesses’ and established the Intelligent Synthetic Biology Center later the same year, in order to support the research and business development in the field.  The Center (including 11 universities and more than 200 researchers) leads the development of the synthetic biology in Korea.  In short, the government’s  strong drive for the synthetic biology did not result in heightened public awareness of the field.  The observation is supported by the level of participation in iGEM, which is quite low compared to the government’s and the industry’s drive and efforts to make the industry thriving.  The result seem to suggest that as a further study, we need to look deeper into the actual works performed by the government, academics and the industry to promote the synthetic biology, and identify the challenges and issues that hinder the development of the synthetic biology despite government’s and industry’s resolution and drive.
c. Public Attitude Toward Specific Area of Synthetic Biology/Genetic Engineering
Answers on Question 5 shows interesting observation: The phrase we use to solicit answer leads to extremely different responses. Respondents expressed their concerns and generally responded negatively if the question includes the phrase “gene modification, gene alteration, etc.,” but answered more positively if the question is about the “genetic engineering.” The contrasting results seem to suggest that people do not understand what genetic engineering means, or what kind of works are done in the field.  Also, people were more understanding and forgiving if given more generic, comprehensive phrases such as “genetic engineering” rather than specific works such as “gene modification or alteration.”  The result also seems to show that the public attitude is largely decided based on the particular phrase used, (verbal and nonverbal) nuances and cultural contexts in which the phrase appears.
Absolute majority of respondents (about 65%) thought that the genetic engineering should be permitted only when justified by clear reasons and right purposes.  About 17% said that the genetic engineering is very dangerous, and prohibited at any cost. About 10% answered that the"

Would affect capability of the dosage unit to remain in place on the skin
Incorporate cross-linking monomeric units or sites
Would solve problems with polymers having glass transition temperatures below room temperature which are used to form a polymer matrix as the transdermal desogestrel-containing composition
In development of suitable polyisobutylene PSAs, one consideration is that PIBs are not crosslinked so they flow slightly.
Within a patch, that slight flow can cause an unsightly ring around the patch when it is worn for several days.
A higher content of high molecular weight PIB in the PSA formulation.
**Polybutene in certain PIB formulations, such as the Oppanol B-12 functions as a plasticizer to allow for incorporation of more high molecular weight PIB.
Mineral oil can be used as a plasticizer for the same purpose"

Safety
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Our lab is BSL 1.  We work with common lab strains of yeast and E. coli, which are kept in closed containers and always handled with gloves.  Closed-toe shoes are required in our lab.  We autoclave all biohazard waste.  When running gel electrophoresis, we use Sybr Safe, which is a mutagen.  To minimize exposure, we wear gloves and work in a contained space (fume hood) and use equipment that is not used for other experiments.  Chloroform is occasionally used in a hood to contain fumes.  Theophylline is used in some experiments.  Even though Theophylline is used in medicine, high exposures to it may be harmful, so we only handle small amounts of it.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
Our product is meant to be a disposable test strip for use in the environment.  Since releasing engineered organisms into the environment is a significant risk with unknown consequences, we would want to engineer a biological kill switch or mode of codon security into our yeast to prevent growth outside of the device.  Yeast are also physically contained behind an impermeable PDMS shield within our device.
Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks?
A.  Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
Using E.coli and Theophylline poses a potential risk to the health and safety of our team members working in the lab if it is handled improperly or consumed. It may cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and may adversely affect kidneys.
Using Sybr Safe and Ethidium Bromide to make gels poses health risks because both chemicals are mutagens.
B. Risks to the safety and health of the general"

SBa_F0001: Conflict Theory
Contents
1SBa_F0001: Conflict Theory
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The conflict theory looks for moral ends to remove this universality of one group taking power. It seeks to justify it on the grounds of ‘freedom for all’
Limitations
There are several limitations of the social conflict theory:
There is a lack of scientific research when dealing with interpersonal conflict so there may not be grounds to uphold the theory.
Incorporation of the theory in different environments is difficult. For example, it is difficult to link family dynamics to class, work and labour.
The theory is very negative. It states that humanitarian acts and civil rights movements were all acts in order to control society better, rather than to promote peace.

In this exhibition, we presented NYMU-Taipei team stories and experiences we had in the past ten years as well as arranged short talks with past-iGEM participants for advice. The panorama is the whole picture of the exhibition, and you can see how we arranged the venue.
Interview with Senior iGEMers
During the arrangement of iGEM NYMU-Taipei 10 Year Exhibition, we had interviewed with twelve senior NYMU-Taipei iGEMers, who attended iGEM from 2007-2016. Through these interviews, we observed and learned how synthetic biology had impacted the past members of NYMU-Taipei team, and how “designed thinking” affected each person’s scientific career. In addition, these seniors gave us lots of suggestions to adjust and improve our project. The feedback significantly meant iGEM experience from all NYMU-Taipei iGEMers could be passed down through the long-standing ten-year team history.
You can read here in our excerpts of five of the essence of the interviews, other interviews can refer to our team Facebook page. Furthermore, we re-made two posters, providing a visual overview of all topics of projects from the past ten years in iGEM NYMU-Taipei, and they could be viewed here as a high-resolution PDF.

Opening Ceremony
September 4th was an important date of iGEM NYMU-Taipei 10 Year Exhibition, the opening ceremony. We invited the president of National Yang-Ming University, Prof. Kung-Yee Liang, the primary PI of Team NCTU_Formosa, Wen-Liang Chen, and the members of The Investigator Taiwan, to address speeches for the exhibition. We welcomed everyone to come to the open ceremony and celebrated with us, understanding projects from the past NYMU-Taipei teams.
The news related to opening ceremony and the following exhibition was published on our school's official website, you can click here for further information. We are very grateful to National Yang-Ming University for financial support and all kinds of assistance in the whole iGEM journey.
Public Engagement
Scientific American provided us with a lot of publications on synthetic biology and genetic engineering, so that we could introduce how synthetic biology works and what iGEM is to the public and students in National Yang-Ming University. Prof. Chuan-Hsiung Chang also explained synthetic biology and iGEM to visitors on exhibition. We not only outreached genetic engineering, synthetic biology and iGEM, but recruited students in"

In addition to analyzing the connectivity of our network, we implemented network motif analysis techniques in attempt to identify topological motifs.
Topological motifs can map to functional motifs which are the subunits of genetic circuitry [ Alon, 2007 ].   We considered this correspondence and applied CytoKavosh [ Masoudi-Nejad et.al., 2012 ] to identify topological motifs that occurred significantly relative to a random graph. CytoKavosh is a visual implementation of the Kavosh motif finding algorithm [ Kashani, et.al, 2009 ] constructed on the Cytoscape platform. We report an increase in the number of topological motifs after analysis of the input circuitry.  The bi-fan network motif 1 (Kavosh motif 204) showed a 1.98 fold increase from the input circuitry to the integrated database.  In our most extreme cases, motifs 540 and 16920 (not included in the graph) had a 7.89 and 6.75 fold increase, respectively.   The cumulative increase in fold change across discussed motifs is 24.57.  Increases in the counts of selected motifs are shown below:
A display of counts of selected motifs, grouped by motif IDs generated by CytoKavosh
A comparison of CytoKavosh analyzed motifs between the input circuitry and the databases shows a clear increase in the number of known motifs.  The observed increase in network motifs validates our expectation that integrating related circuits would increase their potential.

An Overview of Alberta Regional Team Meet-ups
Tour of the Oil Sands in Fort McMurray- AUGUST 11-12, 2009
On August 10th and 11th nine members of the U of C team and 2 facilitators, along with some team members and facilitators from U of L and U of A had the opportunity to go on a tour of the Oil Sands near Fort McMurray.
Monday started off with a visit to Suncor's site.  We looked at some of the machinery and took some photos by a giant tire.  We spent the morning doing a bus tour of the site, looking at the different parts of the operation and how they work together.  We had the opportunity to drive out to a viewpoint where we got a good idea of the expansiveness of the operation.
We then drove part way into the mining site where we got a close up view of some of the trucks.  It was incredible to see just how big they are.  All of the other vehicles that travel on the site have to have special flags and lights so they can be seen.  Our tour guide used the analogy that driving one of these giant trucks is like sitting on a bed in a second floor bedroom driving the house.

With due course of              time, multiple discussions with professors gave us a clearer picture on how to find our desired                organism for future prospects.
Jabez Osborne
Professor Jabez Osborne suggested the following:
Analysis of the stressful conditions that the organism will face in the proposed environment
Suggested different protocols to find our desired organism
Emphasised on the need for using native organisms instead thereby enabling easier            acceptance to the natural environment
Also suggested the use of Macro algae
Prof. M.A. Vijayalakshmi
The Director of Molecular Interactions and Separations Technology Labs at LIM Tech. S, UTC, France
The Center for Bioseparation Technology (CBST) was created at VIT with Prof. M. A. Vijayalakshmi under the ""High priority Research Area"" funded by Department of Science and Technology (DST),              Government of India. She was identified by the Indian Government to come back from France after                more than 30 years of service at Universite de Technologie Compiegne (UTC), France, to steer this                prestigious center.
Firstly, the abundance of knowledge that she had to share with us and her loving and humble nature inspired us. With decades of experience in the field, her insights on our project was a great                 contribution to view our idea in the bigger picture.She emphasised on the fact that the environment in                 even the different oceans were going to be different and that we have to work with specific areas to be able to get the native organism that we can possibly manipulate.
Dr. Sridharan T. B.
Professor of Department of Biotechnology VIT, Vellore
He suggested the incorporation of our system in seaweeds and phytoplankton to achieve faster              growth. He also mentioned the prevalence of organisms is zone specific.
Joseph Selvin
Department of Microbiology, Pondicherry University
With respect to his work, Dr. Joseph Selvin explained his observation on the effect of temperature on                the symbionts of coral reefs. In his first year of observation, he saw a decline in the corals and its                   associated symbionts. But over the next two years of his observation, he saw the revival of the                symbionts suggesting that they were evolving according to the environmental changes. The result of                                   his work suggests that similarly it is possible that over a period of time,an evolution might occur in                  organisms native to the ocean enabling them to resist the change in"

4. The cuvette was wiped and then placed in the electroporator. *Note: For E. Coli, the electroporator should be set for 2500 V
5. The time constant was recorded (should be between 4.6 and 5.6)
6. 600 µL of SOC was added directly to the cuvette and mixed with the cells.
7. The cuvette was incubated at 37 C at various times depending on the antibiotic resistance marker:
Ampicillin – 15 min
Chloramphenicol – 30 min
Kanamycin/Streptomycin – 45 minutes
8. After the incubation period, the cells were added to the pre-made agar plate and spread using a sterilized spreader.
9. The plate was put in the 37 C oven for the cells to grow overnight.
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Purpose: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used to help amplify specific sections of DNA. These strands of DNA are then able to be analyzed and put into new cells to see how their behavior is affected. This technique is mostly used when a cell is being designed that will use genes from multiple sources. DNA is able to replicate on its own, but it takes several hours to occur. PCR is able to optimize the temperature and process that is needed for replication to happen so that instead of taking several hours in order for one copy to be made, thousands can be made in the same amount of time. Each reaction follows the same three steps; denaturation, annealing, and extension. This procedure is the suggested protocol by New England BioLabs Inc.
Procedure:
1. A bucket of ice was gathered to ensure that all materials remained cold.
2. The following components (total 50µL) were added to a PCR tube, from largest quantity to smallest:
Nuclease-free water - 37 µL
5x Phusion HF Buffer - 10 µL
10 mM dNTPs - 1 µL
10 µM Forward Primer - 0.25µL
10 µM Reverse Primer - 0.25 µL
Template DNA - 1 µL
Phusion DNA Polymerase - 0.5 µL
3. The thermocycler was programmed for the reaction using the following conditions:

In 2016, CCU_Taiwan iGEM Team was formed and determined to participate2017 iGEM competition. Since it is our very first time participating iGEM, we did not have enough experience. At this time, NYMU-iGEM Team had given us many valuable suggestions and experiences. So that we successfully formed our team, CCU_Taiwan. In addition to helping us created our own iGEM team, they also taught us how to run Fusion PCR (Figure2, 3 and 4) and the Photo-Bioreactor function through webcam.

Project Management
To organize our project as efficiently as possible was our first objective. Defining the schedule of the tasks to accomplish was necessary to elaborate efficiently our project in the shortest time span and at the best cost whilst bearing in mind the constraints imposed by the competition.
This is why we had to:
Plan: to determine the different operations to be done, the corresponding dates, and the material and human needs that have to be appointed.
Execute: by implementing the different operations defined in the planned phase.
Control: by carrying out a comparison between dates and accomplishments on the level of planning and execution.
In order to do this, each manager has warranted and controlled the coordination of the actors and tasks in a concern of efficiency and yield according to the time limits, thanks to the elaboration of Gantt plannings (that you can find below).
Planning of experiments:
You can find here the notebook that we filled with our experimentations and other events!

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"For our iGEM project, the private sector is committed both morally and financially, in helping us to develop a genetically engineered bacteria to try to clean up the tailings ponds. It is also very evident, that the government will play a major role in the development and acceptance of any course of action that may come out of our project. One lesson that can be learned from the history of antibiotic development and societal integration, is that it is imperative to be diligent not to misuse any synthetic organism.  At this time, most synthetic biology projects have not been overused, strictly because of how new this field is.  Nevertheless, as time progresses and new discoveries are made, researchers should always be thinking of ways to prevent the misuse and overuse of their experiments, regardless of their original intentions.

Internet
The Internet initially began in the 1960s to allow for a globally, interconnected set of computers, that could provide quick and easy access to various data and programs for users (1).  By the 1980s, progress in the development of the Internet included networks that revolutionized the world of computers and communication by bringing about the invention of the World Wide Web by European scientists (1).  Currently in 2010, the Web has become a crucial part of everyday life, and almost necessary for successful social interaction.  Who would have thought that a scientific innovation spearheaded by numerous MIT researchers, would evolve into the sophisticated system it is today, that allows anyone access to every type of multimedia?
Like many scientific discoveries, the Internet and the World Wide Web has led to many ethical dilemmas.  Rather unforeseeable at first, was the profound impact the Internet and the World Wide Web would have on the social aspect of people’s lives.  The advent of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and even the prevalence of e-mail accounts, changed how people communicate and interact, and therefore had a major impact on their relations (2).  The effect of time spent on the Internet and World Wide Web has only recently been extensively studied, and has been shown to not only reduce the frequency of social activities but also productivity at work (2).  Although providing a brand-new market for advertisers, these scientific advancements have also altered the manner in which the News is reported, by decreasing the popularity of historical forms of media such as newspapers, radio, and"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to pur"

Algorithm
Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program."

We are able to say that, although we had prepared the first set of questions to discuss in the event, the public played a key role on the debate moving the flow of the discussions towards the areas they thought were most interesting. Because of this, we were not able to discuss the questions we thought were worth raising, but we also received input from the audience on the aspects the public really considers as important.
The panel and the public event was very successful, with people from different backgrounds and opinions attending. After the event, people from the audience said they had been thinking and discussing the different aspects of GMOs even days after the debate. We were pleased by this statement as it confirmed that we had achieved our goal: to raise awareness and opinions towards GMOs and to open up a new discussion on this subject. It was therefore important that we made sure the discussion was set up as objectively as possible, in order not to provide any bias on the issue.
KIDS HACK DAY
Kids hack day is a non profit organization in Stockholm based on the idea to engage kids to do something good with technology and to raise curiosity in the future of technology. In a playful way kids learn how to program or build technological things and all that while having fun.
Kids Hack Day has previously been aimed towards programming and robotics, so they were delighted that we for the first time could host a biology station. We participated with a station to show kids how it could look like to work in a lab, how interesting the small things in life are. Together with them we extracted DNA from a banana, grew bacteria and learned how to pipette. After successfully extracting the DNA, a young boy said: “After doing this experiment, it feels like I can do anything!”.
GATHER FESTIVAL
Before Science and Art split, Artists like Leonardo da Vinci where both Scientists and Artists. We believe that in an innovation hungry world it gets more and more important that Art and Science fuse and collaborate again. Within our Stockholm Team history we had great experiences the last two years in collaborating with different backgrounds, working together from day one on.
Within the innovation, design and art festival “Gather festival” we hosted an open Box talk about the future of us, humans. Together with Artists and Designers we wanted to talk about ethical questions in how far we should go in modifying our DNA. But also more specific about medication and the future possibilities of being immortal.  Raising the interest of artists to be involved in science, to inspire and spark discussions in biotechnology.

Protein Expression and Purification
The gene for Hfq (plus His tag) was inserted into the suffix region of BBa_K314103, a lac inducible expression cassette constructed by Washington iGEM 2010, and the entire construct was simultaneously inserted into the pSB1K3.m1 plasmid backbone using the Anza enzyme system protocol. See agarose gel below for confirmation of construct.
The resulting plasmid was purified and transformed into Rosetta 2 pLySs cells and grown in LB broth with a 30μg/mL concentration of kanamycin. Initially, 3mL of a 10mL starter culture was used to expand to a 300mL culture, which was grown until OD600 = 0.82 before being induced with 0.8mM IPTG. Cells were taken at t = 0h, 1h, 2h, 12h, 14h, and 18h, before being harvested after 18h. Protein expression levels over time are shown below in an SDS-PAGE gel below; protein expression levels appear to be highest at 18h (see SDS-PAGE gel below). Hfq was purified using a Ni-NTA column, and the resulting concentration in fraction 1 totaled 0.31mg/mL.
Fluorescence Polarization
Fresh, pure Hfq was subsequently used in a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to assess protein binding to sRNA-mRNA duplexes. Plates were read in the Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader with default FP settings and gain adjusted to 25, with each concentration of protein repeated in triplicate on two separate plates. Our FP assay results suggest that Hfq does not bind to the sRNA binding region we synthesized based on results from the literature, and therefore does not effect sRNA-mRNA hybridization in Staphylococcus aureus. Protein concentration was then increased 100 fold and tested with only the AUAUAUA oligo reported in the literature to bind strongly to Hfq, with no significant difference between wells without protein. Wells containing only sRNA compared to wells containing both sRNA and mRNA successfully showed that the RNA was hybridizing; therefore, we concluded that s"

Integrases
The design of our XOR gates was based on integrase logic [9] . This means, depending on the input molecules, integrases can be expressed, subsequently switch a terminator sequence previously blocking gene expression, and then the output gene can be transcribed. This approach is explained here .
In order to characterize the integrase system described above, we first combined the pLux promoter (BBa_R0062) with one of our integrase genes bxb1, followed directly by a red fluorescent protein (RFP, mCherry) to make the expression accessible. Also, this system includes an XOR buffer gate per default blocking transcription of sfGFP. Upon BXB1 activity and switching the gate into ON-state, the terminator should have been removed and sfGFP should have been expressed. We intially designed three different constructs for characterization of the recombinases and their cross-activity. However, the measurement of fluorescent proteins, with both a plate reader and a flow cytometer , did not indicate sfGFP expression due to recombinase activity. Nevertheless, RFP was clearly detectable upon induction in plate reader experiments suggesting that the induction itself worked (see figure 5 and 6).
Figure 5 Expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) 250 min after induction with various concentrations of 3OC6-HSL (10-13 M to 10-4 M). RFP is under the control of the pLux promoter (BBa_R0062) together with the integrase BXB1. Upon expression of BXB1 a buffer gate should have been swtiched to ON-state producing GFP. Data points are mean values of triplicate measurements in 96-well microtiter plates ± standard deviation"
TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," limitations of the model that arise from our assumptions. We assume that fish and human lens contain similar crystallin proteins that are degraded in the similar manner. In addition, we made a rough adjustment of data based our diluting procedure. For better results to create a human cataract model, experiments will need to be done on human lens, even better if done in vitro, without any dilutions.
Significance of Model
With the results of this experiment, we create Table 1, which equates each LOCS value with the equivalent absorbance.When we experiment with the cataract lens model, we measure the absorbance. However, the absorbance values are meaningless to physicians and patients. This model allows them to translate absorbance into LOCS, which tells them exactly whether they need surgery, or into crystallin damage, which tells them how much GSR they need.
Model 2: GSR Pathway
Now that we know how much we need to limit crystallin damage to LOCS 2.5, we model the naturally occurring GSR Pathway in the lens of a human eye. We calculate the necessary GSR concentration to be maintained over 50 years so that the resulting cataract is below LOCS 2.5.
Chemical Kinetics Model: Differential Equations
By various enzyme kinetics laws, fully documented in the collapsible, we build a system of 10 differential equations based on 6 chemical reactions (Ault 1974, Pi 2004). All parameters, constants (Table B), and initial conditions (Table C) are based off literature data (Ng 2007, Melissa 2012, Saravanakumar 2015, Salvador 2005, Adimora 2010, Jones 2008, Martinovich 2005).

Our modeling approach is seen in Figure 4.2, where vary the input, Initial GSR concentration, holding all other variables constant, and numerically solve for the amount of hydrogen peroxide over time. We can find the amount of crystallin damage accumulated over 50 years if different levels of GSR is maintained, which we graph in Figure 4.3.
From this graph, we can find the GSR concentration needed for the LOCS 2.5 threshold.

We presented our progress so far as the phage group.  Two of the main questions that arose was how we are going to know if we have ghost capsids and how we are going to know if they are viable.  We need to research this so that we know how to test for this.
AC 04/15
We presented our project today. There were a few things that we needed to do better. For one, we need to present better background and show how it ties into our research, specifically the need for a capsid library. I feel like we could have been a bit more engaging and better rehearsed as well.
We will need to find a way to test the capsids for viability, and somehow characterize them.

We prepared a document with a step-by-step plan of what our goals were for the rest of the semester.  We also read through the purification procedure that we will be doing Monday to ensure that we understand everything and have all the materials.
AB 5/1/2013 Today we are going to create a plan to follow throughout the semester. We also talked with Jordan about reagents for performing phage purification on Monday. We also reviewed the methods for our procedure.
-Plan to make an excel sheet that will calculate the needed volumes of reagents for the volume of lysate used.
-Plan how many days it will take to complete the procedure - plan in breaks and time Questions to ask Dr. Grose - what is less expensive/better - Freeze thaw or use lithium chloride
Answer: Try both
-Best method for determining phage purification
-Step 3 on 3.3.1.1
-CsCl gradient - we may need someone with experience to help
-should we plan on using CsCl? Or just plan on PEG? (time to set up gradient)

Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Asymmetrically Digestible Reporter (BBa_K880001) Data:
To test the hypothesis that the IRL and IRR orientations were the determinative factor to the inversion negative results observed, we created a second asymmetrical reporter (K880001).  K880001 was engineered such that the IRL is situated on the right of the inverted region and the IRR is situated on the left.  This IRL/IRR orientation restores the orientation as found in the natural fimS region (Gally et al., 1996) and a previously engineered recombinase systems (Ham et al., 2006 ).
The new asymmetrical digest reporter (K880001) in the vector pSB3C5 was co-transformed in 10-beta E. coli (NEB) with strong, constitutively expressed FimE (K880005-K137007) in the vector pSB1A2.  Co-transformants colonies were analyzed for inversion using the asymmetrical digest assay [2] .  The asymmetrical digest reporter and fimE (700bp band Fig7, Lanes 2-4) are both present within the co-transformants.  The asymmetrical digest reporter was observed in a partially flipped state exhibiting both the 353bp band as well as the 255/238bp bands (Fig 7, Lane 2-4).  It has been noted that fim inversions induced by FimE in a previously engineered recombinase systems exhibited low efficiency resulting in a mixed population of flipped and unflipped inversion regions (Ham et al., 2008).
To further characterize the new asymmetrical digest reporter (K880001) in the vector pSB3C5 was transformed into E. coli DH5α, a strain with endogenous FimE.  In accordance with the co-transformation experiment, the asymmetrical digest reporter was observed in a partially flipped state (Fig 8, Lane 2).
10-beta E. coli with FimE.  Lane 1 is a 100bp Ladder (NEB), lane 2-4 are K880001 co-transformed with FimE showing a mixed state indicated the presence the uninverted K880001 yields a 357bp band, while inversion induced by FimE is expected to result in a 255/238bp band.

Next steps
Three colonies were selected from each device (1-1, 1-2, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and 3-1,3-2,3-3), excluding one colony based on purity of the band and potential for differential insert via non-specific binding.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html,"ra solid medium and PCR experiments, we obtained the required strains called PVUVC. Second, we integrated the second device part into this chromosome through homologous recombination, allowing the yEmRFP gene to replace the Ura3 gene. The 5-FOA solid medium and PCR experiments were used to screen correct colony PVRVC. The insertion of the last fragment refers to the previous method. This process is graphically displayed on the above figure.
To achieve mating, another mating type of wild haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 was used for modification. By digestion and ligation, we construct vika gene on plasmid pRS416 which contains a selective marker Ura3, and plasmid pRS413 which contains a selective marker His. Then we introduced those two different plasmids into BY4742 respectively.
Results of Characterization of Mating Switcher
1) Proof of Existence of Device Parts
We built three device parts in total. They were integrated into the chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by transformation. We used colony PCR to proof the existence of these three parts in our strain. The result is showed as below.
Fig 2-2. Microscope image of yeast cultured with SC-Leu with no yEmRFP gene transformed.
The PCR’s results confirmed that the target genes were ligated into chromosome correctly.
2) Verification of RFP in the colonies
The main characterization method of verification of RFP in the TVRVC applied by us is observing the expression of red fluorescent protein under the fluorescence microscope. By this way, it will be much more intuitive so that we can directly get the results. We took pictures under different visions and the results are as follows.The experiments of PVRVC regulation system use this assay method.
Fig 2-3. Microscope image of yeast cultured with SC-Leu with yEmRFP gene transformed.
Fig 2-3. Microscope image of yeast cultured with SC-Leu with yEmRFP gene transformed.
From these images we can clearly see the expression of yEmRFP. These images undoubtedly verify the yEmRFP gene has been transformed succeessfully.
3) Result of Mating

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html," attempted PstI mutagenesis of CAR ws run on a gel. Unfortunately, amplification was unsuccessful, but we had an idea for why this might have occurred. It was discovered that our plasmid of 9kb would need a 7.5 minute extention time, rather than the 1 minute extention time that we had originally programmed into the thermocycler. The mutagenesis experiment was repeated, this time with a 7.5 minute extention time. When these results were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, we had bands appearing to indicate success with the 50ng samples of CAR that we had run, as shown below.
This gel shows 2 bands of CAR that indicate successful mutagenesis of the first PstI site in CAR. The CAR gene is contained in the PET vector. Lane 1 contains the 1 kb plus ladder, while lanes 2,3 contained samples in which 5ng of original CAR+PET plasmid were used, lanes 4,5 contained samples in which 20ng of original plasmid were used, and lanes 6,7 contained 50ng of plasmid sample and underwent mutagenesis by PCR amplification successfully. The bands are slightly over the 9kb band of the ladder, at about 10kb, which is roughly the size of the 10,090bp plasmid.
After combining these two PCR tubes and incubating with DpnI, we performed a transformation with this DNA and allowed the plate to incubate overnight. Also, we continued to try and verify NPT, but were once again unsuccessful. When we viewed the plate that we had transformed the following day, it was found that we did not have any colonies. We presumed this was because the 9kb plasmid was very difficult to uptake with its large size. Several more transformations were attempted. We also attempted a new procedure called site-directed mutagenesis, which would use a single mutagenesis primer per site, rather than one for each strand, and supposedly had the capacity to mutagenize multiple illegal cut sites at once. We would try to mutate 3 sites with this protocol: the 2 PstI sites, and 1 EcorI site. The PCR was run overnight, with eight different samples, at two different concentrations of DNA (50ng and 80ng), with four different annealing temperatures. The following day, each sample was incubated with DpnI for 6 hours, and then each was tranformed on a kan plate. A restriction digest of the NPT pl"

We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

Estimate the volume of the DNA solution.
Adjust the concentration of monovalent cations either by dilution with TE (pH 8.0) if the DNA solution contains a high concentration of salts of by addition of one of the salt solutions shown in Table A8-1. (If the volume of the final solution is 400 µl or less, carry out precipitation in a single microcentrifuge tube. Larger volumes can be divided among several microfuge tubes, or the DNA can be precipitated and centrifuged in tubes that will fit in a medium-speed centrifuge or ultracentrifuge.)
Mix the solution well. Add exactly 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and again mix the solution well. Store the ethanolic solution on ice to allow the precipitate of DNA to form. (Usually 15-30 minutes is sufficient, but when the size of the DNA is small (<100 nucleotides) or hen it is present in small amounts (<0.1 µg/ml), extend the period of storage to at least 1 hour and add MgCl2 to a final concentration of 0.01 M. DNA can be stored indefinitely in ethanolic solutions at 0ºC or at -20ºC.)
Recover the DNA by centrifugation at 0ºC. (For most purposes, centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 minutes in a microfuge is sufficient. However, as discussed above, when low concentrations of DNA (<20 ng/ml) or very small fragments are being processed, more extensive centrifugation may be required.)
Carefully remove the supernatant with an automatic micropipettor or with a disposable pipette tip attached to a vacuum line. Take care not to disturb the pellet of nucleic acid (which may be invisible). Use the pipette tip to remove any drops of fluid that adhere to the walls of the tube. (It is best to save the supernatant from valuable DNA samples until recovery of the precipitated DNA has been verified.)
Fill the tube halfway with 70% ethanol and recentrifuge at maximum speed for 2 minutes at 4ºC in a microfuge.

The 1ml volume was used to have a layer of medium enough thin to perform an uniform irradiation.
Tests with difference distances from the lamp (3 and 4 cm) with different exposition times (1, 10 and 15 s) were done. Minimum distance and maximum time were fixed to avoid lethal UV dose and mutagenesis.
After induction by UV the samples were kept for 2 hours in dark by silver paper to increase the RecA and LexA response.  The OD was measured and the sample transferred in a 1ml tube, spinned at 6000-8000rpm for three minutes, the supernatant was harvested and the pellet resuspended. Slides were prepared for the fluorescence bacteria image acquisition that were elaborated with the Visual Fluo Bacteria Software .
OD was not altered by UV irradiation but we didn't observe GFP. Probably we were not able to find the right time/distance setting. Moreover we are not sure that an uniform irradiation  takes place.

Hydrogen Peroxide Induction
Since we have not success with UV induction, we tested the correct functionality of K079049 and K079050 constructs by using  hydrogen peroxide induction. It is well known [Assad et al. 2004] that hydrogen peroxide is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reaction of hydrogen peroxide with transition metals imposes on cells an oxidative stress that can result in damage to cell components such as proteins, lipids and principally DNA. In E.coli low concentration of H2O2 (1-3mM) results in SOS gene induction [Imlay and Linn, 1987; Goerlich et alt. 1989].

Figure 4
Leucine and Biomass production with maximal production rate. Click to enlarge
In generally it follows from the analysis that the more AHL or leucine is produced the smaller the        biomass output becomes. It also shows that cell A can not operate at the maximum production rate, because the growth rate would then be so slow that cell B would overgrow it. This is something to keep in mind when we choose our promoters for the system. If our promoters are too strong, the growth rate of cell A will be too low and cell B will be able to overgrow cell A.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"Blocks”. During the Westminster UK iGEM meetup Edinburgh talked about the issue of mutated DNA going relatively undetected. Their method at the time involved adding up the value of each base and storing this as a “Checksum” at the end of the BabbleBlock. Edinburgh’s team highlighted in their presentation that they knew this would lead to a large amount of false positives as many different combinations of information could add to the same Checksum. My research looks in to the method of the Checksum and attempts to create a new method that has a smaller chance of false positives.
Storing information on DNA offers many advantages over current methods, however mutations     need to be carefully monitored to ensure incorrect data is not read as a false positive.     Currently for information stored on a BabbleBrick a ‘CheckSum’ is calculated by taking the     sum of the values on each base of DNA. If the checksum of a BabbleBlock has changed between     the time of writing and reading, the data is considered to be corrupt.
$C = \sum^{bp}_{n=1} bp_n$
$C$: Frequency of checksum
$n$: The integer address of base pair
$bp$: Amount of base pairs (5 times the number of BabbleBricks)
$bp_n$: The value of the $n^{th}$ base pair
Fig. 1. The frequency of all checksums in a babbleBlock system containing two BabbleBricks.
Fig. 2. The frequency of all checksums in a babbleBlock system containing three BabbleBricks.
Currently a checksum utilizes only a small percentage of the values that can be stored.     A BabbleBrick contains 5 base 4 digits meaning that 4$^{\text{5}B}$ unique bits of     information share one of 15$B$ checksums where $B$ is the amount of BabbleBricks in one     BabbleBlock. This data has been plotted for BabbleBlocks containing 2 and 3 BabbleBricks     in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. Assuming that between the time of writing and reading     any number of mutations can occur, the maximum probability of a mutation event resulting     in the same checksum can be calculated by comparing the frequency of one checksum to the     total frequency of unique bits of information.
$P_C = \big(\frac{C_{max}}{F}) \approx \big(\frac{1.2 \times 10^5}{4^{10}}) = 11$% in a 2 BabbleBrick system

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Game is an excellent learning platform. Once involved, the profound theory and knowledge beneath the game will be absorbed subconsciously. An interesting game will stimulate the players’ imagination, rise their interests in related topics. Imagine a boy coming across an amazing sic-fic game, the scene of space battle and high-tech shuttles will stay in his mind for weeks, just like seeding a future of science, technology, universe or even literature. We believe that, spreading the interest in medic and science with joy is more efficient than merely spreading knowledge, so why not use game as a platform to spread our passions? To spread the idea of our project, we created a novel board game, Cell War. The game is based on solid medical and biological knowledge, so playing indeed is learning.Various fantasy and sic-fic elements are incorporated to attain joyful game experiences. After half a year’s exploring, we even designed several versions of Cell War for varying players, and the one version we bring to you is a delicate multiplayer board game, friendly for both veterans and green hands. The game has become a symbol of our human practice project as well as our team, representing the creative spirits of iGEMers. Here, we invite you to join our journey with Cell War.
Origin
Initially we thought about making tour speeches around Shanghai to help people learn more about immunotherapy, cell engineering and cancer related information. But teaching by speaking is really not a choice satisfying enough for us. We want people to explore the knowledge of cancer immunotherapy in a friendly way. We want to engage the public. And we want to inspire the future. After several times of intensive group meeting and brainstorming, a bold but impressive idea was brought up: To design a game.
At the outset, the game was crude. We simply copied rules from some of the most famous board games. It was much easier than developing a brand new one, but it existed big problems: borrowed forms are rarely incongruous with our contents and ideas. We tried to invent some rules ourselves, but none of us were familiar with board games. We also considered making online games once, but for us students major in medic and"

Landmine Module
An important part of our iGEM project is a promoter sensitive to DNT/TNT, first described by Yagur-Kroll et al. [1]. We will use two of the promoters described in this paper, ybiJ and ybiFB2A1, in our project, see the landmine detection module . Of these promoters, not much is known other than the fact that they have a DNT/TNT-dependent response curve (see figure 1). Our goal was to find a model which would be able to reproduce the response curves of both promoters.

Preliminary Approaches
Negative transcriptional cascade
Based on the work of Hooshangi S et al 2005 [ 4 ] and the project requirements, the following scheme was proposed.
Figure 4. Genes 1 and 3 are present in the cell and they are produced all the time (black). Genes 2 and 4 (green) are in the self destructive plasmid (SDP).
Protein 1 starts the circuit, activating (or repressing the repressor of) the promoter of gene 2, for proof of concept gene 1 can be changed for a signal molecule. The concentration of protein 2 will increase and achieve the threshold concentration to repress gene 3. At this point the production of protein 3 stops. As the concentration of protein 3 decreases due to its degradation, the repression of gene 4 will not longer exist and the production of protein 4 (restriction enzyme or fluorescent protein) starts. In order to make a longer or shorter delay, the protein production and degradation rates have to be considered. For the former, we can “play” with the ribosome binding site (RBS) and promoter strength. The degradation can be controlled by protein stability, induction of degradation and up-down regulation of degradation enzymes.
Positive transcriptional cascade
Based on the book of Uri Alone [ 5 ] and the project requirements, the next scheme was proposed.
Figure 5. Genes 1 and 3 are present in the cell and they are produced all the time (black). Genes 2 and 4 (green) are in the self destructive plasmid (SDP).
Protein 1 starts the circuit, activating the promoter of gene 2, for the proof of concept gene 1 can be changed to a signal molecule. The concentration of protein 2 will increase and achieve the threshold concentration to induce gene 3. As the concentration of protein 3 increases, the induction of gene 4 (restriction"

How the world affects our Sirens
Background
As a kind of plant pathogen, plant parasitic nematodes are widespread and can result in a wide distribution with their numerous hosts. They can result in severe plant diseases. It causes around 100 billion dollars economic loss each year, which accounts for 10% of the total agricultural loss [1] . The nematodes attack is relatively severe in China at present, harming the agriculture and forestry in a considerable extent. Taking Bursaphelenchus xylophilus for example, there are 187 infected areas of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in China announced by China’s Academy of Forestry which is widely spread in 16 provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian(3rd announcement of China’s State Forestry Administration in 2015). Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the head of forestry pest being listed, is often referred to as the “forest fire without smoke” for its grave damage to the pinewood in the infected area, and it badly threatens the forestry economy, landscape and famous scenery, nature reserve and important ecotope of China [2-3] . What’s more, other plant parasitic nematodes such as Meloidogyne spp. and Heterodera spp. also do great harm to agriculture and forestry.
Fig. 1 Pine wood nematode disease distribution in China (2014)
We still give priority to traditional chemical method for nematode prevention in China. The most widely used nematocides are isofenphos-methyl, carbofuran, cadusafos and niklor [4-5] . However, the present category of nematicides is too limited to choose from.  On one hand，development of nematicides for various reasons is disabled or stopped; on the other hand, many of the existing ones also face the problems of high cost, undesirable prevention effect, severe environment pollution and allowing nemat"

Food intolerance, unlike food allergy, can have                     a number of different causes. Food allergy and food intolerance are both a type of food                     hypersensitivity and are commonly mistaken with each other, but there are some important                     differences. Food intolerance is not mediated by IgE antibodies in the immune system. Hence the much                     slower the onset of symptoms, which can be delayed for hours. The symptoms of food intolerance                     varies but the general symptoms include fatigue, joint pains, dark circles under the eyes, night                     sweats, diarrhea, vomiting, bloating and irritable bowel and some cases skin symptoms such as rashes                     and eczema. These symptoms may last for several hours, even days. The food allergy response,                     mediated by the immune system, is much more rapid and can be triggered by very small amounts of                     food. Those with food intolerance can tolerate a reasonable, not unlimited, amounts of the food.2
*Participants were students or employees at Linköping University (54 %), Örebro University (23 %),                     Karlstad University (6 %), Luleå University of Technology (5 %), Swedish University of Agricultural                     Sciences (5 %) or Chalmers University of Technology (2 %). A few participants were from the                     University of Gothenburg, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Linnaeus University, Lund University,                     Stockholm University, Umeå University and Uppsala University. These participants were also included                     in the study, corresponding to a university answering ratio less than 1 % each.

BioBrick construction
As required, we submit our PIV-leaky-Marciano cloned in pSB1C3 plasmid. This high copy number plasmid backbone is carrying a chloramphenicol resistance gene and can easily be sequenced by the iGEM labs.
We received it in the iGEM kit, linearized. As we tried to amplify it in E. coli TOP 10 culture we had the pleasure to visualize the expression of the monomeric Red Fluorescence Protein 1 which is replaceable by our Part.
Once our part in inserted between the two restriction sites, colonies recover a “normal” colour.
The figure below represents both maps of the pSB1C3 plasmid without and with our Part, the pIV-leaky-Marciano:
Here is the simplified protocol that we used before sending our Part:
Amplifying pSB1C3
Electroporation of pSB1C3 in E.coli TOP10
Isolation of the pSB1C3 plasmid
Restriction
Electrophoresis gel
Cloning the PIV-Leaky-Marciano Part in pSB1C3
Restriction of the pSB1C3 plasmid
PCR of the PIV leaky sequence
Digestion of the PCR product
Purifying and restriction of the PCR product and the pSB1C3
Insertion/Ligation
How is the part is expected to work ?
This BioBrick is expected to work under a variety of promoters such as pPro 30. This Part will provide you a way of secreting aspecific small peptides from the periplasm to the extracellular media.
This has been done before by UCL labs using cyclic peptides. To get more information about what you could do with this part, please check the following article.
