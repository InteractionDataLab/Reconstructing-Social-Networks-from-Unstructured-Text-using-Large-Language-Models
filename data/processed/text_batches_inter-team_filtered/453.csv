Figure Different sample gel preparation conditions. 12% SDS PAGE of dxCas9 (expected size 158.3kDa)  Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 95 deg C 60min, lane 3 95 deg C 30min, lane 4 95 deg C 15min, lane 5 95 deg C 5min, lane 75 deg C 7min, lane 7 No boiling, lane 8 molecular ladder (kDa).
On the 6% tris-glycine SDS PAGE a single band for dxCas9 was observed for all conditions, suggesting that the double band might be some artifact of the 12% SDS PAGE. To further confirm these results, both bands from the 12% gel were excised and sent for mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands were full length dxCas9 with both the N and C terminal intact. This concluded that there was not any protease digestion and that the results are potentially due to a gel artifact. As a result, the purification will continue.

The numbers (1,3,4,5 etc.) describe the plasmids of different bacterial colonies. Additionally, a DNA ladder (100 - 10000 bp; Fermentas DNA Ladder Mix) is added into the gel for the validation of the DNA product length. The resulting NFAT insert should be 134 bp long and NFkB 179 bp. NFAT #2 and NFAT #5 seem to be successfully ligated plasmids, because there are small bands at ~ 150 bp. The lanes of NFkB #4 and NFkB #5 show a p31 plasmid band, which is 4919 bp long. But the NFkB inserts could not be recognized. Nevertheless, we will try to sequence them. All other lanes display definetly the wrong products.

Entrepreneurship
Introduction
Since the beginning of the competition, we designed our project from an entrepreneurial perspective. We wanted to go beyond the iGEM competition so that our project could have a real impact on health and the environment. To this end, we have taken many steps to assess the need of the public, quantify the demand for our device, and prove the usefulness of the services we would offer.
We conducted surveys and had several meetings with professionals to better answer these questions. We also took part in Medicen Summer School on Business Creation in Life Science and organized roundtables about “Entrepreneurship in Biotechnologies” during our meetup, to improve our entrepreneurship skills, and be able to better understand our market. After demonstrating there was a real need for our tool and a potential demand from experts in the field, we built an innovative functional air purifier. To ensure that our device was fully functional, we designed an app' that allows the customer to manage the filters recycling process.
From the beginning, we were also keen on taking advantage of our multidisciplinary skills. Not only did we focus on the biological aspect, but we also seeked to develop other essential aspects of the project to start a business. We were fully aware of the importance of protecting intellectual property when initiating a business. We benefited from the expertise of Azéline and Maud, two team members studying intellectual property law, who gave us valuable advice throughout the project.
Finally, our project could not have been done without the great support of our sponsors and our partners to whom we pitched ideas and presented our project. They helped us a great deal while achieving our goals.
The Team
Our team is made up of 15 passionate and hardworking students in their last year of master’s program, coming from parisian universities and Grandes Ecoles. We are a multidisciplinary team composed of biologists (UPMC and Diderot Paris 7), chemists (Chimie ParisTech), engineers (CentraleSupélec, Ecole Polytechnique, ESPCI), jurists (Paris Saclay University) and industrial designers (ENSCI-Les Ateliers). This multidisc"

Unfortunately, they weren’t able to get in touch with the researchers to obtain the genetic constructs they needed to produce the dye. Since there was no money available for gene synthesis, the project ground to a halt. Since the main goal of our mentorship was to give the students hands-on experience with actual biotech labwork, we decided to carry on and do all the planned protocols but using standard parts instead of the ones that were not available.
During May and June we taught the group all the basic laboratory procedures: how to properly use a micro-pipette, how to prepare media, how to autoclave, how to clean a biosafety cabinet, how to prepare agar plates and how to streak them. After that, we led them through a mini-prep, digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, gel recovery, ligation, preparing chemo-competent bacteria, chemical transformation, recovery and selection in antibiotic plates.
All the students had a wonderful time and were very grateful since they practically experienced the whole college-level Genetic Engineering Lab (save for PCR) in the course of a few weeks. Three of the 6th semester students chose to enroll in Biotech Engineering this August, and one of them even integrated to our college team during the summer.
The faculty from PEGS was pleased with the results and wants the school to continue participating in iGEM HS. They approached us and we gladly offered our help to coordinate the team again. With the help of SyBRE, the student group we founded, the iGEM HS Team will be better organized and will be able to tackle more ambitious projects. Also, we’ll try to get at least another one of ITESM’s high schools involved. With the experience gathered from this first hurried try, we are certain that the next team (or, hopefully, teams) will have a more distinguished role in the competition.

A University of Dundee BSc Microbiology 2012 Graduate, he worked as a chef for a year and a half after graduation. Birkbeck, University of London gave Sean the opportunity to study the subject that he loves and work at the same time. He was able to complete his MRes due to the flexibility of Birkbeck. Without an institution such as Birkbeck offering the flexibility in study, he would not have been able to obtain a research based post-graduate qualification.  Being a part of the iGEM team means a lot to Sean & he hopes to give back to the great institute that provided him with the opportunity to pursue a career in academic science.
When Sean is not looking at Biosynthetic pathways or dreaming up scientific ideas for the good of mankind sean enjoys playing & watching football. He also has a keen interest in nature. He has the pace to keep up with Elliott on the eating"

For the older kids, we organized same games and we also played a card game where they had to connect a bacterium to a disease, or to a product that came from it. The card game also included parasites, fungi and viruses. We also tried to introduce them to synthetic biology, demonstrating to them how to modify bacteria.

In October, we participated in La Fête de la Science (literally the Science Party) in the University of Evry. La Fête de la Science is a french event of two weeks organised on the whole french territory. For this occasion, we spent two days with kids from 5 years old to teenagers of 16 years old, making scientific experiments with them using everyday products. We taught kids how to make an homemade pH indicator with red cabbage and how to extract DNA from fruits with the products present in their kitchen. Of course, we adapted the experiments according to the age of the kids and we encouraged them to reach scientific conclusions by themselves.

OUR INTERVENTION FOR A FAMILY AUDIENCE
In May, we participated in the Rond point des Sciences (literally the Sciences Roundabout) organised by Genopole in the shopping center of Evry.
During this intervention we presented our project in five minutes. Even if trying to attract the shoppers enough to pause their shopping was difficult, our presentation was nonetheless very successful. Several young adults came to see us at the end of our three presentations, sometimes with kids, to speak with us and to ask us for more details, even if our project was very difficult to understand for the uninitiated public.

As we didn’t very satisfying results from our functional assays, we checked everything about our experiments. Then we noticed that even one amino acid change in a protein can cause a difference in protein activity. We noticed that His-tag was added into the proteins when we cloned the genes into pET45-b. Hence we cloned these genes into our own design PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, in order to produce required proteins without any addition. For this cloning, we removed the gene sequences from PSB1C3-HNS, PSB1C3-HNS-T108I, PSB1C3-PotB59/PomA plasmids with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with BamHI and SalI enzymes.(XhoI and SalI enzymes occurs a scar when their cuts ligate)We transformed ligated products into BL21 bacteria strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with Verify Forward and verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be at 503 bp line, but if colony PCR worked, then bands are expected to be at 906 bp line for HNS and HNS-T108I, 2204 bp line for PotB59/PomA.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check in order to learn if the cloning was correct. For cut"

The BLAST analysis also revealed a predicted PucR C-terminal helix-turn-helix domain (HTH-30) at the C-terminal end (Figure 2).
It is often found in PucR-like transcriptional regulators. This HTH-30 domain is likely to be where EtnR1 binds to DNA.

Figure 2. Snapshot of BLAST results, showing putative HTH-30 domain at the C-terminal end of EtnR1.
EtnR1: PsiPred – Secondary structure prediction
The UCL Bioinformatics PsiPred tool was used to predict the secondary structure of EtnR1 based on its amino acid sequence (Figure 3). Importantly, the four helices at the C-terminus show high confidence of prediction, and thus is very likely that the putative HTH-30 domain is present. Many of the other areas of secondary structure also show high levels of confidence.

EtnR1: SwissModel Homology Modelling
The SWISS-MODEL server [1-4] is an automated service that selects the best matching template to a submitted amino acid sequence, performs the alignment and builds a 3D model. The most important limiting factor of the quality of the model is generally the matching of the query sequence with an appropriate template. SwissProt threaded amino acids 1 to 313 of EtnR1 onto a selected template protein: phosphodiesterase 5A GAF domain . It is a regulatory domain of the human PDE5. Notably, GAF domains are commonly found at the N-terminus in CdaR family transcription"

We have built an iGEM ecosphere, which includes universities, experts, iGEMers and teenagers. To achieve our iGEM ecosphere, we went to several schools first. We exchanged little handmade plant printing bags with pupils, made micro landscapes of domestic waste with middle school students, and held a brainstorming about synthetic biology in middle school. We guided young people to understand synthetic biology, so that they would become the industry's reserve talent. Meanwhile, we organized an exhibition with Southwest Union and mobilized college students to help us dig up soil samples. Even more, we helped SiCAU build their team. Under our influence, more and more students have joined iGEM. We communicated with many professionals who are in our ecosphere. They referred to a common problem, laboratory safety, which lacks a uniform safety standard in basic biology labs in China. So we made China's first iGEM laboratory safety video and comics. We hope the ecosphere can develop with a medium. Even if the competition is over, it will continue to output influence, and continue to promote synthetic biology. So we designed an easy-to-understand turn-based board game based on synthetic biology, Gene Card. It becomes popular in China during a short time and turn it into a lot of people's biological enlightenment game teaching aid.
Gene Card
☁ Brief introduction
Gene Card is a card game based on synthetic biology and genetic engineering. The game is a turn-based game. Through the game between players, the first to get six different base cards will win the game. The cards are divided into two categories: the base cards and the function cards. The base cards contain several elements which are necessary for the genetic engineering experiment. The function cards are designed as the interaction mechanism according to simple biological knowledge. Rules of the game are easy to understand. Gene Card aims at promoting synthetic biology among primary and secondary school students and non-biology-major students. We have launched our campaign"

Figure 7. The principle of super protein chip
Based on Double Antibody Sandwich Method, we built a biosensor system which is suitable for the measurement of a wide range of biomarkers. Though the specific binding of antigen (tumor marker) and their polyclonal antibody, we can use the fluorescence microscope to detect the signal and analyze so as to get the test results, then, we can judge the type of tumor.
Figure 8. Double Antibody Sandwich Method
Our project fully takes advantage of the high-throughput of the protein microarray, the high-specificity of the Double Antibody Sandwich Method [6], the hypersensitivity of the fluorescence labeling, in order to detect tumor markers rapidly and precisely, and discover patients’ condition in time, having quite vast potential for future medicinal development.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Bronze_-_-_TEXT.html," cost, open fabrication methods. This is something that has never been possible in microfluidics before.
Physically, our contribution to the community is twofold:
This summer we created Neptune, an integrated microfluidic design suite. This is a single software tool that spans the entire microfluidic design process. In Neptune, users can create microfluidic chips design schematics with the aid of algorithms that optimize the design. Neptune allows microfluidics to be designed through LFR, a specification we worked to create. With LFR, designs are parametric and the design process is simple. Neptune also allows researchers to run experiments directly through the interface by providing a control page. Users can upload a chip design to Neptune, and then use Neptune to manipulate valve states and actuate pumps to generate fluid flows in the chip.
We did not stop there. This summer we also created a full hardware control infrastructure for microfluidic chips. We developed original designs for controlling valve actuation and fluid dispension using low cost servo motors and 3D printed components. These designs are both parametric, and the they have high precision in their fluid dispension. Further, we designed 3D print schematics for a pump array to control a microfluidic chip; these 3D print schematics are all served through Neptune.
Thus, we have developed everything a researcher would need to design, fabricate, and run experiments on their microfluidic device. Accessibility, though, has always been our biggest goal. We developed this entire workflow with the synthetic biology community in mind. Microfluidics have always been very difficult to fabricate, and costly, with tools for fabrication and design costing nearly $100,000. Further, control infrastructure is also costly, and most software tools to control microfluidics are specialized to single hardware pieces. We developed our workflow to interface with and use only open source, low cost tools. We designed 3D printed hardware for the purpose of providing a more accessible alternative, and we use the MakerFluidics fabrication protocol to keep fabrication costs as low as possible.
Please, follow this link to see the documentation for Neptune, and our hardware pieces."

EcoRI and PstI digested Cld genes are all expected to give rise to bands on the gel of ~1 150 bp. The pSB1C3 backbone is expected to give a band of ~2 029 bp. Figure 5 shows the expected band sizes for all four constructs and confirms that we have been successful in cloning all of our Cld constructs with the promoter and terminator.
The His-tags allow us to perform Western blot analysis to determine if we are able to express the Cld enzymes.
Figure 6: Western blot for chlorite dismutase constructs
Expected molecular weights (kDa): A = 32.97 | B = 32.99 | C = 32.96 | D = 31.20
Figure 6 indicates that we have seen expression from A. oryzae Cld, A. suillum Cld and D. aromatica Cld. There is no band corresponding to the correct molecular weight of N. defluvii Cld.
After confirmation of expression we now needed to demonstrate activity. For this we assayed for oxygen evolution after addition of the substrate chlorite using a Clark oxygen electrode protocol .
Figure 7: Kinetic trace of O2 production from the chlorite dismutase Clark electrode
Figure 7 demonstrates that up until the point of chlorite addition the oxygen concentration in the Clark electrode decreases. On addition of sodium chlorite (at time = 0) the oxygen concentration increases in the presence of A. oryzae Cld, A. suillum Cld and D. aromatica Cld. No oxygen is evolved in the N. defluvii experiment but this is not surprising due to the lack of expression as demonstrated in Figure 6.
Figure 8: Rate of O2 production from the chlorite dismutase Clark electrode
Figure 8 demonstrates that D. aromatica Cld has the fastest rate of oxygen production and that A. oryzae Cld and A. suillum C"

Riboregulator Feature Page
In this feature page, several teams that have worked with riboregulators are highlighted. More outstanding riboregulators are also identified according to the these criteria: availability from Part Registry, usage frequency, and availability of characterization information of the riboregulator system. Finally, abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that used or planned to use riboregulators are included; links are provided to each team’s riboregulator page for more information. This feature page can help users to quickly scan through the available riboregulators, and determine whether the riboregulator system is feasible for the project in mind by comparing previous projects that have used the riboregulator system.
Introduction to riboregulators
Figure 1.
Artificial riboregulator system used to control post-transcriptional regulation
Regulatory RNAs are small RNA that regulates biological processes such as transcription or translation. The use of regulatory RNAs has been a great interest in the field of synthetic biology because it provides an additional level of regulation for biological circuits and systems. Regulatory RNAs have also used by many iGEM teams. We have identified 7 teams that have used cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) riboregulator system and more teams that have used riboswitches. For example, UC Berkeley 2005, UC Berkeley 2006 and Caltech 2007 contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry.
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by the UC Berkeley iGEM 2005 team. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level"
Northeastern,2016,Team:Northeastern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," is at a higher temp than -20 and this had degraded the exonulceases or T4 ligase in the Gibson Assembly mixture. Best case, the concentration of plasmid was too high. I did not correct for the this best case scenario directly, but am trying the heat shock with a different set of competent cells

The DNA to the left, from top to bottom are: Anderson promoter at 64.5 degrees, 5% DMSO; Terminator 2; PCMGGT?; PAW978; J22106. This gel was stained for around 15 minutes, and maybe could have gone longer in the Gel-Red, but I think the top four are probably all negative (with possible exception of the Terminator 2). I'll put that Terminator two should be PCR purified, but, if yield is < 10 ng/uL, it's probably worth tossing/trying again
IMG_3010.JPG
The DNA bands to left, from top to bottom are (all Anderson promoters): 67.5 degrees 0% DMSO, 67.5 degrees 2.5% DMSO, 67.5 degrees 5% DMSO, 64.5 degrees 0% DMSO, 64.5 degrees 2.5% DMSO. Isn't as clear in the picture, but the top band (67.5 degrees 0% DMSO) was very crisp and aparent. The others looked cloudy like possible primer-dimers. This was stained for >30 minutes in Gel-Red, which is apprent by how much brighter the ladder is opposed to the gel above. I'll mark that the 67.5 degrees 0% DMSO should be PCR purified in the table

We would like to express the greatest of gratitude to the departments of Bioengineering and Life Sciences at Imperial College London, for making this project possible and providing us the platform to have one of the best experiences of our lives.
Technical Support
During the course of the project we have had the chance to work with many great people who have helped us overcome the bottlenecks in the project:
Dr Danny O’Hare, reader in sensor research, shared his expertise with us during the initial electrochemistry experiments and modelling work. He gave us crucial advice on finding the balance of our redox modulators to optimise our system in different conditions, and how to evaluate and understand the chemical reactions taking place  in our system’s background.
Dr Robert Bradley,  as a bio-electrochemist, gave us essential advice"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-N_-_-_TEXT.html," gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising.
The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe our plasmids were not what we believed them to be. Eventually it was discovered that we were using an incorrect amount of Q5 2x master mix which caused the PCR to not work properly.
Since our project would eventually require separate experiments with 5 different inserts, our first goal in lab was the amplification of our experimental base plasmid. We first created a stock of ampicillin selective plates with a concentration of 100ug/mL. We carried out a transformation with NEB DH5α chemicompetent cells and created a glycerol stock of leftover cells after plating. We plated out transformants on 3 plates at original strength, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions using glass beads. Our platings were successful, and we used the 100-fold dilution plate to isolate single colonies and create a monoclonal culture of transformants. We also learned how to plate with a sterile wire loop in order to keep the number of plates used to a minimum. Every protocol--pouring plates, transformations, platings, and creating glycerol stocks--was new to us and required some reading of protocols from NEB and other sources.
Created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of four S. cerevisiae strains obtains from the Heinrich lab at UCSC. Did a second attempt of miniprepping the pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli, but unfortunately had salt contamination in our resulting sample. We attempted this a third time by tossing out flow-throughs between each step of the miniprep procedure and obtained workable plasmid samples for pXRL2 and pUC19.
Primers came in and were rehydrated.
We performed our first attempt to PCR amplify out the ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica using colony PCR. No amplification was observed. For our second amplification attempt, we used Touchdown PCR and used increasing concentrations of yeast cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Still no results.

E. coli odor itself is not that pleasant as well. We use RED to knockout the insole production gene tnaA (tryptophanase) to reduce the odor itself. Insole in shoes is not a wonderful home for microorganisms to grow. We use vitreoscilla hemoglobin (existing part K1321200) to enhance the grow ability of two E. coli strains and get the quantitative measurement result of the Biobrick.
Overview
Apart from the foot odor, the smell of E. coli itself is also a problem remained to be solved, which is imperative for gaining acceptability for our product. The smell is believed that mainly comes from the derivatives of indole which mostly originate from indole. Thus shutting down the production of indole becomes the key task. The direct way of indole formation in E. coli is the process that turns a tryptophan into indole by tryptophanase. As a result, turning off this process by knocking out tryptophanase will reduce the source of indole as well as the smell. We decide to use RED system to knockout the gene coding tryptophanase: tnaA. [1]
Insole in shoes is not a wonderful home for microorganisms to grow. The oxygen and nutrition are both limited. We use vitreoscilla hemoglobin (existing part K1321200) to enhance the grow ability of two E. coli strains and get the quantitative measurement result of the Biobrick. And it’s the “Biobrick character improvement” in our project this year. We prove that it can be expressed in E.coli and get a lot of quantitative measurement result.

Diving into the world of functional nucleic acids
In 1952 DNA was described as the carrier of genetic information for the first time.
Hershey1952
Shortly after that Crick proposed the central dogma that DNA is transcribed into RNA and then translated into a protein.
Crick1958
Since then the role of nucleic acids in modern biology has exploded. Apart from those essential roles, both DNA and RNA with versatile functions were described. For instance first catalytic RNA that was later called RNA-enzymes or ribozymes was discovered in the early 1980s.

In 1982 the first catalytic RNA (Ribozyme): a self-spicing intron from Tetrahymena pre-rRNA was described.
Cech1981
Kruger1982
Shortly after the discovery of these self-spicing introns further ribozymes were identified in different organisms. Amongst which the hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) is a very prominent example (Fig.1) that has been employed by many laboratories since its discovery in 1986.

The fairly large amount of biotechnology students in iGEM teams could therefore improve communication between modelers with a mathematical background and experimentalists. This requires of course that there are people with a mathematical background in the team to begin with, which surprisingly often is not the case.
Based on the answers above we conclude that more diverse teams help with integration of modeling and experimental work. The proportion of mathematical students in iGEM teams is relatively low in comparison with professional research teams. To better incorporate the modeling aspect of synthetic biology in iGEM projects, it might be preferable to include more students with a strong background in mathematical sciences in teams. On the other hand, including biotechnology students could enhance the cooperation between modelers and experimentalists.
Future prospects
Studying individual teams to see how the composition affects the depth of their modeling efforts and the degree to which models are integrated to experimental work could be interesting. This could help find differences between teams of different compositions, for instance if teams with no students with biotechnology students as “mediators” have their modeling more detached from the experimental side of the project.

Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ica has multiple efflux pumps, including AcrAB. The transcription of proteins required to make this pump can be induced with the help of a transcription factor called RamA. This transcription factor recognises and is bound to by bile salts and then binds to the RamA binding site on the acrRA operon2. This regulatory binding causes increased transcription of the acrAB gene2. The efflux pump can then begin to remove bile salts out of the cell and thus protect the bacterium from it’s environment1.  To apply this concept to the timed lysis mechanism, a GFP reporter (part BBa_E0840 ) was cloned downstream of it.
acrRA:
The device was then further designed to lyse the cells upon entering the intestine thus to release the colicins produced within the cell during the time spent in the stomach. This was also a design to prevent the release of live GMO into the environment. First we wanted to characterise the bile salts sensitive promoter acrRA ( BBa_K318514 ). This part was submitted by the 2012 Wisconsin – Madison team , which consists of the acrRA operon found in Salmonella enterica. This system requires a transcription factor known as RamA which binds to the acrRA operon and activated downstream genes. ramA ( BBa_K318516 ) was previously submitted by the Wisconsin – Madison iGEM team in 2012, however, we were unable to obtain this part and so codon optimised the ramA gene for E. coli and had this synthesised by IDT as a gBlock gene fragment and submitted it as a biobrick.
We cloned gfp ( BBa_E0840 ) downstream of the acrRA promoter in order to detect changes in gene expression. RamA was cloned into the pUniprom vector downstream of the constitutive tat promoter. RamA was amplified with a C-terminal HA tag in order to detect expression of the protein.

Mahir Bozan: Hey iGEM, I am Mahir and studying my bachelor in field of Molecular Biology and Genetics at ITU. Additionally, I have also studied at Roskilde University in Molecular Biology program as an exchange student for last two semesters. It was pleasure for me to be head of Molecular Biology and Genetics Student Club in 2011-2012 academic year. In one of our club meeting, our one of the club member talked about iGEM and my huge interest to iGEM began from that moment. After a long way, finally, we are in iGEM and I am really glad to be part of this competition with such a good team. Molecular Biology is not only my interest, I have also curiosity to architecture, science of physics, film art, painting and also theater. I have lots of interests to say because I believe that knowledge is something endless and I should learn them as much as I can in my entire life.

This year I contributed generally the human practice part of our project and I also worked as lab assistant when I find a chance. Having limited lab experience forced me to become an iGEM member. I learn lots of lab techniques from our advisors and our senior students. I become familiar with synthetic biology which I really like and if I got a chance, I want to work on this field in future. Since it is the first iGEM team found in our university it was hard and stressful year for all of us but I really enjoyed being a member of our ITU iGEM Team.

Chemoreceptor and Chemotaxis
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random - walking pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 1, left panel).  While an attractant or repellent appear somewhere in the environment, the cells suppress tumbling and their locomotor responses specific runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement towards preferred environments.  (Fig. 1, right panel).
Fig. 1  Random and biased walks. Left: A random walk in isotropic environments. When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments push the cell forward. When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle. Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion. Tumbling episodes  enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions. Right: A biased walk in a chemoeffector gradient. As cells swim up a concentration gradient of attractant, they spend more time smooth swimming than tumbling; this modulation of swimming behavior is manifested as a chemotactic response.
The pictures are from Parkinson Lab - University of Utah ( The website address [ http://chemotaxis.biology.utah.edu/Parkinson_Lab/projects/ecolichemotaxis/ecolichemotaxis.html ])
E. coli has five chemoreceptors, four are methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (McpS) which have periplasmic ligand binding sites and conserved cytoplasmic signaling domains (Fig. 2).  The McpS initiate a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates methylation-independent aeroTCAtic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation"

• Overview
A field visit to in vitro diagnostic company, Acon biotech and a face-to-face talk with in vitro diagnosis industry veteran. To have a further understanding on in vitro diagnosis(IVD), we choose Acon-Biotech to perform our integrated human practice. Here, we got our main feedbacks and in turn, developed a mode of transformation of Scientific and Technological Achievements.

The research and development Manager, Mrs. Juan Cui, together with her colleagues had a table meeting with us. Actually, we didn’t aware where our cell-free biosensor’s advantage lies at the very first. But after a detailed discussion, they showed much more interests in our project. They pointed out that the most intricate problems in commercial IVD is the exorbitant cost, temporally and economically.
Below are the detailed reasons:
1. In their actual working process, firstly they have to test out the best enzymes matching ratios. As the enzymes are in a free state, the cluster reactions may not process easily and adequately, which makes this preliminary experiment much more complicated and highly-costed. This especially highlights the demand of our enzymes complex.
2. After getting the result of the best enzymes ratio, they will use a cluster of oxidase enzymes to detect the target substrates, and similar to the glucometer, the final result will be represented through the current transferred by the oxidase reaction. But the point is, this cluster of enzymes can only be single-used, which apparently, increase the cost of diagnosis.
What our user-defined in vitro diagnostic device can do:

Three protein bands were observed in the pre-incubated samples (Lane 1 and 5 in Figures 2, 3). The dCas9 proteins were expected to be the highest bands, indicated as “Native protein”. Post incubation of the enzymes with the PCR product binding and gel shifting was observed, with little migration through the gel (Lane 2 and 5 in Figures 2, 3). After inactivation of the enzymes (Lanes 3 and 6 in Figures 2, 3) protein aggregation was observed at the top of the lanes. This indicates that the binding to the PCR was reversed.

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". We went on to research the situation of workers on plantations and found that there exist serious ethical problems within the current palm (kernel) oil industry.
Current situation
In an effort to look into these problems, we’ve contacted the non-governmental organization Amnesty International, which focuses on human rights. They provided us with a very informative report from 2016 in which they investigated labour exploitation on palm oil plantations in Indonesia. The investigations brought various human rights abuses to light, such as forced labour, child labour, gender discrimination as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices. The report focuses on plantations that provide palm oil to Wilmar International Ltd., the world’s largest processor and merchandiser of palm oil and palm kernel oil.  The quintessence of the report was that these human rights abuses aren’t isolated incidents, but a result of the systemic business practices that are used on these plantations. The payment for example is very low and based on piece rates rather than hours worked. This is very problematic, as there are severe penalties if these targets aren’t met even if the workers had to work overtime. This often leads to child labour, because the children have to help their fathers in order to avoid these penalties or to help get bonus payments. Another problem is gender discrimination. All of the harvesters are men and most of the workers in the plant maintenance units are women. The women often are employed as casual daily labourers rather than permanent, which leaves them without certain social security benefits. They are also under the constant threat of being suspended for one or more days if they fail to meet their target. As for dangerous working conditions, among other things there’s a problem regarding the safety of workers handling the herbicide paraquat dichloride. Amnesty International found that workers often aren’t informed enough about the risks associated with the chemicals and the protective equipment often is insufficient or missing. In our Interview with Marianne Klute she also described most of the above mentioned human rights issues [19,23].
What is the best way to help workers and how would the introduction of a synthetic alternative to palm kernel oil impact them?
In “Workers of the Palm Oil Industry - Exploitation, Resistance and Transnational Solidarity” a paper published by Stiftung Asienhaus in 2016, the authors argue that the best way to tackle both the environmental and worker exploitation issues is to support local resistance/activist groups. Helping the workers achieve better working conditions such as better pay would result in less productivity per worker (because currently they have to work so many unpaid overtime hours or get help by their families in order to meet"
Tec-Monterrey,2014,Team:Tec-Monterrey#ITESM14 interlab.html_-_-_TEXT.html," Thus, a collaboration was made with the team UANL_Mty-Mexico. They gave us four D3-GFP ligations and we gave them a D2-GFP ligation.
At last, the ligations were confirmed on gel on September 16th. The measurements of fluorescence and optic density weren’t made until September 27th because the microplate lector was being used by another researcher.
Section II: Protocol
Sample preparation
The following parts from the distribution kits were transformed in E. coli TOP10 cells according to the electrotransformation protocol:
D1= 17F, plate 2, 2012 (Kn)
D2= 20k, plate 1, 2013 (CAM)
D3=20K, plate 1, 2012 (Amp)
GFP= 12M, plate 1, 2012 (Amp)
RFP= 9K, plate 1, 2014 (CAM)
*A D3 part of the Ampicillin cassette was used because the one in pSB1C3 caused many problems.
After transformation, a single colony from each of the selection plates was selected and inoculated in 20mL LB broth with the appropriate antibiotic. These were incubated overnight at 37°C with 250rpm. Later, the tubes were centrifuged at 4,000rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 1mL of LB media. Of the total volume, 425uL were used for a glycerol stock, which was stored at -80°C. The remaining volume was used to make minipreps. The DNA concentration and purity were measured with the nanodrop machine.
The digestion analysis of the parts was as following:

We attempted to view lumazine synthase microcompartments under scanning electron microscopy. However, because our microcompartments were in solution, the moisture remaining caused the electron beam to heat the sample. This destroyed the entire sample, including the carbon material it was placed on.

Preparation of Cell Cultures and Controls
A total of six 5ml cell cultures of Escherichia coli DH5α cells containing the BBa_K542008 construct were grown under different conditions overnight at 37°C. As controls parts BBa_K542006, BBa_K331031, BBa_K331033, BBa_K542001 were grown normally overnight at 37°C.
Table 1. E.coli DH5α cells cultures grown in LB media and incubated overnight with shaking at 37°C. Samples #1-6 was grown up differently with specific treatments for the expression of certain parts within the BBa_K542008 construct. Samples #7-10 was grown as controls.
The following morning, six 50mL cultures were inoculated with 1mL of overnight culture grown to sample 6 (with nothing expressed), and four 50mL cultures were inoculated with samples 7-10. The 50mL cultures were allowed to grow with shaking at 37oC until they reached an OD600 of 0.6 (approximately 3 hours). Samples 1-3 and 6-10 were immediately pelleted by centrifugation (4oC, 5000xg, 20min) and placed on ice. Samples 4 and 5 were treated as described in table above. Pellets were weighed, and resuspended in 10mL/mg wet weight of the following buffer:
50mM TrisHCl (pH8.0)
250mM NaCl
5mM 2ME
In order to evaluate expression levels, 1mL of cells was removed from each culture, and analysed using SDS-PAGE (12%).
Lysis of Cells and Clearing of Cell Lysate
Resuspended cell cultures were incubated on ice, and subjected to 3x20 pulse sonication bursts, with 3 minute rests on ice.

At this point it is worth reflecting on a criticism sometimes levelled against this model of exponential population growth, namely that if $\lambda$ exceeds $\mu$ then it ultimately leads to so large populations that their existence is physically impossible.
A far more serious, but often neglected, question is How far into the future is ecological prediction, based on simple models, feasible ? The answer must depend on the situation being considered, since it is influenced to a large extent by biological factors such as over what length of time the (actual) birth and death rates can be expected to remain reasonably constant and how"

We reported the effect of gene silence to our teacher. We found out some abnormal data in the diagram. Maybe we had some mistake in the step of mixing the solution. So we prepared to do the RT-PCR once again. But this time, unfortunately, we put PCR Tubes Strip in wrong way. So we plan to do the experiment again tomorrow. We believed that failure can let us go further.
We observed a strong fluorescence from the cells transfected yesterday.

We went to Guangdong Sheng Zhongyi hospital for visiting patients and making a survey. We communicate myocardial ischemia with the patients. We prepared some questions to ask them and we hope to get some useful references about the disease. We asked in detail about the disease and encourage them to establish confidence, adherence to treatment. On the one hand, in this interview, some patients pointed out that the frequency of taking medicine quite bothered him, and almost every patient should take with the emergency treatment drug all the time. We found that most of the patients not only had cardiovascular disease but also had diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease and so on. On the other hand, we know that the healthcare system of China were good but quite inadequate. It definitely reduced patients’ financial burden. But we found that there were still some problems in the healthcare system. We concluded four major problems, for example, low coverage, lack of unity, the high insurance beyond reality and a waste of personal account in the process of constructing the social medical insurance system. After the visit, we shook hand with patients and showed our gratitude to the doctors and nurses who gave us support.
In the progress of experiment, we detected the concentration of cGMP in the cells which we transfected the day before yesterday by ELISA. And we found that the content of cGMP in the third group increased by twenty percent.

The following paragraphs will lead you through the assembly of the  different components.
Additionally to the listed components you will need:
a 2.5mm Allen wrench
grease
a file, a mill or an angle grinder
acetone or glue
soldering equipment
Syringe pump
Prepare the spindle (4) and the stepper motor (2) as shown in the manufacturing drawings by using a file, an angle grinder or a mill.
Glue the linear bearings (6) and the trapezoidal nut (7) into the syringe carrier (5). Since acetone dissolves the used ABS plastic, you can just thinly dab the area with it and quickly insert the components. After the acetone has evaporated, the parts should be sitting tight.
Cut off two pins on each end stop (8). They must be on the same side. If you’re not sure which pins to select, measure the electrical resistances between them. The value should change when the button is pushed. Cut off the other two. Solder thin wires to the remaining legs and push them through the cable channels. Make sure that they are not touching each other with shrink tubing or isolation tape. Insert the buttons into the provided holes.
Screw the spindle (4) into the trapezoidal nut (7) until it reaches the middle of the spindle.
Attach the connector (3) to the spindle (4) with the fitting end.
Hold the assembled syringe carrier (5) into the baseplate in front of the holes where it’s going to be secured in step 7.
Insert the two rods (9) into the baseplate (1) through the back holes so that they fit through the linear bearings (6).
Insert the stepper motor (2) from above into the back of the baseplate (1), insert its axle into the connector and secure it with the screws (10).

Enhanced sensitivity of metal iron detection based on dCas9 system
In view of the current serious pollution problems, we focus on the pollution of heavy metal ions. Only by detecting             heavy metal ions quickly and accurately can we prevent pollution in a timely manner. To this end, we started             with a arsenic ion, combined with the achievements of the 2006 iGEM team (iGEM2006_Edinburgh) in order to construct             a circuit dedicated to the detection of arsenic ions, which consists of Promoter J23104, ArsR Protein, Promoter             ArsR, smURFP. We first ligated these fragments by overlap, then ligated them to the pKM586 plasmid by double             restriction enzymes, and then transformed them into E.coli BL21. Since we think this loop can not be completed             to meet our requirements, we want to make this loop more sensitive. Therefore, we noticed that dcas9 in the CRISPR-Cas             system has an enhanced transcriptional effect, thus amplifying the effect of arsenic ions on the loop. In the             plasmid of dCas9, we need to cut the two segments of the plasmid with BsaI enzyme, then connect the spacer we             designed to target dCas9 to the corresponding gene, and then we import it with another plasmid E.coli BL21 to             complete the enhancement of our arsenic sensing circuit by dCas9.

Plasmid construction
We have accomplished the construction of two parts whose functions are described respectively in the previous design page (Microtubule module) . They are pYD1-α tubulin (BBa_K2220019) and pYD1-β tubulin (BBa_K2220020) , both of which have been validated by sequencing. The electrophoresis image of these two parts are shown below (see Figure 1).
pYD1-β tubulin was transfected into S. cerevisiae EBY100 by our team and its function was verified by protein analysis techiniques including Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy (see Figure 2 and 3). Meanwhile, pYD1-α tubulin was transfected into S.cerevisiae EBY100 by FAFU-China as a part of collaboration works.( Click to see more details)

Protein expression analysis- Western blot
Recombinant S.cerevisiae EBY100 strain harbouring the pYD1-β tubulin plasmid was precultivated to mid-log growth phase and then induced by galactose. After 24 hours of inducing，the supernatant from cell lysates of the engineered EBY100-pYD1-β was analysed by Western blot. The image shows the results of the Western blot analysis carried out with an anti-V5 antibody.

Function analysis- Immunofluorescence microscopy
Recombinant S. cerevisiae EBY100 strain harbouring the pYD1–β tubulin plasmid was precultivated to mid-log growth phase and then induced for 24 hours at 20℃. During the inducing period, cells equivalent to 2 OD600 units were collected every two hours from 8 h to 24 h. To detect the displayed protein, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with mouse IgG against βI tubulin and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 as primary and second antibody respectively.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#development of new methods_-_-_TEXT.html," labeled nucleotide is incorporated, a detectable signal is emitted. This is problematic regarding sequencing of DNA containing unnatural bases, as additional labeled nucleotides would be needed for a continuous strand synthesis and to produce a unique signal for the unnatural bases. Considering the development costs for this new chemistry, the necessary process adaptations and increased complexity of data analysis, the sequencing of orthogonal unnatural bases is unlikely to be feasible with these technologies. In contrast, nanopore sequencing omits the necessity for additional chemistry and it is unlikely that sequencing will be interrupted by unnatural bases passing through the nanopore. On top of that, Nanopore sequencing was shown to be applicable for direct sequencing of RNA, without prior transcription into cDNA (Garalde et al., 2016). Therefore, it promises to be suitable for transcription studies involving unnatural bases too.
We aimed to examine if Oxford Nanopore sequencing is suitable for sequencing DNA containing unnatural bases. Therefore, we sequenced different DNA samples containing either the unnatural bases isoG and isoCm or any natural bases in the same sequence context to see if the output signal differs significantly between these groups. The data processing and evaluation was performed with the help of our own software iCG , that we developed specifically for analyzing Nanopore sequencing data of DNA containing unnatural bases. Our aim is to create a linear discriminant analysis model that is able to discriminate between isoG/isoCm and natural bases in the given neighboring sequence context of two bases upstream and two bases downstream of the position of interest. For a detailed description of how the software works, please refer to our Software page.
Reference Sample Preparation & Sequencing
In order to examine if the unnatural bases isoG and isoCm are differentiable from the natural bases through nanopore sequencing, five different DNA samples were prepared that differed only at a single sequence position, containing either an unnatural base or one of the four natural bases at this position of interest. For our experiments, we started by sequencing isoCm in the sequence context 5'‑AG\iCm\CC‑3' and, on the reverse strand, isoG in the sequence context 5'‑GG\iG\CT‑3'. For this purpose, we constructed five reference DNA samples with the following sequences:

Each reference DNA sample was prepared starting from a pair of complementary synthetic oligonucleotides. The oligos containing isoguanine or 5‑methyl is"

Gladly, we have the pleasure to share our project and                         our ideas with them.
IGEM IISER Kolkata
Sometimes when you are developing a project that focuses on a big problem but without access                         to a lot of information about it, you can commit some misconceptions. This is what happened                         to IISER Kolkata while trying to attack the high concentrations of Arsenic in pluvial                         systems.
This compound is highly concerning all around the world, therefore, they had to gather                         information of concentrations of Arsenic in other places and also what actions are being                         developed to solve this problem. So, we had the pleasure to gather this information in our                         country and share it with them.
General Knowledge of Burns Survey
Since TecTissue addresses an issue that affects people all around the world, we designed a                         survey to gather information regarding the treatment of burn injuries in different                         countries. This activity allowed us to identify important aspects of our project. We would                         like to thank the teams that participated in their responses help us to consider a more                         accurate social and ethical impact.

iGEM Düsseldorf Postcards
“A picture is worth a thousand words”. That’s the idea behind the collaboration                         proposed by the iGEM team of Düsseldorf, which consisted of a collection of postcards that                         represented the wide diversity of applications of synthetic biology. The postcards created                         by different iGEM teams from all around the world depicted their projects and helped to                         bring together the iGEM community by randomly sharing the pictures among the participating                         teams.

Collaboration iGEM team Aachen 2018 - iGEM Biotechnology Conference
On 20th September, we organized the iGEM Biotechnology Conference in collaboration with iGEM Team Aachen . In keeping with the spirit of iGEM this conference was ‘valorisation’-themed and was intended to bring public engagements and collaboration opportunities together. During the iGEM meet-up in Munich, we came in contact with the iGEM team from Aachen and ran our idea of a possible collaboration on the conference by them. They were very enthusiastic right away and already had many ideas.
After the meet-up in Munich, we started Skyping with them weekly to keep each other updated. We divided the tasks and both started with our search for speakers, companies and funding. Our team arranged the venue and facilities, catering services, ticket sales, two speakers (Dr. Silvia Mihaila and Dr. Mauro Muraro) and two companies (Single Cell Discoveries and Mimetas). Team Aachen arranged two speakers (Dr. Aljoscha Wahl and Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez) and designed the flyers. They also helped with designing the powerpoint for the conference. Together we promoted the conference on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as face-to-face promotion both in Germany and the Netherlands.
Before the conference, we had two meetings in Utrecht to sort problems and to get to know each other even better. We had a lot of fun during these meet-ups and during the iGEM Biotechnology Conference itself. We are happy we managed to organize such a successful conference together, with about 60 paying participants!
Collaboration with iGEM team ETH Zurich 2018
This year, the iGEM team from ETH Zurich is developing an autonomous robot that uses biosensors as its control element to follow molecule gradients in the air to detect their source. To speed up their biosensors, they are also aiming to exploit and modify the natural Tar-receptor-based chemotaxis system of E. coli.
During the European iGEM Meetup in July, we came to the conclusion that both of our teams were working on chemotaxis-based biosensors. Although our projects are based on somewhat different methods and applications, we did struggle with similar complications at the time. For those reasons, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of"

The top portion of the rectangle indicates the major groove side of attTn7 and the bottom side represents the minor groove face of attTn7. Also illustrated in the box is the 5 bp duplication (underlined) that occurs on Tn7 insertion and the arrows show the positions of joining of the transposon ends, executed by the transposase (TnsAB) on attTn7.

The sequence of the E. coli GlmS protein, and the consensus attTn7 sequence were derived as described in the text (note that the least conserved nucleotides correspond to the third position of each codon).
Strategy
To improve and extend the study of attTn7 over phylogeny. Also, we will analyze its level of conservation with the final idea of making our miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit extensible to other organisms. Moreover, in the development of a complete synthetic Tn7 transposon toolkit, obtaining a consensus nucleotide attTn7 sequence might be also interesting (it would be included in our system). To achieve this, several database searches, BLASTs, multi sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and sequence logos were performed.
Procedure
Obtaining a consensus nucleotide sequence from organisms which have the Tn7 family transposon.
Searching for organisms with Tn7 family transposon. Several BLASTs were run in the Uniprot database BLAST server using as input E.coli Tn7 transposon proteins (for example TnsB). From the results, several organisms were chosen and it was checked on bibliography if Tn7 transposon had been found in the chosen organisms.
Glms protein sequences were downloaded from Uniprot database and the"

Since the results from the experiment with the red and blue light were inconclusive, we went on to analyse the data from the experiment, where we set up a light gradient in the area that was observed through the microscope. We recorded this for 40 seconds with a framerate of 4 frames/second, waited for 100 seconds and recorded again for 40 seconds. We did 10 iterations of this, which would give us a long-term overview of migration (if there is any) along the light gradient. Afterwards we repeated the same experiment without stimulating the bacteria through a light gradient. A track diagram was created, which should show us if the tracked microbes would show any preference in one direction. In the circular diagram each bacteria starts at point zero and then moves as plotted by its angle and distance traveled. This will give us an idea if there is any tendency to either move towards or away from the light. The lightsource was placed at 90 degrees in the diagram, which means that bacteria that moved in that general direction moved towards the source of light:
Figure 7: Track diagram of phototaxic bacteria swimming, when exposed to a blue light gradient (470nm).
The diagram shows that the bacteria that exhibit proper swimming motility (i.e. paths longer than 40, no circular movement, no Brownian movement) show a slight tendency to move towards the more illuminated areas of the gradient. This can be interpreted as blue light acting as an attractant on the phototaxis pathway. Even though we can see this tendency, it should only be used as an indicator, since due to time constraints this experiment could not be repeated and the number of sampled bacteria is rather low (around 40), which means that the shown tendency could also be coincidence.
The data from the experiments with varying light intensity could not be analysed due to lack of time, but if there is any interest in it, we will gladly provide all the data that we collected.
From these experiments, we cannot definitely conclude that blue light acts as an attractant stimulus on part K343007, but the experiments all together indicate that this might be the case.
In order to verify if the shown tendency would still show up with a greater pool of samples, dublicate determinations of the light gradient experiment would have to be made. The data analysis also needs more time, since our team could only spend one"

Improved Flip Flop

Week 1
This week we have finished the complete sequence of our bistable improved by proteolysis and asRNA.
At the beginning we used a temperature-sensitive mutant of the GFP, but finally we decided to use the wild type because we want to be sure that the improvement in the speed of the signal fall is because of the asRNA/proteolysis mechanism.
In order to choose the restriction sites that will make our construct modular and more versatile (for example going from a 1-2 bistable to a 1-0 bistable), we had to scan our sequence looking for restriction sites already present, so we chose those enzymes that weren’t already present both in the sequence and in the iGEM standard plasmid. In a second optimization step we selected enzymes share buffer for double digestions.
Week 2
This week we have designed a plasmid construct that will express our antisense RNA. This is regulated by Prm promoter. By having it on a plasmid we will have an easy control of the whole antisense system by comparing strains containing or not-containing it.
At first, we decided to use only the first 16 nt of the sequence of the asRNA because it was said to give a greater inhibition in our article (Small RNA Binding to 50 mRNA Coding Region Inhibits Translational Initiation, Bouvier et al.). However, when we where analyzing the kind of terminator they used we discovered that in the complete sequence the terminator was included, and it was a ρ independent one. The fact that the 16 nt asRNA was more effective was proven by chemical synthesis of the asRNA, and it was non-suitable for us as we want to express the asRNA in vivo. So finally"
LMU-Munich,2011,Team:LMU-Munich#Primer Design_-_-_TEXT.html," and downstream regions. It checks every primer for selfannealing and uses only those which are predicted to be not selfannealing.
Additionally for all input sequences the Tm (based on the Wallace rule) and GC content of the annealing region are being determined and named. Further on the 3' ends of the primers are being checked for having a G/C at the end and for potential terminal Hairpins. In case a potential Hairpin has been found the script adds HAIRPIN!?-X-Y to the output. Here X is the number of the nucleotides which compose the loop while Y is the number of the nucleotides which are adjacent to the loop forming nucleotides and potentially annealing.

iGEM MeetUps
Organised: Spanish MeetUp 2018
This iGEM season has been great, specially in our country, being the year with more teams registered in           iGEM. There are five spanish iGEM teams this year, one of them BG-Navarra, formed by High School Students.           UPF_CRG_Barcelona arranged an Spanish MeetUp from 18th to 20th August in Barcelona Biomedical Research Park           (PRBB). If anyone wants to check the program, find itind it here .
Four teams assisted to the Spanish Meetup, BioIQS-Barcelona, OLM-Madrid, BG_Navarra and Grenoble-Alpes. We           held presentations to prepare for the Giant Jamboree, we organized workshops in order to discuss doubts and           problems that an iGEM team can face in Spain and finally we assisted to lectures from researchers in the           PRBB. The lectures were given out by Professor Jordi García-Ojalvo (Dynamical Systems Biology Lab), PhD Núria           Conde (Complex Systems Lab and DIY BioBCN) and Professor Marc Güell (Translational Synthetic Biology Lab).           Finally, we skyped with the european iGEM ambassador, Thea Chrysostomou.
We also combined some inter-team building between the scientific events. For example, we played beach           volleyball, we did a tour around the beautiful city of Barcelona and we hiked up to the Air Bunkers in           Barcelona to observe the stars and get a fantastic stars-master class by the Instructor of BG-Navarra team.           For our team, holding the meetUp was a great experience in order to get to know the other teams, enrich our           knowledge and share concerns and worries about the iGEM competition.
Attended: Mediterranean MeetUp and European MeetUp in Madrid

April 23-29, 2012
We did a new Gibson Assembly to build our working plasmid. This time it worked! We obtained some twenty or thirty colonies.
Additionally, we made our first video with 3DS Max, and Max almost destroyed his notebook with that amount of processing! You can see it here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je5JkoOMITE . Hopefully we will use these tools to make our wiki more attractive.
Also, this week we participated in Ingenia Fair.  You can find more information in our wiki section Human practices/Ingenia Fair.
April 30 – May 6, 2012
Analytical PCR was done to verify if the parts that we obtained from the Distribution Kit 2011 to build the GFP Reporter and Protease Producer plasmids have they corresponding size. The results were positive. Then we proceeded with the PCR products purification. Finally we did the Gibson Assemblies to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid, using pSB1K5 and sfGFP as positive controls. The Assemblies worked all right! Afterwards, we sent all our constructs (Working Plasmid, GFP Reporter Plasmid and Protease Producer Plasmid) for sequencing.
Also, we are very happy because we received the free license of Matlab. Hopefully we will use this tool for modeling.
May 7 – 13, 2012
We transformed E. Coli with our GFP Reporter Plasmid (B2) and with the Protease Producer Plasmid (B3). We did a little experiment with those bacteria.
The following samples were prepared: B2
B2+
B2+ & B3
B2+ & supB3
Nomenclature
B2-  (coli transformed with GFP Reporter Plasmid)
B2+ (coli transformed with GFP Reporter Plasmid, induced with Arabinose)
B3+  (coli transformed with Protease Producer Plasmid, induced with Arabinose)
supB3+ (supernatant of coli transformed with Protease Producer Plasmid induced with Arabinose)
Then we observed each sample with an epifluorescence microscope. The results were promising. B2- did not express sfGFP, but B2+ did. Additionally, in both cases (B2+ & B3) and (B2+ & supB3)"

Different 3D printing materials (right side) were incubated in the indicated solvent for two hours. None of the materials was stable enough to keep its state over the time. Pip = piperidine
Construction of the zinc fingers
Unfortunately, due to a contamination with a second plasmid we were unable to ligate our zinc finger constructs correctly. While our zinc finger constructs are only about 400-500 base pairs long and our promoter inserts are 50-100 base pairs long adding up to a maximum of 600 bp, the band after restriction of our parts from the vector showed 1500 bp. The bands at about 2100 bp represent the backbone of the pSB1C3 plasmid while the bigger bands represent the linearised plasmids (see fig. 5).
Restriction Analysis of the indicated zinc finger contructs                   (Part B: ApaI-Restriction Site + BBa_J23102 (41bp);  Part C: ApaI-Restriction Site + BamHI-Restriction Site + BBaJ23110 + C7C7 Binding Site + BBa_B0032 (80bp);       Part D: ApaI-Restriction Site + BamHI-Restriction Site + BBaJ23110 + K230R Binding Site + BBa_B0032 (74bp);    Part E: ApaI-Restriction Site + BamHI-Restriction Site + BBaJ23110 + ZFN-L Binding Site + BBa_B0032 (74bp);    Part H: ZFN-L 400bp;  Part I: K230R 397bp; PartJ: C7C7 562bp)
Because of time restraints we decided to directly ligate the promoters with the respective zinc finger and to amplify the ligated products via PCR. We used VR2 and VF2 primer (as indicated by SnapGene) for the pSB1C3 backbone which added about 300bp more to our products. However, the PCR amplicons were too small to be our products and we had stop cloning our zinc finger constructs as the giant jamboree advanced rapidly.
Construction of the Kill cassettes
When we tried to ligate Apa-pRha and Kill1 (BBa_K1882009 + BBa_K1882015 ), we were unable to ligate our Kill1 Part into a plasmid"
BNDS_China,2016,Team:BNDS China#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," have been teaching in the international department of Beijing National Day School for more than two years. My background is molecular biology focusing on metabolism pathways. The kids in BNDS are smart and creative. I really like working with and teaching them. They have great ideas in igem project and they worked extremely hard to make it become true. And the problem we are going to solve is so important and practical.
Hi, I am Zhongxiu Hu. I am an eleventh grader from Beijing National Day School. This year, I am the Team Leader of BNDS_China. Being a synthetic biologist is always my dream. (Sometimes I just want to sleep in the lab.) Art is also another giant part of my life. More than dancing and music, I love every form of it.
I’m Yingwen Guo, a senior student from Beijing National Day School. I plan to study environmental science in the future and put effort in environment protection, so it’s a great pleasure for me to participate in the iGEM competition with a team aiming on produce soft water more efficiently. I enjoy the time either doing the lab or having team discussion, when we donate our effort in solving environment problems. Moreover, this competition provides me the opportunity to study the knowledge out of the book and it gives me the chance to meet a group of excellent scientists. It is so lucky for me to be part of the iGEM, and I hope what we do can really help the world.
Hi! I am Alban (Li Yunpeng). I should say I am a researcher of this team. Basically, I enjoyed the time in lab, because I like to be involved in a research program. Though this is not the first time, it is the most meaningful experience to me because we are doing a lot of things on our own for our own topic. Things really get different when we are doing things for ourselves. While doing all the experiments, I like the sense of expectation, waiting for the results, and hoping everything had and would go well.
I’m Andy (Luo Xin) from BNDS A-level program. I’m in my third year of high school. My job in our team is to suggest a topic and engage in lab activities. By joining this team, I aim to learn some basic lab skills and understand how a synthetic biology experiment is done. The time I got to know synthetic biology was in my second year in high school. At that time, I heard a Canadian high school student had synthesized a special type of bacteria, enabling it to clean up plastics waste in a river. I was amazed by how conveniently the problem"

We also provided him with examples to think about, as he was interested specifically in protein editing. We explained phage display to him and how it can be used in directed protein evolution, and walked him through our process of researching, selecting, evolving, and characterizing copper-binding proteins.
Our meeting with Zak was beneficial to everyone; we learned about control theory and how its algorithms can be devised to model large system networks, and he was able to learn about synthetic biology. At the end of our meeting, we talked about exciting advances in synthetic biology, as Zak brought up the completely synthetic yeast genome, published in March 2014, that deeply interests him.

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Recombination_-_-_TEXT.html," are also loaded on the target plasmid, we need to avoid the completely lost of plasmids or the system will not reach the expected effects. That is, the engineered E.coli cannot sense and control the plasmids due to the deficiency of its functional parts.
To solve the problem above, we aim to employ the Lambda Red Recombination system to integrate the functional parts of our project into the genome. The two main factors which will influence the recombination efficiency are the target sites and the length of homologous arms.
After a period of try-error, we have successfully integrate several functional circuits in the form of DNA linear fragments into the chromosome of E.coli DH5α. The efficient tool of genome editing based on recombination has expanded the application of our project and greatly facilitated the measurement of our setting thresholds when the plasmid comes to the low-copy concentration.
