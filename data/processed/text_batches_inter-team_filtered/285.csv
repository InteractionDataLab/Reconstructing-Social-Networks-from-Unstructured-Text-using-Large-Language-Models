Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," undergraduate researchers were 10% more likely to pursue graduate school, lending credence to the claim that undergraduate researchers were more likely to pursue research as a profession. It would be difficult to argue that these cognitive benefits and increased propensity to pursue research do not apply to iGEM, which offers applied research, access to faculty advisors, and sometimes even wages to undergraduates.
The academic literature predicts that there are myriad personal benefits to be gained from participating in iGEM. By learning from problem-solving, rather than lessons, one gains superior problem-solving skills and a superior command of the material. By participating in an engineering competition, one receives all ten benefits that Shehata and Schwartz enumerate. The incorporation of social considerations improves one’s interpersonal skills, makes one more sensitive to the concerns of others, and improves mental well-being. Participation in research as an undergraduate facilitates cognitive development and an innate thirst for knowledge that manifests as being 10% more likely to pursue a graduate degree.
Mitchell, Dori, and Kuldell (2010) performed a survey on iGEM participants that provides solid evidence of some of these effects. At least 60% of participants in 2007 and 2008 reported moderate to great increases in their ability to identify relevant questions, plan experiments, interpret results, connect old and new data, organize information, integrate published information, and communicate ideas. This is in addition to those students who reported learning techniques like PCR, cloning, and culturing prokaryotic cells at rates of 34%, 47%, and 44% respectively in 2007. Despite one in three participants having never worked in a lab before iGEM, another one in three worked more than 40 hours a week on their project. Two in three participants reported becoming more interested in lab research and four in five reported becoming more interested in biological engineering. This is clear evidence that iGEM instills basic lab skills, higher order cognitive and scientific skills, and a passion for science in participants. This increases their future earnings potential, and while the focus of this section is on personal benefits accruing to participants, it also speaks to the greater societal benefit resulting from an increase in the stock of skilled and passionate young scientists.
iGEM also facilitates the conversion of these skills, higher cognitive function, and passion for science into careers and further education. Knowing that iGEM attracts the brightest and most enthusiastic young synthetic biologists, firms and graduate universities pay up to $5000 for a booth at the Jamboree’s career fair (2015.iGEM.org, 2015). iGEM alum and"

1-4. Antisense Method
The antisense method consists in inhibiting the production of certain proteins by using an antisense RNA that is perfectly complementary to the target nucleotide sequence, thus preventing its transcription.
In this case we are using the antisense method to prevent the production of the enzymes G6PD and PGI so by representing the binding of the antisense mRNA to the nucleotide sequence with a Hill equation we got the following equations .
$$ \frac{d[G6P]}{dt} = \frac{V_{max_1} [Glc]}{K_{m_1} + [Glc]} - \left(1 - \frac{\alpha_1[mRNA_1]^{n_1}}{K_1^{n_1} + [mRNA_1]^{n_1}} \right) * \frac{V_{max_2}[G6P]}{K_{m_2} + [G6P]} \\       - \left(1 - \frac{\alpha_2[mRNA_2]^{n_2}}{K_2^{n_2} + ["
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," conversely, the rate of production for repressor protein 2 is given by:
Where similarly, k2 is the maximal rate of protein production of repressor y, KD is the equilibrium constant for dissociation of repressor x from its operator site, x is the concentration of repressor protein x
This results in the following repressor-repressor system:
The resulting nullclines are defined by:
At equilibrium:
This results in a linear fractional transformation with a negative second derivative everywhere and is unable to have multiple intersections with the diagonal. As the multiple intersections of the second derivative with the diagonal is a requirement for a switch, the repression described can therefore not support a switch. However, the inclusion of the depletion term and more than one operator site per cell makes a switch possible. The Hill function that takes cooperativity of binding when describing the level of repression is:
The behavior and conditions for bistability can be elucidated with the following dimensionless model by replacing the Hill equation into the repressor-repressor system, where the depletion term is also taken into account:
The parameters k1 and k2 describes the net effect of RNA polymerase binding, open-complex formation, transcription elongation, transcription termination, repressor binding, ribosome binding and translation. The cooperativity, described by n, can be due to the multimerization of the repressor proteins as well as the cooperative binding of repressor multimers to multiple binding sites within the operator. The nullclines of the system are:
Figure 3: Shows the two stable states and the unstable state of the switch.
The nullclines intersect at three points, resulting in the two steady states and one unstable state shown in Figure 3. From this it is clear that three intersection points occur due to the sigmoid shape of the graph, which arises when n > 1 showing that cooperativity of binding is necessary. Another key that can be extracted is the importance of similar rates of synthesis of both repressors. If the rates are unbalanced, the nullclines will only intersect once producing only a single stable state. An increase in the rate of repressor synthesis will result in a more robust switch (Gardner, T.S. et al, 2000)(Cherry, J., 2000). Figure 4 illustrates the functions of a good switch.

Robustness of the switch
Real switches are prone to stochastic fluctuations or noise, this is a consequence of the lack of separation of the states shown in Figure 5. Poor transversality of the nullclines, illustrated in Figure 6, due to real"

One mistake was made by pipetting the complete d-AuNPs tube into the wells without mixing the tube constantly. The d-AuNPs were sedimentating to the bottom of the tube and this was pipetted into wells E1 and E2. These results should be left out of the data analysis.
From the data, the spectrum of the mixtures with 0 mM, 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl were plotted. Due to pipetting errors and mixing errors, the standard deviations at lower salt concentrations were high. Additionally, the from all the samples with different salt concentrations, the ratio 620/520 was calculated and plotted over the salt concentration.

d-AuNPs Testing: d-AuNPs stability upon salt
The dAuNPs are tested for their stability under different salt concentrations. 20 µL of the d-AuNPs solution, 20 µL MilliQ and 20 µL NaCl solutions (range from 0 mM to 2000 mM) were added in one of the 96 wells on the 92 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs occured at a final NaCl concentration of 1M*⅓ = 333 mM, but increased when adding more salt. At a final concentration of 2M*⅓=666 mM NaCl, the aggregates were the most intensively changed of color.
From the data, the spectrum of the mixtures with 0 mM, 1000 mM and 2000 mM NaCl were plotted. In comparison with the previous measurements, the error bars are lower. Additionally, the from all the samples with different salt concentrations, the ratio 620/520nm was calculated and plotted over the salt concentration.

Our SID epidemic model with ordinary differential equation (ODE) was constructed based on SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model, following are some basic properties and assumptions of our model.
Assumptions
1. The population growth of cockroach follows sigmoid growth curve.
2. The population of cockroach has reached close to the stationary stage.
3. Ignore natural death rate in our system since stubborn vitality of cockroach.
4. Infectious individuals can not recover, and ignore they give birth.
5. Naturally all cockroaches are susceptible individuals, they can infect by M.anisopliae becoming infectious individuals.
6. The number of individual being infected in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject is determined by standard incidence rate $\dfrac {\beta IS}{S+I}$ .
7. The transition rate between infectious and dead is γ, its reciprocal ($\dfrac {1}{\gamma}$) determines the average infectious period, which is estimate by experiment data.
8. Other factors that may affect the experiment are negligible.

In April, we were invited to participate in the March for Science in Cologne. Of course, we accepted this invitation and met with other German iGEM teams located in the Cologne area to promote the importance of science in our modern society and everyday life. At this event, we got to know many iGEM teams in person and got first impressions of their interesting projects. We got to know the iGEM team Duesseldorf quite well with whom we were in close contact throughout the year and started a collaboration for independent sequencing.

After guiding them through our facility, both teams presented their projects and we had the opportunity to discuss them in detail. Especially in such an early stage of an iGEM project, an intensive discussion helped a lot in identifying blur aspects of the project.

The Minister will issue a letter with his decision within 90 days of the application being acknowledged and this will also be published on Gov.UK. The 90 days may be extended if we need to ask the applicant for additional data. If that happens we will ‘stop the clock’ while you gather the additional evidence, and re-start the clock when the information is submitted. The day on which the application is acknowledged by Defra counts as day 1 for the application.    The DR of GMOs for trial purposes is already a national competence, with the UK making its own decisions independent of the EU. Further, decisions to DR GMO are a devolved matter so if an applicant wanted to conduct a trial in England, the application would be made to Defra. However, if the trial is to take place in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, it would those Governments who would make the decision, with applications having been made directly to them. ACRE advises the whole of the UK.   I hope that you find this information helpful, Ivy” To draw comparison across the globe we also looked at legislation surrounding GMO release in the US. We were directed to this Government website to find the relevant information. US regulation of GMOs focuses on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which they are produced, so the extent to which there are restrictions on releases of GMOs into the environment depends on the GMO. There are no comprehensive legislation specifically addressing GMOs – they are regulated under the general statutory authority of environmental, health and safety laws. The Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published a policy statement in 1986 called the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology which set the basic approach for regulation of GMOs in the US. Three main agencies are involved in regulating GMOs – US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In some cases, federal agencies are required to prepare Environmental Assessments (EAs) of federal actions under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to determine if the environment will be significantly impacted. If it will, then the agency must prepare a detailed evaluation called an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). GMO approvals may require an EA or an EIS in some circumstances.

Separation of Different Ions (Copper and Cadmium ions)
OVERVIEW
The genetic circuit based on the Vika-Vox system in genetically-engineered yeast enables stepwise treatment of heavy metal ions by a switch from the expression of Cup1 metallothionein (copper accumulation) to the expression of LIMT metallothionein (cadmium accumulation). We measure the concentration of heavy metal ions in the supernatant at equal intervals to test the efficiency of our system.
BACKGROUND
Cup1, a kind of functional metallothionein, can combine with copper ions in yeast.
As a metallothionein in Littorina littorea, LIMT is capable of binding a large number of cadmium ions.
EXPERIMENT DESIGN
1) construction of S.C-Cu(Cd)
The TEF promoter, the Cup1 gene, and the Ura3 terminator are ligated together by overlap PCR, and then the sequence is integrated into vox-ura3-vox system by yeast's homologous recombination. 5-FOA plate helps us to screen the correct cell after transferring. Similarly, the LIMT gene and the Ura3 nutritional label are integrated into the same chromosome. Screened by SC-ura3, we complete genetic circuit as figure 5-1,5-2.showing below.
Fig.5-1 the construction of expressing copper metallothionein.
Fig.5-1 the construction of expressing copper metallothionein.
Fig.5-2 the construction of expressing cadmium metallothionein.
Fig.5-2 the construction of expressing cadmium metallothionein.
2) Switch
A vector expressing the Vika recombinase is also transformed into the yeast strain. The expression of Vika enzymes can be induced by galactose. Then the Cup1 gene along with its terminator will be deleted by Vika recombinase hence the initiation of the expression of LIMT metallothionein. S.C-Cu is turned to S.C-Cd.
3) Copper Ions Accumulation
After completing the construction of the genetic circuit, we start to test the efficiency of copper accumulation. Firstly, S.C-Cu, S8 (screened by SCRaMbLE) and BY4741 are all cultured in YPD liquid media for 24 hours for accumulation. after that the 430 mg/L copper ions"

Next Version of BioMORTAR
While BioMORTAR has succeeded in its goal to help automate the design process in bacterial and metabolic engineering, it still can be improved on many fronts.
First and foremost, the next version will include a user registry, coded in Django, that will allow users to create a profile and save their designed plasmids on the server while displaying the plasmids their lab currently stores. This will allow the users of BioMORTAR to be able to more easily share resources they have, and access the resources they need to create their desired plasmid. It will also allow BioMORTAR to match parts of stored plasmids to plasmids generated by the plasmid designer, then reference them to the user so that the user can have easy access to the resources to implement the designed plasmid in vivo.
The next step of development of BioMORTAR 2.0 will be a security feature that will deter users from using this tool for malicious purposes. The registry in place will log activity from each user and store the data on the server, allowing for easy access to records in case of need from law enforcement.
One of the most important new functions in the next version will be the ability for the COBRA cell modeling tool to directly interact with the IMPtools module in order to automatically optimize the metabolic pathway for cell growth. With the implementation of the new features in the next version, BioMORTAR will be able to go above and beyond its initial goal in the automation of cell design.

Cell Cycle Dependent Promoter: Pnrd
As described in the systems page , a cell division dependent promoter is essential for the functioning of our intergenerational phenotypic switching device. Stanford-Brown iGEM 2012 documented the characterisation of Promoter Pnrd ( BBa_K847211 ) and confirmed its functionality. However, since it was submitted in RFC[25] standard, the part was redesigned in RFC[10] to deal with the possible disadvantages of RFC[25] standard.
Sequencing results of Pnrd RFC[10]
The results of sequence show that the improved part contains the RFC[10] prefix and suffix.
Reconstructed in the RFC[10] format, the Pnrd promoter was ligated in front of part BBa_E0240 and compared to the standard promoter BBa_J23101. The measurement was made approximately 4h after 100 fold dilution in M9 in a 5 min interval. For details of our characterisation, refer to our protocol .
Figure 1. Measurement of nrd Promoter Activity.
The fluorescence from the Pnrd promoter is compared with that from the standard promoter BBa_J23101, 3 samples were measured every 9 minutes for each construct. Although there seems to be a slight sudden rise in the promoter activity from the 10-20th minute after the start of measurement, since the change in cell concentration could not be measured simultaneously with fluorescence, it is not certain whether the rise is influenced by the cell cycle/division.
SIGMA 35
In addition to the cell division dependent promoter, extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors are required in our device to coordinate between the cell division dependent promoter and Toehold Switch.
The figure below shows the result of our characterisation. Experiments were done according to methods described in our protocol .
Figure 2. Measurement of ECF sigma35 and sigma30 promoter activity.
Fluorescence/OD600 of a construct containing both an ECF sigma35 generating device and ECF sigma 35 inducible GFP generating device BBa_K2070005 was compared to that containing only either one of the devices. *** for P> 0.001 indicates an extremely significant difference between the induced and uninduced state.
As can be seen from the above figure, the ECF sigma30 promoter is only activated in presence of"

The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner.

In mixed break-out groups, we discussed two topics with inherent ethical dilemmas that iGEM teams can face or have faced in the past: bioluminescence and gene drives. In the final round, the iGEM teams got together again and discussed how the same questions of the first two rounds could be applied to their own project.  We received positive feedback from the teams, many naming this workshop as one of the most useful parts of the meetup. Opinions still differed greatly, as illustrated by the quotes below.
“ I believe science is all about having aggressive ideas and putting them into experiments. Bioethics should be considered, but it should not be the reason that we stop the development of a certain technology.”
Participant
“Bioethics is something equally important as the product you are going after. It is unethical not to consider bioethics. ”

Hackaton
On October 5th, 2018, we organised a Hackathon during the Cyber Security Week. Here we challenged participants to try and beat our gene doping detection algorithm. The first goal of the Hackathon was to educated participants about synthetic biology and our project. The second goal to learn from the participants and the sequences they generated. In this way, we were able to make our algorithm more robust through the knowledge and sequences we gained while imparting some of our own knowledge on the participants. The Hackathon was a perfect of how learning can go both ways.

High School Bioethics Debates
We think that also outside of iGEM children need to be brought in contact with bioethics and their own responsibility, whether this is in the development of technology or the use. Since the use of gene editing techniques are more and more widely available, we decided to visit high schools to start bioethics debates on this topic.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," on the creation of a biolaser in the form of a a biosilica-covered cell expressing fluorescent proteins. The biosilica-layer traps some of the photons sent out by fluorescent proteins that can be used to excite other fluorescent proteins. This leads to increased overall fluorescence intensity in the cells. We measured their strains in our plate reader. During our own project, we have worked with the microplate reader extensively. Likewise, testing the samples from TU_Delft was not just beneficial for them, it also added to our own expertise in handling the microplate reader. We tested eight different constructs in a microplate reader: three different BioBricks for expression of fluorescent proteins and expression of GFP with five different promoters. In short, we are content with the results we got and the practice we had gotten through this collaboration, and we are happy about this opportunity to help another team. Moreover, the Delft team did some experiments for us. For our in vitro toxicity assay with fluorophore-filled vesicles, we were hoping for a picture proving that we were indeed able to encapsulate fluorophores in vesicles. The TU Delft team helped us by making some nice pictures of our vesicles using an electron microscope! The results can be found here.
We grow and tested 8 different strains from Delft.
Groningen
For Groningen iGEM team, we tested and improved their system CryptoGERM. CryptoGERM was developed to encrypt messages in the DNA of Bacillus subtilis spores, that can only be decoded using a key that is also in a spore.  We received a message to decrypt from Groningen. As we tested the system in an early stage, when it was not fully developed, we used a translator webpage instead of spores containing the key.  The procedure is as follows: 1) Grow spores 2) PCR the encoded message 3) Sequence the PCR product Unfortunately, the first attempts of PCR amplifying the message failed. We tried to perform colony PCR and tested different adjustments of the protocol: longer initial denaturation time, less DNA as template, addition of DMSO. However, we could not obtain the correct PCR fragment. Subsequently, we tried to isolate the genomic sequence of the bacteria first. After doing this we obtained a nice PCR product that was sent for sequencing. Thus, we proposed to change the protocol from colony PCR to PCR from isolated and purified genomic DNA.   The sequence we obtained was entered into the supplied website , leaving us with the following message: …..

Presentation
In this section, we present our models to describe the four legs of the ST$^2$OOL. We have closely followed all the experimental activities, so our models do not pretend to  completely characterize a single dynamical process of a cell, but instead we intend to capture the dependences of our systems on the variables explored  by our experiments.
Stability We have modeled the variation of the activity of cells transformed with Biobricks, when subjected to different temperatures or pH, by considering changes in the Biobrick transcription  and translation rates.
Standardization We have modeled the expression in different strains by comparing the transcription rates. We have built an app that computes the standardization-stability index and generates the promoter sequence for a given expression rate.
Orthogonality We have studied deterministic and stochastic models of the plasmid growth in order to learn about the unspecific interaction between two plasmids in a cell.
Open License We have modeled the susceptibility to patent a human creation and define the factors that influence it .
Stability
Living organisms have genetic and biochemical tools that allow them to respond to stress. These tools normally up-regulate some stress-specific genes, and, directly or     indirectly, down-regulate the rest of normal genes (most of them housekeeping genes). On the other hand, every Escherichia coli component works worse under non-optimal conditions     (for example, nutrients uptake or ATP production), so that, every E. coli function will be reduced.     We model the relative expression of biobricks when subjected to variations of temperature, pH and salt concentration.
Protein production
The mRNA and protein production of a cell can be described by the kinetic equations:
$$ \begin{eqnarray} \frac{d N_{mRNA} }{dt}&=& P \cdot  r_T - N_{mRNA} \cdot  \lambda_{mRNA} \nonumber ,\\ \frac{d N_{Pr} }{dt}&=& N_{mRNA} \cdot r_P - N_{Pr} \cdot  \lambda_{Pr}, \nonumber \end{eqnarray} "

SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM and BioBuilder to teachers, schools and districts is also great starting point. We also learned that we must provide very clear background information in our teachers guides to accompany our lesson plans. The survey also taught us that many teachers feel pressure to prepare students for external examinations and that this has a negative impact with respects to the implementation of engineering and design skills into their classes. We feel further investigation into this aspect is required before any drastic action can take place but we intend to work alongside iGEM, BioBuilder, College Board, and other educational governing bodies to communicate this, and future findings about exam pressures in the hope it may be considered during curriculum review times.
Presently we continued to develop and design a lesson plan which could be shared with the 54 survey respondents who left their email address with us indicating they want to receive samples of our resources. Working closely with our science faculty we decided to format our lesson plans in the recommended 5E instructional model. The lesson plan was shared in early October and at the time of writing we are awaiting feedback from teachers who have used it. We also earlier sent an email to the aforementioned educators directing them to learning materials from BioBuilder.
Throughout the development process we also worked on increasing awareness of iGEM and synthetic biology concepts in our local Shanghai community. In late May we analyzed the early survey data (65 respondents) and summarized our findings for a presentation at the annual middle to high school cross campus science fair. Several Shanghai schools, including science teachers and administrators attend this event so we had a nice platform to introduce our findings. We also gave a presentation on the fundamentals of iGEM and used the 2016 interlab study data as an exemplar of how iGEM can bring schools from around the world into the synthetic biology community. The science fair also gave us a first opportunity to plan and teach an engineering and biodesign lesson.
Our team conducted a brief lecture touching upon the most fundamental engineering design concepts and how they can be used in biology. Our target audience for this activity was younger elementary/middle school students who already express a strong passion for science. This small-scale teaching lesson helped them establish a link between engineering and life science while also providing us with valuable experience in becoming lesson planners. Approximately 50 students and 8 teachers attended the lessons and participated in in-class activity. Feedback was positive from teachers and we were happy to get some instructional advice from these experts.
Finally, responding to our survey respondents concerns about knowing where and when to use engineering and design in their curriculum, we developed a tool called “Biodesign Launchpad” that educators can use to"

Project Summary
Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. As a matter of fact, constructing a bioreporter bacteria that has the ability to detect toxic chemicals is considered one of the first accomplishments in the discipline of synthetic biology (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) . There are several advantages to using a bacterial bioreporter instead of a traditional physical or chemical sensors, for example, bacteria can offer the same specificity and sensitivity that traditional sensors offer, but they are much more portable and grow in inexpensive media. Furthermore, bacterial reporters also offer advantages over using other types of biosensors like enzymes and antibodies because they are living organisms and they are capable of analyzing samples through a process that involves many enzymes (Yagi, 2007)
The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) although these early tests didn’t use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the areas of genetic engineering and synthetic biology have resulted in many more applications such as detection of contaminants (Willardson, et. Al., 1998) and sugar and amino acid availability in soils (Jaeger, et. Al., 1999) . Even though the reporters have gotten more sophisticated and sensitive, we realized that there isn’t much mention of a single bacterial bioreporter capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting differently depending on the concentration.
We thought the use of synthetic biology as well as the BioBrick standard could help create a “genetic circuit” (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting in a different manner depending on the amount detected. In our initial research we realized that the iGEM British Columbia 2009 team decided to do something similar, so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order to propose a new genetic construction capable"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," academics and students completely condemned this behaviour, and encouraged that measures were being put in place to prevent this from happening again.
Dr Rob Wilson reiterated the importance of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group especially at changing the gender distribution between the stages from undergraduate to professorial roles. Dr Hill highlighted another problem with this distribution, in that part time academics find it very difficult to progress to the professor level. There is a large number of women who are on the education and scholarship route, which makes it very difficult to be promoted to associate professor, because staff need to have a senior management role to be promoted. Therefore Dr Hill argued that:
The lack of leadership roles for women that prevent them from being promoted to the senior positions
The discussion went on to talk more about the unconscious bias and whether attitudes growing up significantly affected people’s opinions now. Laura highlighted that
it is not being taught well enough in schools so people need to do it themselves
, meaning that we all should be more conscious and more aware of what might offend someone, because society has not progressed to the point where acceptance and understanding is taught to a sufficient level. Dr Wilson went on to argue that the path we map out for ourselves
depends very much on the people we see as our role models
and so he emphasised the importance that the University has a large number of
diverse role models
for students, which echoes what Dr Dixon and Prof. Ryan had said in their interviews.
We have to be careful with benevolent sexism, where we think that maybe this person wants to spend more time with their family so let’s give them some roles that don’t give them opportunity -Dr Rob Wilson
This was in response to questions about maternity leave and how attitudes need to change in order for there to be an increase in the number of women at higher roles. We previously heard Dr Santos in our meeting with her talk about how academics use maternity as an
easy excuse
and Dr Wilson is reiterating that this kind of attitude is present among academics and it needs to change.
In questions from the floor, a student asked what the university has lined up as a long term solution to prevent offensive activities like the white T-shirt social scandal from happening again, and excluding students from the university. Alec James responded by saying the staff at the Students Guild (the Student Union) are
starting a research project looking into the diversity of their leadership and why it is what it is
. Laura Howard went on to say:
We can do as much as we can to try to educate and inform people
Interestingly this brought an alternative reaction from the academics. Dr Wilson said"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"       lead to recruitment of RNA polymerase (5) to the promoter upstream of the reporter cassette (3) and subsequent       expression of the reporter gene. In this case the reporter is beta-lactamase, which expression leads to degradation       of ampicillin (blue squares) and survival of the bacteria.
From the two-hybrid system we expect foremost a selection of the binding protein library. Furthermore, we expect a correlation     between binding - target protein affinity and the activated gene expression strength of the reporter. By using an antibiotic     resistance protein as a reporter we predict increased levels of the resistance protein inside a cell with a high affinity     binding protein. The outcome of this should be an increase of individual fitness for bacteria with good binding proteins,     which should lead to a higher growth rate under strong selective pressure. The complete two-hybrid system should cumulate in a     correlation between binding protein affinity and bacterial growth rate, which should lead to selection of a few bacteria with     strong binding proteins. Find out more on our selection subpage .
Accessing the sequence space - in vivo mutagenesis
After selection of the bulk of our library we will increase the affinity of our Evobodies in a process similar to the affinity     maturation of antibodies ( Teng und Papavasiliou 2007 ). As     addressed above we will select our Evobodies by increasing the selection pressure. At the same time, we will use an in vivo mutagenesis system. Thereby ,we can increase the sequence diversity beyond the limits of our library. Slightly modifications of      binding proteins identified during the initial selection will are the basis for the directed  evolution.
Figure 4: In vivo mutagenesis system. By using an in vivo mutagenesis system a single Evobody coding       sequence can be evolved to various different variants, each with a unique binding site. The single starting sequence is       replicated during growth and thereby mutations are incorporated either through error-prone polymerase I or a combination       of global mutator genes. The process results in the creating of the library of binding proteins with different binding properties.
In detail, we will compare two different possibilities to diversify our binding proteins. The first approach is the use of an     error-prone polymerase I in an otherwise Pol I temperature-sensitive E. coli strain.     ( Camps et al. 2003 )     Growth at a non-permissive temperature should result in accumulation of mutations in the part of the genom maintained by DNA polymerase I.     The interesting idea behind this approach is the fact that large parts of plasmids carrying an origin of"

History about the Arduino
The Arduino is a piece of programmable hardware created by several graduate students in Italy in the early 2000’s. The name itself comes from a bar they used to hang out in, which in turn was named after an old Italian king, Arduin of Ivrea. It was created because the hardware they had previously been using was $100 and they knew some people couldn’t afford that, so they designed a cheaper alternative. This is the embodiment of the Maker’s Movement Era!
And with that, the Arduino was born. The model we use, the “Arduino Uno,” contains a programmable chip that we can code via USB, and it has fourteen digital pins along with eight analog pins that can be used to communicate with a circuit based on voltage levels. With this, the possibilities are endless! People have made remote control lawnmowers and quadcopters, they’ve built robots and video games, and they’ve even made sensors and alarms to be used for home security and ease of access! This is what the Arduino can do: bring easy circuit making to anyone’s door step to help improve quality of life."

there is a special law against ""eco-terrorist"" and ""animal liberation extremists"": Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Modifications#Rosetta_-_-_TEXT.html,"G) is a           global collaboration of more than 170 computing centers in 42 countries, linking up national           and international grid infrastructures. It was launched in 2002 to provide a resource to           store, distribute and analyze the 15 petabytes (15 million gigabytes) of data generated every           year by the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator - The Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
In Israel, there are three computing centers connected to the grid, located in the Technion Institute,           Tel Aviv University and Weizmann Institute.
WLCG supports not only the particle accelerator, but also allows unregister users to benefit from           this amazing project. We contacted the local Technion grid administrator and received a temporary user on the Atlas server (one of four particle accelerator components). This granted us access to vast computational power, much more than was necessary. With the help of David Cohen, grid computing specialist from the Technion physics department, we successfully installed Rosetta and all required programs.

Designing a binding site
To redesign the Tar chemoreceptor we followed the protocol presented in ""Rosetta and the           Design of Ligand Binding Sites"", (1).  The purpose of the protocol is to design a binding           site around a selected small molecule ligand. The general steps of the protocol can be           seen in the flowchart to the right.
Using this protocol we managed to generate a library of mutated Tar receptors that theoretically           bind a substance in a novel way and activate the chemotaxis pathway in response to it. For each           design we ran 3-5 iterations of the protocol to assure optimal results.
Fig. 1: Flowchart of the ligand binding domain design protocol.
Filtering Process
The output of the protocol is a library of variants, ranging from dozens to even thousands           of protein PDB files, depending on the parameters of the design run. This fact means that           filtering the results is an extremely crucial part of the process.
Rosetta is able to predict which protein designs are likely to have improved protein           activity. This is done by measuring every aspect of the protein complex such as binding           energies, interactions between amino acids, backbone angles, hydrogen bonds and more. After           the calculation process the user can decide which parameters are relevant and to discard           the lowest results obtained for the mentioned parameters. The specific filters we used in our designs           can be seen in this attachment .

Pveg - RBS - Antifungal EcAMP-1 (revised with a stop codon) - Double terminator
EcAMP-1 is an antimicrobial peptide of 37 amino acids  originated from the specie Echinochloa crus-galli,  a type of wild grass.  This peptide has a particular structure : it is helical because of two disulfide bonds.
EcAMP-1 has shown to have antifungal activities. Its mode of action may be the prevention of hyphae elongation.
This part was added to the Registry by the iGEM Utah State team in 2013. We observed the presence of the stop codon in the suffix. When we have digested this Biobrick, it disappeared. So we added this codon in upstream of the suffix and now, we can reuse this Biobrick.

はじめに
今日、国際的に理科離れが進んでおり、どのようにScience Communicationを図るのかが問題となっています。日本でもその傾向が見られ、特に合成生物学の主幹技術である遺伝子組み換え技術においては、「何か怖いものだ」という認識が根強くおります。遺伝子組み換えとはどういったことなのかが正しく理解されていないまま、遺伝子組み換え食品などは市場から実質的に排除されてしまっているのが現状です。今後、合成しえ物学が発達していくに伴い、国際的にこうした問題がより広がっていくと考えられます。
そこで、私たちは、遺伝子組み換えとはどのようなものなのか、日本の、そして世界の多くの人に知ってもらうために、Human Practiceにおいて次のような活動に取り組みました。

TU-Day
The TU-DAY is the open day of our university, the Technische Universität (TU) Braunschweig. The event is aimed at a wide audience and not restricted to people engaged in science. Therefore, the institutions and working groups of the university used the opportunity to introduce themselves and present their research to the public – and so did we!
The members of our team spent all day at our stand to inform interested visitors about our project and synthetic biology in general. In doing so, we were able to clear up some prejudices towards hotly debated topics like genetically modified organisms - without trivializing the risks that might come along with their use. Furthermore, we put our cooperation with the iGEM team of the University of Virginia into practice by conducting their survey on the acceptance of synthetic biology which we had translated to German for this purpose.
A highlight of our stand was our experiment station for kids. Children were taken by the hand here and performed a series of three experiments relating to milk under our instruction. We made various components of milk visible and explained them to our young visitors. During another popular experiment, we coloured the milk with food dye and produced amazing colourful patterns by applying a drop of tenside. The amazed looks on the children’s faces made the event even more enjoyable.
European Researchers' Night
The European Researchers’ Night is an annual event “dedicated to popular science and fun learning”, as the organizers put it - and we were eager to live up to that! Taking place in hundreds of cities all over Europe from Portugal to Turkey on September 26, 2014, the ERN gives scientists the opportunity to point out the importance of their research and their motivation behind it in an entertaining way. The city of Braunschweig had the privilege to host the ERN as the only location in Germany this year, next to metropolises like London, Paris"

de novo assembly of pLA230
pLA230 was used as control. To make sure our used sequence was correct, we assembled pLA230 de novo from the control dataset and compared it with the published plasmid sequence . We found one point mutation at position and detected an insertion behind the beta lactamase coding sequence.
Figure 13: Alignment of the de novo assembled pLA230 sequence and the pLA230 sequence from Addgene . The alignment shows a point mutation and the deletion inside the pLA230 sequence.
Summary
We analyzed the error prone polymerase I and our genome wide mutators with next generation sequencing.
We showed that the error prone polymerase I has a visible increased mutation rate (10x over background). Furthermore we determined the mutation spectrum of the error prone polymerase I and found a prevalence of transitions.
For our genome wide mutator system we found an increased mutation rate when using the M6 BioBrick BBa_K2082117 up to 7x over background. The uninduced sample also showed visible increased mutation (~2x over background), confirming our     assumption of considerable leakiness of our promoter, when not consequently repressed with glucose.
We also determined the mutation spectrum of the genome wide mutator and it shows the same mutageic spectra as the MP6 plasmid used by Badran and coworkers(Badran and Liu 2015).

A Proposal of the German iGEM Teams Concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," components. For example, the Q5 mix already contains dNTPs, but Phusion doesn’t. Enzymes may also have different optimum temperatures, so you need to take this into account when performing the reaction.
Water: This ensures that each of the components is in the correct relative concentration, because if you have, for example, too high a concentration of DNA, you will get too much non-specific binding, especially between primers.
How does the reaction work?
The reaction works by cycling through a series of different temperatures to allow the different stages of the reaction to occur. Firstly, the reaction mix is heated to 98oC to split the double stranded DNA into single stranded DNA, giving two strands of template.
After this the temperature of the reaction is lowered to allow the primers to anneal to the template. The precise temperature needed is determined by the enzyme being used, and the primer sequences. Our annealing temperatures ranged from about 65-72 degrees Celsius.
The final temperature in the cycle is the optimum temperature for the enzyme you’re using. This allows primer extension to occur at the faster rate possible.
These temperatures are then cycled, so you get 25-30 cycles of denaturing, annealing and extending. During each cycle, you double the amount of DNA that you started with, meaning that this is a very efficient technique for amplifying.
Applications
In the lab, DNA amplification is important for increasing your DNA concentration for future reactions. When we received our DNA stocks, they were at concentrations that were far too low for decent transformations, meaning that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve appreciable results if we used the DNA as it was. By amplifying it, we were able to make our DNA go further, saving money, and get more meaningful data from our bacteria.
Outside the lab, PCR is still important. One interesting application is in forensic science. At crime scenes, there are often very few pieces of evidence which point towards who performed the crime. Finger prints can be very useful, but sometimes there aren’t any. However, often you can find some biological trace of the criminal, such as blood, or skin cells. These contain the DNA of the criminal, which, if it can be sequenced, can point the finger towards the culprit. However, the DNA present at the crime scene will be at very low concentrations. The solution? It needs to be amplified! The scientists doing the PCR need to be very careful in this situation though, because if their DNA gets into the sample, they could be implicated in the investigation.

5.Communication with two iGEM teams
We never missed a chance to communicate. Early  in July, we were contacted by team AHUT requiring the borrow of No.5 plasmid in  the Interlab Kit. We also had a conversation over the protocol and the skills  which contributed to the fulfill of our work. In the summer vacation, we  invited two members of iGEM USTC to our campus and shared with them how our project was marching, so did they with us. All of us had a wonderful and instructive experience during these communications.

The resulting LDLR insert should be 363 bp long and HMG CoA 363 bp. HMG CoA #24, HMG CoA #26, LDLR #3, LDLR #5, LDLR #11 and LDLR #12 seem to be successfully ligated plasmids, because there are small bands at ~ 350 bp. All lanes show a p31 plasmid band, which is 4919 bp long. But other HMG CoA and LDLR inserts could not be recognized. All other lanes display definetly the wrong product (JeT, ~180 bp).

Additionally, a DNA ladder (100 - 10000 bp; Fermentas DNA Ladder Mix) is added into the gel for the validation of the DNA product length. The resulting LDLR insert should be 363 bp long and HMG CoA 363 bp. LDLR #19, LDLR #20, LDLR #21, LDLR #22, LDLR #24, LDLR #25, LDLR #26 and HMG CoA #35 seem to be successfully ligated plasmids, because there are small bands at ~ 350 bp. All lanes show a p31 plasmid band, which is 4919 bp long. But other HMG CoA and LDLR inserts could not be recognized. All other lanes display definetly the wrong product (JeT, ~180 bp).

Here we enlist the requirements we met to deserve the Bronze Medal.
1. Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
We registered for iGEM, worked and learned throughout the summer (it was our “winter”, actually) and will be attending the Giant Jamboree!
2. Meet all deliverables on the Requirements Page (section 3).
We completed all the forms required for iGEM on time, such as “About our Project”, “About our Lab”, “Judging Form”, etc. We will present our poster and presentation on the Giant Jamboree and submit our parts by October 21st.
3. Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
We received generous support and help for the development of our project, we thank all the people involved in our Attribution Page . Our jobs are described in the project in the Team Page .
4. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We were able to submit BioBricks for all of our three modules. For our detection module, we designed two dCas9 that accept protein insertions in two pairs of hotspots that come close when the dCas9 bind to its target (A-dCas9, BBa_K1903001 ) or when it binds to its sgRNA (B-dCas9, BBa_K1903002 ). This engineered dCas9 is a powerful tool for inserting proteins in the Cas9 domains and triggering reactions between these insertions when the dCas9 detects a nucleic acid and changes its conformational state. We also submitted a Golden Gate Adaptor BBa_K1903003 that enables iGEM's standard assembly plasmids to be a Golden Gate assembly vectors.
For our signaling module we created the BioBricks BBa_K1903009 and BBa_K1903011, which are DnaB inteins; and for the response module we designed the BioBr"

Arsenic Reporter
Background and Previous Arsenic Sensors
Several arsenic biosensors have been developed that rely on the Escherichia coli R773 arsenic-resistance plasmid. The ars operon encodes an arsenic and antimony-specific membrane pump that confers resistance by expelling these toxic metals from the cell. Expression of the ars operon is regulated by the ArsR protein which inhibits transcription of the arsR operon in the absence of arsenic. However, when arsenic is present, it sequesters ArsR, allowing transcription of the arsR operon [1,2]. Previously, the University of Edinburgh's iGEM team developed a pH-based arsenic biosensor relying on the fusion of the ars promoter with a lactose degrading fermentation pathway. pH changes can be measured either with indicator solutions or with an electrode. While their biosensor was both sensitive and easy to use, its reliance on pH made it vulnerable to changes in phosphate and bicarbonate levels and required on-site testing [4]. Siegfried et al., 2012, have recently developed a whole-cell arsenic sensing test kit that relies on bioluminescence. Both these test-kits however, lack in their ability to deliver real-time data and require periodic testing.
Design and Construction of our Arsenic Sensor
To expedite the construction of our arsenic reporter system, we employed two existing BioBricks: BBa_J33201 (Edinburgh, 2006) to function as the arsenic sensor and to drive the production of BBa_K098"

She also gave us some fantastic advice on the safety and ethics aspect of the project, as well as suggesting creative ways of addressing the issues involved with each.
Research
Those that did not meet with Amy instead focused on researching what had gone wrong with growing the E. coli and how it could be fixed, as well as looking at other BioBricks we could use and how to build the project on further once we had characterised some of the relevant BioBricks and produced our own. Having looked at previous protocols we felt that our agar plates contained too much chloramphenicol and therefore we decided it would be best to reduce the amount when trying to transform and grow the bacteria during the next week. We also looked at how previous teams had worked on creating data from BioBricks that sensed and reported on the presence of physiological molecules, and researched into how we could use expressions such as fluorescence or bioluminescence to determine the levels of nitric oxide present in an environment.
In the afternoon we were given a presentation by Sebastian Runkel, a PhD student at UEA whose research specialises in nitric oxide. He helped us to understand how nitric oxide was used in the body and what the major limitations and obstacles would be in working with it, obstacles and limitations we then went on to discuss and investigate how we could overcome them. Sebastian also spoke about using Salmonella as a potential chassis instead of E. coli due to its higher competency with nitrogen species, and we went on to discuss this as a possible path to investigate once we were able to produce a BioBrick in the E. coli chassis. This lead to new ideas on how our project might be utilised in the future.

Collaboration with  BUCT-China
We received an invitation from BUCT-China during the process of the experiment. We get some information from the E-mail that the laboratory of BUCT-China team lacked the experience to measure the fluorescence value and they could not accurately control the time of fluorescence detection, and the lab was short of the 96-well plates for fluorescence detection. So BUCT-China sends us the collaboration letter. Our laboratory has enough resources to complete this experiment, so BUCT-China has designed a quantitative experiment and entrusted us to help measure the fluorescence value under different concentration gradient conditions of fatty acids.
The collaboration experiment have designed a total of four control groups. The first one is as a control group that only add 50 ul arabinose solution with 20% concentration. And the second group added 50ul Arabic sugar solution of 20%, and 100ul fat solution of different concentrations was added one hour later. The concentrations of fatty acids were 25mM, 50mM, 100mM, 200mM and 400mM, respectively. We need to add different gradients fatty acid solutions in the third group, and the concentration was the same as that of the second group, while the fourth group was the blank control group.
The fluorescence values measured after 8 hours of culture were as follows:

Purdue,2013,Team:Purdue#Project#Standardized Datasheets_-_-_TEXT.html," use. Many of the parts in the registry have little to no characterization data present on their registry pages. And some parts in the registry have been very well characterized, but all with different assays and techniques. So it can be very difficult to compare multiple parts that have good data because the data is so different.
After weeks of traversing the registry and igem.org, we finally came to the conclusion that the main, underlying issue is that there is currently no standard for characterization data in the registry. Teams have no definitive guideline to follow to characterize their parts.
So to solve this problem, we had to figure out where to start. As is standard with most engineering problems, we started with looking at prior art. In terms of standardizing characterization, we quickly realized how difficult it would be to create a single protocol that could be applied across projects and different types of parts. So instead, we started researching datasheets.
One of the first things we looked at was Drew Endy's datasheet from 2008, shown below on the left. While this data sheet is functional and provides an abundance of information, it also seemed too complex and difficult to understand for the iGEM competition. After a few days of researching, we found out that the Boston University iGEM team had tried a similar project in the 2012 competition. Once we started contacting teams, we especially sought their advice and collaboration. The datasheet they designed in 2012 is shown below on the right. We started brainstorming what our datasheet would look like very early, and many of the early designs incorporated elements from both examples below.
However, as a group we discussed some of the protocols iGEM teams had tried to write over the years, and how most of them never went past the team that created it. This was evident in that we had never heard of most of the protocols and datasheets we found while researching. We were also having trouble deciding how to design a datasheet that every iGEM team would hopefully use. We realized that the best way to design a system that everyone would use and also find a way to keep the idea alive was to talk to as many iGEM teams as possible and get their help and input.
Acquiring Information and Generating Interest
To start this process, we gathered as many personal emails as possible from team roster pages on iGEM.org and Google searches. We emailed at least one person on every single team in the 2013 competition in late May. We sent out a simple survey to gauge how various iGEM teams felt about the current state of the registry, what data is most"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html,"erness inherent to synthetic biology question the ways how appropriate governance measures should be devised. In contrast to many other modern sciences, synthetic biology is rather unambiguous in forging synergetic structures considering that the cross-borderness appears to necessitate such an approach. Moreover, the aforementioned uncertainty also affirms the need for alternative governance measures considering that science cannot function anymore as an infallible authority for policy-making as their pursuit for more knowledge usually prompts new scientific questions and new uncertainties (Zhang et al. 2011). Sheila Jasanoff (2003) has called the condition in which scientists are confident to resolve uncertainty with the term technologies of hubris, in which ""the unknown, unspecified, and indeterminate aspects of scientific and technological developments remain (...) treated as beyond reckoning, they escape the discipline of analysis"" (Jasanoff 2003: 239). The result is that policy-makers are refrained from taking this into account despite that it is inherent to the scientific reality (Zhang et al. 2011). Consequently, ""unknown, unspecified and indeterminate"" factors are withheld from being the subject of discussion, forcing the debate to close down so that uncertainties persist to be incorrectly defined in terms of risks. This then seemingly perpetuates the idea that potential problems can be rendered calculable and thus manageable (Zhang et al. 2011).
Theoretical Framework: Opposing Paradigms in the Face of Environmental Decline
In order to capture the duality of synthetic biology governance, in terms of its positive and negative discourses in relation to the environment, this study has drawn on two ‘seemingly incompatible’ theories of late-modernity. The theoretical framework which will be discussed here has been proposed by Maurie J. Cohen (1997). It involves an integrative approach to the theories of ecological modernisation and risk society, based on their alternative visions of scientific rationality in post-industrial societies (Cohen 1997). Before discussing both theories within the suggested single framework, it is necessary to give an outline first of how the theories envision the current late modernity in relation to the condition of the environment.
Ecological Modernisation Theory
When it comes to the theory of ecological modernisation, problem-solving strategies to environmental decline is configured through the way the state operates in relation to market forces. It has been framed within the context of modernisation where the market economy is perceived as instrumental in addressing ecological concerns. The state itself has, according to the theory, performed inadequately considering the lack of governmental reform to resolve the environmental crisis. Meanwhile, actors participating in the market economy gained prominence as"
Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the students to complete the last station’s activity.
Some groups of students were very engaged in the Ethics station, but some groups remained reticent and difficult to engage.
The course director praised the carousel format of the lessons but stated that there could be “more space for informal conversations between summer school students and undergraduates.""
Modifications in light of the feedback:
We adapted the workshop stations to include a more simple outline and introduction and we made sure we adapted our explanations to suit the level of knowledge of each individual in the group.
We reduced some of the content in the initial introductory activity to allow for more time to partake in group activities.
We created more specific questions to prompt quieter groups to start discussing specific aspects of the ethical issues created by each scenario.
We adapted one of our computer-based stations to a discussion-based station (see below).
In light of this feedback, we chose to change one of the computer-based activities (the Snapgene station) to a discussion-based activity that focused on problem solving. In line with ERASynBio’s recommendations that synthetic biology teaching should equip young people with “skills to operate effectively in multi-disciplinary teams”, we focused a station on problem solving involving a range of different STEM disciplines. Attendees of the summer schools had a range of scientific backgrounds and interests, so we encouraged conversations between individuals studying different subjects to develop young people’s ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams. This set up - where team members contribute knowledge on their own area of expertise -  mimicked conversations that occur within multi-disciplinary teams, such as our own iGEM team, and provided young people to develop the “flexible thinking” required for a career in synthetic biology.
Science outreach activities targeting younger school children are necessary to encourage young people to gain an interest in science and consider a career in synthetic biology. We delivered a lesson on synthetic biology and its applications to 13-15 year old students attending summer schools in Oxford. The presentation for the lesson can be viewed here:
Presentation
Online Educational Resources
In line with recommendations to develop “much-needed approachable synthetic biology web resources” in EraSynBio’s Strategic Vision 2014, we focused on generating online resources to act as accessible educational tools for school children and the public.
Oxplore is a digital platform designed by University of Oxford to encourage school students aged 11-18 to look beyond the normal school curriculum and engage in further research in a variety of fields. We created a podcast introducing the principles of genetic engineering and its common applications, the aim of our project and the ethical implications of gene editing. The podcast was promoted by various outreach organisations in"

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sput"
Tokyo-NoKoGen,2011,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#metallothionein_-_-_TEXT.html," not observe the tolerance of E. coli expressing PduP1-18-SmtA in Cd(II) containing LB medium,  but when we expressed only the SmtA inside the E. coli, we could see that it could tolerate the Cd(II) without the PduP1-18. This could suggest that PduP1-18 fused to SmtA changed the conformation of SmtA protein, and prevented it from binding with Cd(II).
 
 
Due to the fact that not much difference could be observed in the OD595 at 300 mM Cd(II) containing medium, we tried changing the promoters for expressing SmtA and PduP1-18-fMT.
Previously , both SmtA and PduP1-18-fMT were expressed under a relatively low constitutive promoter (BBa_J23117). This time, we changed this promoter to a high constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100) and observed the growth in 300 µM Cd(II) medium, where growth of E. coli could not be observed before. However, E. coli with a high constitutive promoter could tolerate the Cd(II) containing medium better than the E. coli with low constitutive promoter (Fig.12, Fig.13). This suggests that the tolerance could be due to the amount of metallothionein being expressed, with a high constitutive promoter, E. coli could produce more metallothioneins and therefore could resist Cd(II) better.
 
 
4. Summary
Absorb heavy metal ions from the environment, capture them inside the cell and store them inside the BMC, which will then be collected by collecting the E. coli, is our metal ion collecting system using E. coli. The key features in our system is the use of BMC for storage and metallothioneins for capturing. Metallothioneins, proteins that can bind to metal ions – we have decided to use SmtA and fMT which are known to bind to Cd(II). Having observed the difference in the growth curve of wild type E. coli, E. coli expressing SmtA, and E. coli expressing PduP1-18 fused fMT in different LB medium of different Cd(II) concentrations, we could see the difference that E. coli expressing PduP1-18 fused fMT could resist higher Cd(II) concentration than the wild type. Concluding from this result, fMT could bind to Cd(II) inside the cell, because it helped E. coli resist Cd(II). This result is"

When do you need to customize the system?
Seamless assembly
Point mutations
Deletions
Adding short sequences

Customization of the Plug 'n' Play with DNA assembly standard opens the door to a wide range of applications.
When do you need to customize the system?
When a desired biological part is not yet a part of the Plug'n'Play with DNA kit.
When seamless assembly is required (e.g. protein fusion).
When the introduction of mutations are required.
When the introduction of deletions are required.
When short sequences such as linkers, RBSs, signal peptides etc. are required.
A guide for the most common design requests is given below. The guide is based on work conducted by Morten H. H. Nørholm and Hansen et. al. Figures obtained from Genee et al. (in preparation).
Creating new parts
Creating new biological parts can be necessary, when they are not already included in the Plug 'n' Play kit and submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
1. To create a new part, forward and reverse primers have to be designed for the DNA of interest. The free-ware netprimer is an excellent tool for finding suitable primers.
2. In accordance with the Plug’n’Play assembly system the category of the part i.e. promoter, GOI, TS, module, or marker cassette has to be determined.
3. Subsequently the linkers belonging to the category have to be identified. The appropriate linkers and Plug'n'Play tail for the part can be found in the linker table . The forward and reverse primer linkers are 8-9 bp long, and are placed at the 5’-end of the primers.
5. Order the primers from your favourite oligo company. Notice"

We can model this according time and the association constant (kon) and dissociation constant (koff) and internalization constant(Kint).
This gives:
With kon = 5.10^3 M-1s-1, koff = 8.10^-3 s-1 and Kint = 5,78.10^-4 s-1. If we calculate the global constant K', such as IDP = K' xt, we obtain K'= 361.5 s-1. Thus more than 360 phages are internalized per second in contact with a wall.
If we compare the time required to internalize a phage compared to waiting times before the cell enters apoptosis in response to the entrance of a vector cell (1 hour), it appears logical to neglect the internalization of cell vectors (IDP = constant = 360 phages/s) in the final equation.
Thus, with a total efficiency of the phage diffusion, and a neglected internalization time, we can say that the efficiency constant λ is equal to 1.

Simultaneous evolution of DVS and tumor
The evolution equation of our model over time is equal to:
With :
- Nc (t), the number of cancer cells depending time,
- V (t), tumor volume,
- V1 and V2, two tumors volumes respectively times t1 and t2,
- Vcc, the volume of a cancer cell,
- Nbi, the number  of injected tissue vectors ,
- Pp, the lung percentage of tissue vectors relative to the injected dose,
- DTB, the doubling time of tissue vector ,
- tinj, injection time of the [[Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#drapeau|tissue vectors],
- Npl, the number of cell vectors released by bacteria .
We can neglected (differences between the time or space scales)  some factors:
- Kdeg, the degradation constant of the phage, because all the phages were internalized in 10s.

Modelling
In order to predict the concentration of different substance in E.coli, we set the kinetic model according to the reaction rate theory and enzymatic reaction kinetics as our first model in our project.  And the production and conversion rate model is included to simulate the directed evolution model and the natural evolution model, and then we can get the time we need in our directed evolution method of DTE.  The third model we set up is the microfluidics model to predict and simulate the situation in the microfluidics chip, which is our hardware for the gradient concentration of the psicose and antibiotic to let us have a high throughput experiment.  The fourth model we set is the market prediction model to predict the future market and the coefficient between different age groups and the tendency to adopt psicose.

The Establishment of Psicose Synthesis Kinetic Model
In our design, the DTE process is one of the most significant parts in manufacturing psicose. The main process of psicose manufacture is catalyzed by D-psicose 3-epimerase. The models of device A, B, C and D are as follows.
In device A, extracellular concentration of $psicose$ is higher than the intracellular concentration, so it can enter the cells by diffusion. As a small molecular, the $psicose$ inside the cell can be combined with $pPsiR$ to generate $CCI$. $pPsiR$ is a repressor, which can bind to promoters on DNA and block gene expression. After binding with $psicode$,$pPsiR$ falls off from the promoter and the gene starts expressing, And eventually produce the produce $EGFP$.
For device A, the dynamic equations can be listed as follows:
Concentrations of $psicose$ are different inside"

50 mL bacterial suspension was cultured as described in “Expression of the mmo-construct”. The culture was diluted to OD600 4 and centrifuged and washed twice with 0,9 % saline solution. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 mL NMS-Medium. The methane measurement was performed in a modified anaerobic jar. Therefore, the solution was placed into the anaerobic jar and was treated with methane and compressed air in order to obtain an atmosphere with 2 % methane. The methane concentration was detected with an “MQ-4 Semiconductor Sensor“ for 10.000 sec. A converted anaerobic jar in combination with a methane sensor was used for measurements.

For the measurements, we used the sensor MQ-4 Semiconductor Sensor for Natural Gas by Henan Hanwei Electronics. Its function is based on SnO2 whose low conductivity rises with higher concentrations of combustible gases like methane or propane. This sensitivity for methane and its low costs made it perfect for our do it yourself methane measuring system. The data from the sensor were processed by a Sainsmart nano V3.0 device, a smaller variant of the Arduino board.

To get the right methane concentration for each experiment we used flow controllers to set up the respective flow rates for methane, air and carbon dioxide which were then conducted through the anaerobic jar for 10 minutes until a homogenous methane atmosphere was formed.

When the atmosphere needed was generated and all vents were closed the anaerobic jar was placed in an incubator set to correct temperature. For some experiments a magnetic stirrer was also placed in the incubator to keep the homogeneity of the culture and the atmosphere in the jar. The sensor was connected to the Arduino board which was then plugged into the PC outside the incubator via USB cable.

We used a modified version of the Serial Client programmed by Michael Osthege from iGEM Aachen converting the processed signal of the Arduino board into a visual graph and a exportable table file.   For the experiments, we filled the jar with a defined atmosphere of 2% methane in 98% air until the sensor displayed a stable methane concentration which was then set as 2%.The subsequently measured data were considered"
WashU,2010,Team:WashU#Splicing_-_-_TEXT.html," alternative splicing, a single RNA transcript can be spliced in alternative ways depending on the cellular environment, resulting in different mRNAs that can form different isoforms of the same protein. Thus, a single gene may code for a multitude of proteins.
There are several modes of alternative splicing. This project involves what is called Mutually Exclusive exons because the intron contains a stop codon. If the stop codon containing intron is expressed translation will cease before the second exon, preventing translation of sequences downstream of intron.
Splicing Machinery
Splicing is mediated by a large complex within the nucleus called the spliceosome.  The spliceosome is composed of many different proteins and five uradine rich snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleic proteins). Spliceosome formation is directed by several highly conserved sequences on the pre-mRNA.  The three major recognition sequences in S. cerevisiae are highly conserved and are the 5' splice site (N/GTATGT), the 3' splice site (TAG/N), and the branchpoint sequence (TACTAAC), where '/' represents an exon-intron boundary and the 'A' represents the catalytic adenosine at the branchpoint.
Spliceosome Mechanism
To accomplish splicing the spliceosome performs two precise, sequential transesterification reactions which cause the excision of the intron and joining of the two flanking exons.  The first reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the active adenosine of the branch point on the phosphodiester bond of the 5' splice site.  This leads to cleavage of the 5' splice site and formation of a lariate intermediate. The 3' OH of the of the 5' exon is then free to attack the 3' splice site.  This causes the two exons to join and the intron to be released.
Splicing in S. cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae was chosen as a model organism due to its widespread use in synthetic biology and its low amount of native splicing activity. The lack of abundant alternative splicing mechanisms in S. cerevisiae has prohibited the use of splicing as a synthetic biology tool.  Additionally the small amount of naturally occurring splicing activity helps to minimize interference with our synthetic mechanism.
When compared to other Eukaryotes splicing in S. cerevisiae is greatly diminished.  Genome wide analysis has shown only 3.8% of S. cerevisiae genes contain introns (Lopez et. al., 1999)"

Modelling of DVS efficiency on a lung tumour
Context
Non-small cell lung carcinoma, or NSCLC, is an aggressive cancer, with a relatively high speed growth. Treatments are often ineficient, because the tumor growth is faster than  the elimination by the drug.
Objective
We have decided to model our treatment efficacy for this kind of tumor. Therefore we have modelled the tumour progression, our treatment evolution and efficacy. The objective of the modelling is to verify if our treatment is able to eliminate the entire tumor.

Model segmentation
First, we had to recreate DVS complete mechanism and the tumor evolution. Then, for each step of the treatment, we have identified all the parameters that intervene, their actions and their interactions, in order to determine the model equations.
To simplifly the equation we have devided the mechanism and we have modelled each step separately.

Finally, the upper and lower slides are assembled, and then the liquid                         crystal is added.

DMOAP                         is used to induce vertical uniform orientation of liquid crystal molecules.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

Thermosensitive Regulator
Background
To sense the heat produced by ferritin, we need thermosensitive regulator. There are many ways for bacteria to sense and respond to temperature change. However, most signal transduction system that responds to sudden temperature changes takes not the temperature  itself but rather the consequences of temperature-induced damages[1].
The ferric oxohydroxide core in ferritin is structurally similar to the mineral ferrihydrite (γ-Fe2O3)[2], which is Superparamagnetic[3]. According to the work of Heng Huang et. al, Superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles can only generate local heat(Fig.1.), not the heat for whole cell[4]. So the consequences of temperature-induced damages are not obvious. Thus, direct only responses of regulator to temperature change could sense the heat produced by ferritin.
Taking all above into consideration, we tested RNA thermometers assembled with different promoters, and selected the best option. Also, we designed a Thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase, based on thermosensitive intein.
