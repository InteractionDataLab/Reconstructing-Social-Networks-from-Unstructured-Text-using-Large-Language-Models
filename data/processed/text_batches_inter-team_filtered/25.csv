Only through the survey could we learn that people think what is the most critical element of the biological heavy metal pollution treatment program. Also, with the help of questionnaires, it will be easier for us to consummate our  project
In addition to gathering public opinions, we also interviewed several experts and professors in the field and knew our project's advantages and disadvantages. One of our teammates, Fu Yao, interviewed John McGeary, the Associate professor of Brown University. Most of the advice he gave mentioned the safety part. For example,
We don’t always know every function of every gene, so if we release it into the wild to clean up heavy metal water pollution, there might be unanticipated consequences, there might be something that happen because of those changes in gene that we don’t know that is going to happen in the yeast.
One genetic variation has impact on multiple phenotypes. If we only focus on one phenotype, maybe there is another one we don’t know and it might cause different kinds of problems.
Whether it can be a good product to sell in the market or not depends on what happen on yeast afterward.
It is hard to imagine if the yeast captures the heavy metal and stores them, he is sure that there is a way to contain the contamination won’t spread any further.
Two big concerns of our project: what happens to those yeasts, and there are no other things that these genes are related to.
When we want to find other phenotypes of gene, we use reverse genetics (start with the gene, and we go through all the impacts that it has), but there are thousands of phenotypes so we have to test all of them. modal system is useful but not perfect (it cannot capture all human complexities), and it is hard to guess everything that might happen when we change one gene.
We also interviewed professors Zheng Lingling at the school of life sciences at Sun Yat-sen University She asked us what the yeast would end up like and what the absorption limit is. And she also advised us to test the conditions for yeast to survive in water, and compare our methods with the existing methods and so on. It is really helpful for us to improve our project and found our direction more easily.
Furthermore, we uploaded videos which we made to website, let more people know deeper about Biology from the videos. We went to our former middle school to taught students some knowledge about synthetic biology. We also introduced our project to them. A middle school student informed us about IGEM and indicated that he would like to participate in this competition next year. We applied for a club"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices#all_-_-_TEXT.html," the younger generation is fairly informed about the science progress and to encourage them to seek the knowledge on the field, our team spent several months on communication with the schools of Lithuania while paying visits and giving talks. This also provided us with a chance to raise awareness about phenylketonuria and other genetically inherited diseases among students. We were very happy to observe students’ interest in presented topics.
The aim of the school visits was to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to both students with the scientific and non-scientific profile. We organised the talks and discussions in 11 schools in 6 different cities of Lithuania. By the end of our presentations, we were asking students to fill in a short questionnaire. The question ‘Have you ever heard about synthetic biology before our presentation?’ held 65.42 % of negative responses and 34.58 % of positive responses. The results, that were quite opposite after the presentation, showed us that the effort we put into this particular outreach activity was significant.
As it was already mentioned, school visits provided a great opportunity to inform students about iGEM competition in hopes that some of them will get inspired and determined to take part in this competition in the future. A lot of them started following us on social media at once.
During these talks we were recalling the achievements of last year‘s team and introducing our ideas of this year‘s project. We explained to students what phenylketonuria is, what underlies this disease and what is the current treatment. The majority of students have never heard of this disease before. What caught their attention the most was the fact that there is no cure for this condition except for a low-protein diet which they have to follow throughout whole life. Children were inspired by our idea of creating an easier way to fight this disease. According to the questionnaire, some of the students even believed that it is possible to find a cure for cancer with the help of synthetic biology.
We have given talks to approximately 530 students of different age. Besides visiting 11 schools, iGEM team members were invited to organise and run a workshop during an annual event ‘Children’s University’. The topic of the workshop was ‘Create your own bacteria’ and was suited for children of 11 to 15 years old. There were roughly 50 children who attended the workshop, during which they were lectured about microorganisms, laboratory work and the ways scientists exploit their imagination to come up with the ideas of modified bacteria performing novel functions. After that, children were asked to create their own synthetic bacteria out of different art materials – coloured paper, pencils, etc. Students admired the workshop and"

In our STEP system, to improve the affinity of the VEGF-scFv to VEGF, we used Rosetta to help design our protein domain. However, we find that the initial version of VEGF-scFv in parts has no accepted structure in PDD (Protein Data Base). Thus, to improve the reliability of our results, we introduced a new kind of VEGF-scFv that has accepted structure in PDD to iGEM.
Figure 5. The structure of VEGF-scFv and the interface score of modified version of BBa_K2886002 compared with original version and BBa_K1694003. (a) VEGF-scFv is two outermost Ig-like domains of the antibody of VEGF joined together with a GS linker. (b) According to the interface scores which indicate the affinity of VEGF-scFv to VEGF of revised BBa_K2886002, original BBa_K2886002 and BBa_K1694003, we can draw the conclusion that revised BBa_K2886002 probably has a higher affinity to VEGF after our modification.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," organisms as a „cassis“. A variable frame where every biobrick can be introduced into the genome. (Gibson et al. 2008)
The protocell creation approach seeks to build a new organisms „de novo“ after the „bottom-up-approach”(Luisi et al. 2006). Unlike the two other approaches the protocell-creation is not guided by an archetype  (Boldt 2008).
These three approaches raise different ethical questions.
The ethical implications using the appellation of „living machines“ and „artificial cells“ will be elucidated. Focusing on the implicated hybrid-character of such designation, with regards of the relation between machines and living organisms and the deceptive idea of an “artificial cell”. Also  the acquaintance arising from the determination between “artificial cell/living machine” is illuminated.
The term “living machine“ - a hybrid between machine and living organisms
Machine originates from the Latin term „machina“ and means „tool, artificial equipment“ and is defined as „a piece of equipment with moving parts that is designed to do a particular job.[..]“ (Pons; Oxford dictionary 1884).
It follows that machines are designed for a particular purpose, according to the plans of humans and adopt a predetermined, defined and by itself immutable function. Machines are per definition not in the position to plan and conduct their behavior autonomically. They cannot change actions by themselves and can only operate in a certain way with the environment. Crucial characteristic for a machine is the autonomy but not the material, organic or inorganic (Deplazes 2011).
In contrast to the heteronomous machine stands life itself. The discussion about the concept of life in synthetic biology is a complex and wide-ranging field, where the difficulties of a definition lie just in the diversity of life. It is noteworthy that the researchers themselves are trying to find a suitable explanation, as it is an objective of synthetic biology to create new life (Deplazes / Huppenbauer 2009). Here is a brief description how researchers are trying to define life or alive.
After a minimal definition each organism is alive, which has an independent genome, has a cellular membrane structure and a sustainable and autonomous replication system (Endy 2005; Toepfer 2005).
The autopoiesis theory acts on a philosophical assumption when developing a concept of life. Living organisms differ from non-living organisms by"" [the fact that they are] the product of their organization […]. There is no separation between producer and product. Being and doing [of"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in the presence and absence of chloramphenicol. Absorbance measurements taken over time show the growth of the bacteria. Clear lag and log phases are observed when the bacteria are grown in SB media only. But as expected, the graph shows that the bacteria do not grow in the presence of chloramphenicol. This graph was use as a control to compare with device-containing bacteria in order to determine whether the genes we inserted caused an effect on cell growth.
Characterisation of Device 1
Growth Curve
Bacteria were grown which contained Device 1; their absorbance was monitored over time and then the rate of growth compared to bacteria that do not contain Device 1. The graph clearly shows that inserting Device 1 into cells considerably slows their growth in log phase compared with the growth of cells without Device 1, that the lag phase is shorter, and that the cells don't grow to as high an optical density in log phase as the bacteria without Device 1.
Membrane Stress
Investigation of literature regarding the action and regulation of the Cpx pathway lead to the discovery that the system as a whole responds to a large variety of membrane stresses, something that could be true of the specific promoter we chose to use (pCpxR). We therefore sought to investigate the response of our promoter to each individual membrane stress.
Individually many of the experiments produced erratic and seemingly random data which is listed independently below. However plotting all average readings together shows that there is a dramatic increase in response to the stress induced by the silica beads relative to all chemically induced membrane stresses tested.
This indicates that it would be possible to detect the presence of silica beads in solution, in principle, using our binding and detection system. This was certainly successful when silica beads were present at relatively high concentrations. However further work needs to be done to assess whether this high response remains across a range of silica bead concentrations in solution.
In light of these results, additional experiments were conducted to gain further information in which cells were exposed to the stresses of ethanol, Triton X-100 and pH gradients. In this second experiment, a robotic pipette was used to directly fill the 96 well plate to reduce human error, the raw data of which can be found here . Excluding wells with imposed pH gradient, all wells were kept at pH 7 using Tris.HCl buffer, the pH gradient was also achieved with a Tris.HCl buffer.
The 96 well plates (200 microliters/well), prepared with the chemical stressors, were inoculated with 20 microliters of overnight cell culture expressing Device "

Introduction
Toehold improvement
Conclusions
Introducton
During the development of CAT-Seq system we have had the idea and opportunity to adjust the system to not only record the activity information about Catalytic Biomolecules, but also assess regulatory parts and their interactions.
One type of regulatory parts we have decided to assess were the Toehold Switches.
The Toehold Switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the Switch and Trigger. The Switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. The Switch RNA forms a hairpin structure that includes the RBS site. While the hairpin structure is formed, the translation is inhibited. The Trigger RNA is a molecule that can selectively bind to the Switch RNA region and expose the gene RBS site for ribosomes. Once that happens, the protein translation can be initiated.
Toehold switch improvement
While designing the toehold sequence pairs we have noticed that there already is a highly similar toehold sequence in the form of a basic part ( BBa_K2486176 ). That said, even though we believe this part consists of a well working toehold switch, it is combined with Green Fluorescent Protein. Therefore, it is impossible to use this toehold switch with any other coding part a scientist or an engineer would like to control.
That is why we have re-designed this part to make it accessible for everyone to use it as a real basic part for translational control. First of all, the downstream GFP gene sequence was removed from BBa_K2486176 to liberate the Toehold riboregulator sequence from a particular gene and make it autonomous to any part. Next, autonomous toehold sequences face a fundamental design flaw - they require the translation of gene to continue from one biobrick to another. However, by joining biobricks scar DNA sequences, containing STOP codon TAG are"

However, YFP expression was silenced regardless of the binding site type present in the YFP expression constructs. With many control experiments and repeated tests, we thought the most possible reason could be that PUF recognizes sequences in the YFP gene (although the YFP sequences provided from the registry showed no PUF binding sites in silico ). Columns 1 and 2 are negative fluorescence controls while Columns 3, 4, 5, and 6 are positive fluorescence controls.
As a reference to our aformentioned experimental design predictions. The theoretical results chart is shown here again.
mCherry Fluorescence Data
In order to facilitate more reliable results, we also tested our constructs with the expression of an RFP, mCherry. If in the case that confounding factors influenced our results in our experiments using YFP, we could minimize inaccurate influences on our data by using a different reporter.
As of now, we are still running more mcherry experiments. The data showed some preliminary results.  The results confirmed our hypothesis that PUF-PIN don’t silence the gene from the control construct. This confirms our hypothesis that PUF-PIN doesn't silence the gene from the control construct.
Conclusion
The YFP fluorescence data has shown that the PUF-PIN domain has the ability to silence YFP expression. However, YFP expression was silenced regardless of the binding site type present in the YFP expression constructs. Assessing the specificity of PUF requires further experimental research. The mCherry data suggests that it is likely due to a problem with the YFP reporter, but due to the fact that there was no control binding site cloned into the mCherry expression construct, more experiments will be required for conclusive evidence. The specificity and customizability of our gene silencing through RNA scission both have extensive ongoing experiments.

Darned if You Do, Darned if You Don’t: The Cost of Indigenous Culture in Biotechnology
By: Lakaysha Blacksher
History
During the early fifteenth century, while most European countries were still reeling from the Black Death and successive wars, Portugal was on the brink of making a discovery. No, it was not the cure for the bubonic plague, nor was it the admission that the world is round. It was a different kind of discovery: Africa. At this point, credit (or blame) must be given; Henry the Navigator, king of Portugal, became famous for his funding of numerous expeditions to Africa that yielded gold and slaves. This is the start of the well-known Age of Exploration.
By the seventeenth century, Holland, England, France, and Spain had joined the slave trade, and their economies flourished—to the detriment of the entire African continent. Many of these conquests began as humanitarian and/or trade expeditions, with underlying motives. For example, the Kingdom of Benin, a kingdom in what is now Nigeria, had flourished from the 14th to 18th centuries. Their peak was during the 15th and 16th centuries, when they joined in the transatlantic trade. They sold slaves of rival kingdoms for “metals, salt, cloth, guns, and powder.”  However, they, too, were conquered.
Yet again, as if by some odd instant-replay of a competition, both Asia and the Americas, during the same time, were milked for resources by more powerful nations—again, to the detriment of the people. For centuries afterward, these countries in Africa, Asia, and Central/South America struggled to both gain independence and revive their lost culture.
It is only recently that some of these nations affected by colonialism, imperialism, and general cherry-picking of natural resources have been able to survive, and just barely so, without intervention. Unfortunately, the caveat emptor is the impending natural disasters all too frequent in tropical and arid climates.
After the “Scramble for Africa” in 1884 with the Berlin Conference until 1900, there were only two ‘free’ nations in Africa. The first, Liberia, a colony established by the United States for those who, during Reconstruction, wanted to go ‘back’ to Africa and"

As a result, the                         output signal of roGFP2-Orp1 has a more intuitive meaning and higher application value. (click here for more details)
Characterization and Measurement
Measure the response of roGFP2-Orp1 to H2O2
According to literature[1], roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein shows peak value                         at 405nm (oxidation peak) and 488nm (reduction peak). Fluorescence ratio R (R=I405 / I408) is                         uesed to the redox degree of roGFP2-Orp1. Therefore, we used different H2O2 concentrations (independent variable) to simulate the accumulation of ROS in cells and                         the fluorescence ratio (dependent variable) to characterize the redox degree of                         roGFP2-Orp1, which means that the increase of fluorescence ratio R shows roGFP2-Orp1 is                             oxidized and the decrease shows reduction.
Figure.2 Experimental Group
As Figure.2 shown, the fluorescence ratio R of roGFP2-Orp1 increases with the increase of H2O2 concentration. And the fluorescence ratio is basically unchanged when the concentration of H2O2 exceeds 0.8 mM.
Figure.3 Control Group
As Figure.3 shown, the fluorescence ratio of wide-type was not affected by the change of H2O2 concentration and remained unchanged.
Verify redox reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
Firstly, we made the cells almost be oxidation state by adding 1mM H2O2 and observed the change of fluorescence ratio R (dependent variable) with time (independent                         variable).
Figure.4 Verify Redox Reversibility of roGFP2-Orp1
As Figure.4 shown, the fluorescence ratio R decreased slightly in the range of 0 to 20 min,                         because cell itself has the mechanism of scavenging ROS and H2O2 will                         decompose spontaneously. At the 23 min, we added DTT (strong reducing agent) with the final                         concentration of 5mM. As a result, the fluorescence ratio R decreased significantly.
Therefore, the redox of our roGFP2-Orp1 is reversible.

By forming a glass-like matrix upon desiccation, TDPs protect cellular structures and proteins within the cells from degradation. As hydrophilic, disordered proteins, they can form dynamic scaffolds upon desiccation, while they have mutual repulsive interactions.
This matrix formation implies that during dehydration, the TDPs rearrange themselves around, in our case, Cas13a, in a process that could also be compared to phase separation. To simulate the dynamics of this phase separation, we decided to utilize a lattice model, which is well established for modelling these kinds of problems. With our model, we were able to determine which of the four TDPs CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 33020 and SAHS 68234 was most suitable for preserving Cas13a activity after drying and storage at room temperature. Additionally, we studied the TDP behaviour at different concentrations and estimated in what concentrations TDPs have to be used for drying.

Proteins in the lattice model
To keep our model simple, we wanted to take only next neighbour interactions on the lattice into account. Therefore, to be sure that no long-range interactions were neglected in the model, we calculated the Debye length, the length over which electrostatic interactions decline exponentially, with equation (debyelength)
$$\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 \cdot\epsilon_r \cdot k_B\cdot T}{2\cdot N_A\cdot e^2 \cdot I}}\tag{1}$$
where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant, $N_A$ the avogadro constant and I the ionic strength of the solution ( Russel and Saville 1989 ). With an electrolyte containing Tris-HCl (c = 27 mM) and NaCl (c = 24 mM), we found that the Debye length of the solution we were drying is 0.0024 nm. Since this length is smaller than the average size of an amino acid, we were free in selecting the grid size of the lattice model.
To effectively model protein-protein interactions, rather than interactions between individual amino acids, we decided to discretize our proteins into blocks of five amino acids per unit.
As it is not straightforward to manually derive a protein model using protein structure files, we wrote a program that converts the"

We also contacted iGEM HQ about the safety of our project if we were to use human waste to prove our concept.
Preetha began to discuss possible collaborations with our local TELUS Spark science centre, given that we now had a solid understanding of our project direction.
Lastly, we met with a representative of Calgary Labs in order to ask about what types of data are collected at city wastewater treatment plants and to request this data for our use.
The general guidelines and submission requirements for the Canadian iGEM Newsletter were sent out to the Canadian teams. We also sent out a form for all participating teams to fill out. This form served as confirmation for participation and allowed the teams to choose which issues they would be interested in participating in.
Week 9: June 26 - June 30
This week, two members of the team met the president of the University of Calgary, Dr. Cannon, to discuss the project’s progress.

A meeting was scheduled for next Thursday (July 6th) to meet with a team member from the McMaster iGEM team (Dhanyasri Maddiboina) who is currently in Calgary for an internship. Our goal for this meeting was to gain a deeper understanding of the McMaster team’s project, share details of our project, and discuss possible collaborations between the two teams. The students who agreed to represent iGEM Calgary at this meeting were Helen, Lalit, Preetha, and Maliyat.

It is assumed that an outside observer cannot measure these states directly, and therefore must rely on indirect measurements that are a produced by a separate output function. Stochastic variation can occur either during the state transition (process noise), or during measurement (measurement noise).

Estimation Steps:
A good general example for how the sequential bayesian filter functions is the kalman filter, which is commonly used to track simple linear systems. It consists of a two main steps: prediction and update. In the predict step, the system plugs the previous state and covariance estimate into a user-defined function and finds a new state and covariance estimate, called the a priori distribution. Then in the update step, this calculated state and the new measured state (likelihood distribution) are combined together through a weighted average to form the posterior distribution. The weights correspond to the covariances of each state, so that a measurement with a wide distribution (high variance) is trusted less than one with a very narrow distribution (low variance)
Figure 6: Depiction of the a priori, likelihood, and posterior distributions [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, Georgia Tech, 2018]
State Extension:
In order to modify this prediction system for use with parameters, we need to use the idea of state extension. This means treating each of our parameters as an additional state variable, whose predicted change each time step is 0. Just as the filter will converge on the most likely position of a robot, so too will it tend to converge on the most likely parameters that fit the model.
Extended Kalman Filter:
Our first attempt at parameter estimation used an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Unlike the normal Kalman filter, this filter is able to predict nonlinear dynamics. Therefore, instead of directly using our prediction function to update the distribution, we first had to linearize it. This process is similar to taking the tangent of a curve at a certain point, but in a higher dimensional space. Using the jacobian matrix of our reaction equations, we were able to construct a filter that could track moderately non-linear systems.
Despite its popularity, the Kalman filter does have its drawbacks. Firstly, it assumes a normal distribution, which may not always be the case in biological systems. Secondly, unlike the linear kalman filter, an Extended Kalman filter is not mathematically guaranteed to converge on correct estimates, especially when tracking highly non-linear systems. An intuitive way to reason why this error occurs is to think of a line tangent"

Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.

In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

A villager as well as a schoolmate of Shenzhen University from Hunan provided their village for us to test our product and we helped them kill cockroaches with the product.
Procedure
We customized 100 boxes according to the number of local residents, and then came to the village of Chenzhou City, Hunan Province with boxes and related supplies.
In the afternoon, we distributed all the boxes to the villagers, and instructed them on how to use and emphasized some things that should be paid attention to when using them. Then we told them that we would have a return visit in two days. They can tell us their feel and suggest some improvements to our box after using.
Feedback
On the third day, during the return visit, the villagers said that the box was very useful, but felt that the box was not very convenient to use, and it was not easy to operate when disassembling the dressing. The advice they gave us was to change the original height of the magnet to a screw-and-twist control, which is easier to operate and more robust. At the same time, they felt that only two ramps restricted the entry of the cymbal and should be changed to a circular shape. The base, so that 360 ° is a ramp, more convenient to enter.
After receiving their suggestions, we designed it again and uploaded it to application for more suggestions.
Conclusion
With applet, we can do more education and public engagement like Yueliangwan Primary School Education and Public Engagement in Hunan Province. Moreover, we can post more articles about iGEM and synthetic biology from our applet that offers a broader platform for the public to get close to us and join us.

Project description - Why biofilm printing?
Beneficial and detrimental biofilms form naturally in nature. Research on biofilms is twofold: One - preventing and removing detrimental biofilms, and two - exploiting beneficial biofilms.
- Beneficial biofilms are grown for water and wastewater treatment, bioremediation of contaminated soil (from gasoline, chemicals, oil, etc.), microbial extraction of natural resources, and for producing useful compounds or substances.
- Detrimental biofilm research aims to efficiently prevent and remove biofilms appearing in a multitude of contexts. They can affect installations and equipment in the industrial landscape, form in/on the human body (plaque, skin affections, bacterial layer on skin, lung bacterial biofilms, medical implants), form on medical devices and cause infections (catheters, medical equipment, wound dressings).
Industries affected by detrimental biofilms (4Inno.com)
Biofilms cause well over a billion dollars' worth of damage every year in industrial settings, affecting human health and companies' abilities to manufacture their products efficiently
CBE, Montana State University
How does printing biofilms help the industry and end-user clients?
With respect to the detrimental biofilms, Biolink binds together biofilms, forming 3D shapes on which removal products are tested. Printed biofilms are very reproducible, thus more similar to each other than grown biofilms, making biofilm removal results more reliable. Moreover, automation makes the biofilm formation process more controllable, thereby increasing efficiency of testing. In short, production costs decrease and product effectiveness increases.
On the client side, thorough testing of biofilm removal products increases their safety and reliability. People are interested in efficiently removing detrimental biofilms, but are equally (if not more) concerned of negative side effects that may appear. Moreover, cost advantage for production companies can translate in either lower prices for customers, or higher quality of products through re"

LivJKHMGF indicates medium after shaking overnight with E.coli DH5a contain corresponding overexpression vectors. The data of BL21 is not shown here since the data of different sets only owns tiny discrepency.
We try to explain these results, but we are not sure the following explanation reflects reality to what extent. To ascertain this question, there need more sophisticated investigation.
As we have mentioned before, liv JKHMGF are not resides on genome of Bl21. In addition, the leucine ABC transporter will not work if there is not other component expressed in cell. Thus, it can be understood that there are tiny discrepency among different sets of experiments in BL21.
For DH5a, Albeit the DH5a owns livJKHMGF in genome, the expressions of them are repressed by a regulator, Lrp (leucine-responsive regulator protein). According to the result of BLAST, Lrp not only resides on genome of DH5a but that of BL21. Lrp is a dual transcriptional regulator for at least 10% of the genes in Escherichia coli. These genes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism, nutrient transport, pili synthesis, and other cellular functions. It is believed that Lrp senses the presence of rich nutrition based on the concentration of leucine and positively regulates genes that function during famine and negatively regulates genes that function during a feast. Lrp-leucine DNA bingding transcriptional dual regulator inhibits livJ transcription initiation, whereas L-leucine binds to Lrp transcriptional dual regulator to block inhibition of livKHGMF.
As shows in figure 7, livJK seem do not increase uptake of leucine compared with 2101, livHM inhibit uptake of leucine compared with 2101 and livGF promote uptake of leucine dramatically, especially for livF. We can brace these six genes into 3 group, livJK, livHM and livGF, according to the result of spectrophotometer. Then we attempt to ascertain the inner relationship that brace these genes into the 3 group.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

At the Giant Jamboree, we received a gold medal and an Interlab Study Award. We also won the Overgrad Best Parts Collection.
Interlab Study
A key objective of synthetic biology is to accurately characterise biological components, so that they can be easily combined into new devices. Thorough characterisations of parts allow synthetic biologists to make accurate models that can predict the behavior of new biological systems. In order to characterise a part in detail, it is necessary to be able to perform reliable and reproducible measurements of its function, which is the main focus of the Measurement Track.
This year, iGEM has initiated a large Interlab Study , in which teams are encouraged to participate by measuring fluorescence from GFP expressed from different promoters of the Anderson library .
The aim of the Interlab Study is to shed light on the comparability between measurements performed in different laboratories and by different people, i.e. to investigate the variability in measurements of the same constructs across laboratories.
As participants in the Measurements Track we were required to participate in the Interlab Study. Since our laboratory project is focused on developing a new method for measuring promoter activities we felt that the efforts required for the Interlab Study were well in line with the overall aim of our project. Thus we decided to not only measure the three mandatory constructs, but to construct plasmids with all the promoters in the Anderson library and measure the fluorescence from all of them.
Furthermore we wanted to measure fluorescence at a single-cell level to explore the cell-to-cell variation in fluorescence with the different promoters. Particularly we were interested in measuring the fraction of cells showing negligible fluorescence and seeing whether this fraction was dependent on the strength of the promoter.

During the summer, iGEM teams from across Japan attended a meetup held by Tokyo Tech University. KAIT, Bochan lab, Gifu University, Tokyo Tech, and ASIJ. Our team presented, along with the other teams, the progress we have made throughout the year. After each presentation, we had a QnA where many good suggestions were made, which everybody followed up on after all the presentations over snacks. Our team received a helpful suggestion from the Tokyo Tech and Gifu team about the use of a histidine tag to simplify and speed up the protein purification process, also making a more accurate result."

He makes his own microscopes by methods that would have been available to van Leeuwenhoek.  Using of one of Loncke’s facsimiles, Lesley Robertson has spent many hours trying to repeat Van Leeuwenhoek’s experiments, and  photographing and filming the results.
Many film fragments, photos, different light sources, an set-up spanning over 300 years and lots of patience has led to fascinating results. We are very grateful that we are allowed to show the following three movies, illustrating what Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek saw 300 years ago.
The movie below shows a clump of Vorticella feeding on bacteria. The animals are attached to sediment particles by their spring-like stalks which extend when the animal is ready to feed. When the mouth opens, the cilia around it can be seen beating to generate a vortex that traps the prey (usually bacteria) and carries it into the mouth for digestion.
The second movie, see below, shows an unknown worm that appeared during filming intended to prove that van Leeuwenhoek could work with a single candle for illumination. Protozoa can be seen swimming around the algae in the background.

Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," an appropriate measure. As a result we made an effort to include intuitive information about our project in every presentation afterwards.
Our conversation also touched upon FDA regulation. We learned that how you classify a technology has great impact on both the procedures for government approval and the public perception. For example, there are completely different branches of the FDA that deal with biological technologies vs drugs vs medical devices. Classifying our system as a probiotic, for example ( if CUTSCENE transformed E.Coli were used to record chemical concentrations in the gut), might mean less restrictions and requirements initially. However, this “obscuring” of the full details of our product could lead to public backlash. Keeping this in mind, we decided to pursue a more research-tool oriented approach for our system until the regulations behind CRISPR applications were established in public policy. This perspective was one of the key reasons behind our decision to use blue light mediated promoters and repressors in our system: this signal type is much more suited to a lab or industrial application than a medical one.

Dr. W. Seth Childers is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Childers teaches a course on Synthetic Biology which encouraged us to reach out. He was able to give us applications for our project, the main one being quorum sensing. He also provided an important consideration that shaped the way we approached our project which was to analyze the efficiency of our CRISPR Cas9 system. In particular, we discussed how many applications, ranging from pollutant recording to cancer detection, needed temporal resolution on the order of hours rather than days. He recommended looking into bacterial replication rate as a means for increasing base editing, which led directly to our dilution experiments. As a result, our CUTSCENE system applications have the potential to be greatly expanded. Lastly, Dr. Childers was able to suggest other individuals he knows in the synthetic biology field that we would be able to discuss with.

Life Science and Beyond Conference  - Outreach to aspiring students in academia. 
Life Science and Beyond is an annual conference organized by the Society for Biological Engineering ( SBE ) at Technical University of Denmark. The aim of the conference is to promote different life science activities, helping in the organisation of reasonable study plans and sharing a variety of experience between students.
The program of the event attracted over 100 curious students from Bachelor as well as Master degree programs with different biological and biotechnological backgrounds. As the event was held in the main library of the university, many other students got involved in discussions on different stands and during the final dinner.
One of the most popular stands was our iGEM stand, where our team was able to share knowledge on synthetic biology and its applications. We familiarised others with the idea of iGEM, focusing on open-sourcing, collaboration between people with different backgrounds and creating Biobricks. To increase the attraction of our stand, make people read our posters and talk to us, we prepared a  quiz about the iGEM competition as well as synthetic biology with some awards! After a few hours our hands were full of correctly filled-in questionnaires!
We can say with certainty that this event was a success, as many of the participants showed great enthusiasm and interest in joining the next iGEM 2016 competition as well as focusing on topics related to synthetic biology during their studies.
Becoming a Blue Dot Project  - Placing iGEM on the university profile. 
After a lot of work our team has been accepted as an official Blue Dot Project at the Technical University of Denmark. This gesture infers that our university recognize the efforts, we, students put into the iGEM competition. This benefit the outreach potential of the iGEM idea to fellow students and raise awareness in the academic landscape. The increased focus on the iGEM competition promote the interest in participation increasing the academic level of selected participants of future teams.
“The name ’Blue Dot’ refers to the Earth, which - although it is huge - looks like a small blue dot when viewed from space.

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"5. After considering all the feedback we received from experts in the field of wastewater treatment management, we decided that the point of implementation of Biotic Blue will be right before the biological stage.
Figure 5. Integration of Biotic Blue in the wastewater treatment process. (The top part of the illustration i.e. the main treatment process, is a redesign from Natuvardverket: Wastewater in Sweden 2016 [20].
Since radical changes in WWTP infrastructure are impractical and highly costly, implementation of Biotic Blue was designed to be compatible with the existing equipment and practices. More specifically, its implementation as an additional step before the flow of the sewage to the biological treatment can be materialized by deploying in essence, an extra water tank, a magnet, a collection chamber and a pump. An integrated aeration system would need to be added to the water tank, which will bear the wastewater with the magnetic beads as well, in order to adequately secure mixing conditions. Therefore, with air bubbles spurt from the bottom of the tank, the possibilities for the enzyme-substance reactions to take place increase, and the precipitation of the magnetic beads is avoided. Besides, continuous supply of oxygen to the laccase is essential for its activity, and the aeration system provides it in a constant manner. The magnet that would be used needs to have an elliptical shape and its strength needs to be sufficient to attract and separate the magnetic beads from the water. It is important to highlight that the pipes bearing the wastewater along with the beads after the tank, would be Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes. Unlike steel and iron, materials commonly used for water pipes, PVC (plastic polymer) has low magnetic permeability and, therefore, does not have any magnetic shielding properties. Due to the strong ferromagnetic properties of the beads and the smart structure of the magnet and pipe setting, the beads separation process would be smooth and continuous, as it is illustrated in Figure 5. The collection chamber in which the magnetic beads will end up after their separation from the water needs to have an inlet for the washing buffer used for the recovering of the enzymes before their re-use. Finally, the chamber will be connected with a pump transferring the recovered beads to the initial water tank. It must be highlighted that the proposed closed system is modular and it can function in fully automatic mode.
Below, in Figure 6 our 3D printed prototype is displayed. Note that the prototype does not bear all the features of the implementation of Biotic Blue as it was developed due to time requirements before its design reached the current state.

Fundraising
Fundraisers were a great way to talk to the public about our project and the problems we were trying to solve with our improved fluoride riboswitch. We hosted many fundraisers at the Chapel Hill Public Library, band and orchestra concerts, crowdfunding platforms, and at the Raleigh Museum of Natural Sciences. People aren’t going to donate money to a club they know nothing about, so it was our job to effectively present the research behind fluoride toxicity, the mechanism of the fluoride riboswitch in E. coli, and the logistics of the iGEM competition. We knew that most of the public is not fluent in scientific jargon, so we found ways to boil down the science we were doing at the Kuhlman lab to simple terms that could easily be understood by everybody. However, some of the people we talked with were scientists and researchers at local universities such as Duke University and UNC - Chapel Hill, which subsequently led to deeper and more stimulating conversations about science.
This is our poster board that we presented to the public.
This is our crowd-funding website where many people all over the state supported our project and iGEM!

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," experiment relies on the hypothesis that we will be able to detect selectively our E. coli strain when plating a sample taken from our tested environments on MacConkey plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. We therefore needed to test this hypothesis and verify that the natural microorganisms found in our environment samples would grow or not on our selective plates. We also decided to grow our samples on LB medium as this medium is very rich and allows the growth of many microorganisms. We wanted to see if there was a difference with the MacConkey (MCK) medium, and if we could see the growth of the natural ""inhabitants"" of our samples.
We chose to analyze the soil, seawater and freshwater samples. We prepared 5 dilutions (10-2 to 10-6) of a sample of our natural environment and plated 100 µl on the following media:
LB
LB + Spectinomycin (Spectino : 100ng/μL)
LB + Tetracycline (Tetra : 10ng/μL)
LB + Chloramphenicol (Cm : 20ng/μL)
MCK
MCK + Spectinomycin  (Spectino : 100ng/μL)
MCK + Tetracyclin (Tetra : 10ng/μL)
MCK + Chloramphenicol (Cm : 20ng/μL)
We next incubated the plates overnight at 37°C and observed them the following day.
For the soil experiment Figure 2.1 , we observed the growth of microorganisms on LB medium for the 10-2 dilution. These micro-organisms, however, appear to be sensitive to three antibiotics tested (chloramphenicol, spectinomycin and tetracycline). They are also unable to grow on the MacConkey medium. No growth of micro-organisms was observed when samples of freshwater Figure 2.2 or sea water Figure 2.3 were plated on either LB or MacConkey media.  This may have been expected for the seawater medium, as micro-organisms from this environment may require high salt media for growth.
protocol pre-test survival of E. coli
On the whole, we did not observe growth of “natural” microorganisms on the MacConkey + antibiotics plates, demonstrating that in the conditions tested, the only micro-organisms that we should observed are our specific lab bacteria strains.

Bordeaux
We decided to collaborate with the Bordeaux iGEM team because of the strong parallels between our projects. We were both trying to use cellulose to produce an industrially useful platform molecule (2,5-Furandicarboxyclic acid, in their case). With such strong similarities, we felt we would have a lot to discuss about the ethical considerations of our projects.
The collaboration began when David, from Bordeaux, sent our team a Facebook message. Over the next weeks we had skype sessions until it was eventually decided that we would visit them in Bordeaux in late August. They would present the extensive research they had done about the ethics of GMOs and the use of non-edible biomass. In return, we would use the expertise of the chemists on our team and university to improve their protocols and to teach them how to effectively use an HPLC machine.
The Groningen team took a plane to Bordeaux from Schiphol Amsterdam on Friday the 24th of August. Upon arrival we were picked up by David who drove us to the Chateau (Castle) d’Eck where two of us would be sleeping throughout our stay and the conference would take place. The two other members of our team would sleep with David at a typical French student residence. After dropping off our luggage, David took us to a restaurant where we met a few more members of the Bordeaux team. We got to know each other and discuss our projects more inform"

Abstract
The main focus of our project was to create the constructs and purification methods necessary to produce and isolate the restriction enzyme EcoRI. EcoRI is commonly used for research and is one of the primary restriction endonucleases used in the Biobrick standard. Synthesizing a plasmid containing the gene for EcoRI and producing a simple purification method would provide a cheaper option for obtaining the enzyme.
Background Information
Bacteria lack an immune system so rely on restriction-modification (R-M) systems for defense against foreign viruses. The first enzyme involved in the system is the restriction endonuclease (REase). It is specific to a single DNA sequence that is typically four to eight nucleotides in length and is usually palindromic. When the REase recognizes this sequence, it will cleave both strands of the DNA at the backbone, resulting in “blunt” or “sticky” ends, depending on the exact function of the specific enzyme. When a bacterial cell is infected by a virus, the REase will bind to and cut its recognition sequence if present in the virus DNA; thereby, hindering or stopping the effects of the virus on the host. But this process is not specific to host or virus DNA.
To protect their own genetic information, bacterial cells also produce a methyltransferase (MTase). This enzyme is specific to the same site as its corresponding REase, but instead of cutting the DNA at this site, it tags the DNA with a methyl group, which sterically inhibits the binding of the REase. In type I R-M systems, the REase and MTase are apart of a single enzyme whereas in the simpler, type II system, they are found as two individual enzymes. When isolated, the REase from a type II system can be used independently of the methylase to digest DNA for analysis and synthesis making these enzymes a valuable tool in synthetic biology.
General Considerations
In order to produce restriction enzymes in vivo, it is necessary to protect the host DNA from auto-restriction and cell death"

Introduction
After we had decided on Evobodies for our project in April, we quickly learned the difficulty              of explaining our plans to others. Because binding proteins have major impacts on public life e.g. in pregnancy tests,             we decided to spent a lot of time on elaborating new ways to explain and communicate Evobodies and synthetic biology             with non-scientific people as well as with experts from              other fields. In our opinion, a scientifically well executed              project is equally important as the associated dialogue between scientists and the public. Without public approval a well executed synthetic biology project is not practical. The more we spoke             with people not related to science, the more we learned how difficult it is to understand what white coated people do behind the             closed laboratory doors. To breach this barrier, we engaged on the following different frontiers. Additionally, we were getting in close contact with scientists who would give us important              information and interesting feedback on our project. These two different aspects aimed towardsimproving our project on a scintific level and connect the publicity with scientific research to cross boundaries and open hypothetical lab doors.

Uptake was measured using α32-labeled nucleotides. While isoform 1 (Figure 2A) can transport adenosine mono-, di- and triphosphates, isoform 2 (Figure 2B) shows a specificity for nucleoside triphosphates. The fact that PtNTT2 can accept a broad range of different nucleotides makes the transporter interesting for the transport of unnatural nucleotides, as long as they are provided as nucleoside triphosphates.
Figure 3: Subcellular localization of PtNTT1 and PtNTT2 in Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Ast et al., 2009). PtNTT1 and PtNTT2 were fused to GFP to study the subcellular localization.
Zhang et al. 2017 integrated PtNTT2 into the chromosome of E. coli BL21(DE3) under control of the lacUV5 promoter. To demonstrate its feasibility for the uptake of nucleotides, uptake of [α-32P]-dATP was measured. The native sequence of PtNTT2 features an N-terminal signal sequence directing the subcellular localization to the plastid membrane. In E. coli, this signal sequence is likely to be retained, leading to a growth defect in cells expressing the native PtNTT2 transporter. Therefore, a truncated version of PtNTT2, PtNTT2(66-575), was used. The chromosomally integrated, truncated, and codon optimized PtNTT2 (65-575) under control of PlacUV5 was shown to be an optimal compromise between efficient uptake and the growth limitation resulting from expression of the heterologous protein (Zhang et al., 2017).
Figure 4: Uptake of α32labeled ATP by the different versions of PtNTT2 (Zhang et al., 2017).
The expression of PtNTT2 was investigated in different strains, under control of different promotors, and plasmid-bound as well as integrated into the chromosome. In their final design, Zhang and colleagues integrated PtNTT2 chromosomally in E.coli BL21(DE3) under control of the lacUV5 promoter
For our experiments, we decided to use PtNTT2 to facilitate the transport of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates into the cell. Therefore, our plan is to construct"

Background
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a new tool that has tremendous power for the future of bioengineering and synthetic biology. A number of projects have successfully harnessed this technology in applications spanning both gene expression manipulation and DNA detection. While historically DNA detection has been carried out via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, the specificity and adaptability of the Cas9 protein to selectively target DNA has opened the window to a new and streamlined strategy for detecting the presence of DNA fragments in vivo.
The 2015 Peking University iGEM team designed a split luciferase dual-dCas9 system that effectively targets fragments of DNA [1]. In their system, two dCas9s simultaneously bind different but neighboring sections of the target DNA, and in doing so bring together two halves of a luciferase molecule for visible detection. This project was successfully executed and optimized to reliably and adaptably detect DNA.
Our project builds on this dual dCas9 system by using a transcriptional-based reporter system. Instead of split luciferase as an indicator, in our system the proximity of dCas9 binding brings together a larger protein complex (adapted from the yeast two-hybrid system) and initiates transcription of red fluorescent protein (RFP). While this initial design accomplishes a similar goal to the 2015 Peking project, the key difference is in the adaptability of transcriptional activation as a reporter—instead of luminescence as the sole output of the system, our system can be expanded beyond detection by exchanging the RFP output for other relevant proteins for applications [hyperlink to applications] in targeted therapeutics, bacterial strain engineering, and beyond.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Optimisation Considerations: Engineering a Biosensor
Scalability
The initial prototype or production of this biosensor must be easily scaled up for widespread use over time. Key factors to consider include the upscaling of cells required to produce the mechanism required. Bioreactor sizing is crucial, and having successive reactor tanks of increasing size will allow for a large batch of cells to be grown under optimal conditions in order to meet a larger scale production requirement.  The technology should also consider scale of application. This technology has potential uses for an individual consumer at a household level as well as industrial or quality assurance applications for large produce players all the way up the supply chain. By designing a biosensor that can take many forms, a wide scale of users can be catered for.
Selectivity and specificity
Selectivity refers to the competition of various molecules to a receptor, whilst specificity refers to the unique activation of a receptor by a certain molecule, and they go hand-in-hand in biosensor design. Many sensing devices do not respond to one sole molecule, but rather to a feature of that molecule. For example, a common infrared carbon monoxide sensor operates on the function that doubled-bonded carbons absorb energy of a particular wavelength. It would, however, pick up a signal from other compounds that also contain a double bond attached to a carbon (Sberveglieri 2012). Other sensors may instead be specific to a metabolite of a molecule of interest rather than the molecule itself, or having competing selectivity to multiple compounds of a similar physical structure. The sensitivity and specificity of a biosensor is one of the pillars of its characterisation.
Recyclability
Waste is another particularly critical parameter to take into account during the biosensor design process. Following our discussions with OzHarvest, creating something disposable but not biodegradable would be irresponsible from an environmental point of view. Recyclability or biodegradability allow for a better reception of our final product, which is a positive for the synthetic biology movement as a whole. Given that one of the driving motives behind our biosensor is to minimise produce wastage, it would be even more redundant to create a wasteful product.
Sensitivity
Whilst sensitivity is inherently important in any sensor, talks with Zespri Kiwifruits enlightened us on exactly how important sensitivity is in the case of our biosensor. For kiwifruit in particular, coolstore ethylene levels must be less than 30ppb. Currently all chemical sensing devices with the exception of a gas chromatographer fail to detect ethylene at a concentration less than"

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#outreach#interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," hardest hit countries by Panama disease. How would you describe the situation? What kind of losses does it cause?
""Well, here in Mindanao, one of the largest islands and where commercial banana plantations are, Fusarium is wherever banana plants are.  We are implementing very strict quarantine measures, especially with commercial plantations, which cover up to thousands of hectares. As for losses, I cannot give you a figure, but some farms can lose a significant part of their production. Some areas are even being abandoned now because of the disease. Panama disease is definitely one of the big problems in the industry now. They describe it as a silent killer of banana.""
Apart from quarantine measures, what else is done to fight Panama disease?
""We don’t know yet what the best solution is! Putting chemicals in the soils to control it is, I think, not an option and never will be. But one of the things that are done is strict controls when entering and leaving the plantation, you have to step on disinfectants. The same is done with vehicles.  The problem is that small scale farmers do not follow this so religiously, so Fusarium keeps spreading. Farmers also practice rice hull burning. They surround banana plants with rice hull and burn them for days. The idea is that the soil will get so hot all of the Fusarium will die, but there is no proof that this is effective, and it might even help it spread! Fusarium is already hard to kill, and perhaps they are only eliminating it from the upper layers of the soil, but farmers don’t really have much of a choice, since there is nothing available that is really effective.""
Are there any alternative solutions that you consider promising?
""Some companies sell disinfectants or sort of a vaccine for the plants, but so far there is no product scientifically proven to be effective.""
How fast do you think Panama disease will spread to new areas?
""That’s a hard question to answer, but it depends on the people being vigilant, quarantine measures, etc.""
And now, regarding our project. Our plan is to use a genetically modified organism in the soil.  How do you think the Filipino public would react?
""The Philippines is a country that is more or less  open to GMO-based products, in fact we are one of the biggest consumers of GM corn. I think they would accept it, and I have heard from farmers that they would even accept a GMO banana that is resistant to Fusarium. Of course, there would also be some opposition.""
And do you think it would fit with Filipino regulations?
""With the importance of bananas in our economy, I think that"

ADTZ, which is also called aﬂatoxin oxidase (AFO) , is the ﬁrst enzyme identiﬁed as able to degrade AFB1. It can be isolated from intracellular extracts and show a strong affinity with AFB1. As a potential degradation enzyme candidate in our project, we will induce it by our Detection Subsystem and regulate its expression.
Concerning the effectiveness of our project, we will preliminarily take Saccharomyces cerevisiae as our chassis. As a completed cellular device, we hope our modified strain can automatic feel aflatoxins from environment and begin to express relative degradation enzyme to keep there non-toxic, ensuring a healthy condition to human beings.

Cells were characterised in 12-well-plates in this experiment, and each sample was measured in triplicates. An example of a setup is shown below.

Characterizing under Blue Light
Persistent Light On and Light Off
In this experiment, one setup was incubated under persistent blue light for 8 hours, while another setup was incubated in the dark (covered with black cloth) for the same duration.
Figure 3. Change in RFP/OD over 8 hours in the dark (a) and under blue light (b).
Our data suggests that using RFP solely as a reporter is unable to reflect the expected induction and repression activities of the promoter. As seen from Figures 3a and b, fluorescence decreased over the period of 0 to 4 hours in the dark, and increased over the period of 4 to 8 hours under blue light. This is completely opposite of what we expected. We speculated that this phenomenon is due to the mismatch in the rate of increase in OD600 and the degradation rate of RFP. Hence, to alter the degradation rate of RFP, we attached 2 different degradation tags to it, YbaQ and DAS. Degradation tags are also referred to as degrons. They are either part of coding regions, or are added to them to direct their degradation by proteases.
Experimental results show that RFP attached to YbaQ could reflect the expected induction and repression activities of PBLrep. As shown in Figure 3a, RFP/OD increased steadily with time in the dark, where repression is absent, while in Figure 3b, we can see that RFP/OD decreased exponentially with time under blue light. The high intial RFP/OD at 0 hour in Figure 3a can be explained by the low initial OD600 (0.05) and the presence of RFP in the system prior to the commencement of the experiment.

UT-Tokyo,2012,Team:UT-Tokyo-Software#Project#BioBrickSearch_-_-_TEXT.html,"3. User-Experience
In designing the BioBrick Search software, we saw to it that users can intuitively and comfortably use this tool. We took advantage of the latest technologies of dynamic web applications and realized a smooth workflow without page transitions.
Results
We submitted a community post regarding this tool in the iGEM 2012 community page ( https://2012.igem.org/Community ) in August, after we finished developing this tool. After we made this tool publicly available, we got 357 accesses from 16 different countries and users, who in general gave us favorable responses. One of the feedbacks we received said they took into account the ""reliability"" score to determine which BioBrick part to use.
Future Works
iOS / Android support
Due to the incompatibility with a library we utilized, BioBrick Search cannot currently be used on iOS / Android devices. As the library's source code is published, it might be possible to work around this issue by modifying the code.
Synchronization of data with partsregistry.org
To achieve a realistic response time, BioBrick Search uses off-line data downloaded from the partsregistry.org at a specific time. On partsregistry.org, new parts are added and the existing data is updated every year. The current approach requires us to re-obtain the updated parts in order to keep up with the latest partsregistry.org database. Direct access to the partsregistry.org database or a new API that enables users to retrieve information added since the last download is desired.

Experimental Procedure
1 September 2010
1.Once the ligations of LovTAP with promoters were confimed, digest them with EcoRI and PstI in order to fuse them to backbones pSB3K3 and pSB1C3.
2.Isolate and digest the plasmids Psb3k3 and psb1c3 with EcoRI and PstI, in order to remove the RFP gene.
3 September 2010.
3.Once the plasmids are correctly digested with the enzymes EcoRI and PstI,  started the dephosphatation reaction in order to prepare them for ligation with promoters-LovTAP. 4. Prepare the ligation mixture taking into account the quantity of the DNA insert -LovTAP- and the receiver DNA -plasmids harboring the promoters-.  5. Incubate the sample at 16°C overnight.  6. Transform the cells. Click here for the protocol.  7. Culture the cells in the proper selective medium. 8. Incubate the petri dishes at 37°C overnight.  9. Re-culture the resultant colonies in the proper selective medium; incubate them at 37°C overnight.
8 – 11 September 2010.
10. Analyze the colonies with Colony PCR to confirm that they contain the correct ligation  Primers:  Forward (5'->3'): Preffix primer.  Reverse:(5'->3'): Suffix primer.
14-29  September 2010.
11.  Use SalI restriction enzyme, in order to confirm LovTAP ligations, because there is a recognition site for that enzyme inside LovTAP coding region, approximately at the middle of the gene. The SalI recognition site is not present in RFP gene nor in plasmids pSB3K3/pSB1C3. So that cutting with this enzyme, LovTAP ligations will be confirmed as true positives (the insert is LovTAP and not RFP gene).
The constructions of LovTAP with promoters were correctly transfered to pSB1C3 and pSB3K3 backbones.

The countdown to the finals is coming. In order to better improve the late events and advance the simulation finals, we participated in the 5th CCIC held by Shanghai University of Science and Technology. As the first demonstration team, we introduced our experimental program and project progress to other teams, which not only attracted attention, but also been discussed. Meanwhile we received many suggestions from other iGEMers. We communicated with each other, shared ideas and literature, and reached a lot of collaboration and HP cooperation. Members of other teams suggested that we should verify the efficiency of enzymes many times, improve detection sensitivity and consider practical applications. At the same time, after seeing our poster, other iGEMers put forward many suggestions for aesthetics and typesetting. Our team also improved on the issues raised by the CCIC, adding a number of experiments to verify             the feasibility of our project, and the unceasing progress of the project gives us confidence in its success.
Consulting the Antibiotic Company
Foundational science can be difficult for non-specialists to understand and engage with. Therefore, in order to get the views of the practical application professionals on the project, and to obtain the relevant hadoop support, we went to China's largest antibiotic production—North China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (NCPC). Under their leadership, we visited factories dealing with antibiotic wastewater, studied the mechanism of waste residue treatment, learned that the discharge standards of all antibiotic wastewater in the world are getting higher and higher, and even China is about to introduce a more stringent discharge management mechanism. In this regard, as a pharmaceutical enterprise, North China Pharmaceutical Group hopes that our project can achieve practical             application level, truly help small and medium-sized enterprises and the people.

Social Engagement
We are willing to introduce the advanced science to the public. Therefore, we went to a community near our campus, Shangdeyuan Housing Estate, and organized a workshop.             People aged ranging 4 to 65 engaged our events and workshops to know more about synthetic biology.
The residents showed their curiosity about what synthetic biology is. Therefore, we introduce biosynthetic products and some commonly used antibiotic drugs around us. Although they are new to synthetic             biology, they also"

The simulation generates random moves and calculates the energy difference between the new and old chain conformation. As stated earlier, only nearest neighbour interactions are taken into account for this.
We employ the metropolis monte carlo algorithm in the simulation, accepting and rejecting moves with a probability of:
This prevents the system from falling into a local energy minimum, because it allows moves with unfavourable interactions. The probability of accepting unfavourable interactions decreases exponentially for interaction energies higher than the system’s energy. The value of

Results
With our lattice model, we wanted to study the interactions between TDPs and Cas13a upon drying. For this purpose, we first had to assess if the model we were using was suitable for modelling protein interactions. Afterwards, we investigated which TDP would confer desiccation tolerance to Cas13a the best, and at which concentration we should use our TDPs.
Modelling General Protein Interactions
In our lattice model, we convert the hydrophobicity and charge compatibility indices established by Biro 2006 . We tested if the generated energy values had the expected impact on the protein behaviour, by running the model without any favourable interactions, by generating only positive energy values (0-20), and with exclusively favourable interactions, by generating only negative energy values (-20-0) between the chains. By observing the behaviour of the chains after a given number of iterations, we confirmed that the model can provide information on the behaviour of polymers in solution.
In Figure 7 below, the polymer arrangement does not change significantly over 50000 iterations. While the chains have changed positions and it is clear that movements were generated, the conformations and the localization over the environment are similar. On the other hand, Figure 8 clearly shows a clustering of chains after the same amount of iterations, which would"

Monday
First day of offical work in the lab! I'm extremely excited for the next 4 months! Last night I inoculated numerous tubes containing 5 mL of LB media with cells from our glycerol stock in HJ's -80oC. The plasmid DNA was extracted from these cells using the QIAGEN spin column method. The purified plasmid DNA was analyzed and quantified using agarose gel electrophoresis. These DNA will be used for assemblies in the coming days.
I inoculated  4 2L flasks containing LB media with cells hosting biobrick plasmids. Tomorrow I plan to use a QIAGEN maxiprep protocol to obtain large amounts of these plasmids.
I finished the day organizing and cleaning the lab in preparation for this years volunteers to arrive. I've got two weeks to get the lab running, then they're here!
Tuesday
Our lab has received Maxiprep spin columns from BIOBASIC. Today I attempted to Maxiprep pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1T3, and pSB1K3 for use this summer. After completing the protocol the samples were analyzed on an agarose gel, revealing little to no DNA. The columns won't be used again.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production"

General Overview
Apart from genetic engineering development, iGEM values each research program’s impact on the society. To expand our social influence, CIEI-BJ actively communicates with high schools, universities, food production companies and academic institutions. Our human practice is divided into four sections: learn from former iGEMers, integrated human practices, public engagement and education. From various events, we have deepened our understanding of the goal and significance of our project.
These precious experiences not only broaden the team member’s understanding in biology, but also reveal the project’s positive impact on raising public awareness and contribution to synthetic biological study.
Learn from Former iGEMers
At the early stage of our project, former iGEMer Bowen Xiao and several former iGEMers from Beijing Institute of Technology helped us have a deep understanding of the requirements and spirits of iGEM through our meetings. They also shared their valuable experience with us, such as time allocation during the whole project and how to avoid missing any deadline. From this process we also learned our responsibility as iGEMers.

On September 7th, we visited Professor Shi Guoqing of the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USCB) for an interview about his research project. His team invented a sensor for detecting aflatoxin B1 (AFT-B1).
From our talk with Professor Shi, we felt the possibility and significance of a detection system that can detect and degrade AFT-BI at the same time.
The sensor system developed by Professor Shi’s team does not require any advanced equipment and is fast, convenient, and sensitive. This has inspired us to improve on our own detection system’s speed and efficiency.

Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work.
Experimental design
Verification of peroxisomal protein import was performed  by tagging the fluorescent protein mTurquoise with our designed PTS variants. Additionally, a peroxisomal membrane protein was used to ensure peroxisomal localization. For that reason, we chose the transmembrane domain of Pex13 tagged with the fluorescent protein mRuby.
Pex13−mRuby
We used the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13 as a fluorescent marker − by just using the transmembrane domain of Pex13 with a short linker, we make sure that it has no influence on the peroxisomal features. To obtain a higher differentiation from mTurquoise, which we use for another construct, we chose to work with mRuby. Literature research revealed that such constructs have been tested before − Erdmann et al. (2004) described a construct containing only PEX13200-310 with a C-terminal GFP.
Figure 1.3: PEX13 construct with C-terminal mRuby.
Pex5 variant
In order to achieve an orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery we used a Pex5 knockout yeast strain in which we transformed our artificial  Pex5 variant containing a modified PTS1 binding pocket. Our variation facilitates the detection of a non native PTS1 variant instead of the wild type PTS1. The construct contains a medium strength promotor, the Pex5 gene and a terminator. The remaining plasmid parts can be seen in the plasmid map below.
Figure 1.4: Pex5 gene variant.
mTurquoise−PTS
Our approach for import verification is based on the fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with our modeled PTS variants. After several promotor tests with different strengths, we decided to express this construct only in low amounts, since this was the most suitable possibility to detect potential mTurquoise localization.
Our construct is depicted in the figure below.
Figure 1.5: Fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with the PTS variant.
Combination of our constructs
To combine our constructs, we cloned our PEX5 and mTurquoise constructs into a level 2 plasmid portrayed below.

Subsequently,  co-transformation of the PEX13−mRuby plasmid and the level 2 plasmid was performed in order to verify peroxisomal colocalization"

Which alternative ways to inform yourself would you prefer?
13/24
The survey shows high interest in acquiring information via youtube videos. Except from that there were no preferred scource of information about glyphosate.
Do you think more has to be done to inform the public?
14/24
Most of the participants thought that more effort is needed to inform the public about the controversially discussed glyphosate. The survey also revealed, that only small numbers of the public seems to have well-founded knowledge about that subject.
Are you willing to pay more for glyphosate free food?
15/24
Without the use of glyphosate the operational costs of agriculturists could rise up to elven percent because more machines and more working man would be needed since more ploughing would be carried out.
This indicates that the prices for food in the supermarket would most certainly rise.
Do you know a way to detect glyphosate in your food?
16/24
There are ways to detect glyphosate. Most of them are based on different chromatography methods. In the past, laboratories used the gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to detect glyphosate. It is based on the vaporisation of the substance that is going to be analyzed (gas chromatography). Therefore, glyphosate needs to be derivated with a substance more prone to vaporisation.
At the moment the HPLC followed by fluorescence detection is the standard procedure to detect glyphosate. Since glyphosate does not exhibit fluorescence properties it again needs to be derivated to become fluorescent.
Both of these methods require expensive equipment and are very time-consuming. The derivatisation of glyphosate could also result in a biased detection result.
Other possible detection methods are the ELISA KIT and the Strip test kit which are based on the detection by antigen – antibody interaction. These tests could be carried out at home but they are still quite expensive and prone to false positive results.
Would you use a test to detect glyphosate in your food?
17/24
The survey shows, that most of the people are willing to use a test themselves in order to detect glyphosate in their food.
Did you reduce your beer consumption after glyphosate was detected in various beer brands?
18/24
As previous studies suggested, several german non-alcoholic were positively tested on glyphosate.

This gave us the opportunity to communicate on a one to one basis with the public so they were able to raise any questions they have relating to our project or GMOs in general. Team members were also engaging the public on a more practical level with DNA extraction. We aided members of the public in extracting their own DNA using everyday household products, they were then able to take their extracted DNA home with them. Furthermore we had two members of our team presenting at the event specifically talking about our iGEM project.
YSB 2.0
This September, our team has participated in the 2nd edition of the Young Synthetic Biologists’ Conference, held in London. The conference offered a platform for iGEM teams to present their projects and get feedback and advice from other teams as well as from career synthetic biologists. Our members appreciated the opportunity to practice their presentation in preparation for the Giant Jamboree in Boston and enjoyed sharing their iGEM experience with teams from other universities. This has also helped us establish a collaboration with the Imperial College London iGEM team, as our projects both aim to use phytochelatins as a means towards improved water treatments.
University of Sheffield Meetup
In June, two of the team attended a meetup hosted by the University of Sheffield’s iGEM team. The day consisted of presentations and poster sessions as well as giving us the chance to meet members from the universities of Oxford, Kent, Norwich and Sheffield. The day gave us a chance to start considering potential collaborations with other teams as well as gaining valuable tips and advice from much more experienced iGEM members and alumni.
Our Event for Sponsors and Academics
On October 10th 2014, our team held an event for the sponsors of the iGEM York team, as well as for the academics from the University of York. Members of our team gave a brief presentation outlining the overview of our project which was followed by a short Q and A session. After the talk, we took the opportunity to discuss the progress of our project with our sponsors.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#genet_-_-_TEXT.html,", obesity, at this current stage of scientific research is not considered an incurable disease. In fact, many people do not even consider obesity as a disease. The severity of obesity, nonetheless, is slowly being recognized by the scientific community and, in June 2013, the American Medical Association decided to classify obesity as a disease (Dailey, 2013).
Application of gene therapy for our project is indeed an invasive method to treat obesity. Presently, many people will be reluctant to use this method unless obesity and its complications are life threatening (Yu, 2013). On the contrary, other methods currently used to cure diseases such as medicine and surgery are also invasive. The difference is that these invasive techniques have gained enough trust from public through clinical trials and tests. If gene therapy becomes safer and publicly accepted and if the severity of obesity constantly increases, the use of our project through gene therapy does not seem very improbable in the future.
Conclusion
Gene therapy is a promising method to cure diseases. Although the public currently has doubts about it, scientists are eagerly trying to make it safer and more efficient. In the future, when gene therapy becomes more accepted by the public, we speculate that this method would begin to be applicable for obesity, as more and more people recognize the severity and pathology of obesity.
