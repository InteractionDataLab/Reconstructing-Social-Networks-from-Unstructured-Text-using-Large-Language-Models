Antisense RNA
Antisense RNA (asRNA) is another means of reducing gene function. In this strategy a piece of RNA is transcribed which is complementary to the coding strand of a target gene in the reverse orientation, in other words it is the antisense to it. This has the effect of sequestering the coding mRNA in an RNA-RNA duplex which is unable to effectively bind the ribosome meaning protein synthesis of that gene is inhibited. The RNA-RNA duplex molecule may also be targeted by RNases specific to double stranded RNAs meaning the target mRNA is degraded faster due to the presence of asRNA.
Many studies have utilised an asRNA approach to genetic studies. Typically asRNA will not be capable of completely eliminating gene function since target mRNAs may not encounter the asRNA molecule within the cell before being translated. For this reason, asRNA has primarily been used when gene ‘knockdowns’ are desired rather than total gene knockouts. In knockdown strains the expression of the target gene is reduced rather than entirely eliminated. Non-model organisms which are less genetically accessible frequently do not have established methods for creating gene knockouts. In this case asRNA is often used to gain initial insights into gene function since all that is required for asRNA studies is knowledge of the target gene sequence, a plasmid capable of replication in the organism and a means of transformation.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," (Imperial College London 2011)
Rationale and Aim
deGFP is a variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). It was initially designed by Shin and Noireaux (2010) for expression in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems and is more efficiently translated than other variants (e.g. eGFP). Through talks with other biosensor developers (for example, Chris French), and after reviewing legislation regarding the use of synthetic biology outside of the lab environment, the importance of CFPS systems as a chassis was highlighted. Despite its importance, CFPS systems can still suffer from some issues such as lower total protein synthesis than whole cells. By standardising and characterising a GFP variant which has been modified to have enhanced expression in these systems, it is hoped that CFPS will become a more attractive option for researchers. The aims for this section of the project were: (i) to standardise deGFP as a BioBrick and submit it to the iGEM repository, (ii) to demonstrate expression of deGFP in commercially available cell-free systems, and (iii) to characterise expression of deGFP in E. coli cells.
Background Information
deGFP is a modified variant of eGFP developed by Shin and Noireaux which is more efficiently translated in CFPS systems. It was designed by truncating the N-terminal sequence and introducing silent mutations which removed internal ribosome binding like sequences. The C-terminal sequence is also truncated as this has been shown to not be necessary for maximal fluorescence (Li et al. 1997). By removing ribosome binding like sequences, Shin and Noireaux have reduced the amount of incorrect ribosome binding events and hence increased translation efficiency. The length of the protein also contributes to enhanced translation efficiency by reducing the time and resources required for this process to reach completion.
Design Stage
The deGFP sequence was taken from the Addgene database (Plasmid #40019). The sequence was found to have no illegal restriction sites (i.e. no EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, or PstI sites). A strong, standard Anderson promoter (J23100) and RBS (B0034) was added before the deGFP sequence with biobrick scar sites between each part. A double terminator (B0015) was added after the deGFP sequence. The entire construct was flanked by 30 bp overhangs with the pSB1C3 plasmid, such that the construct could be Gibson assembled into a pSB1C3 plasmid digested"

Meeting the Waag society - Infinite Possibilities
We were really surprised to find the Waag society within an old building in the middle of Amsterdam that looked like a small castle. Every Tuesday evening, the Waag Society offers a regular open Wetlab. There, we met Lucas Evers, who is leading the open Wetlab and many other interesting people. Some were regular guests, others visited the Waag society for the first time.
After a short greeting, Michelle, a biotechnology student from Italy and current intern at the Waag Society, presented the amazing DIY hardware they assembled and told us about his ambitious project ""BioStrike"". He aims to design and distribute a toolkit to empower citizens to develop new antimicrobials. Because of the substantial overlap with the last year's Aachen iGEM project, we had an intense discussion about the increasing danger of the speading microbial resistances to antibiotics.
Afterwards Lucas gave all of the guests an interesting tour, telling us about the fascinating history of the building and the amazing events they organized during the last few months. After his tour, he got the chance to outline our iGEM project, which started an controversial discussion about the future of synthetic biology.

Back in the main room Michele told us, that Pieter planned to participate in the iGEM competition next year. That was a great coincidence, because we had hoped to convince Pieter to participate in the iGEM during our visit. We reached our first goal, without even meeting him.
Drinking tea and eating Aachen’s famous gingerbread, everyone gathered around a big table. One of the most mind blowing"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#CRISPR_-_-_TEXT.html," The plasmid (pJOE8999) is used as    a shuttle vector with - a pUC origin of replication for E. coli, a    kanamycin resistance gene and a temperature-sensitive replication    origin from the plasmid pE194ts. [1] This plasmid carries the cas9 gene    under the transcriptional regulation of a mannose-inducible promoter    PmanP. The sgRNA is transcribed under a semisynthetic promoter PvanP,    interrupted by the oop terminator and the T7 promoter (T7P). The cas9    and sgRNA genetic elements allow the plasmid to be used a genome    editing tool, see figure 2.
Fig 2. Plasmid pJOE8999 redesigned for our project.
For application in our project, the idea was to replace the PmanP    with the tetracycline-repressible promoter PtetR. The pTetR promoter is    constitutively on and is repressed by TetR. The repression can be    inhibited by the addition of tetracycline [5] .
With the help of the sgRNA Designer tool (Broad Institute) we were    able to design the 20-nucleotide spacer sequence of the sgRNA. This    sgRNA guides the Cas9 to its target, in our case the key or the    message [1] . The 700-bp amplified from B. subtilis serves as the DNA    template (PAM-motif) for AmyE.
If the spores containing the message or the key escape into the    environment, the CRISPR/Cas9 system will be activated due to the    constitutively on pTetR and the targeted area, which contains the key    sequence in our case, will be deleted. The same applies if the spores    are in possession by unauthorized parties who are unaware of adding    tetracycline to inactivate the pTetR promoter. This addresses the    issues pertaining to access of the message and key by unauthorized    parties, and also prevents genetically modified bacteria from spreading    in the environment. Therefore, this system has potential to be applied    in any other genetically modified B. subtilis.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology can be a useful source of questions on the ethical aspects of our work. She also mentioned how art can be used to connect people to synthetic biology and how in return art can give the emotional concerns a voice, as scientists might oppress these. In our project, we tried to achieve this through collaborating with the Design Academy Eindhoven . Besides, it was nice to get to know more about how the other dutch iGEM teams handled the RIVM assignment. We thank the RIVM and the Rathenau institute for inviting us, it was an inspiring day!
In short, we learned a lot from collaborating both with the RIVM and the Rathenau institute/Synenergene. When starting iGEM, safety and containment of our engineered bacterium were just “Things that need to be considered in order to perform well in the iGEM competition”. The RIVM and Synenergene assignments helped us to think more in depth about different safety aspects and our own opinions about it. Biosafety of BeeT was always a major part of our project, with over half of the team members working on some safety aspect, but these meetings really showed us a different side of it.
Design Academy Eindhoven
As noted above, on one conference, a speaker stated that in order to make science accessible for everyone, art is essential. We integrated this piece of advice very thoroughly during our iGEM project.
After getting to know students from the Design Academy Eindhoven (DAE) on a sunbio conference, we met several times with some design students and talked both about science and art in general, but also about our iGEM project and their design projects. Doing this, one of the students gave us the opportunity to have a “real life bee experience”. The aim of this project was to study group dynamics, stress, and teamwork. The task was to prepare a dish (Baklava) like bees would do it.
The outcome can be seen here . During this project, we learned a lot about how our team works together. It primed us to think about our own group dynamics and also how a competition like iGEM affects us as a team. Moreover, by exchanging with the design students, a lot of issues concerning our project – such as perception in the society and communication issues – came up. We noticed that the depth of our project is not easily accessible to everyone. Therefore, to improve that, we tried to incorporate a lot of art and graphics in our project. This can be seen in our general approach towards presenting our project on our wiki. Not only do we have"

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

Cleanse-Antibiofilm
Enzymatically degrade biofilm from within when biofilm conditions are detected.
Get started.
How to do it?
Test it!
Our result~
Reference
Before we get started:
Biofilm formation is part of the reason S. mutans is so devastating to oral health (see [Project Overview] for more information). For adequate oral protection, biofilm formation is a problem we must solve, and we can do so internally, by modifying the S. mutans genome, (see [Control: Inhibitor] ), or externally, via a modified probiotic. This means we need to know about conditions unique to biofilms in order to design a sensor.
What happens to our teeth if it is covered in biofilm? Metabolic acids which are waste products of S. mutans naturally begin to accumulate to very high concentrations in the local space, and cannot disperse out into the rest of the mouth. This results in a low pH in areas covered by biofilms, about 4.0~5.0. Since our probiotic is physically close to S. mutans (see [Cleanse: Attachment] ), if our probiotic detects a low pH, there’s a good chance it is within a biofilm. Figure 1 depicts this in a simplified diagram.
Figure 1.
Now that we know the target pH range, we need to find out what biofilms are made of, and how to get rid of them. Biofilms are actually conglomerated bacteria colonies enmeshed in a self-synthesized layer of extracellular polysaccharide matrix. Of these, PGA, or poly-gamma glutamate, has been demonstrated to be a main component across the biofilm of several phylogenetically diverse bacterial species, and polyglycine bridges can cross-link glycopeptides that make up the cell walls of biofilm-producing bacteria.

Susan Chen
Hello! My name is Susan and I am a third year at UCSF in the Tetrad program. I grew up in the east bay area and stayed around to study biochemistry and bioengineering at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). During my time at Cal, I discovered academic research, more specifically synthetic biology, and became very interested in harvesting the power of biology for useful applications. Spurred by that interest, I joined the 2009 Berkeley iGEM team to work on bacterial surface display, and from there I became inspired to one day TA iGEM, contributing to this rich experience for students and just getting plain old excited for novel synthetic biology research.

I'm Graham, a third year Bioinformatics PhD student here at UCSF.  After doing iGEM as an undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign... twice, I figured I wasn't quite done yet.  So now I help with the computational aspects of the team's project.  I think iGEM is a pretty cool opportunity. Here at UCSF where we have a team mainly comprised of high school students and it's particularly exciting for this to be their first exposure to hands on, technical science.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," This demonstrates the engagement of our team with the Lethbridge youth.
We found that the interlab study was a good way for us to learn the lab techniques that we used during the development of our own project. However, it seemed challenging to manipulate the bacteria by dilutions as specified in the methods, as our results seemed to vary.
aGEM AND OTHER CONFERENCES
Canmore aGEM
The first place where we publicly presented our project was at the aGEM in Canmore. Our project at that time was focused on desalination. However, after conversing and doing a few calculations with the judges, we soon realized that our system would be incompatible with salt removal. As a result, we decided to change the focus of our project to the capture and removal of metal ions in tailings instead. This pivot turned our potential users from places requiring potable water from seawater, to tailings and wastewater treatment plants. At Canmore, we received the award for “Best Opportunity Analysis”, as well as a prize of $1800.
North American iGEM Kickoff
Our team had the opportunity to go to Calgary for the North American iGEM Kickoff. We were able to present a basic outline of our project, as well as listen to the projects from collegiate teams. This allowed us to expand our knowledge and interest in synthetic biology. At the Kickoff event, we were able to improve our project from the judge’s feedback, as well as gain advice from other iGEM teams in North America who participated in the conference. For instance, we received contact information for different people as this would help us for the future integration of our project. From this helpful information we were able to improve our project over the summer for aGEM in September.
Calgary aGEM
After the North American iGEM Kickoff, our next stop was aGEM in Calgary. At aGEM, we presented our project to a panel of judges, along with other Alberta iGEM teams. At this event, we received valuable insight and gained more experience with answering questions; this helped us improve our system in the final stretch before the Jamboree.  At aGEM, we received the award for “Best Modelling”, as well as $1000 for the work on our project.

Detailed Description
Bio-glues
Bio adhesives are polymeric materials which are naturally produced from a variety of organisms and have adhesive properties. The monomers of the polymeric bio adhesives consist of a variety of substances, but proteins and carbohydrates are the most common.
Biological adhesion is a phenomenon present in many biological systems. Examples of organisms that produce adhesives can include bacteria, spiders, marine tubeworms, sea cucumbers, barnacles and mussels. These adhesives are well known for being very strong, durable and ecologically safe compared with human-made substances. On top of that, some of them can be applied in an aqueous environment being impervious to water and turbulent forces, they give rise for many qualitative applications.
How do mussels attach themselves to a surface?
At the basis of our project are proteins which are normally produced from blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Blue mussels produce adhesives comparable in strength to human-made glues . However these adhesives have extra advantages like the absence of carcinogens (formaldehyde) and their ability to sustain adhesive under water. Byssus threads of the blue mussel attach to a (underwater) solid surface due to catechols on adhesive proteins.
The mussel’s byssus is an exogenous attachment structure which was first described in 1711 (Brown 1952 ). Byssus’ main role is the attachment of the organism to surfaces. The byssus is a bundle of extracorporeal threads. This bundle is at the proximal end attached to the mussel’s byssal retractor muscle and at the distal end to a surface by adhesive plaques.
Mytilus edulis has the ability to bind to a very broad range of materials, ranging from glass, plastics, metals,"

Diagnostic centers do pathogen detection and determine the sensitivity for antibiotic resistance subsequently. In two to three days, the results include the pathogens sensitivity for all potential antibiotics. As we only could detect one kind of antibiotic resistance, we decided to scope our detection method on the most common mastitis pathogen, which is Staphylococcus Aureus.

Nagahama,2015,Team:Nagahama#Issues_-_-_TEXT.html," one of our candidate terpenes. Oral administration to rats showed LD50 of 3.6g/kg body weight. If this rate is extrapolated to human without considering species difference, LD50 will be 216g/person (body weight is assumed to be 60 kg). If we put one-thousandth as a safer threshold dose, i.e., 216mg/person, this dose is quite a lot of amount, as compared with the dose working to microbes. Of course, careful considerations must be done before using geraniol for antimicrobes, if we know geraniol is used as a food additive.
Consult with medical doctor
Fig.1：Consultation with Professor miwa.
We consult with Professor miwa.(Fig.1) He is the president of Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology, and he is medical doctor. Anything, overdose is a poison. (Etc: salt) Safety of terpene is good to think quantitatively. LD50 is quantitative thinking. Eating or taking what is known to be toxic depends on their own responsibility.(Etc: tobacco) When dealing with recombinants organisms, it is related to the discussion on GM food. To reveal the concrete impact on the human body. If you carry a recombinant organism, you must follow the recombinant traffic rules.
Environment
The second one is the risk to the ""environment"". Release of E. coli that synthesizes terpenes out of the laboratory has a risk to the environment. We need to develop the container (safety box) that can reserve the engineered E. coli for a longer time with releasing the terpenes, but with confining the cells in the container. Separable filters can be used. The gene MarA may cause a risk to the environment of increasing antibiotic resistance by increased activities of efflux pumps. Containers (safety box) confining engineered E. coli inside of the containers are required.
Solution
terpenes are derived from plants, meaning they are abundant in nature. Thus, terpenes do not seem to evoke environmental burden, even if they are released from the “Flavorator” into the natural world by misadventure.
Consult with expert
We consult with Professor Usami. We have a genetic modification safety committee in our institute, and he is a member of the committee. Advantages of the recombinant. Recombinant organism is possible to produce, the required amount of the terpene easily. Therefore, terpene continues to fill in the box. However, disadvantages also exist. Recombinant out"

5. “Synthetic Biology 1” Video Series Translation
Throughout our interaction with the general public in Hong Kong, one obstacles we spot out is the medium of instruction.         While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are         taught in Chinese. However, interesting sources for learning synthetic biology are not equipped with Chinese translations,         which could act as a language barrier for any interested parties.
With great honor, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us to the Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us         to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We translated the English subtitles to Chinese and         had produced a voice-over version for four of the videos shared on Synthetic Biology 1. Each video has both Cantonese         and Mandarin versions. Our translated videos have been uploaded on bilibili website: https://space.bilibili.com/178821464/#!/ which is also accessible in China.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images,"

After meticulous preparation, three iGEM teams came from Nankai University, Tianjin University and Tianjin University of Science and Technology went to Tianjin No.13 Middle School to publicize the knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM, meanwhile, to understand the current situation of education about biology in middle schools.” While these students have only been exposed to biology for a year, they like it very much”, the teacher said.
Biological Science Popularization Day in Nankai University
In order to show the charm and essence of iGEM, and at the same time to better promote iGEM and synthetic biology among college students so that more people can focus on synthetic biology and participate in iGEM, we have organized the science popularization report on July 7th, team NKU-CHINA, Jilin_China and TUST_China took part in the publicity. Each team introduced their respective experiment directions and preliminary work with the synthetic biology as a common theme. After the report, outside the venue, the teams also answered the audience’s questions one by one in front of their own exhibition boards, expanding the public's understanding of synthetic biology, iGEM competition and experiment projects. Finally, the iGEM team of Nankai University organized a visit to the iGEM lab to get more closer with iGEM and our experiments. Through our publicity, many students showed great interest in synthetic biology, which is a meaningful publicity.
Team Communication
The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
On July 6th, we held the iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University. This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between various universities teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that our school iGEM team successfully conceived and held this large-scale joint conference. Each team introduced their experiments and other aspects of the work. After the show, we discussed our experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts. Finally, we organized everyone to visit our iGEM Lab to get a better understanding about our experiments.

Introduction of synthetic biology to interested science students
Expand knowledge of biotechnology in the community
Practice presentation skills with a patient and constructive audience
Information Data
Gathered survey data
How did Lambert iGEM address the survey data
Lambert iGEM created a 3 day camp for rising 8th and 9th graders from the local middle schools, where the team taught them about biotechnology. The team gave lectures over basic content in biology and labs based on biotechnology principles. The participants began the camp not knowing much about science, but by the end, they understood the importance of biotechnology and the different aspects in it. The Lambert iGEM team ran this camp to expand the knowledge of the students in our community about biotechnology in hope that they will consider it a career option.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," employees of Wageningen UR. By writing a Resource from the year 2030 , when BeeT will be available on the market, we aimed to bring up ethical issues around synthetic biology in a way that is fun and accessible to the public. Some of these issues are highlighted in the interviews with the general public we included in the magazine. At the same time, the magazine served to spread the word in Wageningen about our iGEM project. Additionally, we wrote an application scenario . This scenario explores how European legislation could affect future BeeT usage.
Click the front page to read our Resource from the future! The Resource is the student magazine of Wageningen University.
RIVM
In the Netherlands, the RIVM (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu) is a  governmental institute that is concerned with public health and a safe living environment. They investigate the impact of synthetic biology on these aspects of our society, and aim to bring existing knowledge on the topic together. Part of their work is encouraging discussions about the development of synthetic biology from a policymaker’s perspective, which includes a collaboration with all Dutch iGEM teams since 2014.
In short, we learned a lot from collaborating both with the RIVM and the Rathenau institute/Synenergene. The RIVM and Synenergene assignments helped us to think more in depth about different safety aspects, how safety by design can be achieved and our own opinions about it. We gained a new perspective on how biocontainment is perceived.
Events
Throughout the year we have visited a lot of conferences with several goals: to inform different stakeholders about our project, to collect input on the BeeT system through different stages of the project, to network with companies and explore sponsor possibilities, and to have fun and learn some things ourselves.
March: multi-stakeholder dialogue
""The role of synthetic biology in energy transition""
Discussion about the current Dutch energy supply and the potential role of synthetic biology. We created “the green human” futuristic scenario where humans would evolve together with plants to be able to rely on photosynthesis for energy. In our opinion it exposes a very important aspect of both energy transition and synthetic biology: that the public should be involved, to be more conscious about energy use and more engaged with technological advances in the field of synthetic biology.

Morganne Wilbourne
I'm a third year biomolecular science student interested in drug development and the medical applications of biochemistry.  In the next two years I plan to apply for M.D./Ph.D programs in the United States.
Izzy Dunstan
I am currently in my third year at the university of St. Andrews studying biochemistry. I was excited to get involved in iGEM and particularly liked the student-driven aspect of it. iGEM was a great opportunity to be able to work as part of a team to build upon a shared interest and to gain experience in industry- wide lab techniques.
Student members
James Hammond
My name is James, I’m from Forres in the north of Scotland and I’m in the third year of a Biology and Mathematics BSc. I got involved with iGEM because I’m eager to try my hand at modelling biological systems, mainly just to see if it’s something I’d consider doing after I graduate. Outside of the lab, my main interest is moth recording – capturing, identifying then recording moth species and rearing out the larvae. I couldn’t tell you why!
Gavin Lamb
I'm Gavin, a 3rd year studying physics at St Andrews. My core interest going into iGEM was modeling but I ended up working in a biology lab learning things completely outwith my field. iGEM provided a great opportunity for this and my ability to learn even within my own subject has definitely improved because of the experience!
Cam Young
Cam is a third year molecular biology student at the University of St. Andrews, and eventually aims to work in the field of research or science communication. Interests aside from science are cooking, photography, and rugby.
Eleonora Shantsila
I’m a 3rd year BSc Mathematics student at St. Andrews. I am primarily interested in applied mathematics and statistics, in particular mathematical biology and joined iGEM to develop my understanding of this area. The project also gave me the opportunity to work with a wide range of people and to develop my coding skills.

UESTC-China,2017,Team:UESTC-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," or even primary school students an opportunity to participate in the activities of biology learning. And the theme of environmental protection is blended among these activities.
☁ Primary school:
UESTC-China hosted a lab open day called ""A Close Encounter with Science"" which attracted more than 20 students and 10 parents. We spread botanical knowledge to them, and let them experience and operate some simple instruments. At last, we played interesting plant printing and dyeing games, and the students enjoyed the fun of Science in these games.
☁ Middle school
Can you come up with a similar iGEM project?
Plant + vacuum cleaner = haze purifier?
Bovine Mammary +coffee beans = coffee without the coffee mate?
Sugar cane related gene + low sugar fruit = high sugar fruit?
We held an activity whose theme is synthetic biology and environmental protection. More than 300 students participated in it. We received numerous bright ideas from them. Not only did we get a lot of inspiration, the children also harvested a new way of thinking.
☁ high school：
We have invited more than 10senior high school students affiliated to the campus in UESTC to participate in an interesting environmental activity. Students build micrographs through plastic waste and plants. This time, we gave them some tips on the recycle and reuse of pollutants and explained the principle of degrading pollutants by transgenic plants.
Library exhibition
In China, when people think of synthetic biology, the potential risk of genetically modified food rather than the benefits of synthetic biology comes to their minds. . It’s hard to change this kind of stereotype or prejudice. So there are four teams which held the activity named ""Synthetic Biology and Human"" at the Chengdu city library. They answered the questions concerning transgenosis from citizens, and intended to change people’s views. However, a small number of people still believe that we are preaching a dangerous, unproved technology. Changing their one-sided ideas is what we strive to accomplish.
Comics and videos about lab safety
We are concerned about the daily safety of laboratories which are consistently ignored by many. China iGEMers from 11 universities posted a series of lab safety education videos and received millions of view on major video sites. UESTC - China abides by the laboratory safety codes in a strict manner.

Due to the complexity of our symbiotic system, only with the established disturbance standard we can not directly obtain the stability of the membrane, so it is also necessary to establish a method to measure the concentration of algae and bacteria in the mixed system. We analyzed, screened and tested various measurement methods for use under different conditions. This part can be used to assist the strength measurement of the binding protein and binding domain in the biofilm. It can also be used to measure the concentration of each component in a binary or even multi-co-culture system.
Therefore, our ""The quantification of the mixed algae-bacteria symbiotic system."" has the following advantages:
1. Various methods, which can be selected according to actual conditions
2. Expandable for measuring the concentration of each component in other binary or even multi-co-culture systems
In general, our ""The selection of interference and the establishment of interference intensity standard"" is divided into the following steps:
1. Randomly prepare a variety of membranes that bind to the binding protein to be tested.
2. Pre-experiment rough determines a suitable range of speed, so that most binding protein shedding rates are quite different
3. Select representative groups and perform speed gradient agitation treatment.
4. Analyze the experimental results and select the appropriate rotational speed as the unified measurement standard.
""The quantification of the mixed algae-bacteria symbiotic system"" section is divided into the following steps:
1. According to the actual situation of the mixed system, select several alternative methods referring the evaluation of our methods.
2. Do pre-experiment to evaluation alternative methods.
3. Select the final method based on the pre-experiment results
""The quantification of the mixed algae-bacteria symbiotic system"" result:
I. bacteria detection.
1. Ordinary CFU method need to use too many plate (72x5x5).
2. Simplified CFU method (96-well plate method) is suitable for coarse measurement of mixed system bacteria concentration. There are problems of plate drying and sampling amount determination(if the liquid is too much, the liquid layer will form, and the colonies cannot grow);the accuracy is not up to the requirement of measuring the shedding rate (the number of colonies per hole is <10, single Error caused by colony difference >10%).
3. Direct blood counting plate method is time consuming (staining problem, impurity resolution problem).
4. Photographing blood cell counting plate method requires high experimental conditions (oil mirror, CCD short focal length).

And we run some parameter scan to analysis how the model works under various parameter sets. And we focus on the affinity of the histamine receptor and the degradation rate of the activated histamine, which are both reckoned as highly sensitive parameters before.
The the affinity of histamine receptor and degradation rate of activating receptor scan results are showed below.
From the figures, we figure that the peak of the concentration of EGFP increases and the decline of it is delayed as the affinity goes higher or the degradation rate of receptor gets lower, which implied us that we can artificially tune these two parameters to adjust the output. Besides,it reminds us that the randomness of these should be further considered in the stochastic model.
Then, we did an input scan and get a figure of output time series of various input, which is demonstrated below. As to the system, the input is the activated histamine receptor in a cell and the output is the concentration of EGFP.
From this figure, it is obvious that the concentration of EGFP soars at the first time and reach a peak,then gradually decreases, since the activated histamine receptor degrade as the time goes by. In addition, the concentration of EGFP monotonously changes as that of RL (input) goes up , which is an evidence that it is possible to test the concentration of activated receptor by that of EGFP.
Diagnosis Model
Diagnosis Model is a model constructed to design, analyze and optimize the diagnostic criteria of histamine testing we developed. In this testing, our purpose is to test whether the histamine concentration in a sample reaches a certain level. If it does, we consider this kind of result as a positive result, which means allergy has possibly happened. However, if the histamine concentration maintains at a background level, we consider it as a negative result. So the diagnosis model is indeed a classification model which focuses on the strategy to determine how we announce the testing result and how much we can believe in it. And, to be emphasized, this model is on the basis of the models we constructed before -- 'Reaction in system' and 'Signal pathway in a yeast.
Diagnostic criteria design
Now we begin with the EGFP concentration in a yeast when certain amount of the histamine receptor activated, which is the output in the signal pathway model. From figure 14, it is clear that the output is dynamic. However, using the whole time"

ETH_Zurich,2011,Team:ETH Zurich#Biology#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html,"ylC encodes for the benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, xylM and xylA for subunits of the xylene oxygenase and xylB for benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase [6] . XlyN is not required for the degradation of xylene, but it is part of the whole transcriptional unit. The DNA binding of XylR occurs at a 40 bp upstream activating sequence (UAS) located 150 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site of the σ54 PU promoter. DNA looping between the UAS and the -12/-24 motifs of the σ54-RNAP facilitates the activation of the holoenzyme by XylR [7] .
How we used it
Figure 4: Circuit operations of SmoColi with xylene sensor
Xylene is not degraded naturally by E. coli. To generate a concentration gradient of xylene we engineered its degradation in SmoColi by including the upper Tol pathway. XylR is a prokaryotic enhancer binding protein, thus is completely functional in E. coli. As an input into the SmoColi system, LacIM1 and CI are put under the control of the PU promoter, enhancing their expression in the presence of xylene.
Arabinose Sensor
Where it comes from...
Figure 5: Structures of the AraC heterodimere with L-Arabinose [14]
The AraC regulatory protein is a activator of the genes for the araBAD, the araE and the araFGH operon in E.coli. araB, araA and araD encode for the metabolic enzymes which degrade L-Arabinose to D-xylulose-5-phosphate. In absence of arabinose AraC does bind to two DNA site separated over 200 bp from each other (I1 and O2 of the PBAD promoter) [8] . By dimer formation of the two DNA bound AraC molecules the DNA is looped and transcription blocked. Binding of arabinose leads to binding of arabinose to I1 and I2, I2 bound AraC directly interacts with the RNA polymerase and activates it. araF, araG and araH and araE encode for proteins needed for uptake of arabinose. If some arabinose enters the cell, the uptake of arabinose is activated leading and more and more arabinose entering the cell. This positive feedback loop leads to an all or nothing response of arabinose in the cells.
How we"
KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven#Ethics#Concerns#Defining_-_-_TEXT.html," op de opkomst van synthetische biologie” (2),the approaches towards synthetic biology are divided into two broad classes. On the one hand there is the bottom-up approach and on the other one there is the top-down point of view.
Bottom-up approach
It is possible to take any part of life, torn apart into pieces, and then creating more and more complex systems from them. This methodology is called the bottom-up approach. The BioBrick initiative, and everything that comes with it, is clearly an example of this approach. As the iGEM contest is about using these BioBricks, this bottom-up approach will be our major focus in the rest of this discussion.
Top-down approach
The particular vision of hierarchical biological reductionists assume that everything in life, especially the living nature, can be reduced to physical processes, which, on their turn, can be described mathematically. This way, it tries to tear apart different parts of nature, which can then be torn further apart, and torn apart and so on, until one reaches the molecular, physical or mathematical level. One of the examples of this approach is the minimal genome project carried out by Craig Venter and others (3). One of Venter’s studies focuses on building a sort of cellular chassis. They want to create an entire genome that forms a base for simple cellular life. A cell with a minimal genome would be an excellent scaffolding for further study. By reducing the complexity of biological systems and processes in cells, one can make cellular pathways more predictable and better controllable.
Another example of top-down synthetic biology was something that catches the eye: synthetic DNA analogs. The Herdewijn research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven for instance, is very much involved in this. They are trying to find the possibilities of creating a parallel nature out of synthetic DNA. This synthetic DNA is different from the commonly known DNA forms in that it uses the same bases, but a different backbone. Mostly this is done by changing the hexofuranose sugar to another kind of ring or ring-like structure. Then, this material is tested for its ability to use normal DNA polymerase (4). They are also looking for modified polymerases that can specifically read their synthetic kind of DNA.

UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO
University of Waterloo was founded in 1957 and has grown to accommodate 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students, and has become Canada’s leading university in comprehensive learning. Also, the university has consistently been voted as the most innovative, most likely to produce the leaders of tomorrow, and best overall University in Canada for over 18 years (according to Maclean’s Magazine). Waterloo’s reputation is however based on its excellent and pioneering co-op program which offers students a balance of work and school on a per term basis, making it a unique learning experience. The city of Waterloo has recognized University of Waterloo and its students, by meeting its demands in terms of funding and involvement. The University has also opened up two new campuses; the pharmacy building, and the joint McMaster medical building in Kitchener, as well as the architecture building in Cambridge, contributing to not only the city of waterloo but the whole Grand River area.
WATERLOO - KITCHENER COMMUNITY
City of Waterloo mainly revolves around the two universities: University of Waterloo and Laurier University. Waterloo is surrounded by Kitchener and thus, the two cities are known as the twin cities, also referred to as Kitchener - Waterloo. The population of the city of Waterloo is always fluctuating due to temporary residents at Waterloo’s two universities. Total population in 2009 was recorded to be 121, 700; approximately 20,000 of which were temporary post-secondary students. Due to its small size, people in the past have tried to merge the two cities together but have been unsuccessful. As of today, both cities have their own identity and their own separate city governments.

They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.

Constitutive promoter in phaCAB growth in sole carbon sources under M9S. MG1655 E. coli transformed with native phaCAB compared to empty vector for sole carbon sources. The trends observed show that there is not much difference between EV and phaCAB for glucose (p = 0.6511), acetoacetate (p = 0.4633) and 3HB (p = 0.7266). ANOVA analysis concluded that  null hypothesis, ""The sole carbon sources tested have no effect on growth"" must be rejected (F 5,12 = 15.94, p < 0.0001). This shows that there is a difference between individual carbon sources. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusions: For native promoter and empty vector, there is no significant difference in growth for the same sole carbon source. There is a significant difference however between the different sole carbon sources used. A similar picture is observed with the constitutive promoter for phaCAB. By far, the most interesting result is seen with the hybrid phaCAB promoter. There is a very distinct difference between empty vector and the hybrid, whereby the hybrid phaCAB grows very well with acetoacetate up until 100 mM.

Would it be ethical to develop techniques for cloning human beings? (Juan Carlos Torres Montoro)
Techniques on their own are neither good nor bad, depends what you use them for. This procedures could be use to produce organs for transplants that would not elicit a rejection response, curing lots of diseases.  We think that governments should have a strict control and laws about this kind of experiments, not allowing the situations where the Human Rights may be violated.
Is it moral to use animals for experimentation? (José Montoro Ortiz)
Animals model are a way to study the molecular basis of a disease and see the effects of medicines. Without them, it would be almost impossible to find new therapies because nobody wants to try something that may kill or hurt badly another person. Also, they serve to study basic physiology and cellular function, by means inacceptable to use in humans. Animal experimentation is well regulated by government agencies, in charge of control the number of animals that are used and how they will be treated.
Are you for or against designed babies? (David Valentín Martín)
If it’s for curing diseases of elder brothers or to avoid an incurable illness, we think it’s up to the parents’ decision and it’s a rightful thing to do. Some other people want to have babies at their desire, choosing his/her sex and appearance.  We think that use this techniques should be used only when there are health issues involved.

Figure 2.
Then, we did the pre-experiment to find when the oxygen concentration in 20ml liquid culture can attain stable condition. The result shows that for Anaero Pack 45min at ~0.40mg/L, for MicroAero Pack 3h at ~2.8mg/L, for CO2 Pack 1.5h at ~4.4mg/L. In air, the oxygen concentration is ~5.8mg/L. (File is in Notebook Part)
Why we use 20mL is because the dissolved oxygen meter need certain liquid depth to test. We need more liquid to provide data for modeling.
Figure 3. Cultivation Device.
Because our experiment need to add same volume of E. coli in liquid culture firstly, we dilute bacteria liquid culture to test OD600 to check if it’s direct proportion relationship to make sure that we can dilute different bacteria liquid culture in same concentration. The result shows that it fits quite good (Figure 4).
Figure 4. OD600 and dilution factor relationship. It’s direct proportion relationship
We wonder if the time for the oxygen concentration balance affects the growth of E. coli at early stage. Because if the growth speed has big difference between J04450 and K1919500, at the real oxygen stable time, the bacteria concentration is not same. Then we add 2ul OD600=0.2 bacteria liquid culture to check what influence it can bring. The result shows that microplate reader can’t distinguish the difference. (File is in Notebook Part) So we can ignore it.
But at same time, we found one important thing:
If the bacteria can be seen in liquid culture (turbid), the oxygen concentration is near to 0mg/L in culture. The supply of oxygen may be dependent on how oxygen enter the liquid (surface of liquid culture and shaking speed).
Then we did the OD600 and fluorescence intensity test in AnAero Pack, MicroAero Pack, CO2 Pack and in air.
We construct the device like this. In box, there’s no lid, but for air culture, lid is involved in experiment system.
To our surprise, in 20ml/50ml OD600 experiment, all oxygen concentrations show same tendency: at first, the K1919500 is quicker than J04450, but in later stage, J04450 can grow more, but K1919500 enter the plateau phase (Figure 5).

E. coli cell lysis
Genes from bacteriophages can cause bacterial cell lysis.
Simple lytic phages, such as the single-stranded (ss) DNA phage φX174 and the ssRNA phages, have a single lysis gene (prototypical genes being φX174 E, MS2 L and Qβ A2).  φX174 E seems to be the best characterised at the moment, and encodes a single lysis protein that inhibits a specific step in murein biosynthesis.  Fewer than 500 molecules of E are present at the time of lysis.  Lysis by E requires continued host cell division. (We can't use the system that Paris used to make their ""germline"" non-divisible.)  The DNA sequence for E is:

Interview with Nobel Prize Winner Harald zur Hausen
Prof. Harald zur Hausen
06 Oct. 2008, Medicine Nobel Prize goes to DKFZ Heidelberg
Harald zur Hausen (DKFZ Heidelberg) is awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of the cancerous Papilloma virus, which envisions today a vaccination against infection. He shares the prize with Francoise Barre-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier (both Institut Curie, Paris) for their discovery of the HIV. Harald zur Hausen has been chair of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) here in Heidelberg from 1983 to 2003 and lead the institute to its world wide reputation. The Heidelberg iGEM team congratulates him to this historic honor!!
Important Information
We had the great chance to interview Prof. zur Hausen about his opinion about science communication via mail. You find the questions we sent him in the box below. But since Prof. zur Hausen is very occupied at the moment (as you can imagine), he will not be able to answer up to the wiki-freezing date on wednesday, october 29th. Thus we set an external link, where we will post the result of the interview hopefully a few days after the wiki-freezing.
The interview will be available under the following Link: Interview with Nobel Prize Winner Prof. zur Hausen

UIUC Illinois 2018 iGEM Midwest Meet Up w/ Washington University in St. Louis
On August 17th, a couple of team members from Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team came to our Midwest meet up. We listened to Dr. Ting Lu give a presentation on his work in the field of synthetic biology. Both teams gave presentations to each other about our projects and the work we were conducting. We talked about problems we were facing and gave each other advice on how to overcome these problems. The WashU iGEM team was having some trouble with their PCR, so we gave them advice by explaining how we successfully completed ours. They provided us with resources needed to obtain important materials for our research for free such as competent cells. We had a great time learning and getting to know each other.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Collaboration
Additionally, we collaborated with the University of Nebraska- Lincoln on their new safety project: A ""Safety Case"". A Safety Case is:""a proactive technique used to visualize the safety of a synthetic biology project and its end goal."" One can use this program to visualize any possible safety concerns with your current project. We input our data in and saw that we should consider adding a kill switch to our Yeast and LAB strains in case they ever were ever introduced into nature.
Collaboration with Imperial College of London
We helped  Imperial College of London on their ""Lets talk about this"" project. This project allow colleagues to better communicate and solve internal social conflicts. This could create a better work environment and a more efficient work space

The system is then neutralized through the addition of ions to a molarity of 150 mM, therefore allowing the system to reach a neutral state. Our results indicate that βHACdH is well solvated in SPC216 water and neutralized to a molarity of 150 mM in a cubic 2 nm cell.
Figure 3. Establishing, solvating and neutralising βHACdH, for simulation preparation.  A. The establishment of a 2nm simulation cube around the dimerised structure of βHACdH. B. The solvation of the βHACdH structure by the addition of SPC216 water molecule as a solvent. C. Neutralisation of the solvated system by the addition of Na+ and Cl- ions. Na+ and Cl- ions are represented by Blue and Green spheres, respectively and SPC216 water is represented by Cyan coloured molecules.
Once we had prepared the system, it was relaxed by energy minimization. This ensures that there are no steric clashes or inappropriate geometries that exist, by applying the steepest descent algorithm[13]. With the minimized structure, the system of solvent and ions around the protein are equilibrated to become orientated about the protein solute at the same temperature, by an isothermal-isochoric ensemble[17]. Pressure is then applied using an isobaric-isochoric ensemble, thereby ensuring that the system reaches a proper density[18].  Our energy minimized structure shows a decrease from -6.75E+05, to a maximum energy plateau for the system of -1.05 E+06 after 1238 ps of minimization time. The temperature of the system quickly reaches the target value of 300 K remaining stable, with an average temperature of 299.82 K, the equivalent of 27 °C over the 100 ps equilibration. Over the course of the 100 ps equilibration stage, both the pressure and density of the system averages 0 bar and 1015.19 Kg m-3.  This is close to the experimental value of 0 bar and 1000 Kg m-3 and the equivalent of Earth’s atmospheric pressure at sea level and the density of water. The pressure fluctuations are consistent with the applied isothermal-isobaric ensemble and is suggestive of compatible molecular dynamics conditions for simulations of βHACdH"

NCTU_Formosa,2016,Team:NCTU Formosa#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," introduction of our product, and then asked them for advice. The main opinions we want to know from farmer were what we can develop organic agriculture. For the public, we aim to discover their views of Pantide. We would continue doing the questionnaire and visit farmer for new idea.
Lab Experiment and Device Design－View more in project
The goal of experiment in the laboratory was to use E.coli to manufacture Pantide. Then, we carry out yield analysis and determination of peptide degradation rate. Also, we use tobacco cutworm’s larvae to experiment Pantide’s function.
Device Design Included Three Part
Insect-catching Apparatus
     With the combination with 2014 NCTU_FORMOSA product PBAN. We created insect-catching apparatus, which could attract specific pests. Moreover, our device device could count the number of pests by infrared sensors.
Analyzing Spraying
      When Arduino microprocessor receives signals from the infrared sensors. It would determine when to start spraying by intersection checking.
Remote Monitoring
      Using IoT to connect the device and APP in user's smartphone. Farmers can get hold of the information of their farmland remotely
Execution Period
Small-scale Pesticide Test
      After we have tested the function of Pantide in the laboratory. Pantide and device would be tested in the greenhouse.
Equipment Test
Equipment Test
      In order to correct the predicted values of device, it would be put in the field for long-term observation and record.
Effectiveness Evaluation
Farm Test
      At last, we would contact with the farmers, which were willing to participate in the non-toxic agricultural-PANTIDE test for four-month field trials.
Business Model Summary
Our value:
Previously detecting the pest appearance and species. Internet of things (IoT) transfers the data to users’ application. Remove spraying the species-specific Pantide.
With the system, we tackle the problem and solve it directly.
Ecofriendly, non-toxic to benefitial insects and human body
Marketing & Future
In this part, we are going to discuss the market analysis, publicity and future works.
Marketing
Our target customers focus on the organic farmers and large-scale agriculture.

Besides, we are standardizing another four new standard BioBrick Parts: FLA, PpcoA, oprF-CBP-HA and oprF-GS-CBP-HA.
Characterization of parts
2. Characterization of the copper sensitive promoter PpcoA
To determine that whether promoter PpcoA can respond to different Cu2+ concentration, we constructed the recombinant plasmid pET28a-PpcoA-mRFP and read the fluorescent intensity for assaying the promoter's transcription ability when incubated in the LB medium containing Cu2+. Team HZAU-China helped to sequence the plasmid and do some pre-experiment to characterize the promoter.
Preliminary Test Procedure
1. Add 2mL LB culture medium, 2uL Kanamycin (50mg/L) and 20uL bacterial samples to a 5mL centrifuge tube. Cultivate in the 37°C shaking incubator and set the rotational speed at 180 rpm/min.
2. Add CuSO4 solution to induce in concentration of 0, 0.02 and 0.1mM. Set three copies for each concentration as repetitions. Cultivate in the 37°C shaking incubator at the rotational speed of 180 rpm/min for 4 hours.
3. Add 200uL bacterial samples from each centrifuge tube to the 96-well plate. Set two copies for each centrifuge"

Next, the full insertion sequence was also generated on Gene Designer. >Mutant Cage Full Insertion GGCCTGGTTCCCCGCGGTTCAGGC >Full Insertion GLVPRGSG This allowed easy insertion of the sequences.  The full sequence was inserted where needed after removing redundant bases.
For the prefix and suffix, the sequence was obtained from this site.  The first prefix sequence was used. http://parts.igem.org/Help:BioBrick_Prefix_and_Suffix prefix-NdeI-gene-XhoI-Histag-suffix
Concluding remarks: Before the rest of the sites are revisited, a meeting will be set up with David and/or Fasih to check our design rationale.
Intro: today we realized that our work the previous day (June 23) was not useful. We had used Dr. Yates' original cage sequence instead of the optimized sequence, which would yield poorer results. Thus, the same procedure of using Benchling to design new cages with the inserted thrombin recognition sites was performed with the new cage sequence above.
Procedure:
1. The cage sequence optimized by Dr. Yates was copied into a benchling file.
2. The thrombin cleavage site was inserted at the area of interest of each site.
3. The resultant sequence was then codon optimized. Integrated DNA Technologies Codon Optimizer, set to Escherichia coli K12, was used. https://www.idtdna.com/CodonOpt
4. The optimized sequence was then cross checked with benchling’s digest function for EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, and XbaI restriction sites.
5. Any residues containing the restriction site were exchanged with different codons to preserve the reading frame and remove undesired digestion.

1. Recreated Mutant Sequences(9-13) using PCquad sequence from Yeates(fully optimized)
-PCquad sequence was copied onto Benchling and the mutation was inserted onto this sequence       -Then this sequence was codon optimized using the Gene Designer tool        -Then the sequence was checked for containing any iGEM restriction enzymes(Pst,EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI,NotI) and were removed by replacing nucleotides to avoid unwanted digestion.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," attended the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva Switzerland took time to reflect and review all of the information they were able to learn over the entirety of the experience.  This valuable information will help us create an informed design for our device, and make adjustments based on international feedback we received from a variety of valuable perspectives.  We discussed this experience and what they have learned at the conference and meeting with FIND. More information on the meeting with FIND can be found here
These team members made sure to thoroughly document this experience to ensure that this information will benefit the design and implementation of our project.  The Biological Weapons Convention and the meeting with FIND both provided our team with valuable information and insight into synthetic biology on an international level.
Week 15: August 11th - August 15th
The World Health Organization responded to our email regarding our research and what feedback they have regarding our project.  This is also an opportunity to gain insight in the malaria misdiagnosis information available from the World Health Organization, as the specific department of the WHO that responded to us is a part of the malaria program.
Week 16: August 18th - August 22nd
This week we created a list of all of the diseases that we previously talked about that have similar symptoms as malaria. Then we looks at the specific symptoms (other than fever) of each to see if we can group certain diseases according to similar symptoms. For example, some diseases might have neck pain as a symptom, while other have stomachache as a symptom. If a patient exhibits neck pain and fever symptoms, for example, then a doctor can administer a diagnostic test that tests for the diseases that have these two symptoms in common. So this week was spent looking into this idea and looking at the different symptoms of diseases that mimic malaria.
Week 17: August 25th - August 29th
This week we started writing summaries for different aspects we looked into as part of the Policies and Practiced research. Different components include diagnostic landscape, device implementation, and informed design. The write ups for these sections integrate the interviews with the experts and general facts about misdiagnosis of malaria that we found as part of our research. Information received from FIND during the Geneva trip was also very useful in writing up these sections.
Week 18: September 1st - September 5th
This week we worked on preparing for the aGEM presentation. We prepared content for the presentation and videos featuring our expert's interviews. We also practiced answering potential questions that can arise after our presentation at aGEM. We also started uploading policies and practices content on the wiki.

We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Reactive astrocytes are different from resting astrocytes in their gene expression profile. Our designed vectors express the first part of our two-component system under a promoter of a gene known to be highly expressed in reactive astrocytes, Timp1 1-4. As a backup, we have the same component designed to be expressed under a constitutive strong promoter, CMV. The construct to be expressed according to the activity of said promoters is an enzymatically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) conjugated to a transcription promoting factor, VP645. This recombinant protein is designed to activate specific endogenous genes in a guide RNA dependent manner.  The vector also expresses a Puromycin resistance gene.

Conclusion
As the concentration of cleaved photo protection groups is almost 480,000 times lower than the concentration of boric acid its toxicity is allowed to be 448,000 fold higher for the same toxicity of the liquid washing detergent. If the toxicity of cleavage products is less than 448,000 fold higher than the toxicity of boric acid, washing detergents with replaced boric acid were less toxic than the actual.
Example for one washing cycle (100 g liquid laundry detergent)
For this calculation we assume that 1% of the liquid detergent stays in the laundry after washing and the composition is like in the calculation above.

Pour une partie de notre communication, nous aimerions remercier Amanda Lo Van qui a réalisé la video du ""CROSS de l'INSA de LYON"" et France3 Rhône-Alpes, Le Progrès, Radio RCF, Viva,... pour diffuser notre projet sur les ondes et les journaux locaux.
Merci à TU Delft pour leur collaboration, et tout spécialement Krijn Warringa qui a rendu les choses possibles.
Ensuite, notre projet, orienté dans une optique industrielle, nous a amené à discuter avec des professionnels de l'industrie nucléaire. Nous sommes très reconnaissants à la centrale du Tricastin, Centraco, à Michel de la centrale du Bugey et à Assystem d'avoir pris le temps de répondre à nos questions, et de nous avoir aider à donner un aspect réalisable  notre projet.
Enfin, pour finir, nous nous devons de remercier l'équipe INSA-Lyon iGEM (2010)(Pour voir leur wiki ). Ce sont eux qui ont engagé la ville de Lyon et ses prestigieuses écoles au sein du concours iGEM. Sans eux, l'équipe Lyon Biosciences n'existerait surement pas.
En se basant sur leur expérience, nous avons beaucoup appris et compris tous les avantages à collaborer avec d'autres personnes. Dans cet objectif, un partenariat a été créé entre l'INSA de Lyon et l'ENS de Lyon, chacun contribuant de sa propre manière au même projet.
Mais le rassemblement de ces deux écoles n'auraient pas été possible sans le travail de certains de nos Instructors . Ainsi, en tant qu'étudiants et conseillers, nous aimerions les remercier pour tous leurs efforts! Cette collaboration est très enrichissante pour l'ensemble des membres de l'équipe, autant scientifiquement qu'humainement.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Results-content_-_-_TEXT.html,". The two portions were mixed and, after incubation overnight, had changed their colour mostly to purple, indicating that the two colorant molecules had diffused between the beads of different colors (Figure 3). As the alginate beads consist of water to a high percentage and methane is soluble in water it can be assumed that methane can readily enter the alginate beads.
Figure 3: Coloured beads (A) after diffusion of the colorants carmine (B) and Patent Blue V (C)
To evaluate the survival rate of E. cowli in rumen fluid, we determined the plating efficiency for the supernatant and dissolved beads. We entrapped equal numbers of bacteria in alginate beads, incubated them for 24 h in 2YT medium or rumen fluid, and separated the beads from the supernatant, i.e. the medium in which the beads had been cultivated. The beads were dissolved in PBS.
In our analysis we normalised the number of cells grown in rumen fluid to the number of cells grown in 2YT medium, representing ideal culture conditions. The ratio ,therefore, poses an indicator as to how many cells survived in rumen fluid compared to ideal conditions. We set the value obtained for non-encapsulated cells as 1 and treated the results obtained for encapsulated cells and the supernatant in respect to this value. The higher the calculated ratio is, the more  cells survived in rumen fluid in comparison to 2YT medium under the given conditions.
Bacteria encapsulated in beads survived to a much higher degree than those cultivated in rumen fluid without beads (Figure 4). Unexpectedly, the number of survived cells in the supernatant outreached the non-encapsulated cells. One possible explanation of this finding is that the beads serve as a reservoir for the cells. As the cells populate the beads they can leave the protecting beads and become non-encapsulated cells, which are fully exposed to the perils of the rumen fluid. These non-encapsulated cells cannot survive as long as those cells still entrapped in the beads. But as more and more bacteria can grow inside the beads and thus may leave them, the number of cells surviving in the supernatant is higher than the number of those which were non-encapsulated from the beginning. Another explanation would be partial disintegration of the beads by phosphate compounds. In a possible application and in view of safety issues this might be prevented by further coating of the beads, for example by adding polyethylene diamine. This was done by the iG"

Bartell
Team Lead - Chemical and Biomedical Engineering
Hello! My name is Justin Bartell and I am will be going into my third year at FSU studying Biomedical Engineering. I'm currently pre-med and plan to pursue an MD-PhD in Bioengineering. My goal is to be able to develop novel therapeutic technologies that can be implemented in a clinical setting. I first heard about iGEM from Cesar Rodriguez, our Primary PI, when he discussed the iGEM program in a Biomedical Engineering Society meeting. The idea of synthetic biology--manipulating DNA to develop biological systems--enraptured me. From there, I agreed to work over the summer for iGEM, and have taken on a leadership role since. One random fact about me: I've gone to the FSU home games since I was five with my dad and brother, and we used to dance on top of a van while tailgating.  We still go to the games to this day (we have front row season tickets!), but we save our dancing for the stadium now.

Hochstedler
Associate Team Lead - Chemical and Biomedical Engineering
Hello, my name is William Monroe Hochstedler. I'm a rising Senior in Chemical/Biomedical Engineering. The reason I wanted to join iGEM was because of the awe inspiring possibilities for Genetic Engineering. Biology and Genetics have always interested me, but this is something that is not only life changing, but world changing! How could I pass up such an amazing opportunity to not only learn about this engineered machine, but actually help build it! A random fact about myself might be that is that I want to get into prosthetic development with a focus on integrating robotics.

Characterising Cellulose Production
Figure 16: Congo Red Assay under progress. LB, soluble and non-soluble fractions were assayed.
Cellulose Production can be easily assayed using the diazo dye Congo Red. Congo Red specifically binds cellulostic fibrils, and this binding can be measured by spectral analysis, because it causes a shift on the spectral properties of the dye, which can be monitored with a spectrophotometer (Klunk et al., 1999). In addition to this, Congo Red also allows for visual, qualitative analysis: it causes a color change of any cellulose-producing colonies by binding to the growing fibres. Therefore, cellulose production can be easily detected by eye on LB Agar plates and liquid cultures (Jolanta Sereikaite and Vladas-Algirdas Bumelis, 2006).
We assayed cellulose production on LB Agar Congo Red assay plates. Colonies containing the refactored cellulose production machinery turned red within 24h, and presented a rougher composition and brighter red color after 48h. In contrast to this, colonies presenting empty vector (negative controls), presented no color changes and maintained the characteristics of standard Escherichia coli colonies (smoother composition and standard yellow colour).
To confirm this qualitative assay, a second qualitative assay was carried out, also based on Congo Red binding. This second analysis consisted of incubating overnight cultures (both cellulose producers and empty vector controls) with Congo Red as described in Materials and Methods. Cellulose producers will present growing cellulose fibres on their extracellular surface, hence will dye red in the presence of Congo Red, unlike non-cellulose-producing cells. After spinning down the cells, a red pellet was observed that corresponded to the cellulose producing colonies. In contrast to this, negative controls did not bind Congo Red and hence maintained the standard E.coli characteristics. We consider that this qualitative data supports our design and confirms that the cellulose production operon has been successfully refactored and transferred into Escherichia coli.

Unfortunately, this sequencing alignment was overlooked at the time, and the deletion within the functional elements of the tetR-regulated promoter was not noticed until after the final assembly stage.
AND-gate assemblies
Despite the sequence errors, all four AND-gate modules were now assembled, so we proceeded to the final assembly steps.   For the split-GFP AND-gate the final plasmid design was simple, the C-terminal module would immediately succeed (i.e. exist downstream of) the N-terminal module in the same pSB1C3 plasmid vector. The N-terminal GFP plasmid was restriction digested within the BioBrick suffix, and the C-terminal GFP part (digested in the complementary fashion) was ligated in. This ligation was transformed, verified by analytical restriction digest, and then sequenced. Sequencing using both VF2 and VR primers confirmed the final assembly of this split-GFP gate in the intended order, including the prefix sequence errors previously mentioned.
For the split T7 RNAP AND-gate the design of the modular part was the same as for split-GFP, with the T7 RNAP C-terminal module ligated downstream of the N-terminal module, in a pSB1C3 vector backbone. This construct was assembled and verified through digest and sequencing. However, to determine the function of our T7 RNAP gate requires a T7-promoter driven reporter construct. We decided to use the E0040 GFP part as our reporter for split T7 RNAP function. We utilised a preexisting T7 promoter (pT7) construct from the BioBrick registry, K1321338 . This part contains the T7 promoter followed by the B0034 strong ribosome binding site, so that any protein coding sequence could be ligated immediately downstream for expression at high levels when combined with T7 RNAP. We ligated E0040 downstream of K1321338 in a pSB1C3 vector, then verified the new composite part by restriction digest and sequencing.   We decided to do an additional functional test of this pT7-GFP reporter construct by transforming the plasmid into an E. coli strain that possesses a controllable T7 RNAP integrated into its genome; BL21<DE3>. In this strain, T7 RNAP expression is induced by addition of the lactose analogue IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). We prepared three overnight cultures of our BL21<DE3> with the pT7-GFP reporter strain"

Overview of promoter activity evaluated with luminescence measurements in pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. These values derive from the experiments you can find in our Data section. Lumi per OD600 are taken at a OD600 of 0.1. Values are the average and the standard deviation of three different experiments for clone 1. Shown is the activity of the Anderson promoters J23100 (#100), J23101 (#101), J23102 (#102), J23103 (#103), J23106 (#106), J23107 (#107), J23113 (#113), J23114 (#114), J23115 (#115), J23117 (#117), J23118 (#118) as well as the activity of the constitutive promoters PliaG, and PlepA. The activity of the inducible promoter PliaI is shown with (+bac) and without (-bac) induction with bacitracin (10 μg/ml). The promoter activity of Pveg is projected from the results from the β-galactosidase assay and was not measured with luminescence measurements. For the assays shown, an intermediate version of the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE was used, which still contained one forbidden PstI site.
Evaluation of Anderson promoters in B. subtilis
The first group of promoters evaluated are the promoters of the Anderson collection (""Anderson promoters""). They have already been extensively measured in Escherichia coli where they all showed a constitutive behavior with different strength. In this project, eleven Anderson promoters were characterized in B. subtilis with the lux operon as a reporter. In B. subtilis these promoters show quite low activity (see Data Anderson promoters
).  To confirm these results some Anderson promoters were also evaluated with the reporter gene lacZ by doing β-galactosidase assays (see Data Anderson promoters
).

The purpose of our project was developing a system to generate Evobodies that are able to bind any given target protein. While a library and the mutation system grant high variability of Evobodies, we needed a method to screen for those that actually show affinity to the target protein. That is why we decided to utilize an in vivo selection system. The beauty of this approach is, that selective advantage for functional Evobodies ensures the lone survival of bacteria providing exactly those, eventually.
We were able to successfully clone the two constructs for the fusion proteins as well as several controls for our bacterial two-hybrid system . Furthermore, we checked if our fusion proteins were expressed as estimated. This was analyzed mainly using SDS PAGE and Western Blot.

FL/OD - Test 1 gave a significantly higher overall uM fluorescein/OD600 ratio compared to all other devices with values of 0.91 and 0.94 from the separate isolates, compared to a range of <0.01 and 0.18 from all other devices.
Variability - As part of the Interlab study, we analysed two separate bacterial transformants in quadruplicate. This allows an examination of the variability between replicates and between colonies. Between replicates, variation was minimal. However, between colonies containing the same device we saw a degree of variability in growth and fluorescence, thus affecting FL:OD. Figure 2 shows high levels of variability between max OD and Abs measurements of Tests 2 and 4. Fluorescence and subsequently FL:OD are directly affected by growth, but factors including inaccuracies in growth set up and the user taking the samples could have also affected these. As plasmid copy number will not be equal, this will also manifest in readings over time.

Conclusions and Future Work
After carrying out the InterLab Study we decided to take a high, medium and low expressing device and analyse their sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions. We also looked into how automation could reduce variation between results.

UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#8 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," digestion of the DNA. At higher concentrations, EDTA can inhibit enzymatic reactions, such as PCR, by chelating metals ions like Mg2+. However, the low concentration of EDTA present in IDTE buffer will not interfere with subsequent enzymatic reactions. TE buffer can be made with common lab reagents or is conveniently available for purchase from the IDT catalog. Alternatively, nuclease-free water, pH 7.0, can be used for resuspending oligonucleotides, but it will not modulate pH over time as will TE buffer. Use of HPLC- or molecular biology–grade water is preferable, as water from a deionizing system (such as Millipore) can be acidic, with a pH as low as 5.0. Water treated with DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) is not recommended for resuspension of DNA oligonucleotides because it can degrade the DNA during long-term storage.
Concentration and Dilution. Investigators commonly call in for advice regarding the concentration at which their oligos should be resuspended. This is largely up to the discretion of the researcher, and is dependent on how the oligo will be used in future experiments. Oligonucleotides are stable when stored over a large range of concentrations; however, for optimal stability we recommend concentrations no less than 1 µM, and no greater than 10 mM. IDT offers a Resuspension Calculator as part of our SciTools® suite (www.idtdna.com/scitools), which is useful for calculating the volume of buffer to add to a dried down oligo to obtain a desired concentration. Resuspension calculations can be made using the yield information that is provided both on the oligo tubes themselves and on the IDT oligo product specification sheets provided with the order. For your convenience and utility, this yield information is presented in optical density (OD) units, mass (mg), and copy number (nmoles). Our standard recommendation is to resuspend oligos to a 100 µM stock concentration, as this is a simple concentration to make and is highly versatile for subsequent dilution purposes. The volume of TE buffer required to achieve a 100 µM stock is easily determined by multiplying the number of nanomoles listed for a particular oligo by a factor of 10, and then resuspending the dry DNA in that same number of microliters of TE buffer. For example, if the oligo specification sheet states that 20.3 nmoles of oligo were delivered, add 203 µ"

While DREB1C up regulation shows significant increase in plant cold tolerance, an over expression results in dwarfism and stunted growth. It has been shown that PIF7, a Phytochrome interacting factor (PIF) which is integral to circadian rhythm controls, act as a daytime inhibitor of DREB1C (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2009). This helps mitigate damage from over expression by acting as one of many counter regulatory elements.
These genes have also been shown to have orthologs in rice and maize, OsDREB1A and ZmDREB1A respectively. Expression of these gene constructs in transgenic Arabidopsis showed increased tolerance to cold, salt, and drought stresses. While these genes do not bind all target DREB1 sequences, they show expression patterns that mimic Arabidopsis (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2006).
The DREB1C promoter could be combined with a reporter gene to serve as a valuable biosensor for cold induced stresses. The fact that it is up regulated by cold stress (MYB and MYC binding motifs) (Shinozaki, 1998) but down regulated by circadian controls (PIF7 binding) (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2009) allow for a more accurate warning when particular plants were under cold stress while keeping constitutive levels low. Evidence that it shares expression orthologs in some plants hints that the DREB1C promoter could be adapted to fit many crop types.
