UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," home, for now there is no need of cooperation between the two of us. For now I studied nDynamics per request of Cesar in case the quantitative modelling will be focused on spatial problems, and then moved on for the modelling of β-lactamase, a request from Rai with newly found papers on its kinetics.
I also took some time doing readings on Fogler's book Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering. This is because my prior study of enzyme kinetics was still confusing, mostly because the Cornish-Brown (2012) book was not presented in the way consistent with my chemical engineering background. Fogler's book, especially Chapter 7, bridged the gap.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Meeting with Cesar resulted in the topic of the quantitative modelling being set to the interaction & interaction of TALE and DNA. During the meeting Justin reported his progress on his last movie, which he completed using key-frame. To this Cesar pushed us try harder with nDynamics and Justin responded by that he needs at least a week to study the techniques properly. At the same meeting Iain asked us to start writing our progress report and filling in the wiki.
While Justin practised at home, I was working on the quantitative model. I adopted the approach of Markov chain by modelling 2D TALE-DNA binding on the strip, with discrete time and space. Since TALE is immobilized to the strip, with each time increment the DNA moves according to the movement rule specified by me, and when certain conditions are met it can either be bind to TALE permanently or can exit the strip. The difficulty was to translate those rules to the transition matrix, whose n-th power gives us the probability of state transition after n-th time increment, which we can obtain the probability of DNA capture. This model essentially hides unnecessarily fine details such as how TALE binds to DNA, and focus on the efficiency of DNA biding directly. The probability of DNA capture obtained from the model can be tested against empirical data such that certain parameters (i.e. the rules) can be modified to better describe reality.
So far a model with hard-coded constants was constructed as a proof of concept. The revision of the code with functions were partially done but was not tested for all combinations of TALE and DNA. So far the model has only considered 1 TALE and 1 DNA strand. The movement rule is a type of Brownian motion, with no TALE-DNA dissociation, with no noise or false DNA possible for binding, and with no DNA and strip interaction. But those are future"

Minnesota,2009,Team:Minnesota#Parts Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," was one of the constructs of the Tet and Lac operators that we examined for our research. Since Tet and Lac are commonly studied operators in synthetic biology, we wanted parts that involved them to be well-characterized to ensure the viability of future research. We decided to characterize these promoters by attaching them to part K081012 , which consists of a strong RBS and GFP. This 'PoPS generator' takes PoPS (Polymerase Per Second) as an input and gives GFP as an output, allowing us to indirectly measure PoPS and characterize our parts.
The figure at the right demonstrates how to combine standard biological parts to form a new composite part. In our case, the prefix part was each of our 5 promoters and these were digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and SpeI. The suffix part was the PoPS generator in every case except part J13002 , which already contained an RBS. This RBS is defined as efficiency 1.0 while the RBS contained on our PoPS generator, which has an efficiency of 0.6. We decided to characterize the entire part that UT Austin 2005 submitted, which included their RBS. These suffix parts were cut using restriction enzymes XbaI and PstI. We ligated these parts to make a composite BioBrick part in pSB3K3 , a low-medium copy plasmid with kanamycin resistance. The 2009 iGEM Judging Criteria gives MIT's characterization of part BBa_F2620 as an exemplar of parts characterization. We gratefully acknowledge their pioneering work with parts characterization and hope that our work continues to maintain the high standard for characterization of parts. We characterized our 5 promoters included with the 2009 iGEM kit in terms of:
Transfer Function: the equilibrium relationship between the input and output
Stability: how transfer function changes across multiple rounds of cell division and culture
Sequencing and Narrowing Down Parts to Characterize
We utilized the software Sequencher through the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) to trim the ends of sequences we received from the BMGC and align them. A chromatogram, shown below, told us the strength of the signal for each base pair. A good sequencing reaction will have a single peak for each base pair while problems with the primer or multiple products in the sequencing reaction will result in multiple peaks with equally strong signals for each base pair.  We wanted to compare both sequencing reactions we had as of 16 July 2009 to each other and to the sequences of the parts that were available on the Registry . We obtained successful"

How we design our biobrick
Operation Model
Mechanism
Target
What is “Detecoli”?
We intend to invent a STICKER called “Detecoli”—a word we coin by combining “detect” and “E. coli”—which changes color in environments of excess sunlight or inadequate temperatures. It will be attached to the product during manufacture and thus is able to monitor the whole process of transportation. Detecoli alerts consumers to possible deterioration or contamination by changing color and serves as a guarantee of quality.
How we design our biobrick
First, we tried to find a UV promoter, and we located BBa_I765001. However, it simply didn’t work in our experiment. So after searching on the Internet, we found a project that had been conducted by Rice University. They found that protein UirR (K1725420) and UirS (K1725410) can be used as a photoreceptor. The UirS protein is anchored in the bacterial membrane where it “sees” the color illuminating the bacterium. If the illumination is UV, UirS activates itself and releases the protein, UirR. UirR will then be phosphorylated, and become active. Active UirR is mobile, capable of binding a specific promoter called PCsiR1, and triggering the expression of the desired gene—RFP (E1010). However, we couldn’t find the promoter sequence of PcsiR1 at first, so we used Plsir (K1725400) instead. But when we eventually found the sequence, it was too late for us. So we designed this biobrick:
Then, we needed to find a way to measure the temperature, which is using"

Inflammation Detecting Bandage
- inflammation is caused by the immune response to pathogens
- can be acute to chronic
- acute inflammation: 1. increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (granulocytes) from blood to injured tissues 2. causative agent = pathogens and injured tissues 3. cells involved: neutrophils, mononuclear cells (monocytes and macrophagens) 4. primary mediator = vasoactive amine and eicosanoids - to carry out the detection mechanism, we will set a target chemical to detect - at this stage, interferon gamma is taken into our consideration: Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a dimerized soluble cytokine that is the only member of the type II class of interferon. This interferon was originally called macrophage-activating factor, a term now used to describe a larger family of proteins to which IFN-γ belongs. In humans, the IFN-γ protein is encoded by the IFNG gene.[2] - the goal of this project is to find a gene coding the protein which and react with interferon gamma and give an indication - a further step may be taken as a “damaged tissue cleaner”, which means that the bacteria can not only detect but also remove the inflammation tissue

Need to start doing experiments collecting UV absorption spectrum:
- Measure UV absorption spectrum of TSB (tryptic soy broth). As you heard from Rikke, there seems to be an issue with fluorescence and/or UVabsorption in the medium we've been using for the kill curve experiments.
- Measure E. coli UV absorption spectrum, with and without the pGlo plasmid. (a) in whole cell suspension (b) in cell lysate, (c) in crude protein extract. If we hope to be able to detect a change in UV absorption spectrum in GFP, how should we best measure the spectrum?
- Once we have a mycosporine producing strain, we'll need some way to measure its spectrum as well. Eventually, we'd like to separate the MAAs by HPLC, but just like with the GFP, we could generate a spectrum for a crude extract as well. Here's a few protocols for extracting the MAA-containing fraction with methanol:

APPLIED DESIGN
WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Applied Design demonstrates the integration of our system to tackle real-world problems. The first possible integration for our system is in wastewater treatment plants. There are two types of wastewater treatment plants: biological and physical. Biological plants use organisms to clean household wastewater, while physical plants use both chemical and physical treatments for industrial wastewater [1]. As part of our Human Practices, we toured our local biological wastewater treatment plant and recognized the processes that occur, in addition to a potential place where we could integrate it. Integrating our system in the biological treatment plant would be useful by aiding the metal removal process; however, due to the low heavy metal concentrations in average wastewater, our system is most suitable for physical/industrial wastewater treatment plants.
Current Methods
To remove the metals from industrial wastewater, there are many current methods, such as chemical precipitation. Chemical precipitation involves the use of chemicals such as lime to convert the metal ions into solid particles. From there, chemical coagulation occurs to destabilize the solid particles to allow for their precipitation by adding a negatively charged flocculant to react with the positively charged particles; this allows for the creation of larger particle groups  [2]. Chemical precipitation is efficient and generally safe. However, there are many flaws. For example, chemical precipitation produces toxic sludge, which requires additional processing to remove, increasing the cost of production. Additionally, the sludge has a low settling rate in addition to being gelatinous, which is difficult to dewater. An alternative option to chemical precipitation is electrocoagulation; however, it is unable to remove significant amounts of heavy metal[3]. Chemical precipitation also requires a very specific pH range; beyond the range, the reagent is likely to re-solubilize into the solution [4].
Comparison of Our System
Our system in comparison is more ideal because it does not produce a toxic sludge, it does not require a specific pH, and its efficiency is much higher. The sludge produced by the precipitation of the metals using our phage and bacteria does not contain chemicals. Theoretically, our phage and bacteria do not require a specific pH, although we will need to perform further tests to prove it. Furthermore, due to our system’s self"

We are glad to cooperate this year for the second time in succession with the motivated iGEM Team Heidelberg. As some of our team leaders were in the last years’ iGEM-Team, we knew about the spirit of Heidelberg’ teams and were hopeful to have a great collaboration as well as a lot of fun with them.
Fortunately, three members of them decided to meet us spontaneously after a demanding meeting within our team. The evening turned out to become great including stories about iGEM, local gastronomic specialities typical for Freiburg or Heidelberg and much more. The next day, we talked about our projects and possibilities to cooperate. It turned out that both teams use the same light system (LOV) for their experiments, although one – their team – worked with bacteria, the other one – our team – with mammalian cells. We showed them where we are working, how we work and presented our latest experimental results. In addition, we talked about the light boxes wherein we conduct our light experiments and about the appropriate conditions of a light experiment.
After we had explained to them how to handle mammalian cells, we heard some information about their interesting project “iGEM@home” that includes the possibility to share unnecessary resources of the computer to speed up modeling of complex protein structures. In terms of important aspects of their project, we were interested in their weekly published blog. A few weeks later, Team Heidelberg gave us the possibility to write a text for their blog about light induction systems, a central part of their and our project. Their blog is released every Monday.

Background
Here follows the ongoing discussion amongst the group members about the project we are putting together. In addition we include theoretical support from scientific articles for what we want to accomplish.
Cell penetrating peptide (CPP)
(High importance, really needs to be adressed. What is the best approach to penetrate the skin? What is the best approach to enter target cells? Can one approach solve both problems? If not, would the two approaches interfere with each other?)
""Protein drugs, because of their large size and hydrophilic nature, are normally precluded from effective delivery such as cell entry or tissue diffusion. Among the transport barriers, the skin poses a formidable challenge to proteins because of the impermeable stratum corneum."" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724
Nina: I found this interesting article about a molecule that can penetrate the skin. Thus we have to build fusion proteins of our protein of interest together with a molecule that can penetrate the skin . This is to have them passing through the stratum corneum, which as the article says is a very good barrier.
""To circumvent these problems that confront the current methods, we hypothesized the concept of “skin-permeable proteins”, which would possess skin-penetrating ability and thereby eliminate the need for a transport vehicle."" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724
Nina: The skin-permeable proteins seem to be good for our study concerning a model to have our proteins penetrating the skin.
""[...] we present a novel strategy for chemically constructing artificial skin-permeable proteins, illustrated by the simple conjugation of a protein to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), which would display a penetration effect on the stratum corneum barrier and transport the attached proteins into the skin."" -Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724
Nina: They have chemically constructed their CPP, but we will use a recombinant approach, meaning we will insert our genes of interest into plasmids and have bacteria expressing our proteins.
""The CPPs are capable of transporting their cargos, often linked by a covalent bond, into almost all cell types.[2] Among such CPPs, the low-molecular-weight protamine (LMWP) peptide (VSRRRRRRGGRRRR), developed"

The expression of the plasmid gives either a red fluorescence, or - if the ncAA will be incorporated at the recoded amber stop codon within the linker site - both a red and a green fluorescence. Synthetase and tRNA are constitutivly expressed in a plasmid with low copy replicon, taking into account that expression results in metabolic stress, but are not under IPTG control for he purpose of avoiding abrupt and unpredictable effects considering extra time and energy needed for their assembly. Whereas the reporter plasmid containig two fluorescence proteins, is kept under operon control for IPTG induction likewise on a low copy plasmid with ColE1.
Figure 7: reporter plasmid pRXG
This reporter plasmid and the corresponding measurement of protein formation is previously used in both an amberless E.coli strain and BL21 DE3 gold. The use of the latter is resulting in competion of the supressor tRNA with release factor one at the amber stop codon at the usual 321 amber stop codons. Most synthetases are used with low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The reporter should also be used with a low copy replicon. Assemble the part provided here into a low copy plasmid, make sure to use replicons from different incompatibility groups, eg. ColE1 and p15A and different selection markers. Keep under operon control for induction. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

Introduction
Do you need an organ for transplantation? Print one. You’d like to test pharmaceutical drugs not on animals, but directly on an organ? Print one. You need a biological system with a certain size and function? Print one. This might sound like the year 2100, and you are right, at the moment, 3D printing cell tissue is not an easy endeavor. At the moment cells have to be printed with the help of scaffolds that support the cells until they grow and attach to each other. This process takes several days, it is difficult to maintain a complex geometry, and removing the scaffolds without destroying the tissue is still a major problem. So we just went ahead and solved all problems.  Our synthetic biology department developed a possibility to 3D print cells almost as you would with plastic. You practically just get them near each other and they connect all by themselves in no time. The exact explanation of that can be found in our wiki.
Since the cells come in a fluid called bioink, we had to find a way to precisely print liquids. That was not our only aspiration. We wanted an affordable, open source product that is easy to use for everyone. We immediately thought about using a commercial syringe pump, but that"

ARABINOSE-XYLOSE AND GATE
SWEET AND
This construct was designed to function as a AND logic gate. This is due to the way the pBad/pXyl promoter was designed. We used a system that sensed l-arabinose in E.coli which was originally designed by Amelia Hardjasa and used by iGEM09_British_Columbia1,2. In the absence of arabinose, the repressor protein AraC (BBa_C0080) binds to the AraI1 operator site of pBAD and the upstream operator site AraO2, blocking transcription1. In the presence of arabinose, AraC binds to it and changes its conformation such that it interacts with the AraI1 and AraI2 operator sites, permitting transcription1. We also used a promoter inducible by xylose that has been designed for high expression in B.subtilis which was originally designed by James Chappell and used by iGEM08_Imperial_College. Xylose does not induce the promoter xylose directly, but requires the transcriptional regulator XylR (BBa_K143036). Our system consists in a fused promoter which includes both AraC and XylR binding sites. AraC and XylR are l-arabinose and xylose sensing, respectively, repressors. In this way, if we use these two inputs, each specific for each repressor we will have an AND gate.
To obtain our final construct we required the following Biological Parts:

Thus, a luciferase assay is used to study gene expression rates, since it is fast and the analysis of each sample only requires a few minutes. Moreover, it is extremely sensitive and the results are very accurate, allowing us to obtain quantitative results. Originally the system is OFF since luciferase genetic sequence is not in the correct frame. When Cas9 cuts, indels appear, system turns ON, so luciferase gene is in the correct frame and it will be correctly translated. In that case, the plant breeder could check the genome editing in a simple way. Cells are assayed for the presence of the reporter by directly measuring the enzymatic activity of the reporter protein on luciferin substrate.

Advised on arranging a timeline for project implementation. We already had valuable experience in planning iGEM activities and warned Tartu_TUIT when it is important to start developing a team wiki page, how to arrange time in October, when the most important deadlines emerge.
Tartu_TUIT:
Provided suggestions for our project.
Together:
We continued our collaboration throughout the year and members from both teams contacted each other when needed:
In May when both teams wanted to elaborately discuss the ongoing human practices work
In July, when Tartu_TUIT team had issues with the sequencing quality and asked for our assistance with sequencing their samples
Later in July we also discussed the progress of each project
In August, when Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team had a shortage of DNA bases
Virtual Meet-ups
Collaboration is all about exchanging ideas and we believe that collective thinking can do a lot of good for iGEM projects. So we have decided to arrange virtual meet-ups for teams to present  and investigate any bottlenecks or issues of their projects. The following teams participated in our virtual meet-ups:
SCUT-China_B
Groningen iGEM

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," this week we tested β-lactamase using banzylpenicillin as a substrate in combination with bromothymol blue as a pH indicator. From this assay we could see that β-lactamase could be used as a reporter enzyme producing a visible colour change (Figure 9,10).
Figure 10.Change in pH catalyzed by β-lactamase using benzylpenicillin. Bromothymol blue was used to keep track of this colour change. Different amounts of β-lactamse were tested. Commercial β-lactamase was used as a positive control. Negative controls included were bovine serum albumin, β-lactamase without the substrate and the substrate by itself.

Negative controls included were bovine serum albumin, β-lactamase without the substrate and the substrate by itself.
Week 26: October 21 - October 25
This week was spent converting our constructed ferritin into more Prussian blue ferritin for experiments. Additionally we performed an assay in order to determine whether having TALEs directly fused to ferritin or making use of coils was optimal for the assembly of ferritin and it's use as a reporter (Figure 11). Kinetic assays proved to be difficult to run this week as the spectrophotometer broke the deep bonds of trust that we had established in our relationship over the summer.
Figure 12. Samples of our parts that were converted to Prussian Blue ferritin were mole balanced in order to ensure that the same number of effective ferritin cores are present in every sample. Additionally the ferritin-coil fusion was incubated with the TALE-coil fusion part in order to allow their binding for a separate trial. Negative controls include unconverted recombinant ferritin, bovine serum albumin and a substrate only control. Samples were incubated with a TMB substrate solution for 10 minutes at a pH of 5.6. Absorbance readings were taken at the 10 minute time-point at a wavelength of 650 nm. An ANOVA (analysis of variants) was performed upon the values to determine that there was statistical difference in the data gathered (based off of three replicates). A t-test was then performed"
SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-m_-_-_TEXT.html," 3 images show the flowfield created by a pointforce at (0.000007,0.000007) with an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis. In the first image there are no walls. In the 2nd a wall is placed at y=0. In the 3rd one wall is placed at y=0 and one at y=0.000015
As the above figures show, there is quite a difference depending on how many walls you take into consideration. We decided to keep working with both the single-wall and the double-wall flowfields.
Flagella dynamics
The next thing to be considered was how the flagella depend on the fluid flow, i.e. if we place a bacterium at an angle θ with the wall, will it remain at that angle or will it get pulled around by the flow in the tube, thus changing its position? The two extreme situations would be either that the flagella stick very hard to the surface and are therefore unaffected by the flow or that they stick very gently to the surface and that their angle depends completely on the flow. In order to create an intermediate situation, we could constrain each flagellum with a harmonic potential, pulling it toward a favored angle (connected to the initial orientation of the fagella when it stick to the surface). We believe the answer lies somewhere in between the two extremes, but that does not mean the extremes can't tell us anything. We therefore decided to create a model in which the flagella keep still, and one where they are affected by the flow and a potential. The size of the potential can always be set to zero if we want to study the flagella without an affecting potential.
The basic idea then is that every flagella stuck to the surface creates their own flowfields. To get the entire flowfield we add together all the flowfields created by the individual flagella. In the case where the flagella are stationary the assumptions made so far actually shows the system. For flagella that are able to move it's a bit more tricky.
The first thing we had to figure out was how the flow created by all of the other flagella would affect one single flagellum. To do this we decided to approximate a flagellum as a string of spheres and use dragforce calculations to figure out the force with which the flowfields of the other flagella would affect the spheres. An image, showing some of the vectors involved and the procedure we used is shown below.

Variations
A digestion over night is possible. If you digest over night use only 0.1 µL restriction enzyme.
It is also possible to use PCR product as insert. Digest after PCR with corresponding restriction enzymes and clean up with PCR clean-up kit . This could lead to higher yields of insert DNA because a lot of DNA gets lost during the gel electrophoresis clean up.
Standard Freiburg BioBrick Assembly
Modified from Silver lab and Assembly standard 25 :
This assembly method can be used for fusion protein assemblies with BioBricks which are bigger than 150 bp. The BioBrick should be at least 500 bp bigger or smaller than the backbone. The BioBrick, which complies with these conditions, is used as the insert and is assembled into the prefix or suffix of the other used BioBrick, which is called vector and needs to be available in the BioBrick Assembly standard 25 . You have to differentiate between a prefix and a suffix insertion.
Suffix Insertion
Digestion of insert: at least 700 ng DNA / 10 µL volume, 1 µL 10x NEB buffer 4 + 0.1 µL 100x BSA, 0.5 µL NgoMIV (NEB) , 1 µL PstI .

Prussian Blue Ferritin
What is Ferritin?
Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that allows cells to keep iron in a soluble and non-toxic form (Munro, 1990). Ferritins across different species have very similar architecture and function, despite variations at the primary structure level (Harrison and Arosio, 1996).  The 450 kDa protein shell consists of 24 subunits that can be composed of both heavy and light chains  (Lawson et al., 1991) (Figure 1). Inside this shell is room for an iron core composed of up to 4500 Fe (III) atoms stored as ferrihydrite phosphate (Ford et al., 1984). The goal of our project is to make use of this natural nanoparticle as both a scaffold and a reporter system.

How can Ferritin be a Reporter?
Iron is worthy of attention because of its ability to participate in Fenton chemistry. In this reaction, iron acts as a catalyst to cause the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen-radical species (Figure 2). The resulting hydroxyl radical can cause the oxidation of common horseradish peroxidase substrates such as 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)"

Modeling Interactions Between 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)
Introduction
Kinetic Modeling
1TYZ Strutural Modeling Using PYMOL
Homologous Alignment Modeling
Introduction
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase is a pyridoxal 5’ phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the chemical conversion of  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate,  the immediate precursor of ethylene synthesis in plants, and water to ɑ-ketobutyrate + ammonia. Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  and water, and its two products are ketobutyric acid and ammonia (1). This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolyses, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in compounds that have not been otherwise categorized within EC number 3.5.
Figure 1: A visual representation of the ACC deaminase catalyzed reaction.
ACC is emitted from seeds or plant roots and then metabolized by bacteria expressing ACC deaminase activity, which stimulates plant ACC outflow, decreasing the root ACC concentration and root ethylene evolution and increasing root growth. The widespread of ACC deaminase activity has been noted in several Burkholderia species. The common association of these species with plants suggests that this genus could be a major contributor to plant growth under natural conditions. From this perspective, the approach of reducing the production of ethylene levels in plants by increasing the activity of ACC deaminase may be an effective strategy to improve plant growth under a variety of stressful conditions, such as flooding, high saline conditions, and drought. In this work we investigated the kinetic properties of ACC deaminase, structural properties including ways to mutate residues surrounding the cofactor Pyridoxal Phosphate binding site, and ultimately used modeling to determine which homolog of ACC deaminase"
Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," on GMOs being released into the environment may be something to worry about. He agreed with us that perhaps it is best to pitch our technology to water companies or other companies where it will be in a contained and controlled environment instead of implementing it directly in the environment. We came to this conclusion after considering the application procedure and fee that we previously discussed with DEFRA.

Interview with Dr. David Tompkins and PhD student Katie Ward - Aqua Enviro 04/08/2017
We got into touch with Dr. David Tompkins and Katie Ward, a PhD student currently interning at Aqua Enviro . We discussed thoroughly about the market and competitors that we’ll have to address in order to successfully pitch our project. We were introduced to Ostara , a company that is similar to our project in the way they do phosphorus precipitation as struvite following biological phosphorus removal and is currently implementing their technology at commercial scale in the UK. Also, we were introduced to Microvi , a company that has a phosphate removal technology in which specific microorganisms are cultivated in special beads that provide optimal living conditions.
In addition, we were told that current phosphate removal methods are mostly chemical dosing in the UK to achieve 0.1-1 ppm phosphorus in the effluent discharge to surface water.
“Biological phosphate removal has not been taken up very widely in the UK; perception being, it is not as efficient as chemical dosing. The discharge consent that people are looking at are difficult to achieve with biological approaches.”
- Dr. David Tompkins
Chemical dosing seems to be the preferred route in the UK because it can guarantee the final concentration needed. The downside to this technology is that the dosing agent has to be purchased and the result of chemical dosing is sludge which needs to be processed further. While biological approaches also normally produce sludge that requires treatment, water companies perceive that they are more difficult to use and does not guarantee the removal of phosphorus to its required final concentration. That means that we’ll have to consistently prove that our project would be able to remove phosphate in a predictable and consistent manner to successfully sell our project.

We believe that mösbi could be a game-changer in giving more people a gateway into synthetic biology without the need for expert knowledge or any high-tech tools. Here we’ll present the research that took us beyond the bench and had us convinced, and the historical basis of cautious but successful modifications to plant husbandry practices.
The field of Synthetic Biology is set to boom. Current estimates predict the global market for synthetic biology to “grow to $16 billion by 2018” (The Atlantic, 20147). Launching mösbi in such a promising landscape for industry growth gives great prospects for its ongoing evolution and improvement. Within and proximal to the biohacker community there is already an interest in using biotech to improve plant aesthetics: 49% of respondents to a survey by revolutionbio.org would “purchase garden plants with new colours & scents developed by biotechnology.""8  - a demand that fits perfectly with our use of chromoproteins (colours) and raspberry ketones (scents)  as circuit outputs.
Having such a promising potential user-base for mösbi is integral to why we think it could become so instrumental in introducing new people to synthetic biology. For example, as hobbyists and enthusiasts tinker with and refine mӧsbi, they’ll make new modules that broaden the combinatorial options available through crossing. We believe that our chassis could rapidly embody one of the easiest hands-on introductions to principles of synbio design.
Mösbi could also significantly improve how people engage with synthetic biology by way of the innate simplicity and familiarity of how it works: mankind has been using cross-pollination to produce plants with desired traits for hundreds years (ISAAA, 20069). Plus, performing cross-pollination is still common in amateur horticulture, and is one of the top three techniques recommended by a British gardening company that is currently running a competition to “find or create a new plant”10. Hence our project uniquely capitalises on already popular concepts with which the wider public is already comfortable. By promoting crossing as the principle means of ‘transformation’ with our chassis, we could really help to demystify synthetic biology and dispel the apprehension often experienced by people coming across the technology for the first time (The Wilson Centre, 2013)5.
One difficulty that remains is that recombining genes between related organisms already existing in the natural world is quite different to directly inserting new genes or even complete genetic circuits into living organisms – and that is a difference that is not without controversy. Many express concerns such as the potential unknown"

My research interests lie in developing microorganisms capable of producing small molecules of significant social, economic, and scientific value from renewable resources. In the past decades, the field of biotechnology has blossomed to allow the production of valuable proteins including restriction enzymes, polymerases, blood factors, antibodies, and other therapeutic enzymes at industrial scale and cost. Recent work has shifted towards the production of small therapeutic molecules that are difficult to synthesize de novo due to their complexity. The high value ($ per molecule) of these chemicals allows for an economically viable process to be designed using today's technologies. In the coming decades, our economy will need to be based on renewable resources in order to sustain itself. As such, the chemical industry will need to discover renewable sources for its specialty chemicals and materials that are currently derived from fossil fuels. To reach such ends, my research group will develop new tools for engineering biological systems and explore the world of protein engineering in order to develop new biological catalysts for essential chemical reactions. It is my goal to develop a leading laboratory in the field of Synthetic Biology in order to harness the growing database of biological parts for use in developing novel technologies for chemical synthesis.

Our laboratory studies microbial biochemistry with an emphasis on understanding the molecular mechanisms that give rise to phenotypes in bacteria.  Although our current understanding of the complexity of a bacterium is still emerging, it is becoming clear that the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that govern cellular homeostasis are far more sophisticated than we had imagined.  Our approach to the study of bacteria is driven by the development of new capabilities for studying single cells or small groups of cells and the application of these techniques to dissect the molecular choreography within the cell.  This research is interdisciplinary and is based on a fusion of techniques from biology, physics, engineering, and chemistry.

The biobrick was further engineered by testing the native CpxR target sequence that is found in front of CpxA in the E.coli genome (as Calgary's BBa_K339007 did not include the whole sequence). These are the biobricks BBa_K1486049 and BBa_K1486050 , with the promoter in forward and reverse direction respectively.
Submitted the two parts of the split of EPIC Firefly luciferase (N-terminal part ( BBa_K1486016 ) and C-terminal part ( BBa_K1486017 )) from Cambridge 2010. The plasmid ( BBa_K1486018 ) containing the two parts of the split separated by a spacer can be very useful as a negative control or to establish a background noise for a complementation assay experiment.
Compared the EPIC Firefly luciferase from Cambridge 2010 team to the renilla luciferase ( BBa_K1486022 ) in the same conditions, to determine which one is best suited for a complementation assay experiment. The full and split luciferases have been compared. Renilla luciferase (full and splits( BBa_K1486021 )) have been submitted.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Biologie Synthetique_-_-_TEXT.html,"’on peut breveter quelque chose de vivant, lui conférant de ce fait, une valeur marchande ? C’est à cette question qu’est confrontée la biologie synthétique.
Pensez-vous qu'un organisme créé synthétiquement doit être brevetable ?
À l’instar d’autres technologies, la biologie synthétique nous ferait entrer, dans une nouvelle ère, celle de la « biolithique »1, où le vivant devient l’outil. Un outil qui pourrait être grandement prometteur pour guérir de nombreuses maladies. Mais est ce que son objectif thérapeutique légifère t-elle son utilisation ? La biologie synthétique interpelle donc notre conception du vivant. Où se situe la frontière entre le naturel et l’artificiel ? Peut-on se permettre de tout créer à partir du vivant ? Risque-ton de faire « diverger » l’évolution ?
50 % des étudiants ont tendance à rejeter cette éventualité d’une instrumentalisation libre sous prétexte thérapeutique, néanmoins, 31 % pourrait l’envisager et 19% des étudiants se posent la question. Quant à une dérive de l’évolution, 50 % des étudiants restent assez convaincus que l’évolution ne peut être compromise par la biologie synthétique, cependant 31 % des étudiants sont pensent le contraire.
Dans le cadre d'une application thérapeutique, peut-on se permettre de tout créer à partir du vivant ?
Risque t-on de faire diverger l'évolution ?
«Les chercheurs doivent se poser ces questions et prendre garde aux utilisations non éthiques qui peuvent êtres faites de ces technologies, même dans un but de guérir les maladies », cette crainte d’un étudiant en dit long sur les interrogations que soulèvent l’instrumentalisation du vivant auquelle fait face la biologie synthétique.
En effet, chaque avancée de la recherche biologique contient son lot de questionnement sur les implications sanitaires, environnementales, sociales et éthiques des applications possibles de ces découvertes. Est-on capable de contrôler le vivant ? Sommes-nous en mesure de maîtriser la propagation des systèmes que l’on"

BIT,2018,Team:BIT#Hardware#Microarray_-_-_TEXT.html,". Its light transmittance is as high as 93%, which is friendly to fluorescence detection.
At present, we have designed three sizes of chips, each chip has a total size of 30 × 30mm, and the height is determined by the thickness of the acrylic. In use, the reacted biological sample is injected into the chip, and each chip can be used to detect a plurality of biological samples. Taking a 9×9mm chip as an example, the chip has a total of 9 liquid passages, one of which is used as a control when used, and the other can detect one sample.
The processing of PMMA chips is relatively simple. If only less than ten disease markers need to be detected, it is more convenient to use PMMA chips. Figure (Fig. 2) is our production process.
Fig.2 Schematic digram of PMMA chip production.(a)Draw a chip digram on the computer;(b)Export the chip map to the laser cutting machine;(c)Using a laser cutting machine to complete the preliminary production of the chip;(d)Arranging, aligning, and, fixing the layers of the chip in accordance with the design;(e)Completing the bonding of the chip using an oven;(f)Completion of chip production.
Detailed steps to make a PMMA based chip.
Draw a designed chip map using SOLIDWORKS and export it to DXF file format;
Use RDWorksV8 to import the drawn print files into the laser cutting machine.
Place a 2mm thick acrylic plate in the laser cutting machine, set the cutting speed to 5mm/s, start the laser cutting machine, and wait for the chip to be cut.
After cutting the layers of the chip, wash and dry with deionized water;
Arrange, align and align the layers of the chip according to the design;
Clamp the chip with two aluminum plates to make the layers of the chip closely fit together;
Put the aluminum plate and chip into the oven at 170 °C, control the temperature change within ±5 °C, and heat for 14 min.
Take out the heated aluminum plate and chip, and apply a small amount of water to the outside of the aluminum plate with a test tube brush to slowly cool it to a free evaporation state.
Place the cooled aluminum plate and chip in a ventilated place, and then take out the chip after natural air cooling to check whether the bonding is successful. If successful, the chip is completed.
Precautions:
When cutting the chip, complete it as much as possible, and repeating the cutting"

Energy and Electrons are Required for Carbon Fixation
For the Calvin cycle to proceed, energy in the form of ATP and electrons carried by NADPH are required. In photosynthesising organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these constituents are provided by photophosphorylation performed by the photosystem complex. When engineering E. coli to perform photophosphorylation, 13 genes for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a and 17 genes for the biosynthesis of photosystem II need to be heterogeneously expressed. Several attempts have been made at expressing part of it, such as the psbA gene Efimov VA, Reverdatto SV, Beilinson BA, Fradkov AF, Chakhmakhcheva OG.

This year, iGEM McMaster has had the pleasure of being able to collaborate with a number of different iGEM teams. Here are some of our highlights from this year.
The oGEM Conference
The Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine Network (oGEM) Conference is an annual event that brings iGEM teams from across the province of Ontario, Canada together to discuss their research projects, initiate collaborations, and hold discourse on both the successes and challenges of synthetic biology research. This year, we had the pleasure of planning and hosting this annual event at McMaster University, bringing together the iGEM teams from Univeristy of Toronto , Queen's University , University of Guelph , University of Ottawa , University of Waterloo , and Brock University , as well as hosting Western University's Synthetic Biology group. There, we also had the fortune of having Dr. Benjamin Scott, Synbio Canada President and iGEM alumnus, come to speak to us about his research in synthetic biology. Additionally, we introduced a student SynBio roundtable discussion session in response to the discussion paper published following the first National Synthetic Biology Conference here in Canada.
All the different team members of oGEM!
University of Waterloo
Throughout the year, we also had a mutually beneficial advisory relationship with the iGEM Waterloo team. Specifically, we met with Clara Fikry from the team several times early in calendar year to discuss the projects we were considering undertaking and the paths that we would take to do so. Through much discussion and meetings between the teams, we were able to share feedback and learn from each other. Additionally, Max Reed, a member from Waterloo who had led their amyloid-related iGEM project last year, took the time to speak to us as we are looking at amyloid-beta. We discussed how to obtain bacterial growth curves, which medium to use for best resuults, amyloid protein overexpression, and inclusion body formation. Last, but not least, the Waterloo team was kind enough to provide us with the required E. coli DH5-alpha cells for the Interlab study so that we could meet its second requirement.

Sharing with our Community
This year our team had the opportunity to participate in several outreach activities both within our city and across our province. Being an Albertan team, it was easy to get people talking about the beef industry and the continual risk of E. coli outbreaks. In addition to talking to experts in the beef industry though, we wanted to carry our dialogue out into the community, to your everyday beef-consumer here in Alberta. Through our outreach activities, we got the opportunity to do just that. In addition to some new actvities such as our participation in Beakerhead, we were also able to continue to build some of the community relationships that we started last year, by continuing our work with the Telus Spark Centre and Genome Alberta.
With our ongoing collaboration with the Calgary Telus Spark Centre, we were able to interface with over 200 Calgarians who got to do some hands on science at our station. At Beakerhead, we got to be part of a 5 day science and technology festival right in the downtown core of Calgary. We got to showcase some of our work to industry and academia through continued collaboration with Genome Alberta.  Finally,  we ventured out of Calgary to Consort Alberta where we mentored their first ever high school iGEM team who took the prize for best human practices at the High school jamboree last spring. To find about more about some of these events, follow the links below.

Week 37: 10/9- 16/10 This week, the LiU-iGEM team went to central Linköping to find participants for our survey and enlighten people about synthetic biology and about our project. Week 38: 15/9 - 21/9 We are trying to get our results we want to achieve our goal before the Wiki-freeze . We are still doing some mutagenesis and working with a collaboration with Lund which is about exchanging our Biobricks and try to co-express them. We are doing some SDS-page which takes forever to do, but we are hoping for good results. Week 39: 22/9 - 28/9 This week we sent in our Team banner, which is something the teams are going to see in the Giant Jamboree in Boston. (We hope you will listen to our presentation on thursday 25/10 and come to our poster to discuss our project!). Week 40: 29/9 - 7/10 This week our team member Martin Viksten had a TEDx-talk in Norrköping about iGEM and about our vision. In the lab we had progress and sent our mutagenesis to Germany for sequencing. We also started to do the protein-expression of our co-induction system. The system utilizes chaperone expression to increase protein folding. The proteins we co-induced with chaperones were aggregation prone proteins.

Efficiency of the Database Entries
86% of participants would like to see a ranking/rating      system for the parts by the other iGEM users which will be one indication      of if a part is working and how well in different laboratories. Few had concerns about how well the rating system will work for      rarely used parts while the widely used parts would even more popular      due the the rating system. Still many believes this would be one      futher towards a peer-reviewed quality control system for the parts.
61% of participants agreed that parts should be updated      regularly by the designers, where most agreed at least when there      is new information on the parts. It has also been suggested      to give permission to all the users of that part for updating information.
73% of participants have been agree with us that excluding      the low ranking parts or the parts with negative feedback from the      future plates will increase efficiency of the system. The      major concern about excluding any part is losing the variety of      parts in the database. Few recommends excluding only the parts that      are not working.
“Efficiency shouldn't be top priority in a database. First and foremost,     data is the top priority. Excluding those parts would make the system     more efficient”
“Some parts may be rare or new and have low efficiency, but can be very important! Getting rid of them would eliminate any chance of improvement     to these parts, which not only a qualifier for an iGEM gold medal, but     also one of the focuses of biobricks.”
We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or with     negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still archive     them and make their data available through the parts registry. So the     while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated, fully     working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on a more     exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the parts     stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be encouraged     as an collaborative effort.
New Options for the Parts Registry Database
96% of participants are like minded with us that it      will be useful to have a link out to the gene/protein information      of the parts and - %97 of participants have been agree that they      would like to know if a part is also involved in known biological      pathways.
For receiving pathway information more participants have     voted for NCBI Cog (59%) than KEGG pathways (38%) when the responses     for"

Our goal is to express Pantide successfully. We used E. coli BL21 rosetta-gami strain to cultivate genes. Afterward, we sonicated E. coli and then ran SDS-PAGE to make sure that Pantide fell into the correct ranges. There are seven kinds of BioBricks, and the mass of them are showed below.(Table 2)
The gel of SDS-PAGE result is correct, and here is our result.(Figure 2a, 2b, 2c)

Purification of Pantide
After sonicated E. coli, we further purified Pantide to check whether it is well-expressed. The purified products’ length can be seen in the table below.(Table 3)
The gel of SDS-PAGE result of Hv1a, Sf1a, OAIP have a length of 5kDa~7 kDa；and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, OAIP-Lectin, and Hv1a-GS linker-Lectin have a length of 17kDa~19kDa.(Figure 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g) As a result, the constructions of BioBrick were correct.

Research Interests
Salmonella Typhi is an exclusive human pathogen and the cause of typhoid fever, a life-threatening systemic disease that affects millions of people and kills more than 200,000 every year. The goal of my research is to gain insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Salmonella Typhi pathogenesis and its human-adaptation. We are using an advanced cell biological approach, where imaging and biochemical analyses are integrated by genetic, genomic and proteomic methods. These studies also intend to address fundamental questions in the cell biology of the host. One main question that we are focusing on is about the host mechanisms restricting S. Typhi from infecting non-susceptible hosts.

Human Practices
Investigating the most basic theories of biology is not only important to laboratory research, but applies to students as well. Through the distribution of a molecular biology animation and the presentation of our research to high school students, the Penn State iGEM team has reached out to the community with its foundational research.
Basics of Molecular Biology Animation >>
Human Practices
State College High School Presentation
Questioning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology takes a foundational approach to the most strongly-held beliefs in the field. As we designed our projects, the Penn State team realized that this research applied not only to current researchers, but to those who were just beginning to learn the basic theories that govern life as we know it. High school students are taught to the Central Dogma, and  accept it as true without a second thought. Showing them another side of molecular biology would provide an interesting counterpoint to their book-taught knowledge.
The Penn State iGEM team visited a local high school and presented our designs and project objectives to a high school biology class. We began the seminar with a preview of the Basics of Molecular Biology animation compiled during the summer. Afterward, we presented our individual projects, stressing the importance of investigating outliers in a scientific field. The students were attentive, engaged, and asked excellent questions. Though the Penn State team may have introduced a shameless plug for the iGEM high school division, the experience was enlightening for both parties.
Animation and Prezi Distribution
A cartoon animation of the basics of synthetic and molecular biology was developed and produced by one of our team members, Kevin Thyne. The Blender animation has been uploaded to YouTube, along with three Prezi animations describing the individual project designs and results. Both the animation and the Prezis are publically available, and all were shown at the State College High School presentation

Plan for today is to try purify some HIS proteins through the columns.
Will run 6 lanes in SDS gel: 1) DH5A 2) DH5A His-purified First 3) DH5A His-purified Second 4) Nox-plasmid in SDS 5) Nox His-purified First 6) Nox His-purified Second
Heat shocked comp cells with the new starvation reporter plasmid. There are now 5 boxes of comp cells in the lower compartment of the -80 because of biochemstry. Hopefully what I used was DH5alpha, as it was not ours. Cells were in 42 C for 90 instead of 45 seconds, as for some reason our printed protocol calls for 2 minute incubation at 42.

Many ""successful"" colonies for the starvation sensor after heat shocking into BL21 last night, rather than DH5alpha. Weird Colony-PCR results though, suggesting the creation of something other that what was intended. The first gel is below. This PCR will be performed again.

UT-Tokyo,2013,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cell and binds to LuxR.
2, the AHL-LuxR complex binds to the pLux/Tet hybrid promoter and increase the transcription rate of genes including luxI.
3, LuxI synthesizes AHL.
Figure. 9 Positive feedback loop.
This process occurs not only in a single cell. Intercellular positive feedback loops are formed and function as intercellular coupling like a spreading positive membrane potential of a nerve cell axon (Figure 10); AHL is synthesized in a cell and diffuses across cell membrane, and activates transcription in other cells. This cell-cell communication enables intercellular synchronization of gene expression, which drives the one directional movement of the “clock hand”.
Figure 10 Intercellular coupling
Multi-Negative feedback system
Our clock “gear” has 4 negative feedback loops of different mechanisms (Table3), which are formed by tetR, aiiA, anti-mCherry sRNA, and anti-luxI sRNA (Fig. 11). All suppressors are regulated under the pLux/Tet promoter and expressed when stimulated by AHL. This negative feedback loops makes falling phase of gene expression.
Figure 11 Multi-negative feedback system
Table 3 Multi-negative feedback system
TetR binds to pLux/tet and represses transcription of mCherry, luxI, and 4 suppressors including tetR.
AiiA degrades AHL in order to repress transcription indirectly.
The sRNAs might work as a rapid suppressor for two reasons; 1. they repress the translation, which is the final step of prokaryotic gene expression, 2. they are quickly produced since they do not require time for translation of themselves. Both of sRNAs facilitate degradation of mRNA that contains mCherry, luxI, tetR, and aiiA. Anti-mCherry sRNA represses translation of mCherry gene, and anti-luxI does that of luxI gene. Repression of luxI causes decreased production of AHL, while repression of mCherry doesn’t affect AHL.
The differences of mechanisms may lead to various patterns of suppression of various strength and time (Fig. 12). This multi-negative feedback system is a novel one which is not reported in previous papers or past iGEM projects. We designed 20 combinations of these 4 negative feedback loops and sought for the best combination for the Multicellular Analog Clock.
Hasty group reported[1] the system with only one negative feedback loop of AiiA. Their system generated synchronized oscillation. This system shows bursts without any external stimuli"

Caltech,2012,Team:Caltech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"  One of our objectives was to knock out E. coli’s NADH dehydrogenase enzymes Nuo and Ndh, which typically oxidize NADH.  E. coli’s genome has been entirely sequenced, so we tried lambda red recombination engineering to target the two enzymes’ genes.  We are still trying to knock out both genes in one strain of E. coli.
The production pathways we plan to introduce in E. coli require NADH for the reactions; however, E. coli require NADH to donate protons and generate the proton-motive force that drives its ATP synthase to produce ATP. E. coli uses NADH dehydrogenase to convert NADH to NAD+ and expel the proton outside of the cell membrane. Thus, we tried to increase yield is by incorporating a proteorhodopsin – dependent energy producing mechanism into the cells.  Proteorhodopsin is a proton pump originally found in marine organisms.  We built our proteorhodopsin strain using PCA assembly based on the information from the paper Light-powering Escherichia coli with proteorhodopsin .  Our characterization of the part is inconclusive, but after more testing we hope to find that the ATP levels will increase in proteorhodopsin strains when the normal proton motive force producer, the electron transport chain, is knocked out.  Correspondingly, we then plan to test our hypothesis that the more NADH available to assist in reduction during fatty acid synthesis, the higher our alkyl ester yield will be.

Bacterial Animation
View the Bacterial Animation Notebook
For the bacterial animation project, we are working on creating a construct of a fluorescent protein (mCherry), with a degradation tag attached into a light sensing system in Escherichia Coli that will sense light and “photograph” a light pattern as a high-definition chemical image and then animate by the degradation tag. We obtained the fluorescent strain from the Murray Lab at Caltech.  This project was a collaboration with students from Cal Arts, who will focus on the animation of these coliroid plates. Not only is this project fun, it has potential applications in specific temporal and spatial control of biofilms. In addition to publicizing synthetic biology, our project will satisfy one of iGEM’s requirements of human practices and outreach.
This concept of designing a bacterial system in coliroid that is switched between different states by light has been previously achieved with expression of a lacZ reporter. The system allows a"

Compared with control groups, green fluorescence intensity and mRNA levels were dramatically reduced in groups treated with gRNA and tCas9-CIBN. These results suggest that gRNA can specifically guide tCas9 to target upstream of CSPA promoter, thereby to inhibit CSPA promoter to reduce GFP expression levels.
Activation capability validation
Spatially controlled activation of gene expression was achieved in strains co-transfected with the LACE system, a reporter vector containing a gRNA target sequence upstream of CSPA promoter and the eGFP gene. Strains transfected with light-activated CRISPR/Cas9 effector (LACE) and incubated in the dark did not show a significant difference in eGFP levels compared to control groups transfected with empty plasmid. Strains containing the LACE system and gRNA exhibited significantly brighter eGFP fluorescence intensity when illuminated compared to when incubated in the dark. Activation of the eGFP reporter in strains transfected with the gRNA and LACE constructs, the gRNA and tCas9-VP64 expression plasmid or an empty plasmid as a negative control was quantified after 24 hours of illumination or incubation in the dark.

THE TEAM
SAFETY & PROTOCOLS
Meet the team!
This summer I worked on the wet lab components of our project including experimental design and data analysis.
Hi! My name is Joanne Wu and I am a rising senior pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I joined iGEM because I think there is a lot to learn from nature in designing more adaptive, resilient, and efficient systems.
This summer I led our team’s efforts in exploring our problem space and iteratively refining our project goals. My interest in STEM education and engagement led me to spearhead the lesson plan component of our project. For this endeavor I worked closely with Gabe to first understand the biology behind our biosensor and then with various educators to figure out the most effective way to present this information. My interest in civic engagement prompted me to work closely with Muntaha to refine our Antimicrobial Footprint app. I also created and delivered our presentation at the iGEM symposium with Gabe and put together this wiki.
Hi! My name is Muntaha Samad and I am a third year at UC Davis studying Computer Science and Engineering.  I am very interested in mobile deep linking, and the idea of making the app world fluid like the web. I also really enjoy robotics and am interested in pursuing a career working with smart prosthetics.  In my free time I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and working for the UC Davis C-STEM Center. I decided to join iGEM to gain more experience programming in the context of solving biological problems.
This summer I produced an app that calculates your antimicrobial footprint and raises awareness about the unnecessary and potentially harmful ubiquity of antimicrobials in our environment.
Hello, I am Logan Vinson a fourth year Genetics and Genomics major at UC Davis. My career interests include genetic monitoring and breeding selection for endangered species and populations under inbred depression and genetic bottleneck. In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing and engineering. I first found out about iGEM while i was at my junior college by my biology professor. She told me about the competition after i had expressed interest in genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. Ever since then i had made it my personal and professional goal to compete in iGEM.
This summer I worked on genetic assembly and integration, expression and protein purification. I also helped with outreach and data collection.

Carol Chan
I am currently studying chemical engineering with a biomedical engineering specialization at the University of Calgary. Prior to starting my engineering degree, I completed a degree in biomedical sciences. The reason I decided to join the 2009 iGEM team is because the idea of synthetic biology is new and exciting. More importantly, I have the great opportunity to experiment engineering with biology, which is where most of my interests lie. I will also be exposed to collaborative teamwork which is an essential element of engineering. Some of my other interests include sports, sports and more sports. I don't play very many sports, but I sure love watching football and hockey on TV! I also like cooking, learning new recipes from dad and watching movies!
Vicki Komisar
I just wrapped up my fourth year in the University of Toronto’s Engineering Science program, with a specialization in biomedical engineering. I am excited to be back in Calgary and representing my hometown in my first iGEM experience, with a focus on the lab work and modeling. My experience over the last four years has been all across the board, with summer research projects in biomechanics and rehabilitation engineering; as well as coursework that entailed a series of rather nefarious biomedical and nanoparticle-based wet labs. When I’m not satisfying my lust for bacterial genomics, I’m usually either swimming, skating or learning German in preparation for a work placement in Bern, Switzerland. If you’re at the jamboree, come say hi. I’ll even throw in a free horoscope reading for the fun of it! Cheers!
Chinmoyee Mukerji
I am a 3rd year student studying Chemical Engineering at the University of Calgary. This year, I will be helping to promote iGEM alongside the Marketing and Management teams. I joined this team because synthetic biology fascinates me. I believe that it is paving the way for a technological revolution. I hope to increase awareness in the community about synthetic biology and how it may open doors for further advancements through the accomplishments of our iGEM team. Outside of summer work, I enjoy playing the piano. I often sing classical Indian songs. I love painting, sketching- anything involving art!  I also love photography and gardening.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," to inform the (possibly illiterate) population about the device and its use.
Even taking measures, some responsibility will always be transferred. In the case of a catastrophe resulting from the misuse of the device, there will be a trial in which it will be determined who has more responsibility in that specific situation. This will depend on factors such as the intention of the end-user and the opportunities that the producer had to prevent the catastrophe. However, even if the end-user turns out to be most responsible, the producer will also be affected negatively because the product will be perceived as unsafe and the catastrophe will bring bad press to the company. Therefore, even when considering the transfer of responsibility, it is in the producer's best interest to prevent a misuse of their technology.
Conclusions: Developers have the duty to do everything in their power to make their technology safe, within certain reasonable limits. It is not only what they should do, it is also in their best interest to develop a safe technology, as well as transfer as little responsibility as possible to the end-user.
Patient Autonomy
Patient autonomy related to diagnostics is just one part of medical ethics. Medical ethics is a broad field that is based on four pillars: beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy (read about them here ). Concerning our device, the first three are relatively easy to analyze. Mantis complies with the beneficence principle because it provides a means to detect diseases at an early stage and the possibility to provide subsequent treatment(s), as well as helping to control the spread of infectious diseases. It complies with the non-maleficence principle because the technology itself does not pose any danger to the patient (this does not consider the unethical use by the user, e.g. sacrificing infected patients). Additionally, Mantis complies with the justice principle because it will be open source, affordable and easy to produce, so that society will be able to take advantage of the technology, and not only a privileged part of the population. However, the autonomy principle is a bit more difficult to analyze; how should governmental bodies react in a deadly epidemic emergency, when the control of the disease is necessary? How autonomic is the decision of the patient when their knowledge about the situation and the device is limited?
Who should take decisions?
When talking about autonomy and technologies we can think of three categories for decision-making processes:
The technology makes the decision after the measurement. For example, pacemakers are  in-the-loop systems where the decision of the device is not affected by a human.
The technology is used to take measures or to diagnose, but the"

The concentration of 4-Nitrophenol released by PHB depolymerase (phaz1) activity. Empty Vector and Substrate alone were used as negative controls. Figure by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM
The above graph shows that greater esterase activity occurs when the phaz1 cell lysate is in the reaction mixture. The graph shows that there is also esterase activity occuring in the Empty Vector and Substrate alone reaction mixtures, but this is due to the imidazole present in the Tris-HCl buffer, which acts as a general base catalysis. (6)
Purified enzyme assay
Since the phaz1 BBa_K1149010 construct contains a His tag, the protein could be purified by metal affinity chromatography . The colourimetric assay was carried out, as with the cell lysate. 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer was used instead of the Tris-HCl buffer, to eliminate the esterase activity caused by imidazole in the buffer used previously. Every 30 seconds for 30 minutes the absorbance at 405 nm of the reaction mixture was recorded. The reaction mixture contained 1 ml of phosphate buffer, 2.5 µL of purified PHB depolyermase (stock concentration 0.230 mg/ml) and para-Nitrophenyl butyrate to make final concentrations of 50 µM, 100 µM, 150 µM, 200 µM and 250 µM of substrate.
The purified PHB depolyermase (phaz1) is definitely active. The graph shows that more 4-Nitrophenol is produced with greater concentrations of para-Nitrophenyl butyrate. Figure by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM
The above graph shows how the concentration of 4-Nitrophenol produced is greater when the para-Nitrophenyl butyrate substrate concentration is greater. This data shows that we have successfully purified active PHB depolyermase.
SDS PAGE gel shows that PHB depolymerase was purified from the crude cell extract. Figure by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM

What are we facing?
Biosafety has always been a major concern to the public, to the companies and to the researchers. Doubts and worries were raised just as genetic technology was invented. With the rapid growth of synthetic biology and the iGEM community, and more and more synthetic biology products being built with widely distributed DNA toolkits or the inexpensive DNA synthesis service(Synthetic and Will); we are facing the unprecedented biosafety issue of unwanted leakage of synthetic biology products to the environment that may cause unexpected but likely disastrous problems.
Predecessors
For decades, researchers were striving to build biosafety devices through auxotrophy or external inducive kill switches(Lee et al.); of the latter holins and restriction enzymes are most commonly used. Most failures of the previous devices were due to mutations and evolution of immunity(Moe-Behrens et al.) .
The two major threats of engineered microbes’ leakage are the possible horizontal gene transfer which will lead to the spread of recombinant DNA to the ecosystem, or the fact that engineered bacteria could contaminate or overrun the natural habitat.(Wright et al.))
Project Xscape
Under this circumstance, this year we decided to be a fundamentalist to synthetic biology, using genetic circuits and logic gates to establish biosafety devices which can apply to real-world situations.
Since cell death and lysis mean there is a continual presence of free DNA in the environment, holins, which are most widely used are excluded from our choices, and colicin E2 nucleases (Darmstadt iGEM2016) came into our site. We choose site non-specific nucleases since the entire genome and plasmids needed to be entirely digested to prevent the spread, and we use nucleases from a different family to prevent the possible evolution of nuclease inhibitors. Artificial DNA, RNA, and amino acids are a good solution, but due to its high cost so far, it is not applicable to most of the user.
For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the"

22 September - 28 September
 
The sequences of NisA, NisC, NisRK and sfGFP(Bs) were analyzed. The sequences of NisA and sfGFP(Bs) were completely correct. The sequence of NisC showed that a mutation occured at residue 185, where an AAT was changed to an AAA, changing an asparagine to a lysine. The changed amino acid was on the outside of the protein, so may not have an effect on the function of NisC. The sequence of NisRK showed two mutations. At residue 199 of NisR a GAA was changed to a GAG, not changing the amino acid at this position. At residue 300 of NisK an ACA was changed to an ATA, changing a threonine to an isoleucine. The PNisI with RBS showed a large mutation. At position 508, 18 basepairs were missing. Therefore it was decided to not send PNisI to iGEM HQ anymore.
 
A PCR was done to generate fragments for assembling genes that had illegal restriction sites. Every fragment was succesfully amplified. The fragments were purified using the GeneJET PCR clean up kit. Not all fragments have a sufficient concentration or purity, so only the fragments for the combined BioBrick of NisF, NisE and NisG was made using Gibson assembly. The transformants that contained pSB1C3 with NisFEG were tested using colony PCR. No positive transformants were found.

Saturday August 25th
We PCR screened the transformations from yesterday to see if we actually got the parts. It turns out that we successfully got the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, K20600 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, and the R0010 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015. This is excellent because now we are much closer to the final product. The simple construct is not completed, except for some site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) that is required to fix some mutations that were introduced.

We miniprepped a few things this fine Sunday morning. Thirty minipreps makes for a fun day!
Monday August 27th
We analyzed our qPCR data and saw that we have a concentration of 5.617 pM of the sheared genomic DNA. We will be sending out our library ASAP for sequencing. We are also doing our first round of SDM today! We want to mutate the reductase to become more efficient under aerobic conditions by changing out two base pairs. The dilutions are tricky, but we got them down by the end of the day! We performed the SDM protocol on the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, and B0034 + Reducase + B0015. We also continued on with our Strain E-15 EG3 directed evolution, and we will almost every day.

RybB Structure
Goal:
Obtain the secondary structure of the asRNA described in the flip-flop system designed by our V sublab.
Background
In order to improve the robustness of genetic silencing, one of the possible mechanisms is to implement an asRNA inhibition system. Our V sublab implemented the RybB-ompN inhibition system described by Bouvier (Bouvier et al. 2008) .
Strategy:
Use the RNAfold Web Server to obtain a possible secondary structure for the asRNA mentioned above.
Procedure:
Find the sequence of> the asRNA which is going to be introduced in our genetic flip-flop system (in this case the sequence of the RybB RNA).
Introduce the sequence in the RNAfold Web Server.
Results and Discussion:
The output of the RNAfold Web Server for our asRNA is shown in Figure 5. The free energy of the optimal secondary structure is quite high which would be expected as the RNA under study is an asRNA whose objective is the silencing of the ompN sequence by physical binding to this sequence. So, this asRNA may not have a quite stable secondary structure. The predicted structures are shown in Figure 6.

Introduction
At the CAS conference in Munich we met the iGEM team UCL for the first time. Discussing about the different projects a common basis was found. Since the UCL team also produced laccases (for a different approach) a collaboration has been developed subsequently. The idea was that each team will characterize the laccase(s) of the other team to reproduce and cross-validate the results. Therefore the plasmids containing specific BioBricks were exchanged. The iGEM UCL characterized our BioBrick <partinfo>K863005</partinfo> and consequently we characterized their BioBrick <partinfo>K729006</partinfo>. The laccase CueO from E. coli BL21(DE3) was used by both teams, but with different expression vectors and chassis as well as a different protocol for the laccase activity test . Hence, the established methods for production and cell disruption had to be discussed and adjusted. For the characterization of the activity each team used its own method.
For an initial characterization the BioBrick <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> was sequenced. Afterwards, the protein was produced in E. coli KRX and a growth kinetic was determined. Furthermore, a SDS-PAGE as well as an activity test was performed.
Sequencing analysis
For the improvement of the data collection the BioBrick of the University College London iGEM team was sequenced. The sequence analysis shows that the analyzed BioBrick matches the sequence published in the Partsregistry (see Fig. 1). It was proven that the BioBrick codes for the E. coli laccase CueO, indeed. Therefore the sequence"

Synthetic biology is accounted as a sensitive and controversial subject, which needs to be paid more attention in    the potential safety threats. This year, NPU-China focus on designing and synthetizing the minimal S. cerevisiae    mitochondrial genome. We thought carefully about and managing any risks to ourselves, our colleagues, community and the environment.
Safe project design
1. In our project, non-pathogenic strains of E.    coli and S. cerevisiae are used as    chassis to construct and simplify the minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome.
2. Harmful parts are not    allowed in our project. All the parts in out project are from original S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome, which    will not pose any threat.
3. we consulted our instructor to ensure the safety of our project design.
Operating wet-lab in a safe standard molecular biology laboratory
This year we mainly carried out our    project experiments in two laboratories:
1. Laboratory of Molecular Biology and    Synthetic Biology, Ecology and    Environmental Protection Research Center, Northwestern Polytechnical University.
2. Gene Synthesis Laboratory,    TACG (Tianjin) Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
The laboratory has a clean bench for    routine molecular biology    experiments, fume hoods, UV-protective glasses, sterilizers, and other laboratory equipment to ensure the safety of    the personnel. In addition, the laboratory provides ample laboratory clothing for personal protection, such as    gloves, masks, goggles and other experimental supplies.
Safe laboratory work
Before we started our wet-lab work, all the members had taken the Lab Safety courses    in our school that instructed us how to work safely and securely in a lab. Until we passed the corresponding exams,    we were not allowed to enter the lab.
In addition, there are experimental security administrators for both of    our labs, of which the administrator of NPU Lab is Zhu Wenbo and that of Taige Biotech Lab is Peng Kai.
Before    we officially entered the lab, the security administrator would personally give us security training, including    explanations of instrument usage, experiment"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA being in solution with a concentration                       of 1 μM. For lower concentrations the results on the gel were not as clear, but amplification was indeed confirmed by means of SYBR Green measurements (as explained after). In the end we decided to focus for the Cas assay only on                       Probe 1, which we believed to be the one with the best design among the ones designed for Cas12a by our team.
As expected, and consistently with previous papers on RCA, the size of the obtained amplicons was so large that they could not actually move through the agarose gel, being stuck in a position very close to the well (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Left: Agarose gel analysis of the RCA products obtained in the presence of 1 μM let-7a-5p with some of the probes we investigated. Probes 1 and 8 were designed by our team, Probes 2 and 4 are used as a control                           from Qiu et al., 2018. Right: Agarose gel analysis of RCA product, indicated by the arrow”. [Reproduced from Takahashi et al., 2018 ]
Furthermore, by means of SYBR Green I fluorescence measurements, we were able to quantitatively confirm that our probes indeed successfully trigger amplification. We were also able to estimate more accurately the specificity of our                       amplification assay: we showed that our system could amplify let-7a-5p with a concentration as low as 10-100 pM (Figure 3). This value is consistent with the results obtained by Qiu et al., 2018.
Figure 3. Left: Real-time fluorescent measurements of sensitivity of RCA reaction by means of SYBR Green I. Concentrations are referred to the reagents before being put in the RCA solution. Measurements were done                           with 10 nM, 1 nM, 100 pM and no let-7a, with the concentration of probe in all samples being 1 μM. All the values are blank-subtracted. Right: Fluorescence intensity for the different concentrations of let-7a at 120-min                           time point.
The SYBR Green I assay also allowed us to verify that the design of our probe 1 was specific for its target miRNA (let-7a-5p): the signal obtained in the presence of the same concentration of another miRNA target with very similar                       sequence (let-7d-5p, two mismatches only) was proved to be significantly lower, as shown in Figure 4.

Our Project
The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future."

Besides that we contacted team NCHU_Taichung and they gave us the shuttle plasmid of Rhodopseudomonas palustris-E. coli. Furthermore, they also gave some suggestions on the cultivation and transformation of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In addition, since team NCTU_Taichung was the first time to participate in this competition, they may be lack of experience of modeling. Thus, they wrote several emails to ask our team members about this part. We gave assistance to them on structure and direction.
8. Tianjin
In the course of project researching, our team was fortunate to read a paper from Tianjin University, which is of great help to our project. Therefore, we contacted the students of team Tianjin and contacted their instructor. The instructor answered many questions about the paper patiently and gave some advice for our project. In late August of this year, our team's student, Cheng Long , had an opportunity to communicate with their iGEM team members about their programme which was focus on Shewanella , visit their laboratory and power generation equipment. Furthermore, this year team Tianjin has designed a synthetic biology picture book for children’s enlightenment. When they told us their intention, our team found that it was a meaningful thought and could help children know more about synthetic biology which was good for their growth. Therefore, our team came up with some suggestions on stories for their picture book.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," of medical conditions that require lubricant, especially those associated with the elderly. We saw the potential of the addition of a safe GMO within them to prevent bacterial infections.
In hospitals nowadays it is very common to have a urinary catheter inserted to drain the bladder. Catheters can either be intermittent, where they are only inserted temporarily and removed as soon as the bladder is empty, or indwelling, where they are in place for a prolonged period of time (days or weeks.[i]) The NHSN (National Healthcare Safety Network) had found that in the EU around 17.5% of hospital patients need indwelling catheters: 45-79% of which were in a critical care unit, 17% in the medical ward, 23% in the surgical ward and 9% in rehabilitation[ii]. Around about 73% of the patients receiving these catheters are above the age of 65. Now the problem arises as about 28% of these elderly patients will develop a UTI (urinary tract infection), due to the use of a urinary catheter. 60-80% of patients with indwelling catheters receive antimicrobials to counteract asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to microbial resistance. In practice catheter lubricant is used to try to reduce the risk of infection, pain, friction and general discomfort.[iii]
From the data shown in the graph above it clearly shown that the E.Coli transformed with IrrE grows better in the 40%Lubricant/60%LB solution in direct comparison with the Wild type E.Coli, which hardly grew at all. This data thus suggests that with the IrrE the E.Coli is better adapted to living in, which would allow further studies being conducted on the maximum concentration of Lubricant it can be grown in. Furthermore once that has been determined the pathogen detecting aspect of the concept can be realised.
Thus overall this experiment has allowed us to show that IrrE increases the growth of the E. Coli in the Superdrug Lubricant containing: purified water, glycerine, Carbopol 940, Triethanolamine and Sodium Butyl Paraben. This supports the previous experiments that concluded that IrrE allows for better growth in saline conditions[iv], except this time in Superdrug Lubricant.
For further conceptualisation and experimentation it should be taken into consideration that within a commercialisable product the bacteria will not be under ideal growth conditions and the nutrients will be a limiting factor, especially when considering that the lubricant concentration will have to be a lot higher than in this experiment"
