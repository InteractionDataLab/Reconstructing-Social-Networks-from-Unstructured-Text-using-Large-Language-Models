Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," MerR regulator binds to the operator region of the promoter and recruits RNA polymerase, forming a ternary complex. Transcription is slightly repressed because the apo-MerR regulator dimer has bent the promoter DNA such that RNA polymerase does not contact it properly. (B) Upon binding the cognate metal ions (shown as cyan circles) the metallated MerR homodimer causes a realignment of the promoter such that RNA polymerase contacts the -35 and -10 sequences leading to open complex formation and transcription. Modified from Brown et al.
The key sequence for MerR’s binding is a region of interrupted dyad symmetry (19bp) located between the -35 and -10 haxamers of Ptpcad (The top strand). And the structure of Pr (botton strand) is similar to Ptpcad in a divergent orientation. The -10 hexamers of Ptpcad and Pr actually overlap by four bases. When the apo-MerR dimer bind to the dyad symmetrical operator DNA between the -35 and – 10 elements of mercury inducible promoter, PmerT, which has a unusually long spacer of 19 bp for MerR to bind on, the binding of RNA polymerase is inhibited(Fig.2). When Hg(II) is available in the environment, the ion binds to merR between the two subunits. The Hg-bound MerR can result in an a structural distortion of PmerT, allowing the RNA polymerase contacts to be made, leading to the expression of down-stream genes. This mode of transcription activation indicates that as the apo-MerR and Hg-bound MerR have a competing relationship. The initiation of PmerT is controlled by the expression level of MerR, and the activity of which can be denoted by reporter genes. Thus the sensitivity of Hg(II) in cell can be manipulated.
Fig.2. DNA sequence of the Tn21 mer operator promoter region. The MerR binding site on PmerT is marked by a box. The -35 and -10 regions for both PmerR and PmerTPAD are marked with boxes, and the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence that MerR recognizes and binds to is marked with arrows under the DNA sequence. The divergently oriented promoters are marked by blue box and purple box, respectively.

Design Notes
In our design, merR was isolated from the operon and assembled with constitutive"
METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," includes the PartID, PartName, RFC values, , designer and      contact information and parameters to build standardized template.
Database standardization is done by additional gathered unstandardized      information manually by hand , most of the distributed parts are      analyzed and new parameters are assigned according to parts input-output      model like : Inducer, Activator, Repressor, Inhibitor
For each promoters we assigned their inducers or repressors      as input and for protein generator parts we assigned generated proteins      as output which maybe activator or repressor of other devices.
iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts,      encapsulation of implementations , decision branching and direction      are milestones of our algoritm. The subprogram at the head of the      arrow starts executing after the termination of the subprogram at      the tail of the arrow. Following flowcharts are the high level representations      of our algorithms developed for the BioGuide software.
We run our algorithm on the real combination dataset to build      our input/output relations graphs . We also collected the subpart      assembly order, such as 1st: promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding seq,      any internal parts and the Last: terminator. Each specific Biobrick      type has been assigned a number as a unique image ID from 1 to 19.
ImageID assembly orders for each construct has been used to      extract the type information for each subpart with that construct.      This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible brick      combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed by      iGEM in Spring 2010
Four different graphs were constructed Graphical Modeling Theory      where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and the functional      combinations that can build new constructs are presented for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of iGEM      devices and one graph is based on Biobricks.
Each graph comprises a set of vertices or nodes and a set of      edges. In the set of nodes each node represents a device, while      in the set of edges each edge represents the input-output combination      of the nodes.
We arrange a survey to analyze user needs and response, According      to our survey results,244 participants are completed our survey      between 10 to 22.10.2010, 57% of the participant had scientific      degrees from B.Sc to Professor and 18% had graduate degrees. 18%      of participants are enrolled in their teams as either Instructors      or Advisors.INSA-Lyon, Lethbridge,"

Results
Auxotrophy assay
Figure 1 : As expected, the plate on the right shows that the tyrosine auxotroph strain is only growing in the presence of tyrosine whereas the AceK strain (non auxotroph) grows in both plates.
Two petri dishes are prepared as follows:
M9
M9 + tyrosine (0.05mg/mL)
TyrA- E. coli strain, purchased at the Keio collection, is screened on each dish. AceK E. coli strain is studied as a control.
The results are showed on Figure 1.
Photocleavage assay
Figure 2 : The cells grew only in the plate on the right which was exposed to UVA rays found in sunlight.
To assay the photocleavage of the o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr), the previous experiment was adapted.
Two petri dishes containing M9 growth medium with ONB-Tyr were prepared. One of them was exposed to sunlight for 8 hours while the other one was kept in the dark. The cells were deposited on the petri dishes after its exposition.
The result is showed on Figure 2.
Fluorescence measurement
The cells used in this method are TyrA- E. coli transformed with the biobrick BBa_K577882. After transformation, the slightly reddish colonies are selected and their fluorescence is measured.
Figure 3 : Selection step of fluorescent colonies (TyrA- + BBa_K577882) on LB + Tyr 0.05 mg/mL. On the upper petri dish, no arabinose had been put in the medium, and on the lower one, arabinose (0.1%) had been introduced, making the expression of the RFP possible. Left - Seen with naked eyes. Right - Under Fluorescent Excitation (584 nm)
Tyr A- E. coli (not transformed), and BL21 E. coli are studied as negative controls. For each cell line,"

iGEM Academy
Nowadays, iGEM has a very strong and growing presence on YouTube with many videos being created and uploaded by teams each year.  iGEM Academy aims to bring together and unify the iGEM community on YouTube. We encourage fellow teams to either put together videos or contribute already existing videos that fall into the following categories:
Project Introductions: a platform for teams to share their project ideas, work done so far and goals for the future.
iGEM Tutorials: videos that provide visitors with up to date tutorials on synthetic biology and lab techniques that are relevant to synthetic biology. Our set of lab tutorials ‘A Beginner’s Guide’ has already been uploaded, make sure to check it out!
Lab Art: a showcase of the colourful and creative world of synthetic biology.
Musical iGEM: a celebration of song and dance in the lab.
Outside the Lab: videos outlining synthetic biology work being done outside of the competition.
iGEM HQ: videos about the iGEM competition and the Giant Jamboree.
Let’s Talk: video interviews with members of the public talking about synthetic biology.
WikiFlicks in collaboration with UCSF iGEM.
Taking part is easy and straightforward. The teams that already have an official YouTube channel can contribute videos that are already uploaded onto their own channel. With the teams’ permission, iGEM Academy will feature links that will send users directly to these videos.
However, if these teams would like to contribute videos that are not uploaded to their own channel or if an iGEM team doesn’t have an official YouTube channel but would still like to take part, these teams can be made managers of iGEM Academy. This will allow them to upload their videos directly to the channel.
It is important to point out that this is a joint effort. We hope that as many teams as possible take part in helping to make iGEM Academy a base which connects viewers with the YouTube channels and videos of all iGEM teams. So far we have had a very positive response from teams and some videos have already been uploaded to the iGEM Academy channel.

Meeting Agenda
Meeting Notes
The following notes were taken at our smaller group grad/undergrad meeting. Ryan, Isis, Karina, Greg, and Francisco discussed the Preterm Labor Project.
The project can collectively be seen as an information processing project (integrating multiple signal inputs for one output, instantaneous input sensing vs. inputs over time)
Two-Component systems are our friends; they are easy to work with and understand. Even larger, more complicated systems (such as chemotaxis) are composed of a bunch of two-component systems. A next step would be to determine which two-component systems involve steroid receptors and attempt to decouple systems to be able to work with developing a multi-signal input system.
Must push for receptors that are readily available! If there are none, would have to work on creating new receptors. Could be another component of the project within itself, and could also be a a means to measure ""success"" of a project.
Smell generators developed by MIT need precursors. Need to either fix/change this so that we wouldn't have to worry about the precursor.
In summary, Framework of Project:
1) integrate multiple inputs 2) inputs over time (Francisco had a really good idea for this component of the project...) 3) build sensors for inputs we want  4) design  bacteria to survive in body  5) design a way to remove bacteria (if needed)
Next Steps
1) look at the engineering that's gone into Two-component systems 2) see if there are receptors that are available for us to use
Information processing of the project can be used for other applications.

Safety
Overview
     Before getting the permission into the lab, we must pass the safety examination online. Only students who pass this exam could have the opportunity to attend lab safety training. Our PI, Ding Ming, trained us with vivid examples of laboratory accidents in order to force us attaching more importance to safety and thus, avoid more tragedies. Besides this, he taught us more useful things: methods to use super-clean bench and ultraviolet lamp, using eye shades and masks while contacting toxic substances, wearing multilayer gloves during ultraviolet tapping process, and other measures in case of emergency (our lab is equipped with first-aid kit, fire detection device, gas mask, fire extinguisher, fire blanket, etc.).
Security for using biological tissues
     We use E.coli MG1655 and JT2 in our experiment, which are not disease producing bacteria and belong to operational safe level in iGEM rules. When doing experiment, we strictly abide by the laboratory rules. For used biological materials (such as bacteria solution, etc.), we will do strict sterilization before further processing. Bacteria we use are always under laboratory environment. Even in G20 Summit, when we had to share labs with other teams in different schools, we carried bacteria in tightly closed containers, with no chance flowing into the outside environment.      In the future, considering that bacteria will play their role in our designed device, we add escape-proof circuit in bacteria. Also, because two kinds of bacterial strains will work together in our system, we design a suicide switch based on toxalbumin. No matter which strain escape from the system, the gene for toxalbumin will be expressed and kill the escaped bacteria, and thus ensure the safety (but due to time constraints, we have not achieved the"

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," that could reduce the reliance on released GEMs is a step in the right direction. We investigated the use of our Sphereactor as a cell free system. A system that could contain the tools needed to do the work that the released GEMs would have done before. With a cell free system, we have complete control over our machine. We have also investigated the recall of the Sphereactor. This could allow for the Sphereactor to go out, collect up a toxic substance, then be pulled by with a magnet. We feel that a large amount of synthetic biology could be carried out within cell free systems, and that our project has laid some really solid foundations for this.
SynBin
We felt the best way to address safety concerns was to evaluate our behaviour in the laboratory, ask ourselves whether it would be acceptable to the general public, and if not, how can we make it more acceptable.
This evaluation inspired the “SynBin”, a tool to help future teams share and discuss their accidents (“Syns”). Whether it’s an embarrassing slip or a more serious “Rachelle’s set the lab on fire… again!” all incidents can be posted anonymously in the SynBin’s database. This will allow fellow synthetic biologists to learn from each other’s mistakes and adapt the way they work, creating a safer lab environment for everyone.
By demonstrating how seriously we take health and safety, we can show the public that synthetic biology is being carried out in a safe and controlled environment. We feel that practical solutions like this are the best way forward to a more engaged and accepting public.
The Syn Bin can be found here
Intimidating Skills Required: software tools for all
Software
One of the first problems any scientist will have on joining the world of synthetic biology is gene cloning. Gene cloning is the method by which DNA molecules can be assembled in vitro, taken up by host cells, and then replicated with the cells as they divide. By speaking with scientists within our building, and by noting the problems we encountered while working, we realised that cloning can be quite intimidating!
Two problems we encountered, by no means all, with cloning were as follows:
• Different organisms use codons differently.
• Making PCR primers is confusing.
Gene Synthesiser
Many synthetic biology projects involve the heterologous expression of foreign genes in a host such as E. coli/S. cerevisiae etc. For successful and efficient translation, the codon usage of the newly introduced gene must be optimised to match the tRNA pool of the host organism. However, if one simply picked the most common codon for each amino acid, the rate"

Safety-by-Design
For our team safety does not only come first. We prefer to say “safety always”. That is why we actively incorporated safety throughout our project, from the topic choice, focussing on responsible use of synthetic biology, to the product development, consisting of a cell free device. The RIVM, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, advised us on this. We concluded that from an environmental perspective unregulated gene doping use throughout society might pose another threat and thereby a reason for detection, at least in sports, and further awareness throughout society. In the image below an overview is given of how we incorporated safety throughout our project.
“The vectors people in society would use for gene doping might in time also pose an environmental threat, depending on the vectors.”

Steps
Carefully cut the plastic bag into a rectangle(do not tear and avoid any hole on the plastic bag) .
Tape the rope on the diagonal of the plastic bags, the rope should be longer than the diagonal.
Tape the eraser on the cross of the two rope.
Go to the roof and see whose can stay in the air longer.
Think about why it can stay in the air the longest.
WHY DO WE CHOOSE THIS TOPIC?
Every summer, Taiwan will be affected by four typhoon on average. Thus, we want to teach the children the fact about the wind and air. What we care about is that they can understand the science behind typhoon, in Chinese there is a saying “ understand             yourself and the enemy then you can win”, this is basically what we want to do. Besides, we talked about flying, a dream that every children once dreamed.
The Process
This week process is a little bit different form the other week. Because the experiments of this week have to go outside the classroom, we are afraid if the children are taking out and doing the experiments in between the lecture like before, they can             not stay calm and focus on the lecture. We decided to implode the lecture first and then do the two experiments.
At first, we were kind of worried about whether they can focus on the lessons for such a long time without any fun experiments. Fortunately, they love the concept of the typhoon and airplane, and have a lively discussion. What really             surprised us is some of the children, a normal fourth grade students, can already explain Bernoulli's principle. Of course they explained it in children’s way, however it is still really impressed.
Absolutely, WEEK THREE highlight is doing the two experiment. Most of them know at least one way to fold a paper airplane, however some do need more assistant. Since there is only three teachers in one classroom, the better way to solve             this problem is to tell the children to teach each other, it can relieve our stress, on the other side, they can learn how to take care of each other. When doing the parachute experiments, the children have more problems, and the teachers             are just not enough. But don’t worry, they have to learn how to solve the problem by themselves, we are their last defense, before we help them, they have to try their best to do it on their own. That’s how we smoothly handle 30 kids with             only three university students.
And finally it is time to go outdoor and give it a try"

We decided to prioritize the assembly of one construct, the melanin construct, because black is the most commonly used ink colour. We designed a g-block to contain assembled promoter, RBS, melA and terminator parts, including the BioBrick prefix and suffix sequences. We first cloned that into the pJET plasmid using the ligation kit from Thermo-Fisher Scientific. We chose this method because this kit is very efficient and it would improve our chances of successful assembly. We did succeed in inserting the melA construct into pJET (Figure 1).
Figure 1. 1% agarose gel of melA_pJET digested with EcoRI and PstI. Plasmids 1 and 3 had the melA construct successfully insert into pJET without disruption of the cut sites.
We then proceeded through cloning methods to finally insert the melA expression construct into pSB1C3 for submission to the iGEM registry. Were able to generate two successful clones (Figure 2, melA_pSC1C3 5 and 6, boxed). One of these clones was sequence confirmed and submitted to the Parts Registry ( BBa_K2481108 ).
Figure 2. 1% agarose gel of a colony PCR amplifying the melA and indB construct inserts from pSC1C3. Successfully amplified melA and indB bands are boxed.
We transformed the melA_pJET plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) and attempted to overexpress the MelA tyrosinase (~54kDa) and produce the pigment melanin. Four colonies from the transformation were picked and used to produce pre-cultures, which were then used to incoulate test expression cultures. During the test expression, cultures were also supplied with CuSO4 and extra tyrosine, as tyrosine is the substrate for MelA and Cu2+ is a cofactor of the enzyme. Cultures were induced with IPTG at OD600 ~1 and a 1OD sample was taken (T0). Another 1OD sample was taken after the cultures were left"

New BioBricks
Cripto-1 Expression System (K1908001)
This part is a semi-composite part that was synthesized by IDT which holds a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kozak sequence, a coding sequence for the Homo sapien membrane protein Cripto-1, and an ADH1 Terminator region. The coding sequence was codon-optimized for expression in yeast using the proprietary codon optimization program on the Integrated DNA Technologies website. Our design was intended to induce a strong expression of Cripto-1 in yeast to test for membrane localization. We hope that our contribution of a eukaryotic receptor protein to the iGEM Registry is found to be useful and beneficial.
Hepatitis B Antigen Expression System (K1908002)
The Hepatitis B Surface antigen (HBsAg) is a subunit from the surface antigen of the Hepatitis B virus. The blue chromoprotein is added as a visual indicator of the expression of the antigen. The 2A is a short amino acid sequence that is commonly used by picornaviruses to cleave proteins, and will allow the separation of the blue chromaprotein from HBsAg. The yeast secretion tag will allow the antigen to be secreted into the media. The supernatant of the media can be tested for the secretion of the antigen using an HBsAg ELISA Kit. This composite part also contains a yeast ADH1 Terminator. We hope that this part would serve as a dual reporter in more complex genetically engineered systems.
BioBrick Improvements
fwYellow-amilCP Osmolarity Color Toggle (K1908000)
This system is intended to be a blue-yellow color toggle that expresses fwYellow (K1033910) and amilCP (K592009) dependent on the activation of the OmpC promoter at varied ambient osmolarities. A negative feedback loop inhibits production of fwYellow (regulated by pLac) when the OmpC promoter is active and amilCP/LacI is being produced. Growth in high-osmolarity media is expected to give a blue color while growth in low-osmolarity media is expected to produce a yellow color. Further characterization of the construct is necessary to understand the mathematical relationship between protein expression levels at varied ambient osmolarities.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Emily's first experience with cloning! Ashlee led Emily through several practice experiments from designs made earlier in the year: making a gel, loading samples, gel purifying DNA. Ashlee introduced Emily to her research the previous semester. She had inserted the HMF-ABCDE pathway on the pSEVA251 KanR plasmid into P. putida and had validated its function, but was having difficulty inserting the dCas9 system into the pSEVA251 KanR HMF-ABCDE plasmid. The plasmid size would be close to 18 kb and this, among other affects, was thought to increase the difficulty of the cloning. Another hypothesis was that the dCas9 pathway did not have a strong terminator for the trans-acting RNA. Ashlee and Emily began work to insert the terminator. They performed a ligation of the pSEVA251/HMF plasmid and the terminator.
Clay and Sam worked on a program in Excel to codon optimize GFPs. Sucess. Unfortunately, program is clunky and requires a lot of user input for any optimization. Decision made to attempt the same task in MATLAB.
Thursday, May 22, 2014
Ashlee and Emily finished the ligation, transformed the ligation into DH10B electrocompetent Escherichia coli cells using electroporation, incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hour, and plated on Kanamycin plates.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content6_-_-_TEXT.html," the number of people who know about iGEM and the number of people who are willing to participate in iGEM, we think the number of people who are interested in iGEM increases nearly 60%. Just look at the reasons why they don’t want to participate, most people chose no time and no supports. Only few people claimed that they were not interested in it and far less people said they didn’t like biology at all. Considering that our high school students are under so much pressure from National College Entrance Examination and some high school are too poor to afford technologies and apparatus, our results indicated a really good reality that almost everyone was willing to accept this new science and technology.
Second, as for how to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology, we summarize two points.
On the one hand, popularizing iGEM and synthetic biology via internet can reach a good effect because nearly half of these high school students said they heard iGEM and synthetic biology from the internet. We all think wiki is really a good platform to popularize synthetic biology and communicate with other iGEMers. What’s more, publishing more books relating to synthetic biology and iGEM is also a good conduit to let synthetic biology and iGEM known by other people, especially the young.
On the other hand, teachers and parents seem to have difficulties in accepting a new technology in China or in the whole world so that students can’t learn some interesting and impressive new science and technologies from adults. It’s very common in China but we, as a new generation, should try our best to realize the rapid changing of our society.
Future plans
Finally we drew some conclusion to improve our survey next time. In order to obtain results that are more valid we should launch a more widely circulated survey. In addition, perhaps more copies can be distributed at random to the general public. On the other hand, it’s really important to make an effective and smart questionnaire to get a more cogent result. Maybe we can make two kinds of questionnaire to hand out before and after the lecture to compare to get a better conclusion.
Theme Fresco
Besides those activities related to synthetic biology we’ve mentioned above, we assisted XMU_Software in finishing a theme fresco in Furong Tunnel.
Furong Tunnel can be said to be the most attractive scenery of Xiamen University, visited by more than 30,000 people per day statistically. We made this work in consideration of its attractiveness, which can greatly help us to popularize not only synthetic biology and iGEM but also our team. In fact, many students witnessed the fresco,"

Sonja Georgijevic
I have B.Sc. degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology, and M.Sc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, both from the University of Calgary. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Educational Technology. For the past three years I have been teaching third year undergraduate courses in molecular biology in the University of Calgary Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have also been involved with University of Calgary iGEM teams, acting as laboratory supervisor and facilitator since the summer of 2006. It is my involvement with iGEM that prompted my interests in undergraduate science education and educational technology. I am interested in developing educational tools for teaching undergraduate level science.
Dr. Christian Jacob

The presentation at the Synapse (a society for students and professional within the field) event was in collaboration with Copenhagen University’s iGEM team. At this event we gave a presentation about our project and our supervisor Chris Workman gave a presentation about synthetic biology as well as iGEM. We also presented for the student organisation Society for Biological Engineering, the high school society Academy for Talented Youth and the previous mentioned Biotech Academy camp that was held during the autumn break. We presented iGEM and our project before an audience of high-school students considering starting their studies at our University with great response.
One of our team members also attended the International Synthetic and Systems Biology Summer School 2017 in Cambridge to keep us up-to-date with the newest research in Synthetic biology in addition to getting us valuable contacts working within the issue of snake envenoming.
Press
The website and magazine of the Technologist are initiatives of EuroTech universities Alliance (DTU, TU/e, EPFL and TUM) to promote technical solutions which address major challenges in modern society and bring together exciting research and innovation from around the globe.
We are to be published in issue No. 15 in January 2018. The issue of snake envenoming, its diagnosis, and iGEM-participation will be covered.
The magazine is available from leading newsagents, at major train stations, airports, etc. or can be ordered via www.technologist.eu .
This year our university newspaper, DTU Avisen, has expressed particular interest in our project and written an article about the project and the team. The article is published in the November edition of DTU Avisen, where we are featured on the frontpage.
Conclusion
In conclusion our main goal has been to promote synthetic biology to a wide target audience. This has been achieved mainly via the Biosensor project, public engagement activities and via the documentary.
The Biosensor project ensures that the average high school student receives an introduction into the world of synthetic biology, whereas the documentary and our public engagement spreads the message to a more general public. The Snakebite Detectives iGEM project has been the backbone of this journey, standing as an example of the potential of synthetic biology, BioBricks, and hard work.
We have taken ethical considerations of our work into account, while also taking safety and human responsibility and resources into account.
We have identified challenges facing solutions such as ours and  proposed an incentives to motivate further innovation within fields, where financial incentive to innovate has been infeasible or absent.
We hope that solutions such as these can serve as investment opportunities for companies"

During starvation, the half-life of RelB decreases significantly due to a Lon-protease Overgaard, M., Borch, J., Jørgensen, M. G. and Gerdes, K. (2008), Messenger RNA interferase RelE controls relBE transcription by conditional cooperativity. Molecular Microbiology, 69: 841–857. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06313.x , causing a shift in the equilibrium of RelB and RelE to a higher level of RelE. In a non-starvation situation, the interactions with the operator sequence keeps the amount of free RelE at a low level, thereby stabilising the system Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . In our simulation, the shift in equilibrium is made by introducing additional expression of RelE.
Two different models were used with two different approaches:
How a given configuration of RelB and RelE production increases the RelE concentration and whether it could induce dormancy within 2 hours.
The time required for the bacteria to exit dormancy for each of the configurations, that is, how long it takes the levels of free RelE to decrease again.
Rates and Reactions
The skeleton of toxin-antitoxin system inherent to E. coli in the model was based on the study by Cataudella et al. 2012 Cataudella I., Trusina A., Sneppen K., Gerdes K., Mitarai N. Conditional cooperativity in toxin-antitoxin regulation prevents random toxin activation and promotes fast translational recovery. Nucleic Acids Res. 2012;40:6424–6434. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks297 . In an E. coli cell with a size of 1-2 μm, each nM of concentration can be approximated to 1 molecule. Thus all units are converted to molecules-1, as this fits the premises of the Gillespie algorithm. To simplify the model, the high affinity of RelE and RelB was"

Protocols
in vitro recombinase characterization protocol
The different logic gates that have been designed are described in Biological Modules. We imagined a new method for characterizing the logic gates switches with recombinases. This protocol is really easy to apply, can be used to test many recombinases with many sites, avoiding the necessity for lengthy and difficult cloning steps.
For easy characterisation of the switching steps without any complicated device, we decided to use the RFP (Red Fluorescent Protein). The gene encoding the RFP protein was directly used as a reporter system, placed under the control of the different promoters of the various logic gates.
Besides the reporter system, each logic gate must be tested with the corresponding recombinase. To save cloning time, we first thought of co-transformation. However, the different tests performed were inconclusive because of the different expression levels of plasmids and incompatibility of pSB1C3 and pSB1A2 derived plasmids. We then decided to test recombination-based switches in vitro.
In vitro switch of the designed logic gates avoids the unnecessary DNA assembling steps putting the recombinases on the same plasmid as the logic gate (which is in"

After telling her about our project we asked her about which aspects we have to consider for such a solution to be implemented. She told us that costs are very significant, especially if there is a series of products that need to be used. More importantly, risk assessments has to be made and considered. There are many restrictions when it comes to providing safe methods and products in the food industry. The use of GMO is highly restricted by international regulations, especially when it comes to food and nutrition.

Odd Atle Tveit
Head of Department for Water and Wastewater in Trondheim municipality
Key insight
The department does cell counts to research bacterial growth and assess the results based on drinking water regulations. They don´t research biofilm in particular.
If the bacteria level is higher than permitted they use methods like flushing water or rinse the tubes with soft sponges. At the treatment facility they use methods like UV and chlorine.
Biofilm can be used in a positive way by removing pollution from wastewater using biorotors.
Summary of interview
We also wanted to talk to someone working on providing the town with clean water and the treatment of wastewater, as this could be another relevant application area for the project. We had a telephone interview with Odd Atle Tveit, the head of the department for water and wastewater in Trondheim municipality. There is an extensive network for the transportation of clean water to the citizens in addition to treatment facilities. They also treat the waste water before it is led to the ocean. Because of humidity and water levels, bacterial growth is a risk. They don´t research biofilm in particular, but water quality. Based on different levels they assess if the network has to be treated to avoid further growth of bacteria.
The department does cell counts to research bacterial growth and assess the values based on drinking water regulations. We asked him if biofilm is an issue, and he could inform us that it does not cause big problems. If the bacteria levels reaches a certain level, they use flushing of water through the tubes to get a better flow through. They also use soft sponges with the same diameter as the tubes to rinse the walls. In the treatment facility they use chlorine and UV-light for disinfection. He could inform us that many water treatment facilities removes organic substances so there is less nutrition available in the water. This is one way to decrease biofilm formation in water distribution systems. He agreed with the fact that biofilm is complex and important"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Co-culture
Overview :
G.xylinus and E.coli belong to the Gram-negative bacteria, and G.xylinus can secrete bacterial cellulose,which has great potential in many areas. In order to reach the diferent demand of nutrition and carbon source, we have finnished exploring the better growing together environment for both bacterials. And then, we have made G.xylinus and E.coli growing in the Co-culture media together and get BC membrane after a week inoculated.
Key Achievements
Create the Co-culture system.
Find a better inoculation ratio and carbon source.
Testing all of the parts working and get BC membrane datas.
Create a response surface modelling in the Co-culture system.
Improvement :
Optimized co-culture media can increase the yield of BC by16.7%
Optimized culture media can shorten the time for G.xylinus to produce the same amount of BC than the original one.
G.xylinus
Overview :
The biosynthesis pathway of bacterial cellulose in Gluconacetobacter xylinus is complicated including the synthesis of cellulose precursor, polymerization of glucan monomers and assembly of glucan chains.
Bacterial cellulose has great potential in many areas, including water purification, tissue scaffolds, wound dressings, etc., however, until now, all bacterial cellulose-based materials have been created using chemical or physical post-production processing, not genetic engineering,and the yield of BC's is also low. According to our finding that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylinus cultured individually when cultured with E.coli at pH=5.We have overcome the numerous difficulties associated with G.xylinus genetic engineering, and we mainly do the following two aspects of work :
overexpress  key gene of PGM：ptimize the metabolic pathway of Gluconacetobacter xylinus., redirecting more carbon sources into the production of bacterial cellulose
Overexpress key gene of c-di-GMP: increase the production of cellulose synthase.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Results-content_-_-_TEXT.html," fast in the respective environment and high levels of heterologous protein expression have to be given. Another aspect to consider is the ubiquitous occurrence in the cow´s rumen.
To evaluate the benefit of using Escherichia coli as a heterologous expression system for sMMO instead of sticking with the natural methanotroph M. capsulatus we decided to compare their growth rates using a cultivation curve at the respective optimal cultivation conditions.
As shown in figure 2, E. coli does not only reach a much higher cell density in comparison to M. capsulatus (OD600 = 7 and OD600 = 1, respectively) but furthermore shows a much faster growth. The time span for the organism to reach the exponential stadium is of particular interest for the choice of the organism. Whereas M. capsulatus reaches the exponential stadium after 20 h, E. coli does after only 3 h .
Figure 2: Growth curve of E. coli (red dots) and M. capsulatus (black dots), plotted is the optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm ) as a function of time. The complete growth curve for M. capsulatus is shown in the smaller plot
The difference in growth is caused by the differences in carbon metabolism. While E. coli is able to metabolise a wide range of carbon sources, M. capsulatus depends on C1 compounds as the  sole carbon source, which results in a slower metabolism linked with decreased protein biosynthesis. To degrade a significant amount of methane in the cow’s rumen, it is necessary to choose an organism capable of producing the sMMO in high amounts. Furthermore, E. coli is a natural resident of the rumen [4], the best-characterised model organism for synthetic biology and the standard chassis for the iGEM competition. These factors facilitated the choice for E. coli as a heterologous expression system. Therefore, we provided E. coli with all necessary mmo genes from M. capsulatus.
Cloning
The first step of our experimental procedure was to isolate the genes for all the six subunits of the enzyme complex from M. capsulatus (Bath) - mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ (coding for subunits α, β and γ, respectively), mmoB (coding for the regulatory protein), mmoC (coding for the reductase) and mmoD (table 1). We chose the vector pSB1A3 in view of our future plans to coexpress the subunits with chaperone proteins which were contained"

He loved it so much that he sometimes SLAMMED the cover to make sure it’s closed, then Raul would be jealous and said ""DON’T SLAM THE CENTRIFUGE!"" *Hmm... I wonder why the centrifuge got replaced* Alfie also liked the newly replaced centrifuge. He put smaller tubes than required- maybe thinking the big tubes were too heavy for the centrifuge, but he had to take care of the mess of broken tubes and split DNA inside the centrifuge. Lastly, he worked as a great team manager, and helped out the whole team by transferring to many different teams.

Imperial_College_London,2010,Team:Imperial College London#Schistosoma_-_-_TEXT.html," of under diagnosis, but more commonly found in migrants and tourists also. The trained immune system of healthy people living in endemic areas will often be able to fight off parasite infections naturally. Furthermore cord blood lymphocytes from newborns of schistosome-infected mothers are significantly more likely to amount a helminth Ag-driven B cell response than others, indicating in utero sensitisation takes place (King et al. 1998) . Acute schistosomiasis is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction caused by the migration of schistosomulae within the host body and usually weeks or even months after primary infection. It is characterised by a sudden onset of symptoms ranging from fever, fatigue, and myalgia over malaise, non-productive cough, eosinophilia and patchy infiltrates on chest radiography. These can later also be accompanied by abdominal symptoms caused by movement of mature worms.
Impact on human health - Long-term effects
Chronic pathology caused by schistosome infection is rarely evoked by the adult worms, but rather by lesion caused by the eggs that become trapped in the tissue during perivesical or perintestinal migration, or in other cases after embolisation by various organs including the liver, spleen, lung and cerebrospinal system. As a result of protease secretion, an eosinophilic inflammatory response and granulomatous reaction are provoked which are later replaced by fibrous deposits. The granulomatous responses are ""strictly mediated by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells specific for egg antigens"" Nascimento-Carvalho & Moreno-Carvalho 2005 . The extent to which an individual suffers is therefore directly dependent on the disease burden but also the precise immune response mounted by the individual. Depending on the species of schistosome a person is infected with, a number of distinct conditions can be found, if the disease enters the chronic stages and is not treated timely.
In addition to the immunopathology that can be attributed directly to the parasite, it is although thought to be a major factor contributing to morbidity and accompanying problems such as anaemia, nutritional status and cognitive and physiological capacity, as well as fatigue (King et al. 2005) . Older studies failed to demonstrate this effect even in individuals, but more recent studies have shown a small, yet significant, effect of the parasite on human health in general.

This complication caused by Schistosoma is most notably found in young children between 5 and 10 and is rare during and after adolescence. The eggs of"

ComA directly activates the srfA operon which encodes enzymes needed for the production of the lipopeptide surfactin.(5)
In Bacillus subtilis, quorum responses contribute to the induction of competence development, sporulation, degradative enzyme production and antibiotic production (6). The ComX–ComP–ComA signalling pathway is a major quorum response pathway in B. Subtilis and regulates the development of genetic competence (7).
During biofilm formation in B. subtilis, most cells produce and secrete ComX. A subset of these cells become surfactin producers and secrete surfactin and a distinct population that does not itself synthesize surfactin responds to this surfactin and generates the extracellular matrix.

FLAKY BIOFILM
In our project, our goal is to get an easily applied  anti- gram negative coat with the inhibition mechanism of our LALF protein. Normally,  agar does not have a vicious consistency; therefore, it cannot be easily  applied on a surface. For this reason; we perform a useful method which is  called biofilm paste (benefited from Team Groningen 2010). In this method, we  use corn starch with liquid lb medium. Our wild type B. subtilis grows up very  fast with the corn starch. We use 2 g corn starch with 50 ml LB medium. After 3  days waiting at 37 oC, we get our flaky biofilm.

The second fusion protein contains the activation domain (RpoZ) with our created binding protein (2). At first the DNA binding domain binds at the specific binding site upstream of the reporter (3). If the binding protein can interact with our target (4) the RNA Polymerase I can be recruited and binds to the promoter (5). The result is the expression of the reporter gene, in example the beta-lactamase(6). No binding between the target and the binding protein (7) leads to no expression of the reporter gene (8). At the end only the bacteria survive with the activated reporter. These bacteria you can use to produce a lot of the binding proteins against your specific target (9).
The bacterial two-hybrid system , our main approach, consists of two fusion proteins and a reporter gene that grants selective advantage. One    fusion protein is the target protein fused to a DNA-binding domain while the other comprises the Evobody consisting of a binding protein with a RNA polymerase subunit. The    DNA-binding domain that is connected to the target protein binds upstream of the reporter gene, in our case coding for beta-lactamase.   If there is a certain affinity between the Evobody and the target protein, the polymerase subunit of the Evobody recruits the full enzyme and subsequently the beta-lactamase   is expressed ( Badran et al. 2016 ). Cultivated in an increasing concentration of ampicillin, only those bacteria expressing enough beta-lactamase will prevail. Since the expression    of beta-lactamase correlates to the affinity between Evobody and binding protein we can use the best grown bacteria to determine the sequence of the Evobody    which then could be used for production.
Figure 2: Illustration of the split-protein system. Only in case of the Evobody showing affinity towards the target protein the functionality of the split beta-lactamase(10) is restored, granting a ampicillin resistance to the bacterium that generates the Evobody.
The split-protein approach is also based on beta-lactamase as a resistance to ampicillin. The general idea is, to split a reporter protein    into two non-functional subunits. Then, a translational fusion of one half of the split-protein respectively and one of the two allegedly binding proteins   is created. In case of successful binding between the proteins, the fused split-protein halves should therefore restore the functional reporter protein. As afore mentioned we   chose beta-lactamase as a reporter, as it allows the application of selective"
Peking,2012,Team:Peking#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," Yang lab, here we called the Luminesensor may circumvent serious issues of current optogenetic methods, e.g. cytotoxicity, narrow dynamic range, and dependency on laser and exogenous chromophores.
Amazingly, the Luminesensor proved to be sensitive to natural light and even bioluminescence. Moreover, the Luminesensor is able to respond to light signals with broad illuminance scales (Figure 1).
Figure 1. The broad illuminance scales to which Luminesensor could respond to.
2. Synthetic Biology in 2D and 3D
-- A Practical Application
Few optogenetics methods have been applied to practical applications until now. To fully demonstrate spatiotemporally precise manipulation of cellular behavior using our Luminesensor, our team has deeply explored the applications  in 2D and 3D bio-printing.
High resolution images could be easily obtained by 2D bioprinting on a bacterial lawn bearing the Luminesensor (Figure 2). (more on 2D Printing ).
Figure 2. High resolution of 2D bioprinting.
What's more, sharp images could be printed using an Apple iPad as light source (see iPrinting ), which indicates that our Luminesensor could serve as the interface between biological systems and electrical devices.
A very promising application of the Luminesensor is 3D printing, using light signals of spatially high resolution. Three dimensional images could be elegantly printed into media mixed with bacteria expressing the Luminesensor (see 3D Printing ). A new design strategy of 3D printer using holographic technology instead of layer-by-layer printing, was also proposed. With such a power tool, 3D printing regarding biological material has endless potentials for medical use (crazy ideas in Future ).
3. Cell-Cell Light Communication
-- A Novel Strategy of Signaling
Cell-cell communication based on quorum sensing systems, e.g. AHL, has been largely utilized by synthetic biologists to construct gene circuits with complex functions, e.g. pattern formation and edge detection. However, the diffusion and saturation of quorum sensing chemicals limit the delivery of communication signals, which in turn requires high spatiotemporal resolution and long range interaction.
The ultrasensitivity of the Luminesensor encouraged our team to explore the possibility of cell-cell light communication (Figure 3). By employing bacteria expressing the lux operon from V. fisheri as ""light senders"" and those bearing the Luminesensor as ""light receiver"", we successfully demonstrated, for the first time ever, that light communication between cells"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," very first interview with Dr Griffiths, he suggested this same problem, that as a man he was uncomfortable with coming across in a patronising manner when trying to address issues of confidence in women. Dr Lewis argued that increasing the number of quality role models surrounding female staff and students is the key to improving confidence in areas like presentations and public speaking. However, here, Professor Ryan argued that you are in danger of coming across to women like
so you don't know how to lead so we'll teach you how to lead properly or you're not pushy enough so we'll teach you to be more pushy
. We hadn’t considered this perspective because of the personal accounts academics like Dr Lewis had shared about the importance of programmes for improving confidence in how it empowers women to respect themselves more. Furthermore, Professor Ryan applied this to the application process of jobs. It is recognised that men will apply for jobs if they meet some of the criteria whereas women tend to apply if they have met all, or almost all, of the criteria.
Another way you could see that is there is a problem with men, men putting themselves forward when actually they're not qualified
Professor Ryan argues that the problem shouldn’t necessarily be tackled by giving women more courses on leadership, confidence and empowerment, but perhaps we should be changing the attitudes of men. We talked with all the academics about what kind of social change is necessary for there to be a difference in equality and diversity in science, and Professor Ryan indicates that we should consider putting the same kind of focus on changing male attitudes to confidence as we are with women, except with the opposite circumstance.
If I put myself on the side of someone hiring I actually want someone who's actually qualified for the job
We would think that a way to make an immediate difference on this front would be to give the right kind of role models and mentors to people so to dissuade them from applying for a job if they are very under qualified, and likewise persuade people to apply for the job if they are qualified. Dr Sharon Dixon argued that these mentors don’t need to be of any one gender or any one background, just as long as they can relate to the person involved. Professor Ryan agreed with this perspective saying:
Any given individual may need to look to three or four different role models so they may need to look at someone as a scientist and then someone as a supervisor and then someone who has a good work life balance
This perspective is one we agree with, because it is unrealistic to believe that there is one individual for all, who can act as a multi-purpose role model. Another area where both Dr Dixon and"

Happy first day of school, Penn State!  The HMF plasmid was digested again with EcoR1 and PstI.
Plasmid prepped cells were sent for sequencing. Hoping to get results before the end of the weeks so they can start to be characterized.
Tuesday, August 26, 2014
The HMF digest was run on a gel and purified yielding only a small amount of DNA.  This will be redone in the coming days.
G4 was digested.
Wednesday, August 27, 2014
Four lambda red-dCas9-L6 digestion reactions were run.  We digested the plasmid with AvrII and PacI.  These were PCR cleaned, instead of gel purified, and were then transformed into P. putida competent cells.
G4 was attempted to be ligated into the backbone. Cells were transformed and plated with the G4 ligation.
Thursday, August 28, 2014
The same digestion was repeated today as we did not get the DNA concentrations we anticipated.  This made it hard to transform, so we will do that again tomorrow.
At this point, G4 has not been successful transformed into the backbone. It has been decided to stop pursuing this GFP variant because it is being too problematic.
Friday, August 29, 2014
The digestion was PCR cleaned again using an additional wash cycle.  This still did not yield better DNA concentrations and we were unable to move forward with the transformation.  Some thought into why this was happening was brought up, but no conclusion was reached and we decided we would try again.

Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," this optimization of the PCR parameters the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT from figures 1, 2, and 3 were sent in for sequencing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa sequencing facility. Glycerol stocks were also prepared from these colonies.
Results and Discussion: The decrease in annealing temperature seems to have greatly improved the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT colony PCR; however, much of the smaller bands still appear in the gel all averaging roughly 0.5 – 1 kb. These bands did not appear in the previous gels using high annealing temperatures suggesting that these may be products of internal priming. Even though there are putative internal priming products present, we lose some bands that were present in previous high annealing temperature PCRs. Contamination of the PCR reagents was ruled out as the colony PCR was performed in parallel with the other constructs using the same master mix. The product produced during the colony PCR were then sequence verified before further experimentation.
The CR2 Gag-Prot-RT gels from figures 1-3 showed that the plasmid was indeed taken up by all colonies sent in. As the sequencing had been performed with T7 forward and T7 reverse primers, only the first 500-600 base pairs of the 5’ and 3’ end of the constructs could be verified. We ordered three internal primers for the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct to close the gaps for verification of the sequence.

PCR conditions: (1) Initial Denaturation at 94℃ for 30 seconds (2) Denaturation at 94℃ for 20 seconds (3) Annealing at 65℃ for 20 seconds (4) Extension at 68℃ for 1 minute 30 seconds (5) Final Extension at 68℃ for 5 minutes; run for 35 cycles.

After we interviewed the specialists who are famous in the food and sweeteners area, the current situation of sweeteners was getting clearer in our mind.Generally, most of them used by us have the  main shortages which are high calories and bad taste even though they might be very sweet.We based the human sweetness receptor on our design and hypothesized to construct the signal conduction path in the yeast
VISIT SOME AUTHORITATIVE CORPORATIONS
When several constructions of gene had been finished and tests had been carried out, the COFCO which is the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China became our next interviewee.Some of the managers showed up to welcome us and  they are the principal of innovating new product—Mrs.Zhao, the one of vice chairmen of the company—Mr.Huang and the doctor who is responsible for the manipulating of electronic tongue technique—Mr.Liu.We had a long but meaningful chat about the current device used by most of the  food producing companies, which made us realize that the generally used machine’s range is so limited that it is hard to measure the sweetness conveniently as well as some devices like electronic tongue technique would only be efficient after the association with the assessment given by workers, which results in the humongous uncertainty.Therefore, an innovative bio system which relies on Synthetic Biology to observe and select new types of sweeteners will have a non-negligible contribution to the society.Finally, we accept the advice which came from COFCO and what they suggest is to let us start with some classical and conventional sweeteners like stevia rebaudiana,  liquorice and Momordica grosvenori.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phases of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University etcetera to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the increase of popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology.Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accept one"

Our Key Goals
The aim of the USYD iGEM 2017 team was to address the problem of insulin inaccessibility. The design of our insulin, and its means of expression, needed to look at five key characteristics:
Stability
For our project to work effectively, we must have a supply chain that’s not a cold chain, so that costs can be reduced. This will ultimately mean that the cost of these cold chains will not be passed onto the consumer. To achieve this, we hope to design an insulin that will not lose efficacy after being exposed to room temperature for long periods of time.
Single Chained
As a result of the difficult purification methods, Single Chain Insulins, or SCIs for short, have been developed with a small, C-peptide chain linker. This linker connects the A and B chains in such a way that the di-sulfide bonds form more favorably. We aim to develop our own single chain insulin to compare it’s simplicity.
Ease of Purification and Affordaility
We must also consider the impact of a difficult, costly manufacturing process on small scale manufacturing companies. This impact is too great to impose on this grass-roots organisations, so we have pursued to find a cheap, simple purification method which is able to produce high yields from a recombinant system.
Intellectual Property Issues
As a result of the way drugs are currently developed, all new inventions for therapies are protected by Intellectual Property Law through patents. These patents surrounding all currently prescribed and newly invented insulins has inspired our team to pursue a completely open source project.
Safety and Efficacy
Our insulin products must be of certifiable medical grade such that it can be approved for human use after stage IV clinical trials, or biosimilar clinical trials. Furthermore, it must also be at least as effective as the other insulins on the market.
Our Insulin Analogue
Proinsulin
We began working on expressing proinsulin as it is a reliable, unpatented, and well characterised therapeutic. Proinsulin itself is inactive, and to become active it requires"

Biosafety
The pretreatment should be safe for the user and the environment after disposal
Storability
The ease of use on-site increases when the method can be stored without freeze-drying. For this we would like to refer to our TDP Design page
Accuracy
It is important that our detection method does not give false positives. To see how we researched this, we would like to refer to our Modeling page
Clear readout
To be able to obtain a readout visible by the naked eye, we developed a modular detection method which can be revised on the Coacervation Design page
Our solution
We incorporated all these design requirements in our end-product: CASE13A (see our Project Description ). To apply our design in the field, we looked at our design from the perspective of a potential end-user, in this case a farmer. We developed a detection protocol with simplified methods (see our Sample Preperation page). Due to the simplicity of the steps in our protocol, the detection can be done outside a lab environment and without special training. Check out our Demonstration page to see how we achieved this. We also managed to limit the costs to around 10 euros per detection, which is much less than the current method.

High Fidelity PCR
To amplify Linker-Tn5 (1508 bp), Tn5 (1452 bp) and Tn5-Linker (1505 bp) coding sequence, high fidelity PCR was done using the amplified Tn5 (in previous PCR reactions) as template DNA and FP005, FP006, FP007 and FP008 as forward and reverse primers. Two times eight 50µL PCR mixtures were prepared, according to the High Fidelity PCR protocol .

To test the effect of DMSO on the PCR performance, one extra tube per amplicon was made that was supplemented with 1.5 μL DMSO (3% final) and 34 μL MilliQ. Additionally, instead of the amplified Tn5 PCR product as template, the original pTXB1-Tn5 plasmid was used as template.  Finally, a negative control sample was taken into account that contained no primers and 37.5 μL MilliQ instead.
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 1 min 30 seconds and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. In order to check the difference between two PCR machines (older one and new one), the tubes were divided over the two thermocyclers. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The obtained PCR products Linker-Tn5 and Tn5-Linker were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL DNA was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
As can be seen, the PCR amplification with primers 005 and 006 resulting in Linker-Tn5 were successful. The primers 007 and 008 did not result in any PCR amplicons. Also, the HF buffer supplemented with 3% DMSO resulted in the required amplicon. Remarkably, the old PCR machine did result in thicker and brighter bands DNA. This might be"

Biological Engineering ('18)
Saie Ganoo? Don’t you mean Saie GaYES? You’ll never meet a more spirited, motivated, or hardworking individual than Saie. She puts the ‘gem’ in iGEM and the ‘tada’ in Team Lead. If you ever need to watch an uplifting Facebook video featuring cute animals or to call someone right away in excitement about a random idea, Saie is your girl. Saie spends 400 hours a week on iGEM, but in her spare time she is a full time biological engineering student, a proud member of Theta Tau, an RA, probably an astronaut???, and all around one of the best friends you could ever ask for!
Yifan Chen - Wet Lab Lead
Biological Sciences ('18)
With about a month left until competition, one truth has become abundantly clear to the team members toiling away in our wet lab space: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
For the lab is dark, and full of errors.
However, all is not lost. Cornell iGEM has a secret weapon: Yi Fan Chen, our glorious Wet Lab Lead. Yi Fan can defy all physical and chemical laws that govern the success of molecular biology techniques. When he touches a miniprep or protein purification, it magically works, better than it has ever before! He is the light that guards the realms of synthetic biology.
Outside of iGEM, Yi Fan works in a lab and spends the remaining three hours in his day regenerating his supernatural powers as he sleeps.

In this expression, D is the diffusion coefficient and dc/dx is the slope of the molar concentration. We can obtain NO's diffusion coefficient in water either by experiments or by calculations. Finally we choose to do the calculations.
For dilute non-electrolyte A, its diffusion coefficient in solvent B (also called the infinite-dilute diffusion coefficient) can be estimated by Wilke-Chang equation:$${D}_{AB}=7.4\times {10}^{-15}\frac{{(\Phi {M}_{B})}^{T}T}{\mu {{V}_{A}}^{0.6}}\mathrm{{m}^{2}/s}$$
In the equation,
DAB — The inter-diffusion coefficient in an infinitely-dilute solution, m2/s.
T — The temperature of the solution, K. In our case, it is 0.5.
μ — The viscosity of B, Pa·s.
MB — The molar mass of B, kg/mol.
Φ — The parameter of association of solvent. (Introduction of the association parameter into the formula is brought about by the fact that associated molecules behave like large-size molecules and diffuse at a lower rate; the degree of association varying with mixture composition and with molecule types. Therefore, Wilke and Chang presented the values for most widespread solvents: for water φ=2.6; methanol, 1.9; ethanol, 1.5; benzene, ester, heptane and non-associated solvents, 1.)
VA — The molar volume of solute A at a boiling point under normal conditions, cm3. It can be estimated by Tyn-Calus Method: V=0.285V1.048, while Vc is the critical volume of a substance and measures 57.7 for NO.

Figure 3. NO concentration distribution with time around the wound.
The six pictures demonstrate the NO concentration distribution with time (with the 1 s interval) around the wound caused by IBD. The concentration is shown along the Z-axis (unit: D). The intestinal lies along the X-axis (unit: 5 mm, Y-axis the same) with intestinal walls surrounding it.  To simplify the situation, we assume that the dissipative NO molecules gathered altogether as a dot at time 0 which is located on the lower part of the intestinal walls, and the walls consume all the NO molecules within its range.

Health effects
In the environment, mercury is one of the most toxic elements (L.A. Rojas, 2011). The most toxic compounds are organometallic mercury molecules like methylmercury and dimethylmercury, because they can easily permeate the cellular membrane. These organometallic compounds are better soluble in lipids. Because of this fact, it is easier to permeate the cellular membrane. Acute effects of a mercury intoxication can range from diseases of the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, neuromuscular and neurological problems. Inorganic mercury accumulates in the kidneys and has a long biological half-life, before it is not detectable anymore. In contrast to organic mercury, inorganic mercury is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier or blood-placenta barrier, so it accumulate in the organs (Park et al., 2012). A chronic intoxication of mercury results in kidney changes, changes in the central nervous system and other effects like cancer (Holmes et al., 2009, WHO 2005). Additional studies show that mercury generates chromosomal aberrances (WHO, 2005). In addition, a relation between an early exposure of mercury and late initial of Alzheimer`s and other neurodegenerative diseases are discussed (Park et al., 2012).
Detection
Mercury can be detected by atomic absorption spectrometry with a detection limit of 5 µg/L and the Inductively Coupled Plasma Method with a detection level of 0.6 µg/L (WHO 2005). In addition, there are different chemical and biological test systems. One of these systems is the detection by ELISA with mercury specific antibodies (Wylie et al., 1991).
Our mercury biosensor
For our sensor, we use the mer operator from Shigella flexneri R100 plasmid Tn21 ( BBa_K346002 ) and its regulator merR ( BBa_K346001 )  constructed by the iGEM team Peking 2010. The MerR functions as an activator and regulates its own transcription (N.L. Brown et al., 2003). Our sensor system combines merR under the control of a constitutive promoter and the merT promoter for the mercury depending expression of sfGFP.

WHAT IS iGEM?
iGEM stands for the International Genetic Engineering Machine Contest
Student teams are given a kit of biological parts (DNA) at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. Teams present their work at the iGEM Jamboree held each year on MIT’s campus in Cambridge, MA and compete for awards in several categories including energy, health/medicine, and food.
iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition grew internationally, 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, and 84 teams in 2008.
In 2009 over 110 teams with over 1200 participants are expected to participate in the competition. They will all specify, design, build, and test simple biological systems made from standard, interchangeable biological parts. Teams will present their projects at the iGEM Championship Jamboree in October 2009.

Tongji_Shanghai,2016,Team:Tongji Shanghai#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," we made an exhibition of some animal and plant specimen, told the story behind the specimen. They seemed so interested in biology. Then we popularize scientific knowledge about synthetic biology and introduced the iGEM competition to them. It was a little changeable for them, so we tried to make it easy to understand. It’s great to share with senior high school students. They are so young that they have some extraordinary ideas which surprised us a lot.
Tongji Hospital Visit
Since our project is about tumor and its treatment, we want to know how will patients and citizens think of it. Thanks to Tongji Hospital, we could get the access to introduce iGEM and our project to the patients, and then we could communicate with them about their life as well. Some ideas were quite constructive and helpful to our improvement of the project, though most patients couldn't understand it well. On the other hand, it's meaningful for us to learn more about empathy and care. We are willing and determined to do more volunteer work about health and care in the future. IGEM is a great platform to start, and there is a long way to go.
Team Communications
Taipei Workshop in NYMU
We are proudly invited by National Yang-Ming University, an active iGEM team to have a visit in Taipei in August. NYMU kindly held an communication meeting together with other iGEM teams in north Taiwan: TAS, NTHU, NCTU.
We shared our project ideas and give suggestion with each other. To improve commutation experience, we had a “World Café” Workshop focus on environmental protect and youth social responsibility. Team members from different schools presented their personal thoughtful ideas. Moreover, we made a colorful painting together to conclude our discussion results after the workshop.

The transcription and translation mechanism although theoretically processes, in practice it may not be as predicted. The model considered above (or in general  practice) considers abundance of cellular resources such as ribosomes, or amino acids to  carry out the function . In reality, the present quantity may not be sufficient to the facilitate smooth function of each individual biological processes. When we insert a synthetic  plasmid inside a cell, the host has to share the resources it suppose to use for cell growth  and other activities. One can model the competition of cellular processes as virtual induced negative feedback. Suppose, A and B are two mRNA require the ribosome and the  only available ribosome binds with A due to strong RBS in the sequence, then B wont be  translated to the protein form soon. These kind of behavior is known as post transcriptional control. There could be any possible combination of such competition behavior, as  a case study we are considering a competing between p1 and p4. Such competition introduced two implicit feedback to each other in the oscillator. The model of such dynamics  can be written as,
where the parameters are same as earlier. The model is simulated and response is as shown in figure below. Here, we observe an increase in period as expected. This is due to an additional delay involved for ribosome (or any other resource queuing). The competition of resource sharing may quench the oscillation if the delay is more than required. This is a preliminary step to understand how the resource may effect the ideal biomolecular system performance.

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," $N$ is the number of yeast in the system.To further improve, we combine the model 'Reaction in system' that provides the relation of histamine in the system and the expectation activated histamine in one cell. Thus, we have a full model from the histamine in the cell to the fluorescence intensity.And we consider it as a known function
$$ Flo_t=Testing(L_t) $$
Taking $k=1000,N={10}^7$, the plot of this function is showed below.
In this testing, we can flexibly control the input concentration of histamine by diluting or concentrating. However, we know from other researchers and clinical doctors that the expectation histamine concentration of positive result ($EH_p$) is often ten times of that of negative one ($EH_n$).
$$ log(EH_p)=log(EH_n)+1 $$
Thus, with the above rule, we have to find a proper negative input, which ensures the testing system has the best discrimination. In other words, we need to decide the expectation of histamine input of negative result, which makes the negative result and positive result is the furthest. We can define the difference between the negative and positive result as follow as we know that $EH_p=10EH_n$
$$ dif=Testing(EH_p)-Testing(EH_n)=Testing(10EH_n)-Testing(EH_n) $$
The $dif$ is a function of $EH_n$, so we can find a $EH_n$ that maximize the $dif$.The figure of $dif $ is shown below.
In this parameter set we choose, the proper expectation histamine input of negative result that makes the difference biggest is $EN_n=3.16nM$, and the corresponding input of positive result is $EN_p = 10EN_n =31.65nM$. We can directly point these in the plot of the system function as below.
In summary, after analyzing the testing system, we figure out that letting the negative histamine input be $EN_n=3.16nM$(With this parameter set) and testing fluorescence in time $t_{max}=145$(With this parameter set) should be the most efficient and accurate criteria.
Threshold Calculation
After we designed the deterministic model of diagnosis, the error of the input and system should be considered. It is reasonable that there are errors in both negative and positive input, as the histamine in example is different and the manual operation also brings errors. Thus, we tend to assume that the negative and positive inputs ($H_n$ and $H_p$) are subject to"

This year is the first time we participate in iGEM competition. Given the little experience we had and the confusions regards to rules and regulations, it was extremely lucky for us to have ShenZhen University iGEM team as a mentor throughout the competition. Right from the beginning on team built-up, members selection, project formulation, to later stage of technical troubleshooting, project progress control, and eventually Wiki and poster formulation, etc. It is fair to say that our project would not even exist without the generous and timeless help from the whole SZU team. You guys are the stars!
In return, we helped them testing CA enzymatic activity and plotting standard curves using two different methods, as we have previous experience (interlab studies and our own project) of generating good results using plate reader in our lab. It was a great learning experience for us this year, and hope we will be able to pass on these invaluable experience to someone else in need in the future.
Besides SZU team, we also received great help and advice from other iGEM teams in the local region. For instance, by participating in Southern China Regional Meeting that was held in May this year, we shared our project idea with the participated teams, including SYSU-China, SUSTC-China, SCUT-iGEM, SZU-China, SCAU-China and SSTi-China, and received constructive suggestions on project formulation and technical approaches.
Through the discussion, we came up with fresh ideas and were able to locate solutions for problems encountered. Altogether it helped enormously to the following progress of our project. Furthermore, iGEM Organizing committee organized an Asian team leaders’ workshop that focused on team building, laboratory safety and practices. We have learned quite a lot about what’s on about iGEM, and how to make a meaningful and beneficial project. Organizer also invited experts from biotechnology industry to present us current developments in the industry, which really opened up our mind.

Approach 2
ComR approach details
Still with the aim of creating a rapid UV-response system, we elaborated a second approach based on a regulation pathway, the ComR and ComS system, originally found in Streptococcus thermophilius. Our goal is to produce a UV inducible promoter.
ComR and ComS mechanism
The ComR and ComS system controls natural competence and allows quorum sensing in S. thermophilius.  ComS is a small peptide encoded in the genome. After synthesis, it is matured and extruded from the cell into the medium. The peptide’s import allows other cells to sense the signal. When a basal level is reached it will trigger a competence in the whole population.  Indeed, once reimported in the cell the ComS will be able to bind ComR protein. This will allow the formation of a ternary complex (peptide-protein-DNA) with a specific DNA motif (ComR-box) and trigger the downstream gene’s expression (See schema here below).
Our little trick
The ComS’s mature sequence is LPYFAGCL. An aromatic’s substitution by an alanine would block the binding to ComR. Hence our objective is to synthetize this peptide while replacing the tyrosine by a tyrosine-ortho-nitro benzyl (tyr-ONB). This should indeed prevent the binding unless there is some UV exposure and the ONB or photocage is released. This will result in the gene’s expression controlled by the ComR box’s  induced by exposure. Using a red fluorescence protein should signal the UV exposure.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," recommend testing the sensitivity of the whole tool by also testing the RNA prepared from all the different dilutions DNA with Cas13a. Lastly, it would be interesting to test an isothermal T7 RNA polymerase. In this way, not only the RPA-reaction works at room temperature, but the whole RPA and in vitro transcription can be done at this temperature, greatly increasing the user-friendliness of our tool.
Conclusions
We experimentally validated that boiling is an easy and effective method to isolate DNA from gram-negative bacteria in milk and gram-positive bacteria in LB. Also, that the combined RPA and in vitro transcription reaction can be performed at a constant temperature. Furthermore, we mapped out and tested all the sample preparation steps to get from gram-negative bacteria with our target gene to our target RNA, which activated Cas13a. We can state that we successfully prepared a biological sample for detection via Cas13a. We translated what we learned into a user-friendly protocol that can be followed by farmers to perform sample preparation on their farm.
CINDY Seq - Generating a visible readout
The goal of the detection module was to demonstrate our newly invented coacervation method, named Coacervate Inducing Nucleotide Detection of Your Sequence (CINDY Seq). CINDY Seq allows naked-eye detection of target recognition by Cas13a, exploiting the physical phenomenon called “coacervation”. This is the phenomenon that mutually attracting polymers phase-separate into polymer-rich regions (known as coacervates) and polymer-poor regions if the polymers are long enough and the conditions are right. More elaborate description of this method is provided on the design page , and a theoretical model describing the coacervation process is provided on the modelling page .
Achievements
Production of visible coacervates
We started forming coacervates following Aumiller et al. 2016 . They use “long” polymers of uracil (polyU) in combination with spermine, a small positively charged polyamine, to form coacervates. PolyU/spermine coacervates were formed with 0.1 wt% polyU and various spermine concentrations. The absorbance of 500 nm light was measured by UV/Vis spectrophotometry. The results are shown in Figure 19. An interesting observation that follows from these measurements is that there is an optimum of spermine in between 0.1 and 1.0 wt%. This is counterintuitive, as it is hard to imagine that addition of more spermine actually decreases the amount of coac"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Furthermore, it is interesting that the published copy number of ColE1 plasmids ranging from 100 to 300 and copy numbers of pSC101-based plasmids, like pHSG, are only between 6 and 8 (Kornberg und Baker 1992; Cabello et al. 1976; Hasunuma und Sekiguchi 1977). Based on this data, we expected  ratios between 12.5 and 50. The observed difference between our sequencing based copy number estimation and the previously published values, could be explained by the application of different techniques. Assuming the copy number of the controlled regulation of pSC101 plasmid is correct (6-8) this results in copy numbers for the ColE1 plasmid of 34-46 for the wild type and 29-38 for the error prone polymerase I. In our opinion the determination of plasmid ratios via NGS is more reliable than older methods. Therefore, we will use our determined value of 40 copies with a normal polymerase and 33 copies with the error prone polymerase I as values for our calculations in the reversion assay article.
To assess the mutations incorporated by the error prone polymerase I we wrote a custom python script which
Imports a TSV file
Counts coverage for all non-reference bases at every positions as well as the total coverage
Normalizes the counted mutations by the total coverage of the analyzed plasmid
Constructs mutation and coverage plots for all sequences of interest
This script calculates the mutation frequency as mutation frequency per sequenced base. The calculation was done for all mappings to our reporter plasmid. The results provide an overview about the basal mutation rate in combination with the sequencing error and the effect of the error prone polymerase I.
Figure 6: Mutation frequency determined by high-throughput sequencing. The mutation frequency was determined as observed mutation per sequenced bases. The control is our reporter plasmid grown without any kind of mutator. Therefore, this sample was used to control for sequencing errors and other background effects. The higher numbers of differences to the reference in other samples is supposed to represent true mutations. Analyzed samples are our reporter plasmid grown"
BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," sequence of the target gene is relatively long and the expressed protein is more complex, that is, when the target gene is expressed, the bacteria will be subjected to a certain pressure, our system will have more significant effect. On the other hand, we should look for a promoter with the suitable amount of expression to control the expression of GDH. At the same time, we can look for smaller and more efficient growth-promoting factors to further improve our system.
Through the comparison in Figure 22, we can clearly see that the single cell fluorescence of Figure 22D is higher than that of Figure 22B, and the single cell fluorescence of Figure 22C is higher than that of Figure 1. Scilicet, the E. coli target gene in both the experimental group and the control group was higher expressed under the condition of adding ampicillin. This shows that the traditional method of antibiotic resistance selection is very effective, and it can indeed stably express the target gene by reducing the structural damage of the plasmid or the loss of the plasmid. On the other hand, our system can effectively play the above role with low concentrations of antibiotics, and our system can reduce the use of antibiotics to a certain extent.
From the experimental results, we can find out whether the addition of IPTG has little effect on the final expression of GFP. Even if IPTG is added to some extent, the fluorescence of single cells will decrease. This phenomenon is not in line with expectations, because the lactose operon should be promoted by IPTG to promote the expression of downstream genes, that is, the expression of GFP should be increased after the addition of IPTG. We initially believe that it may be that the promoter we use is strong and the response to IPTG is high. The final concentration of IPTG we calibrated was 1.5 mM/L. The IPTG highly concentrated caused a large amount of response from the promoter. We used a high copy number plasmid, which increased the load of E. coli and eventually caused some bacterium overload to death. In the follow-up experiments, we will reduce the concentration of IPTG or remove the lactose operon region from the plasmid to solve this problem.

Gradient antibiotic concentration experiment
Design
In our anti-degradation verification experiment, we found that the anti-degeneration effect of the genetic loop we constructed against the uneven distribution of the plasmid was not obvious, but it was also found to have a growth-promoting effect, that is, the growth rate of the strains introduced the plasmid was higher than that"
Stony_Brook,2017,Team:Stony Brook#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ins are all small, membrane-active peptides, and are grouped into subclasses based on common structural features and shared homologies [8]—a feature that makes phylogenetic analysis useful. Shorter amino acid sequences also mean that similarities in structure between these bacteriocins can be more easily identified.
Bacteriocin sequences were chosen using BLAST, a common bioinformatics multiple sequence alignment algorithm used to identify sequences that are similar to one or more input sequences—in this case, the protein sequence of lacticin Z—using NCBI’s protein-protein, pBLAST algorithm. The substitution matrix PAM was chosen over BLOSUM, since PAM matrices score alignments between more closely related protein sequences. The lowest PAM matrix number available, PAM 30, was used for the same reason.
For a more complete phylogenetic tree, other class II bacteriocins that are representative of the class and/or well-studied bacteriocins were included, such as circularin, enterocin, and leucocin, as well as some bacteriocins from class I, III, and V [9]. Colicins, a class of large bacteriocins produced by gram-negative bacteria [8], was chosen as the outgroup in order to root the tree.
Methods: Multiple Sequence Alignment
These chosen sequences were aligned with ClustalW’s multiple sequence alignment algorithm using the PAM substitution matrix. We chose to analyze protein sequences over nucleotide sequences because protein sequence alignments often predict homologous relationships more accurately [10]. It is easier to achieve statistically significant alignments with protein sequences because a larger alphabet of characters—20 amino acids compared to 4 nucleotides—means less likelihood of obtaining a match by chance. Furthermore, because of the redundancy in genetic code, synonymous mutations in codons are not accounted for in protein alignment. In nucleotide alignments, synonymous mutations have the possibility of scoring the same as non-synonymous mutations, even though synonymous mutations are not under selective pressure.
Methods: Phylogenetic Reconstruction
After aligning sequences, we chose to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood method. Phylogenetic tree construction methods can be categorized into two main groups: distance based and character based [11]. We did not use a distance based approach, such as UPGMA and other neighbor joining methods, because these algorithms cluster sequences solely based on genetic distance, and not based on divergence times.
Out of the character based approaches, we chose the maximum likelihood method because it is one of the most robust methods, and is favorable for phylogeny reconstruction of sequences where we have limited"
Braunschweig,2013,Team:Braunschweig#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," insert fragments were extracted from gel while the vector part was dephosphorylated. Afterwards purification of vector and insert parts was performed and the DNA was ligated according to our protocol. Subsequently, the ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' by heat shock.  Yesterday‘s test for leakiness under different conditions showed that the use of LB Medium wouldn’t solve the problem of the leaky promoters since liquid cultures showed high cell density for all ampicillin concentrations. We still need to find a solution for this problem in order to get our concept to work.  Furthermore, we performed new colony PCRs and agarose ge of the transcription factor LuxR, the combined Rhl-autoinducer synthase RhlI and aeBlue expression cassette as well as the Plas induced ampicillin resistance cassette from colonies on agar plates.
Week 9: July 14 - July 20, 2013
The highlight of this week was our first visit at the DSMZ (German collection of microorganisms an cell cultures). We got the chance to analyze our cells containing different chromoprotein expression cassettes with a FACS (Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter) and found out that it is difficult to differentiate our cells them like this.
Monday, July 15, 2013
Investigators: Kevin, Anna, Kerstin, Laura, Melanie
In order to construct  the RhlR and LasR expression cassettes with an upstream double terminator both expression cassettes and the double terminator were restricted and extracted from gel and purified respectively. After ligation a transformation was performed. Furthermore the problem with the leakiness of our promoters was discussed again. Therefore we tested the expression cassettes containing the inducible promoters in different minimal media. We observed leakiness for the inducible promoter of the las quorum sensing system, but no leakiness for the inducible promoter from the rhl quorum sensing system. Thus, the minimal media did not solve our problems with the promoter leakiness. In the afternoon Kerstin, Laura, Anna and Melanie visited the DSMZ in Braunschweig  and tested the fluorescence characteristica of cells carrying a single chromoprotein and mixtures of cell carrying different chromoproteins in a FACS (Fluorescent Associated Cell Sorter). When measuring cells containing the same chromoprotein expression cassette we saw that it might be possible to differentiate cells carrying the yellow amilGFP and the pink eforRed chromoprotein by thier fluorescence cause they showed significantly different signals. However, when we"

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," resistances could be observed. As history shows we were always able to develop novel antibiotics or develop modifications for known antibiotics to cope with the evolution of bacteria. For the last thirty years antibiotic development has been stagnant, not a single novel antibiotic was developed, many promising compounds were discovered and tested but all of them failed leading to an ongoing antibiotic discovery void. [3]
That trend puts modern methods of antibiotic development into question. Bioinformatics supported compound screenings could generate huge amounts of potential agents and targets of which most did look promising in “in vitro” studies and initial testing’s. However, all of them failed in toxicological or “in vivo” experiments. Posing the question if understanding mechanisms and calculating potential binding abilities is the way to go. Some researchers already turned their backs to modern methods and returned to the testing of natural compounds originating in widely uncharted organisms like tropical plants and sea organisms. Another approach is utilizing bacterial abilities and compounds to either trick bacteria to deliberately take up toxins/antibiotics or to utilize the abilities of predatory bacteria like Myxobacteria possess to exterminate their natural prey.  Myxobacteria are a bacterial species of which our understanding is still very poor. What we know is that they hunt in packs and exterminate other bacterial species with a vast arsenal of antibiotic compounds which they express based on their prey.[4]
Harmless bacteria evolve into relentless threats
The presence of antibiotics in almost every aspect of life leads to the adaptation of common bacteria to our most efficient weapon in the war against infectious diseases. Common bacteria becoming more and more resistant poses a twofold threat:
Bacteria are capable of horizontal gene transfer, a mechanism that speeds up evolution among a population by transferring useful genes, like antibiotic resistances, from bacteria to bacteria.
Common bacteria, like Enterobacteria and Pseudomonades, can cause facultative infections. And any infection can potentially lead to a lethal outcome through sepsis and biofilm formation.
Thus, Hospital acquired infections are on the rise and become less and less treatable.
Standard surgeries might become life threatening again
The most common bacterial threats in hospitals are Enterobacteria like E. coli and K. pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Those strains developed many different resistance mechanisms and the ability to develop potent biofilms which leads to chronic infections that are almost impossible to cure.[5]
Therefore, the Royal Medical Society recently shed some light on current prophylaxes which become less and less effective due to the rising inefficiency of antibiotics. A global trend that leads to the point where even the most"

Overview
‘Micro Holmes concentration measurement system’ is a system containing electronic components, mechanical components, biology components (several kinds of genetic engineered bacteria) and software working with them. Using this system, you can monitor the contaminants concentrations whenever and wherever in a cheap and easy way.
A typical ‘Micro Holmes concentration measurement system’ at least include:
A Microbial Fuel Cell
 -- cathode chamber and anode chamber
 -- carbon fiber felt
 -- proton exchange membrane
A MCU -- such as pcDuino3 board
A voltage magnification circuit board
An Analogue-to-Digital Conversion chip
A set of input and output devices--C such as touch screen
One or several kinds of bacteria--C such as genetic engineered E.coli
Till now, we have made two versions of Micro Holmes concentration measurement system, the professional version and the portable version. Their main principles are totally same. The only difference is that the professional version has a set of complicated MFCs (6 cathode and anode chambers with thermostats and magnetic stirrers) and can automatically change sample. On the other hand, the portable version has its own incomparable merits. Portable ones are cheap, handiness and fit for complex working environment.
We will bring a portable version of our ‘Micro Holmes concentration measurement system’ to the Giant Jamboree. So this Manual will concentrate on the portable version.
Quick Guide
1.  Power On: Press the power button more than 3 seconds till the power light sparkles.
2.  The touch screen will show the ‘Welcome screen’, please wait until the ‘MODE’ screen appears.
3.  Select the ‘Standard Curve (Initialization)’ mode to work out a formula showing the correlation between the concentration of contaminants and the output voltage of MFC (or load an existing one)
4.  If you want to load an existing formula, just click the ‘OPEN’ icon, and then select a save file (Then please go to step 7). If you want to work out a new formula please click ‘ADD’, and then input the current concentration of contaminants ended with the button ‘OK’.

Problem we aim to solve
Genetic engineered bacteria which use plasmid as expression vector are widely                                 employed in many social domains and developed rapidly these years. However,                                 the plasmid segregational instability has been the limitation of scientific                                 research and large-scale industry production for plasmid-based expression system.
So, what’s the plasmid segregational instability?
It’s known that uneven cell division arises frequently which is bound to                                 produce two daughter cells with different plasmid numbers. The cell with                                 less plasmids will produce cells with much less plasmids.
In our project, those cells with not enough plasmid number are called ""Slacker"", on the contrary, ""Worker"" is the name for cells with enough plasmid.
The existence of slackers will sharply decrease the efficiency and profit due to the slacker’s                                 increasing proliferation ability while producing no target substances.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of the slackers. Can we make                                 the bacteria themselves monitor the plasmid losing situation and eliminate these slackers?                                 In this way, we can enhance the plasmid stability,                                 stabilize the microbial population structure and finally improve the production efficiency.
Project overview
We decide to equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller)
In our project, the inhibitor protein’s concentration is used as a signal to indicate the                                 intracellular plasmid numbers. The sketch map of our basic circuit is shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1 The basic circuit of P-SLACKiller.
We choose a constitutive promoter to express inhibitor gene, and an ""in-promoter"" which                                 is repressed by inhibitor to express killer gene. Under normal circumstances, for                                 plasmid concentration being high enough, our killer is repressed by inhibitor whose                                 concentration is connected with plasmid numbers. However, considering the effect of                                 plasmid segregational instability, the plasmid numbers will decrease, so as the                                 intracellular inhibitor protein. The inadequate inhibitor cannot completely repress the                                 expression of downstream killer gene, and all those slackers will be killed.

1:10 dilution series was performed to generate -1 through -7 sample. Spot test followed when we spotted 5uL of each sample unto one plate overlaid with 0.5mL of E coli B overnight and 5mL of x1 top agar.
Titers were performed for the -6 and -7 samples: 0.5 mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight was infected with 20 uL of each phage sample for approximately 20 minutes before 5mL of x1 top agar was added and content plated.
2) Applying the mutagen (8.26)
Label 4 test tubes C, 0, 500, and 850. Add 10mL of LB and 200ul of E coli B overnight into each test tube. Incubate on the shaker at 37 Celsius for approximately an hour before 50uL of adenine solution was added to each test tube.
Remove all the test tubes off the shaker after another hour of incubation. Add an additional 40ul of adenine and 80ul of uracil to each test tube. Also add the corresponding amount in ul of 5-bromodeoxyuridine, a mutagen, to each test tube. (Ex: Add 500ul of mutagen to tube labeled 500)
Place all the tubes on the shaker at 37 Celsius.
After 20 minutes, take only the tube labeled C from the shaker. Take 1mL from this tube and pipette it into a cuvette labeled C. Using 1mL of LB in a cuvette, blank the spectrophotometer at 600 OD. Then measure the absorbance of the cuvette labeled C. Measurement was repeated for verification.
Remove the other three tubes after 30 minutes of incubation and add 150ul of T7 phage from the ""8.24 T7 stock"" to each tube. (There should be a 1:10 phage to bacteria concentration. The calculations are as follows: The spectrophotometer reading was 0.354A, which indicates there are 1.77E8 bacteria/ml. Because there are 10ml in each tube, there is roughly 1.77E9 bacteria per tube. This means that we need 1.77E8 phage added to each tube. Because the 8.24 stock is concentrated at 1.6E7 phage/20uL, 150ul of phage will provide 1.2"

Luminescence measurement of ""Suicide switch-like"" module
Luminescence measurement of the Bacillus subtilis strain W168 containing thrC::PspoIVB-ecf41bli aa 1-204 (through transformation with pSBBs4S-PspoIVB-ecf41bli aa 1-204) and sacA::PydfG-luxABCDE (through transformation with pSBBs3C-luxABCDE-PydfG)
For this measurement, the Bacillus subtilis strain W168 B63 was used.
This puts the luxABCDE cassette in the place of the MazF later. Therefore, this output should reflect the expression of MazF in our Suicide switch.
σG, the last sigma factor in the forespore, activates PspoIVB, which controls expression of ecf41bli aa 1-204 in our module. Ecf41bli aa 1-204 activates PydfG, and thereby the production of luciferase as a substitute of MazF.
This platereader measurement is the first and not reproduced to this point!
We get an expected activation of the module in late stationary phase and therefore during sporulation. It therefore seems to work.
But we also get a much too early peak of luminescence at about six hours during transition state, maybe due to unspecific (stress-induced?) activation. As the Ecf41bli aa 1-204 used is the truncated version which is constitutively ""ON"", this could lead to a high activation of the PydfG"

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Chemical Diffusion Model_-_-_TEXT.html," We inject the certain chemical into the first layer to form a concentration gradient (Fig.2).
• Gas molecules diffuse downward across the PDMS layer and reach the second layer.
Fig.2 A) The formation of chemical concentration gradient. We inject the chemicals into the inlet 1 and the water into the inlet 2 to form it. B) Chemical diffusion down through PDMS. The chemical can across the PDMS to enter into Layer2 full of the M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl. Add H2O to 1 liter.).
After that, the worms in the Layer2 can respond to the gradient chemical (diacetyl or 2-nonanone). We are able to determine whether their behavior is close to the wild types. See another model .
Fig.3 A) The Gaussian Plate Using this chip, we can know the C. elegans’ preference and repulsion through their distribution in the chip. The chamber is just like B) the Galton Nail Plate.
Physical Process
1. Forming Concentration Gradient
We need to know the time for forming the uniform concentration gradient. The characteristic diffusion time tc can be calculated by the Einstein and Brownian movement equation(Yang, Wu, Xu & Wang, 2011) [1] :
t=\frac{w^{2}}{2D}
Here, w is the diffusive distance, which is equal to half of the width of the branch channel (In our work, the width of any serpentine branch channel is 0.15 mm.);
D is the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in liquid.
The D value of the diacetyl is 8.5*10-6cm2s-1
Based on the above formulas and parameters, we can get our tc=3.3s. It means that it costs 3.3s to form the expected gradient in layer1.
2.The Diffusion Time for Chemicals in PDMS
The process that gas molecules diffuse downward across the PDMS layer is considered. The second layer is full of the continual M9 buffer flow, so the chemicals will not be accumulated in this layer. We can assume that the concentration of layer2 is always equal to the concentration at the bottom of the PDMS.
A simplified diffusion model is built to describe the physical process:
Fig.4 The diffusion in the Gassian chip the chemicals will diffuse through the PDMS layer as gas molecular.
For nonsteady-state diffusion, we use Fick’s second law to describe the process

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2015,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ing if expression of putative glycogen acyltransferase enzymes affect E. coli glycogen content
AIM:
To analyse the effect of expression of the putative acyltransferase enzymes (MAO, Rv3030, Rv3034c, Rv3037c) on E. coli glycogen content. This was to confirm if expression of the enzymes inhibit the synthesis of glycogen, for example by competing with glycogen synthases for the Carbon 4.
METHOD:
The E. coli which had been transformed with the acyltransferases under control of an inducible promoter were firstly grown in LB media and then divided into two, with half being induced with IPTG, and then allowed to grow overnight. Cells were harvested from 1 mL of each culture and the cell pellet re-suspended in Lugol’s solution. This process repeated in low nitrogen, high carbon minimal media, which promotes glycogen accumulation. The cells were harvested from 1 L of media and the glycogen was extracted using the glycogen extraction protocol.
RESULTS:
There was no significant colour change with Lugol staining, although the MAO cultures were noticebly lighter in colour.
Figure 1: Overnight pelleted bacterial cells after IPTG-addition to half of the LB liquid cultures of the branching and acyltransferase enzymes resuspended in Lugol’s solution.
The masses of the glycogen extracted are as follows;
    •  MAO non-induced: glycogen extract mass = 30 mg
    •  MAO induced with IPTG glycogen extract mass = 40 mg
    •  Rv3030 induced with IPTG: glycogen extract mass = 60 mg
    •  Rv3030 non-induced: glycogen extract mass = 30 mg
    •  Rv3034c induced with IPTG: glycogen extract mass = 50 mg
    •  Rv3034c non-induced: glycogen extract mass = 60 mg
    •  Rv3037c induced with IPTG: glycogen extract mass = 40 mg
    •  R3037c non-induced: glycogen extract mass = 40 mg
The glycogen from all extracts was an amorphous white powder, confirmed to be glycogen by TEM imaging, as in previous experiments (not shown here). The masses observed were not significantly less when enzymes were induced, indicating that their expression did not interfere with glycogen content. Interestingly, the mass of glycogen was actually doubled upon induction"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Figure 9: The time derivatives of concentration of monoterpenes produced using the pinene synthases, PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin, found in the simplified biochemical pathway as a function of time.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - FOR MANUFACTURING
After proving that the addition of the K6R-HMG2 and erg20-2 would increase the production of monoterpenes, I performed sensitivity analysis to determine which enzymes would most contribute to the increase in production of GPP substrate, monoterpenes and the rate at which monoterpenes are produced.
In order to do this, I tripled each of the following enzymes and ran the simulations separately:
[K6R-HMG2]
[IDI1] for the production of DMA-PP
[IDI1] for the production of I-PP
[erg20-2]
[PgTPS-Pin2]
I compared each case to the above simulations which were based on the fact that each enzyme was at the same relative concentrations. This was the case for both endogenous cells which contained the ERG20 and HMG2 genes as well as for the mutant cells containing the erg20-2 and K6R-HMG2 genes instead. All measurements were compared at steady state.
The first result is the concentration of GPP increased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. The simulations suggest the following:
tripling the [K6R-HMG2] increases the [GPP] by 8.7000 times
not tripling any enzymes, for the mutant cell, yields an increase of [GPP] of 1.6929 times
tripling the [IDI1], for the production of DMA-PP, increases the [GPP] by 1.4484 times
Figure 10: The concentration of GPP increased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. Mutant cells contain the erg20-2 and K6R-HMG2 genes where as endogenous cells have the HMG2 and ERG20 genes instead.
The second result is the concentration of GPP decreased using the pinene synthases (PgTPS-Pin2 and PsTPS-Pin), with selected enzymes' concentrations being tripled, for the simplified biochemical pathway. The simulations suggest the"
