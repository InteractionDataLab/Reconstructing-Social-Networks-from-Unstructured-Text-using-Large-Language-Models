    Article 19 The studies of the health and quarantine organ are as follows:
    (4) Carry out health and quarantine inspection of any special articles such as exported or imported microzoaria, biological, human tissue, blood and hemoproducts as well as some animals that may spread human epidemic diseases;
 
Train station
    We contacted a personnel working in the department of safety inspection in the train station. Below is the interview.
    Q: Can the safety inspection machine detect these biological products?
    A: Until now, the safety inspection machine do not have the function to detect biological products. It can only detect whether it is liquid or not. We need passengers to drink a sip of water. But if it is other products, we will treat accordingly.
    Q: Do you have any regulations to limit the category, quantity of biological products?
    A: The category, quantity of biological products must abide by the regulations made by quarantine department.
    Q: Currently, how do railway department detect biological products such as microorganism, DNA?
    A: Currently, we do not have specific inspection machine to detect biological products.
    Q: Is there an emergency plan to deal with events when biological products leak and spread?
    A: We have such an emergency plan. But in view of public opinion and the danger of panic, it is not appropriate to announce this plan.
 
Airport
    We contacted the safety inspection department in the airport. Following are our findings:
    a. Liquid is not allowed to be carried with passengers themselves.
    b. Airline safety inspection is more complicated than train station. Because airline transportation is composed of internal and overseas lines. If we go abroad, we should not only pass the safety inspection in the airport, but also pass the inspection from the customs. And every country may have different regulations on what can be imported and exported.
    c. For biological products, we should ask both the airline company and the state’s customs to make sure whether they are legal.
 
Express delivery
    We chose to investigate SF Express Company which is famous for its quality of service. Following is what we got:
    a. Inflammable and explosive articles can not be transported.
    b. Whether products can be transported or not depends on their staff’s inspection. They will provide on-site service.

No growth was observed on the negative control plates with un- transformed DH5α cells, as they are not naturally resistant to ampicillin.
Week commencing: 20/08/2018
The week started with a visit to Scotland to meet the Edinburgh iGEM team. The visit was extremely useful as it allowed us to share our progress with Edinburgh and vice versa and we also gave each other feedback on our respective projects. Additionally, we discussed the potential for collaborations, ate lots of pizza and even got to see some of the shows in the Edinburgh Fringe festival. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Edinburgh and meeting the Edinburgh team, who were very hospitable and we hope to maintain a close relationship with Edinburgh iGEM moving forward.
Two members of the team, Will and Umar, also travelled to London to meet with Richard Ballard, co-founder of Growing Underground. We were shown around their tunnels of hydroponics which grow approximately 33 metres below the busy streets of Clapham. Growing Underground sustainably grow fresh micro greens and salad leaves, which are unaffected by weather and seasonal changes, before providing these to wholesalers and local restaurants such as M&S and Ocado. The meeting was very productive, we discussed how our project may be beneficial to the company and, also, how the company can help our project develop. We discussed the project at length and considered how the project might be refined to better meet the needs and concerns of a company such as Growing Underground. We hope to continue working with Richard and the Growing Underground team as we continue to develop the project.
This week in the lab, we resuspended the gblocks and primers from IDT. We also calculated the volumes of pSB1C3 and gblock inserts required for specific concentrations in the Gibson assembly and conducted a Gibson Assembly using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Reaction Protocol. We then transformed the Gibson Assembly using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Protocol, and then spread the reaction mixture onto chloramphenicol selection plates for overnight incubation. There was no colony growth on any of the plates therefore transformation was unsuccessful.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

To test the activity of the Taz construct we created, varying concentrations of L-aspartatic acid were added to a culture of E. coli expressing Taz construct on plasmid pSB1AK3 and RFP under the promoter PompC (Bba_M30011) on plasmid pSB1C3.
Two isogenic strains of E. coli K-12, BW25113 (parent strain for the Keio collection ) and JW3367-3 (with ΔEnvZ mutation) were transformed with pSB1AK3 carrying our Taz construct (BBa_K1343016) and pSB1C3 carrying the BBa_M30011 reporter.  The bacteria were cultured in growth media containing varying concentrations of L-aspartic acid.  After two hours of growth the relative RFP fluorescence of the cultures was determined (fluorescence/OD).
The strains used were given to us by Lior Zelcbuch, Elad Hertz from Ron Milo’s lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
OD was measured at 600nm.
Fluorescence excitation wavelength: 560nm
Fluorescence emission wavelength: 612nm
The goal was to compare the expression in the wild type and in the ΔEnvZ mutant.  We expected that in the wild type the expression will be greater than in the mutant since the natural EnvZ/ompR system will cause expression of the RFP.
Figure 2: Relative fluorescence dependent on L-aspartic acid concentration (mM)
Figure 2 shows that at low concentrations of L-aspartatic acid (below 1mM), there is a steady, constant expression of the reporter in both the wild type and the mutant strain.  The relative fluorescence observed by the mutant strain (ΔEnvZ) is lower than that of the parent strain.
The mutant shows an increase in relative fluorescence is observed at 1.33mM L-aspartic acid, with a peak at 2mM followed by a drop in relative fluorescence at 4mM"

Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
So far, the Metal Sensing Team have successfully digested the pSB1A2 plasmid (which contains the BBa_J33206 BioBrick - the arsR gene and binding site) so that the plasmid has had it's promoter removed. With this linearised fragment we hope to insert the czrA gene along with the cadA promoter; these genes will be extracted from the genome of Bacillus subtilis via PCR reactions. The primers capable of this are pMA1 and pMA2 (designed by Mathew and Arun).
Today we will carry out PCR in order to amplify czrA gene for our team and sac, ara and sspb genes for the stochastic switch team. However we must first of all hydrate and prepare the primers which have just arrived (i.e. pMA1 and pMA2). We will also need to prepare for the possibility of the PCR reactions not working - overnight cultures of B. subtilis in LB medium will be prepared for a possible PCR tomorrow.
Practical Outline
These are the three things which the Metal Sensing Team need to have accomplished by today:
Hydrate the newly-arrived primers pMA1 and pMA2, adding water according to their concentrations (in nMoles); then dilute them to 10x dilution.
Using the 10x hydrated primers, carry out a czrA amplification PCR reaction on cells taken from a plate containing wild type Bacillus subtilis
Inoculate LB cultures with B. subtilis cells and grow overnight - this is for if the PCR reactions today don't work
Procedure
1) Preparing primers pMA1 and pMA2
pMA1 and pMA2 need to be rehydrated by adding sterile distilled water. The volume of water to be added is simply (the concentration (in nMoles) of the primers multiplied by 5) ul. The concentrations of the primers are as follows
pMA1 = 30.6 nMoles
pMA2 = 31."

Structure of complex of protein and other biomolecules are often saved as format of “*.PDB”. Visualization and analysis of that structure and sequence are also important to design novel engineered proteins. PyMol is used for such purposes. We used PyMol for two processes. First of all, it is used to confirm iG-like regions of FGFR are really FGF binding domain. We downloaded the FGF binding domain of FGFR from RCSB PDB and checked the sequence binds to the FGF is really marked as iG-like regions. (Interleukin receptors have iG-like regions, but they do not bind to their signal molecules.) Other process using PyMol is to visualize the structural alignment result made by Matt. PyMol saves the image of biomolecules in png format.

Impact of our project on society
As part of the human practices side of our project, we wanted to investigate what the impact of our project on society would be, whether good or bad. To do this we brainstormed amongst ourselves, questioned a number of professional scientists and researched published literature. We considered the impact on society if our project was to be scaled up to an industrial level.
Positive impacts of our project
We believe our project could have a number of positive impacts on society if it were to be successfully scaled up to an industrial level. We will discuss these below:
Improved environmental impact :
We believe that our project if implemented on an industrial scale could reduce the damaging environmental impact of fragrance production in industry. Currently essentials oils are extracted from plants using processes such as CO2 extraction, which requires high pressures, and steam distillation, which requires high temperatures, both of which are energy demanding processes. Yields of essential oils obtained through distillation processes are also very low, rarely above 5%, with yields for lavender around 1% and lemon 2%[1], meaning large amounts of crops are grown to obtain very little of the desired product. Our project could allow the production of these fragrant compounds with less energy consumption and less waste products produced.
Increased land availability:
With the human population rapidly increasing, land availability for food production is becoming an increasing problem. A report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation for the United Nations in 2011 states 'Today's population of around 7 billion is expected to increase to about 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2009). By this time, another one billion tonnes of cereals and 200 million extra tonnes of livestock products will need to be produced every year (Bruinsma, 2009)[2].' The reduction in use of land for fragrance production will free up land for food crop production instead.
Creation of jobs:
With more and more people receiving a good and higher level education, we have an increasing number of trained scientists looking for jobs. Our project will create skilled jobs suitable to those with a scientific background.
Scientific advancement/medical research:
Terpenoids are not just used in the fragrance industry, they are also commonly found in antimalarial and anticancer drugs. The creation of terpenoids for use in medical products is also being researched[3], and methods developed in our project could aid this research. It could also aid further synthetic biology"

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance Analysis#m_-_-_TEXT.html," interval including no GFP response and strong GFP response. Because the interval we set is small, we define sensitivity according to the logarithmic nicotine concentration as the equation below
Equation 3 Sensitivity of GFP signal to nicotine input
Due to the application of difference without the calculation of limit value, the sensitivity value is not completely same as the real differential coefficient of GFP intensity-nicotine input curve. To increase the accuracy and smooth the sensitivity-nicotine curve, the sampling interval of log10 nicotine is set to 0.001.
Figure 5 GFP concentration vs nicotine
Figure 6 Signal sensitivity vs nicotine
The variation between promoter 1 strength may influence the GFP signal response to nicotine input, so we select three groups for comparison: 0.1 (group1), 0.5 (group2) and 1 (group3). Figure 5 shows the change of GFP maximal concentration with different nicotine input. All three groups have two bursts in the curve, which means that there are two regions with high sensitivity. This phenomenon is also reflected by figure 6. When nicotine input is between 1e-3.8and 1e-3 M, three groups have very strong sensitivity. The left boundary of the interval is the threshold of the sensing system, which is about 1e-3.8 M for group 2/3, and 1e-3.6 M for group 1. But for the second burst, the interval of the three groups vary a lot. The burst interval of the three groups is [1e-3.2, 1e-2] M, [1e-2.7, 1e-1.3] M and [1e-2.3, 1e-1] M separately. This difference of sensitivity distribution means that we can select specific promoter 1 strength to achieve high sensitivity and precision sensing and measurement in the defined nicotine input range. This idea can be developed to a new application in our future work.
Time point of signal processing
In the experiment, we need to choose the appropriate time to measure the GFP signal to determine the existence and concentration of nicotine in the medium. Besides, to collect the maximal quantity of final product, it is important to select the time point when 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine reaches highest concentration. This session we simulate the change of GFP/NicA2/3-Succinoyl-Pyridine and identify the start time of observable GFP signal and the duration time of GFP signal and NicA2 high expression. At last, according"

Expression Control
SDS PAGE
As a crucial part of the selection system, the correct expression of the binding and the target protein is inevitable. By testing several protein samples via SDS PAGE and western blot , this could be verified.
Figure 1. SDS PAGE for expression control: Result of a SDS PAGE with samples from left to right: Color prestained marker, HA4 Evobody wild type, HA4 Y87A mutant Evobody, HA4 R38A mutant Evobody, HA4 R38A E52A, SH2:cI + HA4 Evobody, SH2:cI434, SH2:cILambda
As the estimated molecular weight for the HA4 Evobody is 22 kDa and for the SH2 fusion protein 24 kDa, bands were expected to occur in the lower half of the separation gel. It can be seen in Figure 1 that the samples that should contain the HA4 Evobody and the SH2:cI fusion protein together, the SH2:cI434 fusion protein alone and the SH2:cILambda fusion protein alone show a band visible at an approximate molecular weight of 24 kDa. As the bands are relatively strong in comparison to the native proteins, which"

WHU-China,2012,Team:WHU-China#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli K.12 strain and genes we manipulated are original genes in E. coli. The protein products, at least from current understanding, will cause no harm to researchers, the public and environment. In addition, strict lab practice is executed to further ensure safety.
Q2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, Did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience? Yes, we will discuss this question in latter part of this page (Safety Considerations of Our Biobrick parts and Our Project).
Q3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country? Yes. All materials obtained have received the approvals from the department's laboratory management committees. We are also obliged to observe the regulations of Teaching Centre of Experimental Biology and apply for approval for materials before we start our project.
Q4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? Some classified measures should be taken according to the safety of the material. For example, plasmids that may harm the safety, when submitted, should receive more attention and have a stricter package. Some harmful byproducts during experiments should be eliminated properly. We have done our human practice aiming at understanding attitude of the public towards genetically modified baceria and publicizing biosafety ideas to the public, which we think should be popularized to other teams in future iGEM competitions.
General Safety Issues
In this part, we will illustrate organisms, reagents and equipments we use that may cause safety problems, and introduce our operation standard, management and trains protecting the team members, public and environment.
As above, all the organisms and DNA hosts are not of high individual or community risk. Until now, the only used organism is E. coli K.12 (and some of its varieties, for example, DH5α, a RecA mutated strain). Our current lab of basic-biosafety level 1 is safe enough to manipulate this strain. Only the genome (a generous present from University of Dundee iGEM team), but not the living Salmonella enterica was manipulated in the lab, and the genes from it are homogeneous of E. coli K"

- So I tried using Wine, a program that allows cross server systems. However, we realized that this would involve changing settings for the whole server. And this means that we would need another prof to help us (and he’s not around now). So this is not an option.
- we thought about accessing the executable in javascript. However, after researching, I learned that this requires the client to change permission settings of their own computer to work, and it is highly discouraged to do so.
- And finally, we decided that if we’re going to be using a linux server, we might have to write the executable file in java. But that would be more unnecessary work.
So after ruling out all the options that we could think of, we decided that we might have to set up a windows based server. Meaning we either have to set up one ourselves or have someone else come in and set up one.
So I’m back to square one.
Man. my whole research is going in circles.
July 24: More troubleshooting
Today was more trouble shooting. I tried so many more different ways. But, it still doesn’t work. why???
There’s definitely a way around it. I know there is. I can’t go empty-handed to my professor again. I have to make something that she likes. I have been working on the same project the whole summer and I most likely have made the least amount of progress this summer compared to everyone else in my lab. However, I guess when it comes down to how much I learned from all the trouble I have, I definitely didn’t learn less than others. However, I do wish to learn about C#, something that everyone else seems to have gotten the hang of. Instead, I have gotten a fairly good grasp of html/ css/ js, perl, cgi scripts, and working with servers.
ohwell. I really need that Eureka though. sigh. tomorrow. Hopefully, tomorrow will be the day.
July 25: Breakthrew
Breakthrew!!
I came in today and it was as if I stepped into another place in my research.
I have literally been going in circles (and if you have been following my blog, you’ll see that there are days where I had “breakthrews” only to be set back again and stuck with code.)
But today, a mentor was able to code pretty much my (and my lab mates) whole summer"

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

Week 11 - 19/09/11
Day 1:
We had our final advisors' meeting. The team continued to update the wiki. A miniprep was made of the overnights which was then eluted using a TE buffer (to be sent to MIT) and water (for further investigation).  Sam also carried out a digestion on the DNA to additionally confirm that the correct DNA was being sent. Overnights were also made for a final characterisation data experiment, involving controls, to be done.
Day 2:
DNA was sent to the registry in the morning. Another repeat of the arabinose experiment was carried out by Charlie. The team concentrated on finishing the wiki in time for the deadline in two days. Overnights were made so that more characterisation data could be obtained.
Day 3:
Ogaga carried out a final run of the arabinose characterisation experiment. The team continued to focus on updating the wiki and collating all the project's data to upload.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," The days are slipping by really quickly now, 26 days and counting until the wiki freeze! I was alone in the lab today, and since I had a course until 12, it sort of limited the amount of work I was able to do. I just ran some gels and did a PCR purification of the PCR products Anastasiya and I ran yesterday after the meeting. I also did restriction digests of the PCR products, but I managed to forget to take them out of the Thermoblock.. Good job, Thomas, that was a total waste of two hours... Luckily, Anastasiya and Patrick are coming in tomorrow, so they'll be able to redo the digests before we actually have to use them :P. Lisa and Maya from the Repressor group redid some ligations in the morning and transformed them in the afternoon. Both groups made overnight cultures of the restreaks done yesterday, so the people coming in tomorrow can miniprep the plasmids and run verifications PCRs to check if Wednesdays ligations went well.
I'd also like to start a new feature on this blog: Picture of the day! Maya has kindly offered to leave one of her cameras at the lab, so we can better document the stuff we're doing here. I'm certain we'll get some fun and cool pictures taken. Today we'll start with a picture of Maya doing transformations

Positive results from the lab!
Today was a great day for the Antiterminator group. Anastasiya and I ran some verification PCRs on the 5 ligations we did last Thursday. We finally confirmed that all the constructs we had hoped to make were successfully ligated! Other than that, both groups did restreaks of the ligations that were transformed yesterday. The Repressor groups seemed somewhat successful, but they decided to play it safe and redo some restrictions so they can redo the ligations tomorrow. For the Antiterminator group 3/4 of the ligations seem very promising. The last one, however, seems like it may have failed. We'll have to redo it next week if it has.
We also had our weekly meeting today. Nothing too exciting, we just talked about how to send in the biobricks we are submitting to the iGEM registry, buying plane tickets for Boston as well as who is going to be presenting at the jamboree in November, among other things.

INTEGRATED PRACTICES
Our human practice efforts in terms of engagement directly led to information that we incorporated into our project design.
Initially unsure of the best way to address the issue of antibiotic resistance via outreach, we performed extensive research on the subject. The publications we read mentioned many causes for the rapid pace of resistance development, including the overprescription of antibiotics in developed countries. We concluded that we needed the perspectives of clinicians if we were to understand why doctors overprescribe antibiotics, and how a group of undergraduates could hope to persuade doctors to prescribe antibiotics more appropriately.
As such, we interviewed Drs. Persell, Postelnick, and Scheetz, all of whom work on the research and clinical side of medicine through the Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Medicine. These interviews revealed a major reason doctors prescribe unneeded antibiotics: patient demand. Instead of persuading doctors to change their behavior, we decided to educate the public on appropriate use and prescription of antibiotics.
In addition, the three physicians agreed that CRISPR would be more effective if targeted to knock out resistance genes for existing antibiotics rather than serving as a novel antibiotic by targeting other bacterial genes. Existing antibiotic resistance proteins, such as beta-lactamase and fluoroquinolones, are safer targets and result from well-characterized sequences. This advice incorporated well into the design of CRISPR Capsules—a realistic future aim would be to introduce Cas9 encapsulated in OMVs to a cell already containing a guide RNA for a selection marker such as ampicillin. If Cas9 enters the cell and cuts the resistance gene, it will not grow on that antibiotic. This would be a proof of concept for targeting antibiotic resistance with CRISPR, and also a simple test of successful OMV delivery.
One interview question asked the clinicians to identify what they considered the most worrying antibiotic-resistant infections. Their answers included hospital skin infections like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. This also informed our project design, because topical infections would be safe early applications of a bacterially-derived product to evaluate immune response to the therapy.

.113 – 1.118
These variables represent the most significant factors related to business founding in iGEM when all the variables are regressed together. Having a successful Proof of Concept at iGEM, a business plan, plenty of knowledge exchange with industry as well as enough customer feedback enables iGEM teams to move their project from the academic world to a viable product.
Summary and Discussion of Quantitative Data
In sum, the significant quantitative variables (p ≤ .10) on iGEM business creation were 1) access to customer feedback, 2) knowledge exchange with industry, 3) a team entrepreneurial spirit, 4) product market growth 5) having entrepreneurship consulting, 6) awareness of government funding, 7) an interest in legal advice 8) an interest in patenting and 9) having a successful Proof of Concept for the iGEM project. The most significant negative variables (p ≤ .10) are 1) team functionality and 2) the inability to patent during iGEM project development.
Similar to the qualitative data, founding teams used much more knowledge exchange and entrepreneurial consulting, and had an entrepreneurial drive that made them more aware of funding opportunities, market growth and legal issues.
The most interesting factors are the degree to which knowledge exchange and mentorship were so crucial in supporting iGEM entrepreneurs. Industry interaction and proper guidance for the project and business played a heavy role in developing a marketable product, securing funding, understanding patents and being aware of market opportunities.
It is surprising that team functionality did not play a larger role in the statistics. Team quality and cohesiveness is often quoted to be one of the most significant factors for startups; however, in the case if iGEM it seems to be a negative influence. This could also stem from the fact that so many teams are very large (e.g. over 20 people), and often startups begin with much fewer people. This means teams likely split up after iGEM and only a few continued the business, as seen in the qualitative interviews.
The following sections will dive a little more deeply on Founder and non-Founder differences, as well as a look at the combined qualitative and quantitative data to better understand biotech entrepreneurship enabling factors.
Population Differences Between Founders and non-Founders
To further understand the enabling factors in biotech entrepreneurship, independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare population"

Clotho application: Circuit List and TTEC
We transplant the software into Clotho and the name of the application is Circuit List. Since Clotho is a popular framework in synthetic biology, many people can experience our standard and software. The database is the same as the online one and the information is the same as the online one. We also transplanted TTEC, which is the last year iGEM software into Clotho, which is promoted by iGEM.
Synthetic biology laboratory management
Human practice
We mainly did some human practice about publicity of synthetic biology so that more people can know what synthetic biology is, what iGEM is and what our standard and software is. Some workshop meetings were made to support other teams and get help from other teams. We also made a survey concerned with ethic issues in synthetic biology.

The 2018 Leiden IGEM team showed that nalidixic acid, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, induces cellular stress within bacteria. They hypothesized that this similar stress response might translate into mammalian systems as well.
Therefore, we collaborated with Leiden by testing four concentrations (0µM, 1µM, 5µM, 25µM and 100µM) of nalidixic acid addition in CHO DG44 cells transfected with our family of metallothionein (MT) promoters. As we described in our design page the MT1 promoter and and variations of the MT2 promoter have all been shown to activate transcription in response to cellular stresses.

MT1 - derived from Mus musculus 305bp, MT2 full - taken from HEK293T cell line 381bp, MT2 - 59bp promoter fragment as described by Santos, Anderson K. et al[1] . Error bars represent ± one standard deviation from the mean normalized fluorescence intensity.

CHO DG44 cells were transfected with pcDNA+eGFP plasmid MT promoter derivatives using the vender supplied lipofectamine 3000 protocol. Twelve hours after transfection cells were exposed to varying nalidixic acid concentrations (0µM, 1µM, 5µM, 25µM and 100µM) and varying H2O"

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4

TERRA addresses the lack of accessibility of microfluidics to the synthetic biology community by automating the exportation of outputs of microfluidic experiments onto standard lab vessels, such as a 96-well plate. Currently, researchers can either manually collect these outputs and transfer them into plates for later analysis or invest in highly specialized equipment, such as embedded sensors, to run real time, on chip analysis.1 Manual collection disrupts the benefits of automated microfluidic experiments, and implementing sensors requires extensive knowledge which synthetic biologists typically do not have.2 Incorporating sensors and other analytical systems on microfluidic chips requires expertise of microelectronics and fluid dynamics, as well as time for characterization of the devices. TERRA is the accessible and automated solution to incorporate microfluidic technology into the experimental workflow for synthetic biologists.
The Problem and TERRA
Some of the reasons why microfluidic devices are currently inaccessible and not widely used in the field of synthetic biology are as follows:
A lack of standardization across the microfluidic industry - differences in chip sizes, materials, and manufacturing methods
Difficult to integrate sensors into microfluidic devices - requires knowledge of microelectronics and fluid dynamics as well as takes time to fully characterize the system
Difficult to export the output of microfluidic devices in an organized manner - harder to integrate into other workflows
A lack of standardization of synthetic biology protocols - different labs use variations of similar protocols making it harder to design microfluidic chips for a general synthetic biology protocol
High entry costs to begin manufacturing microfluidic chips
TERRA addresses all of these limitations either directly or indirectly.
TERRA is microfluidic agnostic - since TERRA was designed to be compatible with both self-designed and commercial microfluidic chips, TERRA treats the microfluidic chip of interest like a black box system. Through the TERRA Adapter, the user connects their chip of interest to TERRA to facilitate select and redirect outputs.
TERRA is an automated system capable of selectively dispensing the output of a microfluidic chip into common lab vessels - as a system, TERRA consists of an active XY-plane and"

The three samples are incubated on plate overnight. We did the colony count next day morning. The CFU can be calculated with the number of colonies using given equation: # colonies x Final Dilution Factor = CFU/mL (Figure 4)
Discussion
According to the strength of the promoter given on the website, the average fluorescence obtain from measurement should be device 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 3 from highest to lowest. However, the data we obtained shows that the average fluorescence from high to low is device 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6. Between two devices the difference of the average value is rather small, so we assume that it might be within the range of uncertainties or some error occur when we were picking colonies to incubate them.
Another problem is that there is not a big difference between the fluorescence values measured in 0h and 6h. This may be because the fluorescence in 0h is measured after ice bath for 6 hours, and the ice bath may have failed to prevent the bacteria from growing, causing them to express fluorescent protein just like the 6h incubated bacteria. In addition, this may also account for the different order of highest level of fluorescence between 0h and 6h of the colonies, since bacteria are growing in ice bath and this growth may be unequal due to their position in ice. The solution in 0h will probably have a distinct fluorescence reading from the 6h solution if they were measured directly without ice bath."

We therefore assembled a plasmid with RBS and UnaG under the control of the specifically requested T7 promoter which was sent to the Stockholm team. We also supplied the Stockholm team with bilirubin as well as a guide on how to use it.

The Natural Host
Bordetella is the natural host of the BPP-1 bacteriophage. It expresses a protein on its surface, pertactin, that BPP-1 binds to in the first step of the infection process. However, Bordetella does not always express pertactin. It cycles between two phases: Bvg+ and Bvg-. Pertactin is only expressed in the Bvg+ phase, while in the Bvg- phase, pertactin expression is inhibited. Infection by BPP-1 during this phase is much less common, but it still occurs (Liu). This indicates that the BPP-1 virus has a mechanism for changing its host specificity, and thus, the binding properties of the proteins on its tail fibers.
Cryo-ET scan of the BPP-1 phage (Dai)
The Virus
The BPP-1 virus is a bacteriophage belonging to the Podoviridae family. It has an icosahedral head with T=7 symmetry, and a short, noncontractile tail with six tail “spikes” attached to tail fibers. At the end of these tail fibers are major tropism determinant (Mtd) proteins, which bind to the pertactin proteins expressed on the surface of Bordetella. The Mtd protein does not display high affinity for pertactin, but the multiple Mtd proteins possessed by each phage particle coupled with the flexibility of the tail fibers allow BPP-1 as a whole to have high avidity for its host (Liu). Following infection, the virus is lytic, and destroys the bacterial host to release more copies of itself (ViralZone).
Diversity Generation
The genomic DGR system in BPP-1 and other phages (Medhekar)
The BPP-1 phage contains a diversity generating retroelement (DGR) for diversifying its Mtd protein. DGRs generate variability in the viral receptor protein that specifies tropism for ligand molecules, and encode polypeptides that are designed to tolerate sequence variation."

Introduction
Science and technology have always been prompted by a desire of solving social issues. Thus, science would be nothing if it does not exist a relationship with people.
In this page we are going to show how we have faced integrated practices and we will give an answer these questions:
How your project affects the world and how the world affects it?
Is your work good enough for the world?
Integrated Human Practices
Feedback receiving: the key to the success
When creating a new scientific device, the existence of political, economic and social frameworks leads into the necessity of an in-depth analysis of how your creation would affect the world and how the world affects it.
As a result, our first step was to identify the real-life problems that could be solved with Printeria and so classify its application fields. To do so, we decided to employ a tip given by Israel (researcher at UPV)  the MIT market segmentation table . This table allows you to classify all users you think your product could be interesting to buy on the basis of several questions. Using it we analyzed Printeria potential users in accordance with our project values.
You can read the resulting market segmentation analysis and how it helped us to focus our initial approach by clicking here:
Market Segmentation analysis
As a result, Printeria main applications fields can be summarized as:
Education
With a friendly-user software, Printeria is designed to be an educational tool
Research groups
Printeria automatizes protocols, and enhances the experiments reproducibility.
Bioartists
Printeria offers a compact and friendly toolkit for the bioartist entire disposal
Thus, our main concern was how to fulfill the different stakeholder demands. Following our interdisciplinary spirit, we searched for continuos input from professionals with different backgrounds and"

In the second cavity, there is a lysine deficient E.coli which can hardly grow without the addition of lysine. Meanwhile, we transformed a plasmid with fluorescent gene into the E.coli ΔLysA. When the E.coli ΔLysA has received the lysine signal released from the complementary chain, it begins to grow with the expression of the fluorescent protein. In this way, we can transform the lysine signal to the fluorescence signal. Consider that the lysine concentration could be weak, we decided to use a strong promoter(BBa_J23100) and a cyclic amplifier system to enhance the signal, and a dual fluorescence system to improve the sensitivity.

Visiting Cambridge Consultants
All members were invited to Cambridge Consultants. We discussed about the project, visited their laboratory and had a delightful lunch in the cafe. They are really keen to give us advice! In the afternoon we have established some strategic roles - who will manage the team, work on graphical design, wiki programming, content, etc.
10th July
Scientific 'pool'
Still swimming in the scientific literature and trying to get as much help from our busy advisors as possible. Last week we aimed for sending all the sequences for synthesis today. And do everything at once. But over the time we realise that eating an elephant requires cutting it into smaller pieces. We need to test everything to know what went wrong, we plan controls for everything and design experiments which will teach us even if the result is negative.
But we are still thinking far ahead and considering actually introducing some gene of interest by our finished system, if it works. We spend a lot of time researching into edible vaccines and virus-like particles which could have an impact in the field and it's really exciting!
11th July - 13th July
Co-lab workshop
Lovely French students were were coming down to Cambridge to give us a workshop about connecting synthetic biology with design. An opportunity not to be missed! We joined some keen designers as well as people with other backgrounds and together we were working in the lab, had an etnographic workshop, had interesting lectures and were looking for a common language. We got a lot of interesting inputs for our human practices and got to design a few human practices projects happening later. For example we want to make discussion workshops in between students interested in synthetic biology, philosophy and journalism to bring them together to share thoughts. Hopefully we'll also go to schools to educate about synthetic biology.

Human Practices (Silver)
We contacted family members, friends, and representatives of the World Health Organization to discuss current issues with birth control. We sent out questionnaires to several grassroot organizations and advocacy groups around the world to gauge their interest in our product and learn about stigma, cost, and access issues. We also presented to local classes and partook in a TEDx talk to teach people about iGEM and discuss potential ethical issues with our project. For more information, check out our Human Practices page !
Integrated Human Practices

Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," difficult to see fluorescent proteins in K542008 samples, fluorescence observed in FRET experiments suggests that protein is expressed.
FRET
By using sample 7 (fluorescent protein control; BBa_K542006) as the baseline for expression of fluorescent proteins in the cleared cell lysates, we evaluated samples 1-5 for FRET by comparing fluorescence at 475nm (CFP) and 528nm (YFP).
Figure 2. Relative change in fluorescence at 475nm and 528nm, when excited by light at 439nm. ""LS then FP"" is Sample 5; ""FP Only"" is Sample 1; ""LS Only"" is Sample 2; ""FP then LS"" is Sample 3; ""LS then FP"" is Sample 4.
In each sample, we observed a decrease in fluorescence at 475nm and a simultaneous increase in fluorescence at 528nm. We believe that this decrease in CFP fluorescence (observed at 475nm) and concomitant increase in YFP fluorescence (observed at 528nm) is indicative of FRET interactions occurring between CFP and YFP. The presence of FRET interactions naturally leads us to the conclusion that the oligo-arginine-tagged CFP and YFP are being co-localized within the lumazine synthase microcompartment.
Within the FRET results, the condition where lumazine synthase was expressed before the fluorescent proteins were expressed shows lower levels of fluorescent change than the other conditions, suggesting that fluorescent proteins have difficulty entering the completely formed microcompartments.
Conclusion
Proteins that have an oligo-arginine tail fused to their C-termini are localized within the microcompartment formed by the oligomerization of lumazine synthase proteins
Proteins can localize within the compartment more easily when they are co-expressed with lumazine synthase
Proteins have a more difficult time entering the compartment when the compartment is fully formed
Discussion
While we hoped to be able to control the expression of the fluorescent proteins and lumazine synthase temporally, our SDS-PAGE gel indicates that even in the absence of IPTG, the lac-inducible lumazine synthase is being expressed. This means we are not able to achieve one of our conditions – fluorescent proteins expressed first, then lumazine synthase. The constant expression of lumazine synthase gave us several measurements with co-expression of lumazine synthase and fluorescent proteins. Furthermore, co-expression approximates the condition we were attempting for our first condition – namely, the formation of microcompartments around"

Mission Architecture
So how do we propose going about this entire endeavor?  When a finalized version of our GMO fungus has been produced, the idea for astronauts is to bring a container with our fungus spores and a container with cyanobacterium to Mars. On their way, the astronauts will cultivate cyanobacteria in a growing vessel that is shaped like a long triangle. As you can see on the cross-section drawing, the vessel is a lightweight, collapsible container that can be fitted with a gas pump (pump not included in Fig(5)). The sides are zippable and on the inside, they are sown in spacers that make the inside volume of the vessel carve out our brick. The cyanobacteria will fill out the volume of the growing vessel while being fed CO2 through a pump, into the vessel. When the growing vessel is filled with the bacterium, the astronauts will put the GMO fungal spores on top of the bacteria. After a short while, the fungi will have consumed the cyanobacteria and filled out the entire volume of the vessel. The astronauts can then open and start building their habitat from fully formed fungal bricks.
Fig 5: The figure illustrates the growth vessels that the astronauts could utilise to grow shaped building material from fungus. They start by cultivating Cyanobacteria,. Hereafter, they plant fungal spores into the bacterium, letting it grow into fully formed fungi bricks.

NCKU_Tainan,2018,Team:NCKU Tainan#Kinetic Law_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration of substrate at a fixed amount of enzyme.                                              That is the Michaelis-Menten kinetic law.
A. The Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetic law is expressed as follows:
$${E + S \underset{k_{-1}}{\stackrel{k_1}{\rightleftharpoons}} ES \xrightarrow{k_2} E + P}$$
The Enzyme (E) forms a Complex (ES) with the Substrate (S) and modifies it to the Product (P).                                              The Product is then released and the Enzyme is free to perform another modification.                                              This process is described by the ODE system.
The system cannot be solved analytically.                                              Michaelis and Menten considered a quasi equilibrium between E and the ES-Complex to simplify the system.
$${{d[S] \over dt} = -k_1[E] \cdot [S]+ k_{-1}[ES]}$$
$${{d[ES]\over dt} = k_1[E] \cdot [S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]}$$
$${{d[E] \over dt} = k_1[E] \cdot [S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES]}$$
$${{d[P] \over dt} = k_2[ES]}$$
After derivation $${v = {-ds \over dt} = {d[P] \over dt}}$$
where Vm represents the maximum rate achieved by the system,                                              and the Km is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vm.
The constants vmax and Km can be looked up at the public data base BRENDA.                                              The rate konstant k2 describes how many substrate molecules are transformed into product molecules per second and active site,                                              it is thus called turnover number.
$${Vmax = k_2 \cdot [E_{total}] = k_{cat} \cdot [E_{total}]}$$
B. A more realistic description of a enzymatic reactions than pure Michaelis Menten Kinetics                                              is given by considering the product forming reaction step as reversible.

Survey on Open Research and Synthetic Biology
The main goal of our human practice was to introduce synthetic biology to as many people as we could, regardless of their major. We introduced our program ""Gil"", along with its application in the scientific research. Prior to the seminar, we carried out a survey aiming to understand people's level of knowledge. In order to obtain a reliable data, our sample for the survey varied from people with no prior knowledge of synthetic biology to those majoring in it. The survey included some information regarding one's background knowledge on synthetic biology, the appliances of the program Gil, and especially ""open network"" and ""open data"". We focused on the topic of open research because we utilized a lot of various open source to develop the software, and we believe that open research is the core value of synthetic biology and computing.
Prior to the survey, our team wanted not only the data collected from the survey but an opportunity for people to know about Synthetic biology and our project. Therefore, the survey contained questions of background knowledge on Open data and synthetic biology while still using vocabulary and definitions easy enough for people with no prior knowledge on this field to understand.
We conducted the research for seven days and obtained 183 answers. Also, the survey was written in two languages: Korean and English.
From the survey targeted at the general public, we got some interesting results. The 60% of the people did not know what synthetic biology or open data was, but they did say that not only synthetic biology but science field would benefit from their connections with open data. Most people thought that it would widen the understanding and also bring about a more effective way of our data searching.
The response from the IGEM members, who already had plenty of knowledge of Synthetic biology and its connections with networking, was not so different. 58% of them responded that they have had research experience on redesigning cell metabolic pathways, and agreed to the term that our project will help to find efficient pathway regulations. Moreover, they responded that such projects like ""Gil"" will reinforce collaboration among scientists dedicated to the field by allowing by the ubiquitous sharing of information.
With the survey results underlying, we started to introduce synthetic biology, the competition IGEM and our project 'Gil' to the people. As texts could limit the transfer of knowledge aimed at the general public, we tried to involve interactive activities in order to efficiently pass on the knowledge about synthetic"

SECTION I: Provenance and Release
1. The data was taken by member of Sumbawagen team as follow. Cindy Suci Ananda, Muhammad Al Azhar, Adelia Elviantari, and Yulianti. Other person who should be credited is Arief Budi Witarto, Ph.D. (instructor) who supervised the experiments.
2. Date of experiments: September 22nd – 24th, 2014.
3. All persons consented to the condition.
SECTION II: Protocol
Introduction: There are no spectrophotometers – neither UV nor fluorescent – in Sumbawa island. Thus our project uses mobile phone camera to obtain data and quantify using customized software. Among fluorescent proteins, mRFP showed strong color visible to naked eye, thus we chose it as the report of measurement in our project. However, this report was made in the request of iGEM 2014 Committee using GFP to show the possibility on using our system for the Measurement Interlab Study. In this study we used different device/part although it has the same GFP gene, aside from which was already been designated by the Committee. We did it because the objective was to show whether GFP is measurable or not in our system.
Through this activity, people's understanding of Sumbawa honey is also increasing. We introduce to the public some information about Sumbawa honey such as how to distinguish between genuine and fake honey, a tool used to measure the levels of glucose in honey, until any product that can be produced made from honey.

UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB,2017,Team:UChile OpenBio-CeBiB#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," not well known and which most of the time is not included in studies, statistics and others. The villagers mentioned their problems due to the abandon of the municipality and the thermoelectric facilities, highlighting:
Declination of flora and fauna in their lands, also animals are having serious health problems due to the gases.
Emissions without filters during the night.
Poorly paved roads, no luminary in them.
Serious health problems, for example:” People here die from cancer, from 10 people that pass away, 9 are related to cancer, and I’m not talking of people in their 50’s, they are in their 30’s, it’s young people” (Focus Group, Neighbor’s Board Los Maitenes, 2017).
After identifying the problems that they suffer they are told about iGEM Competition and what we, as Team UChile OpenBio-CeBiB are doing. Immediately they were interested on a possibility to improve air quality and fight climate change. Also, they mention they would love to recover they missed agrarian land. They described Los Maitenes as “a rich community in peas, beans and corn plantations, animals roamed freely in our lands and we had what to eat, because nowadays we do not even have that, neither animals” (Focus Group, Neighbor’s Board Los Maitenes, 2017).
Collecting the ideas and stories of the villagers, we proposed them the design and implementation of a biorreactor shaped as an iconic symbol of the town. So, following their memories we decided to design a wheat spike-like biorreactor that will clean the air from the town square and will be continuously producing molecules that will work as bio-fertilizer. Also, we invited the members of the Board and their families to visit our University and our labs.
Design of a wheat spike-like reactor.
Project metamorphosis
The first idea for the team was to build a catalytic bioconverter for vehicles, that could absorb their emissions with an optimized-carbon capture microalga.
After consulting with teachers and public in general, we opted to intervene a metabolic route for synthetizing a determined biomaterial with all this new carbon captured.
Along the expositions we’ve done, we got the suggestion to do a bioreactor capable to absorb industrial emissions.
Finally, our visit to Los Maitenes village induced us to focus in a bioreactor familiar for the community and produce biomaterials that the community will appreciate (in this case it could be fertilizer, or other molecule to help the plants to grow).

The Leica SP5 should be set to acquire both a fluorescence image (with the HyD detector) and a regular bright field image (it is important to set both channels to ‘Visible’). The settings for the bright field channel were Smart Gain 305 V, Smart Offset -2.5 %. The setting for the fluorescence channel was Smart Gain 10.0 % (the HyD detector sets the offset by itself).
Each captured image (containing TIFF files of both bright field and fluorescence images) should be saved automatically under the same experiment (LIF file). This enables the microscopist to export the LIF file, which is then ready for the subsequent analysis.
NOTE: A bit-depth of 12 was chosen in this Interlab study to ensure that the range would accommodate both the samples with strong fluorescence and weak fluorescence. A lower bit-depth like 8 bit would cause the images with strong fluorescence to be oversaturated because the range would simply not be wide enough (data lost before analysis).
Quantitative image analysis
The data set was provided by the microscope software in LIF format. This file has about 1GB size. While ImageJ can read LIF format, it does not manage the memory very well, and cannot load the images simultaneously. The method used to circumvent this issue is to convert the LIF file into many TIFF files. Each TIFF file contained one fluorescence image and one bright field image. bfconvert utility was downloaded to convert the Leica LIF files into a set of TIFF files. The utility was downloaded from http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.1.3/ .
The images were converted with the command line:
$ ./bfconvert 150818\ Interlab\ Hyd2.lif %n.tiff
The resulting files have spaces in their name. This created problems for ImageJ. The spaces were converted into underscores with the following command:
$ for file in *.tiff; do mv ""$file"" `echo $file | tr ' ' '_'` ; done
The ImageJ analysis was scripted into a macro file. The commands of the macro file are as described in the following instructions.
The TIFF image was opened with ImageJ.
The two stacks of the images were converted into two images for easy reference in the macro.
The bright field image was selected and viewed with a Grays LUT.
The background was subtracted using Process > Subtract background..."". In the new window, the rolling ball radius"

Within all these different methods, they have one thing in common—various stress are induced during the dehydration process, examples like shear stress [4,8] , oxidative stress [5,8] , heat stress [6,8] , chemical stress and osmotic stress [7,8] . Cell membrane in particular, appears to be damaged and significantly affect cells viability. Its fluid bilayer structure was originally stabilised via Van der Waals forces and hydration repulsion, which is severely weakened by lose of water [7] .Package default will occur during rehydration process because the regular arrangement of phospholipids is disrupted during dehydration, and this cause leakage of cellular components [9] . Dehydration brought severe decrease in viability of the cells after rehydration and cells’ resilience seems to be a major concern.
Protection by adding protective agent
Three main protective strategies can be envisaged to maintain their Viability after dehydration:
Change the process parameters, like lowering the temperature, or pressure within certain range [10]
Pre-stressing the cell prior to drying, which induces their own protective stress responses [11]
Add protective agents.
Saccharides(e.g. Sucrose, lactose, trehalose) [12,13] is one of the most commonly used protectant and was proved to be efficient in improving resilience of cells, several correlated mechanisms have been proposed. Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide of glucose, have been widely accepted as a long-time protectant. However, cost of production is significantly increased by artificially adding trehalose, and we are hoping to find a suitable substituent for it.

Because of their peculiar resilience, their traces could be found almost everywhere, across the seven continent including Antarctica, a wide range of biomes, the dessert, ice field, deep sea or maybe in your garden.

Introduction
The natural ligand of the Tar receptor is aspartate. While this molecule is useful for bacteria, localizing aspartate sources is less interesting from a human perspective. For this reason, it is necessary to generate libraries of Tar receptor       mutants from which to select the ones showing selectivity for new, noteworthy compounds. To this end, it is equally important to create libraries with sufficient diversity and establish a fast and effective assay to screen them. We thus aimed       at developing robust protocols to obtain mutation libraries and a simple and fast experimental set up for the selection process.       The Tar receptor structure is well characterized [1], and the sensory domain is defined at the N terminus, between M1 and F189. This modularity allows to restrict the target area of diversity generation to this region, consequently requiring       fewer mutants and resulting in a higher library quality, as the"

Initial Results
Induction occurring at around 22 hours showing a doubling in current. The background control strains are shown here which display how little current is produced when mtrB is not present.
Same strain of Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1, but induction at point shown displaying the actuality of IPTG causing current increase. This shows the difference between background expression and actual current induction very distinctly.
Control (M5 Media only) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate.
Induction of mtrB gene (no GFP, no mtrB insert) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate. - Acts as a second control
Induction of mtrB_GFP strain (GFP, no mtrB insert) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate. - Highest b/c resources not being directed toward mtrB pathway, which is still removed
Induction of mtrB_GFP_mtrB strain (GFP, mtrB insert) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate.  - Resources being directed toward mtrB pathway, which reduces GFP expression
Success!
Sequencing confirmed that the T7A1 promoter was removed and the other seven promoters were inserted in its place thus creating seven new strains of S. oneidensis MR-1. The original IPTG inducible strain was used in the engineering protocol to test current and GFP induction. After initial troubleshooting in the bioelectrochemical system design that caused inconsistent current production (Figure 8), current induction by IPTG showed promising results. Inconsistent current developed from hydrogen gas build-up in the counter electrode leading to an extra 18 gauge being added to the counter electrode housing. Similar results would be obtained if KCl is not removed from the glass reference housing or if bubbles form by the Magnesis stick inside the housing. ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB was induced with IPTG and showed nearly two-fold increase in current while ΔmtrB prL814 and ΔmtrB produced only .03 mA of current (Figure 1). The knock"

Close the sequencing results.
The idea of placing sacB under the control of the lac promoter is to create kanamycin-independent control. Moreover, by changing the IPTG levels, the level of selection can be controlled.
One of the weaknesses of sacB selection often mentioned in the literature is that sacB loss-of-function mutants also survive, and this may occur at higher frequency than loss of the cassette. RFP is added to ensure that cells which have lost the cassette (should be white because of loss of RFP) can be distinguished from cells which have lost SacB function (should be red as RFP is still present). This would allow us to assess the counter-selection efficiency of SacB.
We also prepared a Kan-plac-RFP-sacB selection-counterselection cassette.
Characterisation
The growth of SacB (bottom) and a control (top) were tested by adding 1.3 g solid sucrose plus 0.5 ml sterile water into a well in the middle of the plate, as shown in Figure 4 below..

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the versatility of the prescreening, multiple variants of the ssDNAp were designed to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 2 targets the EPO coding sequence. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp 2 was used in this experiment to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 2, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 µM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 2 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
We kill bacterial waste using 10% bleach solution before it is disposed of.  We are also using nonpathogenic baterial strains: E. coli DH10B, P. putida KT2440, and P. fluorescens B2.  These strains cannot grow outside the laboratory environment and are non-infectious BSL 1 agents. Our iGEM projects are designed to use only small scale techniques, reducing the amount of materials used and bacteria grown.
The Risks of Our Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
CODON OPTIMIZATION PROJECT:
A great success in the field of codon optimization would allow for the optimization of genes at the codon level that were previously considered difficult to repress, tune, or even express at all. The ability to break these barriers would allow researchers, industry specialists, and possibly unauthorized individuals the ability to tune the expression of genes expressed by altering them at the codon level. It is foreseeable that companies generating biological products such as medicines that are coded by weakly expressed genes could find a way to generate stronger genes that code for the exact same products. Because any gene could be optimized in this manner, it is also theoretically possible that the production of toxins or other dangerous biologically produced molecules could be increased - as with any synthetic biology technique. This scenario is not likely, and does not carry significant risk for several reasons. FIrst, alternative methods of increasing output of metabolic pathways are already extant, and the use of codon optimization as a tool for doing so would not be the easiest, quickest, or most cost effective method. Second, to codon optimize a gene, large scale DNA synthesis equipment and know how is required, and any group sending a dangerous genetic element for codon optimization would have to go through the additional layer of security of a commercial entity, and would thus be even less likely to use our method.
An interesting application of our project, if it were to truly allow for much more efficient optimization of existing genetic systems, is that scale up of biomolecule production could be done much more quickly than is now possible. This is"

Future Experiments
In the future we are going to do additional testing to see the full amount of time it takes for a clot to fully form as well as running multiple runs of these experiments to better our results that we have so far. We also want to run an osmotic shock periplasm test to see what is stored in the periplasm and hopefully there will be our viper protein and the Thiol isomerase."

The common bands at 2097bp are the plasmid backbone of pSB1A2. Other than that, each lane (except DNA ladder and negative control) shows at least 2 more bands: the gene insert, and the singly-cut / uncut plasmid. More importantly, the amount of singly-cut/uncut plasmid is significant, indicating that 5 minutes are probably insufficient for FastDigest. We then run restriction digest experiments at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 15 minutes, each with either equal amounts of XbaI and PstI, or 2:1 ratio of PstI to XbaI (this ratio is recommended on website of Fermentas for double digestion using PstI and XbaI). Restriction products will be run on agarose gel for analysis tomorrow.
To make sure that transformation colonies growing on Week 1 plates (Amp) are still viable and contain our plasmid insert, 8 colonies were picked from each Week 1 plate and transfered to freshly made Amp plates. They will be ready for mini-prep on Thursday.

We reviewed the GMO safety and application regulations in 6 countries: Spain, France, Mexico, Brazil, China, and USA. We didn’t analyse the surveys for China, USA, and Spain because there were not enough answers. We also reviewed the current state of GMO deployment in these countries.
How was the interactive map coded?
A few words from our computer engineer
The online interactive map collects and displays the results of our international GMO survey about. The website was made with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, while the map itself is displayed using D3.js.
The smooth slide scrolling effects were achieved using the One Page Scroll library, and all animations are pure CSS.

Working on these countries allowed us to be in a direct contact with their iGEM teams. Some of these countries also encountered problems from climate change that affects vineyards in Mexico, Spain and Greece (which is not yet represented on the map).
They spoke with us by Skype and distributed our survey among the winemakers in order to understand how they deal with climate change and introduce Softer Shock as a potential solution. Most of them gave advice for French vineyards on which techniques should be used. To find out more go to “Dialogue with Experts”.
Dialogue with experts
Integration of Softer Shock in the world of industry
Our team needed a deeper understanding of how our project can be developed industrially. We interviewed experts in plant protection, law, and economics to understand the effect that softer shock would have in the business world. For each meeting we add the link of the full transcript which you can read below each paragraph.
1- Discussion about the interactive map with Mr Tarnowski - Swiper CEO - 07/26/2017
We met Mr Tarnovsky, CEO of Swiper. As he has valuable knowledge about websites and data, we organized a meeting during the summer.
The idea of the interactive map was discussed and what we needed to do so it becomes a valuable tool that can help a lot of people. The aspects highlighted were the importance and the ways to get data. It was advised to build a prototype of the map so we could assess the behaviour of the user. it was suggested that the prototype must contain a limited amount of countries such as the one belonging to the G20 group.Datas must be collected from the prototype so that the project can answer to the visitor’s need. In order to get those datas, the prototype would display a restricted amount of information and the website would be fully accessible only when the survey is filled. This ensure the degree of data filling. Other ways include"
