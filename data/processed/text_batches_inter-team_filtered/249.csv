Olivia Cheng | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics (MIMG)
[Why iGEM?] iGEM allows me to explore possibilities and potentials in science while gaining experience in research.
[Favorite Coffee?] Cafe Latte - Not too strong, yet nothing fancy
Fasih Ahsan | Junior | MIMG & Bioinformatics
[Why iGEM?] I am truly fascinated by our ever-growing ability to harness the power of biology and shape it for our own uses and designs.  Being a part of iGEM opens the door to independently exploring and discovering new paradigms of synthetic biology.  I am thrilled to begin unearthing these hidden secrets with UCLA iGEM!
[Favorite Hot Sauce?] Sriracha mixed with Cholula and a couple drops of Tapatio!
Phillip Nguyen | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity,diversity, and autonomy. Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones. Being that it is primarily undergraduate, I have the impression that everyone has a bigger voice in project directions compared to a conventional university lab.
[Favorite Molecule?] Phosphatidyl Choline
Kane Nania | Junior | Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
[Why iGEM?] The idea that we can engineer life to do practically anything, the idea that that we can abstract this engineering through iGEM and the standardization of genetic parts, is pretty awesome. The potential of synthetic biology is massive and I want to be a part of that.
[Favorite Hairstyle?] Bald with a mullet. Preferably if they have a beard which connects with the mullet. Preferably yet if the beard is of the chinstrap flavour.
Andy Wang | Junior | Biology
[Why iGEM?] What I most enjoy about iGEM is the process of conceptualization and creation—specifically, extracting scientific knowledge and applying it to innovate a potentially useful product. I would like to explore how to functionalize silk as a potential drug delivery system, and learn more about the techniques that can be developed to study this subject.
[Favorite Sport?] My favorite sport is cycling because I find it soothing yet exhilarating to ride along the coastline on weekends, enjoying California’s beautiful weather and scenery.

Yeast A that ferments xylose
After introducing the plasmid we constructed that contains gene XYL1,XYL2 into S.cerevisiae EBY100. We creat a xylose-utilize strain. We measured the growth rate of both our recombinant strain and negative control to prove the superiority of our new strain in xylose utilization.
We cultivate the EBY100(XDH-XR) and the EBY100(control) in SC adding 2% xylose as the sole carbon source, adjusting initial OD600 about 1.2,and placing in the shaking incubator of 30℃,180rpm to ferment.
The following result can well demonstrate that the strain that carries our plasmid grows much better than the strain that not (the stationary phase OD of EBY100(XDH-XR)is nearly 2 times that of WT EBY100)and reach the stationary phases after 40 hours’cultivation.
Figure 1.8 Growth curve of strains of our recombinant strain and negative control. Error bars represent standard deviation of four biological replicates, so do the other charts in this section.
For an immediate evidence, we need to know exactly how xylose content change in the medium. We use HPLC to detect the changing concentration of xylose, getting more data to support our idea that our cells can utilize the carbon sources as long as the concentration of xylose decrease with time.
The following chart shows the xylose content of both our recombinant strain and negative control. It is obvious that in our xylose-utilize strain, xylose content decrease (especially rapid in the first 40h) as time goes by while for the negative strain the xylose content stays steady, indicating the disability of using xylose.
Figure 1.9 Xylose content of both our recombinant strain and negative control.
In addition, to finally realize our design, the yeast need to ferment on xylose only. Therefore, we use the SBA-Biosensor to detect the ethanol content in the medium, which can convert the reaction of immobilized enzyme to electrochemical signal and help make a curve reflecting the ethanol change in the culture condition.
The following chart shows the ethanol content of both our recombinant strain and negative control.
Gladly, the curve of xylose-consuming strain goes gradually up along with cultivating"

The Temperature-Based System for E. coli: SafetE.coli
Overview
To protect the environment from a possible Genetically Engineered Bacteria (GEB) contamination, we created a two-level protection system. First a biological containment was built, which could be improved with the addition of a </html> physical containment system level  depending applications. We choose to build a system which the E. coli viability was restricted to a narrow range of temperatures. Such system should then be combined with the physical containment system.
Problematic
Nowadays, a large number of thermosensitive systems are commonly used in the biology field. Two points appeared to be important when we started to design our device: first, it must be durably functional in time to avoid the spread of GEB. Secondly, the system must be flexible and adaptable to the users’ needs.
Details
Why our device is safe and stable in time
In order to create a safe system, we choose to control the survival of bacteria by modulating the expression of several essential genes.
The targeted essential genes were chosen in accordance with the literature on the subject. They have to control a vital function in the cell, be well-characterized, have a constitutive expression, and not be redundant in the bacterial chromosome. Taking into account these various parameters, adenylate kinase (adk), alanyl-tRNA synthetase (alaS), DNA polymerase III subunit delta (holB), methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG), phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (tyrS) should for instance be good candidates. The more of these target genes are controlled by our system, the less likely is the bacterium to live outside the lab.
The aim of our system is to control the expression of these chosen essential genes.
To do this, a replacement of their natural promoter by homologous recombination  has to be made. The repressible Tet Promoter, which is controlled by the Tet Repressor, will replace the native gene promoter. The repressor gene with a specifically engineered promoter will also be inserted on the chromosome. For this project, the classical Tet system will be modified by placing theTet Repressor gene under the control of a thermosensible repressor, this repressor being downstream a thermoinducible promoter. Thereby the expression of the essential gene is indirectly determined by the outside temperature.
The thermal control part of the system (described below) could be implemented on a plasmid or onto"
Caltech,2008,Team:Caltech#Project#Phage Pathogen Defense_-_-_TEXT.html," model system. A significant extension of the results presented here would be the incorporation and production of a non-E. coli bacteriophage by E. coli. A promising candidate for this is the Salmonella phage P22; P22 has been shown to be viably produced in E. coli when the prophage is expressed [14]. Incorporation of the P22 prophage should be feasible following the framework of the current model. Furthermore, co-culture experiments with the current constructs and wild-type E. coli can be used to validate the current system's effectiveness at eliminating pathogens.

As the preeminent pioneer of bioremediation, his 300+ papers have been cited nearly 20,000 times, but his work giving lectures and seminars for the next generation of scientists allowed us to contact him and ask him to review our project, which he was keenly intrigued by. His insight into the mechanics of our degradation pathway and the bacteria we sourced the pathways from allowed us to mold our experiments into an effective and innovative tool for the field that he created.

iGEM Goes Green
We have participated in iGEM GOES GREEN to consider a more eco-friendly way to work in our lab in the environment, which centers around the idea of raising awareness around the environmental impacts we, especially as members of iGEM, have on the world around us and how we can lessen the negative side effects of those impacts. Namely, iGEM Goes Green is focused on spreading awareness on what our carbon footprint is. Our project is supposed to help clean the environment and we want to be effective in our lab methods to make sure that we keep the environment clean, while researching a way to save it! In one of our many contact points with them, we - along with our school’s Ecology Club - sent suggestions for their Go Green Guide, a document that outlines exactly how one can conduct a more eco-friendly lifestyle in and out of the laboratory. We detailed the impact of several other processes (that did not deal with the conventional tips) concerning greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Eco Club helped by planting a tree on our campus for the purpose of slightly compensating for our carbon footprint created by our flights to Boston, as well as to establish our collaboration with TU Dresden. For more information on this particular collaboration, click here.
Bioethics Seminar
The discussion led at the seminar provided insight for us towards improving the involvement behind the ethical implication of our project and the research it entailed. The topics discussed, along with the input from professors from UCSD, improved the understanding of the project in that we could now confidently expatiate upon what were not only the scientific implications, but also the ethical implications of our project. While discussing gene therapy and consequently, GMOs, we emphasized how GMOs weren’t necessarily harmful and how they could be of great benefit to the"

Within scientific disciplines, open science communicates “data...and everything else...as it happens,” making the entirety of a scientific investigation available (Grand, Wilkinson, Bultitude, Winfield 2012). The aspiration of open science is to “...improve the flow of information, minimize restrictions on the use of intellectual resources, and increase transparency of research practice (Borgman, 2015).” While this concept is aspirational, there are several challenges that arise from this desire to make data and all the surrounding aspects of research open and accessible. Borgman suggests that these challenges and obstacles include, but are not limited to: motivations to create and store data; the usability of stored data for others; the length of time for which these data are stored; funding and research grants; and interdisciplinarity (Borgman, 2015"

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates_-_-_TEXT.html," technical viability and high potential for commercialization. Our team did extensive educational outreach in addition to educating ourselves on public perception of our work. We used this input to inform our device design such that it could be implemented in a way that addresses the major concerns of both scientists and consumers. We also took steps to protect our intellectual property and explore the patenting and commercialization process of our product. Finally, our team sought to investigate ethical issues brought up by our discourse with the public by discussing both our work and ethics related to the project with a variety of experts and ethicists.
Educational Outreach
Building on past successes, our team has been devoted to volunteering our services to the community in a number of educational venues. The team took our curriculum, first developed in 2013, and improved the structure and delivery of our lesson plans in the hopes of encouraging awareness and education on topics in synthetic biology. Since 2013 our educational outreach group ECORI (Educating Communities On Research Innovation) has taught our original, interactive curriculum to over 200 students (K-12) and their teachers. This year we also created a mobile exhibit form of our curriculum along with a layman’s introduction to our project that we displayed on over half a dozen weekends to visitors of all ages at the Science Museum of Minnesota. Our curriculum has also been brought to several other STEM fairs and family fun events in the Twin Cities area including the 3M Science Day Fair for 3M employees and their families, UMN Biodiversity Fair, CSE Family Fun Fair, and the Middle School STEM Fair hosted by the Association of Multicultural Students at UMN. Finally, the team designed a Synthetic Biology Game Show that was presented on stage with 30 participants at the Minnesota State Fair to assess the general public’s knowledge of the subject and teach hundreds of passers-by in a way that was both engaging and interactive. Winners were rewarded with reusable bags, magnets, and gift cards donated by our sponsors. In the spirit of science, our curriculum has been ever evolving to constantly address salient topics and educational materials. The variable versions of our curriculum allow it to be flexible and practical in various settings.
Public Perception
Our team sought to inform the majority stakeholders in our community concerning the scope of our project. This year our team chose to have an exhibit catered towards adult residents at the Minnesota State Fair (the largest statewide annual gathering with over 1.8 million visitors each year) to learn how we can best design our technology to meet the needs and concerns of the people whose waters we hope to bioremediate. We delivered a short synopsis of our"

Since robustness was one of the criteria for choosing a sufficient ribosome binding protein (RBP) to control alternative splicing, we wanted to see how our Ms2 would fair in a cell-free system, and held up to our expectations.
We also scraped data from past iGEM websites and saved into a csv file.
The file is initially used by the team to search for similar projects on CRISPR and RNA-targeting. It gathers various information, including title, abstract and content from project pages. The csv file was announced through the iGEM collaboration page, and we shared the file with multiple teams. We are glad that the file is used by Team Groningen for data visualization and analysis.

Another scale-up of the fermentation of E. coli Rosetta-Gami 2 with <partinfo>BBa_K863012</partinfo> was made up to a final working volume of 12 L in a Bioengineering NFL 22 fermenter. Agitation speed, pO2 and OD600 were determined as well as the glycerin concentration. The data are illustrated in Figure 3. This time HSG autodinduction medium was used to produce more biomass. Due to the change of media and to a low amount of cells for inocculation, there was a long lag phase of about 6 hours. During this phase the glycerin concentration is nearly constant. The cells were in an exponential phase between 8 and 18 hours of cultivation, which results in a decrease of gylcerin, of pO2 value"

Results for Ranaspumin
Back to Results
We were successful in cloning our Ranaspumin BioBrick into the pET23 vector, yet our attempts to ligate it into the submission vector yielded negative results. Submitting it as a theoretical BioBrick became a top priority.
Results for Latherin
E. coli expressing latherin under the control of a pBAD promoter. The presence of a significant level of foam compared to the negative controls clearly demonstrates its surfactant properties.
Figure 1: Expression of latherin or PDE under a pBAD promoter either un-induced or induced with arabinose. Cells were lysed by sonication prior to being shaken. As PDE is not a surfactant you would not expect an increase in the amount of foam even in the PDE+ sample.
Results for the light responsive constructs
We aimed to build a series of constructs of OmpC, OmpF and Bluf promoters, connected to eYFP ( BBa_I13001 ) and a constructed RFP reporter, to determine whether the light responsive promoters work at all, and eventually characterise them.
This work would serve as a proof of concept that expression of our novel biobricks via light is feasible.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to use gene doping because the phenomenon will sound new and thereby dangerous to many people at this point. Based on a paper by Connor et al. (2009) that did research on the tendency towards doping use in athletes, one would expect that less than 12 per cent of the respondents from the general public would take gene doping for performance enhancement.
For the Dutch population this prediction is still relatively close to the 16% that actually wants to use gene doping for purposes other than just medical. For the Chinese population this prediction is clearly wrong as there 55% is open to using gene doping for performance enhancement. Together, given the extra pressure that is generally put on athletes, these figures provide us with an alarming estimation for possible gene doping use among the athlete population.  In China we asked an additional question though that shows 10% of the general public would even like to take gene doping for performance enhancement if this would shorten their life to only five more years. Compared to Goldman’s dilemma that was developed in the 1990’s and found that more than half of the athletes questioned would take a performance enhancing drug that would kill them in 5 years ( Goldman et al., 1992 ), this figure is relatively low. Keeping in mind however that we are polling the general population, this might be a figure consistent with Goldman’s research at the time. Later research from 2009 by Connor et al. indicated approximately 6% of the athletes at a track in the USA would take a similar drug ( Connor et al., 2009 ), which is in turn lower than we found among this general population.
We expected that people would generally not see gene doping as a problem, because they have most likely never heard of it before. Because gene doping is relatively unknown by the general public, we also expected people would think it will only become a problem in the future.
Both in China as well as in the Netherlands people think gene doping is not a real problem yet, although the percentages people estimate tend to result in relatively high numbers when applied to the athlete population. In the Rio Olympics of 2016 11544 athletes competed. If we apply the responses of the Dutch respondents to the Rio Olympics an absolute minimum of 760 athletes would have used gene doping on the 2016 Rio Olympics, compared to a minimum of 1075 athletes according to the Chinese respondents. On top of this, most respondents think gene doping will an even bigger problem in the (near) future. This might be a good indicator for the confidence athletes would put into these therapies.
We believed people are generally in favor of very strict doping control, since"

Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering                     involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year,                     Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils,                     high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who                     may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors                     a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some                     basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and                     principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. What’s more, the                     game Foldit is used to give children a vivid model of protein. In addition, we distributed questionnaires                     to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.

Science and Technology Exhibition
We held a Synthetic Biology exhibition in Hefei science museum, which is the largest off-campus science class.                     This exhibition attracts thousands of citizens including innocent pupils, high school students and their                     parents. And our team coordinated with team USTC and provide a flood of synthetic knowledge to the visitors.
We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic                     Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein                     folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could                     learn knowledge while having fun.

Contact person: Prof. Samir K. Brahmachari, former director of India's main research body - The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR); Chief mentor, Open Source Drug Discovery center.
Advice: Regarding the law, there is no GM microorganisms that are allowed because of the use of antibiotic markers that makes them unsafe to eat. But for him if we can add a safe vitamin pathway to a bacterium currently present in food (lactic acid bacteria for example) that will be sterilized but producing enough vitamin to fortify the food, it should be possible. It is not impossible that regulatory issues can undergo changes. Concerning the GMO debate in Europe and India, the main points are different: in India, people don't want GMO to be associated with farmers, they don't want them to be dependent and no one want a monopoly of a particular plant. These issues don't apply to our project for Samir Brahmachari, but labeling would be an problem: the use of our product only depends on people's wish. If people find it beneficial and safe, they would take it. To continue, an accelerated evolution can be more acceptable for a project like ours for the GMO regulation. Also, since our project doesn't imply a big company producing and giving a product, it is more likely to work and be more accepted, as well as the way we want to implement it (give power to people, let them have their own ""mini-lab"" and produce their bacteria and yeast for their consumption) according to him.  Prof. Brahmachari visited us this summer and participated to our first workshop. We went to meet him again at the 2nd Annual Open Source Pharma Conference in Frankfurt, Germany at the end of the summer.
Indian Citizens - field study & Acceptance :
Because the law is not the only element we needed to consider for our project, we decided to build a survey on the food habits of Indian citizens, to understand what they eat the most and when, how they cook, how often the food varies, how they see our idea, would they try it, etc.
This survey take an important place in the Human practices, because collecting information on the field is essential, to understand people’s acceptance toward our project, and to find ways of introducing this project into their daily life without disrupting their tradition and culture.
Alice's trip to India :
In order to get in touch with the Indian population, we shared our survey with an ex- iGEMer (Alice LEBOEDEC  from the 2014 INSA­"

Alessandro PCR purified the previous succesfully amplified T7-RFP products but for T7-lac-RFP he had a very low yeld so the next day the PCR and purification has to be repeated.
Vincent got the sequences for the Y42F, V36F mutants back. With the help of the BLAST alignment tool, it became clear that the V36F mutant was as expected, while the Y42F was in fact the P39Q-Y42M mutant. It may be that the primers got mixed up or that the labelling of plates was incorrect. Either way, we have two mutants.
Wednesday, 17 August 2011
Alessandro proceeded with the day 3 of competent cells making protocol. Alessandro ran the PCR to amplify T7lac2-RFP again and it' ok (the following day he will do the PCR purification) and PCR purified the pSB3K1 backbone (succesfully amplified the day before) as well as the T7-lysis again but this time the yeld was higher. Alessandro has made the Gibson assembly for pSB3C5 and pSB3K1 with T7-RFP and with T7-Lysis (the Gibosn for the T7lac2 hasn't been done because we ran out of Gibson master mix). Alessandro miniprepped pSB3K1.

Team Activity Tests:
We like our new cooperation with Team Immobilization. The thing is, that they don´t like our buffer. Sodium acetate (pH 5) seems perfect for activity tests but apparently not for immobilization. What they prefer is a Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5). To find out whether there is a difference between the two buffers that causes different activity habits of our laccase TVEL0, we setup comparable measurements with the two buffers and TVEL0. We concluded that the laccase in sodium acetate buffer shows a slower saturation but all in all both laccase samples reach the same maximum so that it is ok for us to use both buffer systems.

Team Wiki:
Today we browsed our wiki and were not very impressed: it's a lonesome place. So we started to think of how we could blow a little more life into it. For this, texts should appear soon on our wiki. To manage this bunch of work, we divided the subtopics of our wiki and appointed them to group members. Now everyone has a topic which he is responsible for. And that includes writing the texts, uploading pictures and keeping the represented information updated. Before anybody had the chance to disappear behind his/her notebook being busy editing his own page, we had to establish our wiki rules:
Use the standardized formatting as presented in our example page .
Try to edit your text without using HTML code as far as possible and use wiki code instead. Useful advices when using wiki code are represented on our example page , too.
If you want to change anything that does not belong to your scope of duties, ask kindly the person of charge and make sure he/she is fine with it.
Make your text more understandable by using images and charts. But remember: you are only allowed to upload pictures if you own them or if they are published without licenses.

Shanghaitech,2017,Team:Shanghaitech#PublicEducation_-_-_TEXT.html," school students aged from 13 to 14.
To get better understanding of teenagers’ views of biology and to promote the concept of modern biology, we held a seminar class named ‘Bio+?’ for students from the Experimental Middle School Attached to Xuhui Institute of Education Shanghai (XJYFZ). The 9 participants were from junior high school students aged from 13 to 14.
After the class, students participated in a brainstorm of ‘Bio + ?’. They showed great creativity, like ‘Bio + Computer’, ‘Bio + artificial rainfall’, ‘Bio + Bluetooth’, ‘Bio + Sound’. Everyone drew their designs. The great passion of students in scientific innovation indeed is infectious to us. We also interviewed their instructors Zhe Jin to discuss about her ideas in instructing students to technological events. We hope that our Magic-Block platform would help tp realize their dreams with modern biology.
Social Media

Fig 3. WeChat platform
In order to spread synthetic biology and our project to the public, we also created a WeChat account. Every month, we posted several articles on the account. The topics include popular scientific articles in synthetic biology, brief introduction of MagicBlock, introducing our workshops. We have received many comments saying that they are excited to find a new area about design and creation. Also, a number of suggestions from the readers really inspired us to improve our project.
In summary, through the public education, we realized our aim of building a platform for public to learn synthetic biology and realize their wonderful ideas is fun and urgent. We also receives valuable feedbacks to improve our project."

Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the changed sequence with the original one and count the Hamming distance between them. When a restriction enzyme site sequence occurs on the mutated TALE sequence, there will be a penalty.
2.Codon Usage
When the sequence contains too many rare codons, which means the number of the homologous tRNA is extremely low in E.coli, the whole sequence can hardly express. In order to avoid the appearance of rare codons, each occurrence of rare codons will lead to penalty.
Selection
In each generation we sort the 200 sequences according to the scores of each single sequence. And we terminate the half of lower scores, the rest of them will have better fitness. Repeat the process of mutation and crossover, the average score of each generation will increase. (See Results.)
We repeat the process for 600 generations.
Simulated Annealing(SA)
-Introduction of Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing is a simple and general algorithm for finding global minima. It operates by simulating the cooling of a (usually fictitious) physical system whose possible energies correspond to the values of the objective function being minimized. The analogy works because physical systems occupy only the states with lowest energy as the temperature is lowered to absolute zero.
-Our Strategy
Mutation
We randomly choose 5 points on the sequence to mutate. To each single point, the process is the same with our computational mutation in genetic algorithm.
Scoring
The same as fitness scoring in genetic algorithm.
Parameters
The initial temperature T is 10000.0, after each generation, the temperature reduces to 99% of the former temperature. If the new generation has higher score, it will be accepted. Otherwise it will be accepted at a probability P(A)

We output the average scores of each generation. And we can see that the scores range from -4500 to 350, and after about 100 generations, the average score becomes stable.(See Figure.3)

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

During the 2014 Giant Jamboree it came to our attention that iGEM Team Sumbawagen was in need of a fluorescence detector to finalize their project.  Part of our project in 2014 was the development of a low budget Do-It-Yourself device for measurement of optical density (OD) as well as fluorescence, the OD/F device , which would have perfectly matched their needs.

Thus a collaboration was established between both teams to ship one of the OD/F devices to team Sumbawagen´s University in Indonesia.  This year's iGEM Team Aachen 2015 continued this collaboration by assembling an OD/F device , calibrating it and finally shipping the device to team Sumbawagen.
Some cuvettes and a USB power supply were included in the bundle
Further packaging of the OD/F device was necessary to guarantee safe transport
Packaging resulted in a large box compared to the size of the device

Overview
Team UAlberta’s Beelab focused on performing in vivo experimentation on the efficacy of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) at inactivating Nosema ceranae spores and the function of our Antifungal Porphyrin-based Intervention System (APIS) prototypes. Our work for our Beelab included collecting and housing honeybees for experimentation under various treatment conditions.
The main motivation behind using live honeybees rather than other animal models, or cell lines, is that N. ceranae is an obligate parasite of honeybees. N. ceranae infections have only been found to infect the Asian honeybee, Apis ceranae, and only recently has it been documented in the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera [1]. Use of cell line studies were also considered but honeybee cell lines are notoriously difficult to acquire and maintain. Published alternatives, such as Lepidoptera-based cell lines have been infected by N. ceranae, but are cited as not suitable for propagating spores [2].
As propagating spores was necessary for our experiments and due to the of the physiology of N. ceranae and limitations in vitro testing, Team UAlberta opted to use live honeybees for our experiments as it would provide the best route for evaluating our designs. Find the full justification for live honeybee experimentation here.
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our APIS design, we identified four critical outcomes that our technology must achieve:
Excess intracellular PPIX must not have any toxic effects on our E. coli chassis as the function of the APIS construct hinges on producing PPIX above natural concentrations. This aspect was focussed on in our Wetlab section.
Our E.coli chassis itself must not be harmful to the health of both Nosema-infected or uninfected honeybees treated with it.
The PPIX therapy must function as intended so that ingestion of PPIX must decrease Nosema spore loads in vivo or prevent the spread of infection.
PPIX must not have a negative effect on the health of both Nosema-infected and healthy honeybees health. We must ensure that bees, both health and unhealthy, do not experience negative health consequences by consuming PPIX.
Achieving these four outcomes individually"

Who’s your PABA: intelligent sun protection
E.colipse is an intelligent and adaptive sun radiation protection system which responds to UV exposure with the production of a protective agent. We implemented two different approaches to detect hazardous levels of sun radiation.
The first approach focuses on sensing UV-radiation directly. This system is based on UVR8, a UV sensing protein from plants. In its dark state, this protein forms a homodimer that dissociates upon UV radiation. We fused UVR8 with the DNA binding domain from TetR, which is unable to dimerize and to bind DNA in monomeric form. UV-exposure forces the UVR8-TetR fusion dimer to split, release the DNA and enable transcription. Thus, UVR8-TetR acts as a light-activated on-switch in bacteria.
In the second approach we sense sunlight, and thus indirectly the dangerous UV-radiation, via characteristic wavelengths in the suns emission spectrum. The system then computes its transcriptional output using a hybrid-promoter based biological 2-to-4 decoder.
Finally both approaches trigger the production of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, and various colored pigments as visible warning signals.
Our lab efforts were supported by models in both the direct and the indirect sun light detection strategy as well as in the PABA production.

Northwestern,2010,Team:Northwestern#Protocol#3A Assembly_-_-_TEXT.html," try commercial competent cells. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Do not add more ligation product than specified and be careful when resuspending the competent cells.
The second most common problems are caused by defects in the DNA entering the ligation. We find ligation to be a very reliable process. However, the sticky ends of the cut parts can be destroyed by enzymes. Also, the original DNA may be incorrect or defective.
Another common mechanism for failure involves a piece of genomic DNA being cloned into the construction plasmid.  This result typically occurs when the assembly is somehow unfavorable to the cell.  This issue can be partially checked via the colony PCR step in the protocol though if the genomic DNA is of the same size as your assembly, then the single colony PCR screen is ineffective.  A careful purification of the construction plasmid can help to avoid this result as can phosphatase treatment of the linear construction plasmid .
Analysis
Schematic of linear DNA fragments present in ligation reaction
Since the transformed cells are plated on plates supplemented with the antibiotic corresponding to the construction plasmid, only cells containing the construction plasmid backbone should survive.
Since the construction plasmid itself has been reduced in quantity by PCR and digestion by DpnI, few colonies will contain the original construction plasmid.

red light receptor
In August we decided to drop the red light receptor system.
The main reason beeing Jakob having to leave the team to start studying in Strasbourg.
So the FreiGEM team shrunk to five people.
Still we did submit one part for this system which is BBa_K608151 the translational unit of pcyA
We talked to some of the iGEM teams like TU Munich also working with this system
and we are sure that the red light receptor is not lost.
blue light receptor
The handling with the LOV domain and TrpR domain was very difficult.
On the one hand it was difficlut to digest the parts, because there was a SpeI restriction site in the tryptophan repressible promoter region. So we first had to mutate SpeI into NehI restriction site to digest our parts without digesting the promotor. In the beginning we also tried the Gibson assembly. Primer design was quite difficult because of the lenght, the usually very high annealing temperature and unspecifity of the primer sequences, combined to the mutations we had to include.  These hassel leaded to trouble to amplify the Lov domain.The 3A-assembly with the mutated parts wasn´t successful either. We only cloned the Not-Gate in the pSB1C3 vector. We tried this experiment with different parameters but we weren´t successful.
Lysis cassette
After a lot of mishappenings concerning the 2 parts making up the temperature sensitive lysis cassette, we made a last attempt to ligate them (link to workbook) and transform the novel composite over the last weekend before the Wiki-freeze. After putative positive colonies were picked, we managed to perform a last-minute, ""blind"" -ie not knowing if the sequence of the insert was correct-, and preliminary OD-measurement testing.
We later verified the part sequence. Since we cannot upload .ab1 files, we made 2 base-call files from them without changing absolutely anything (that means that there are some false bases at the beginning and end of every file).

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#dataAnalysis_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial infections are still grave problems which troubled both patients and doctors. There are always new types of drugs appears. Meanwhile, the delivery of a new drug is challenged. To keep drug activity in the transfer process, reduce drug side effects and improvement of the target. Since European medical treatments developed more, the carrier of the drug is intended to explore more, to go to a higher level of progress.
D. Cancer
Cancer is likewise a heated topic in the Health and Medicine track. In this field, Asia leads the most entries overall, a total of 8.In other regions of the world, North America has 7 entries followed by Europe and South America each with 4 entries, while Africa has only 1 entry. The total number of projects is increasing every year. At the same time, we have conducted research on cancer. According to the corresponding estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) ,the total cancer deaths in 2012 were 8.2 million (about 22,000 cancer deaths a day) – 2.9 million in economically developed countries, and 5.3 million in economically developing countries. And there were 14.1 million new cancer cases in 2012 worldwide, including 8 million occurred in economically developing countries. However, the place with more new cases does not always have higher mortality. In our opinion, the difference can be attributed to several factors. Different population densities in different regions creating the great difference of new cases. Moreover, the different levels of development between the various regions of the world which lead to non-uniform medical standards result in difference detection and treatment of cancer. What’s more, the risk of being diagnosed with cancer increases substantially with age, so there will be more newly diagnosed cancer cases in developed countries than in developing countries. According to IARC, the top3 regions have the highest incidence of cancer is Asia, Europe and North America, which fit the regional distribution of the projects.
As a matter of fact, a considerable amount of cancer can be prevented and cured. Through investigation, we found that some cancers are caused by the following factors: tobacco use and heavy alcohol consumption, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, and/or poor nutrition. So people can change their habits to keep them. In addition, many of the cancers related to infectious agents, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), could be prevented through behavioral changes and infection controlling.

Automatic Unit Test & CI
Our project is deposited on github to support work division and efficient cooperation. During the development of the project, we use travis-CI for continuous integration and use coverall for coverage test. Thus our software is most likely to operate well as long as the unit test is good. With this method, we can ensure the quality of software and prevent programming bugs.
Algorithms
Biocircuit (Transformation from a truth table to logic circuits)
The Quine-McCluskey algorithm is a method used for minimizing of boolean functions that was developed by W.V.Quine and extended by Edward J.McCluskey.
Espresso heuristic logic minimizer is a computer program using heuristic and specific algorithms for efficiently reducing the complexity of digital electronic gate circuits.
Because Espresso is more efficient than Q-M algorithm, especially when inputs are more than 6, we choose Espresso for our software.
NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation and study of the structure, dynamics and functions of complex networks.
We use directed graph to characterize biocircuit, and NetworkX has make it more convenient to operate with graphs.
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Pyeda is a Python library for electronic design automation. We once used pyeda to simplify Boolean formulas. However, we found bugs in the process, so we got in touch with its author Chris Drake and submitted the issue. Therefore, we didn't use pyeda directly but make some changes to his espresso model. We are very grateful to his excellent work.
Score Calculation for Logic Circuits:
The complexity of electronic circuits essentially depends only on the number of gates, and it can be minimized by the Espresso algorithm. Synthetic biology, however, is distinct from electronics and a gene circuit is much more complex than a logic circuit. We first simplify the truth table input by users to obtain several simplified logic circuits, and then correspond them to a gene circuit. We estimate the complexity of a circuit solution as a function of the number of the regulatory factors involved in the network. Considering the complexity involved in the promoters and RBS, we give a score function.

Since our team decided that pursuing the avenue of wastewater treatment was no longer the best possible direction for our project to take, we decided that our microbead research, while valuable, would be too far outside the scope of our space travel application to have a meaningful connection to our project. Our human practices efforts were thus rerouted to ensuring the health of the astronauts who would be using our system on long-term space missions; however, we have summarized our preliminary research on microbeads below:

The co-culture - device and design
Introduction
A co-culture refers to a consortium of two or multiple species of microorganisms living together, interacting in a “social-network” sometimes helping, at other times inhibiting, each other. They act a lot like roommates actually. When living together, you communicate, you interact, and you regularly affect the mood of your mate, for better and for worse.
 
You cooperate with your roommate too, which is also the goal of our co-culture system; to make Synechococcus elongatus (henceforth “synechococcus”) produce the needed carbon source for a culture of Bacillus subtilis (henceforth “bacillus”) to grow, facilitating the production of a target compound by bacillus through cooperation.
 
The target compound could potentially be anything in the biobrick registry, however, we have chosen to focus on usable compounds for space exploration and settlement. For this project specifically, we sought to facilitate the production of the bioplastic, poly-lactic-co-3-hydroxybutyrate acid (PLA), using novel biobricks within bacillus.

Screening
To test activity of protease: construct of ?(I didn't really get what kind of protein that was) with linker to ß-Lactamase. If there is no protease activity, the construct stays complete and ß-Lactamase gets to the periplasm. Otherwise, the linker is cleaved and the ß-Lactamase remains in the cytoplasm. Testing for resistance against Amp or other ß-Lactamase-sensitive antibiotics.
Construct on same plasmid as protease
Question: Microviridin in cytoplasm fully folded?
2 other selection marker for microviridin (KanR on phagemid) and protease necessary.
Also compatible ori needed
Search for protease: Groups working with proteases need to be contacted to get the genes (also considering those that may be difficult to express in E.coli as activity may be high enough to detect it)

Phage display
approach 1:
Cloning mdnA (out of pARW089) into pak100 (containing gene3)
PCR with overlapping primers for iGEM restriction sites
pelB (signal peptide) as BioBrick?
approach 2:
Cloning gene3 into pARW089
Why can pARW089 be used for phage display? Has f1 ori that enables single stranded replication and packaging into phage particles Won't there be problems with the cleavage of the leader peptide? Fusion protein would have microviridin at the N-terminus and gene3 at the C-terminus. So the leader peptide can be cleaved. remark: maybe a linker between microviridin"

The institution
Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
Not exactly. There is currently no iGEM or synthetic biology course as such, but some modules do mention iGEM (though not as core material). The closest module we have is part of the biochemical/genetics degree scheme and is Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. However, a new syllabus has recently been deployed, which does have more focus on synthetic biology with a more devoted module, but there is yet to be a whole course for synthetic biology.
When did you start this course?
Of the team members, the only person who took the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology module is Ryan Coates. This is a third year module, and the course started in September 2017, ending in December 2017.
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
The course materials are not freely available online, though students who attend the module can access them freely, whenever they desire (including at least 2 years after the module has ended).
When did you start your brainstorming?
The team started brainstorming sometime in February 2018, when the initial members were accepted onto the team. This is when a basic idea was developed, which was literally as simple as ""target the aphid symbiont"" but with no more detail than that. Further developments came around June time after exams.

Project Overview
Introduction
Cyanobacteria contain signal transduction systems, thereby making them capable of sensing and responding to light Bussell AN, Kehoe DM. Control of a four-color sensing photoreceptor by a two-color sensing photoreceptor reveals complex light regulation in cyanobacteria. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 2013;110(31):12834-9. . This ability gives the organisms the opportunity to adapt and optimize their metabolism to a circadian rhythm. Photoreceptors in the plasma membrane, of which phytochromes are especially abundant and well described, are responsible for this property Vierstra RD, Davis SJ. Bacteriophytochromes: new tools for understanding phytochrome signal transduction. Seminars in cell & developmental biology. 2000;11(6):511-21. . In 2004, the UT Austin iGEM team made a light response system consisting of a photoreceptor combined with an intracellular indigenous regulator system Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. . EnvZ and OmpR make up the two-component system naturally found in E. coli. The photoreceptor known as Cph1 was isolated from the cyanobacteria Synechocytis PCC6803. Cph1 has functional combination sites, which combined with the kinase EnvZ form a two-domain receptor, known as Cph8. Activation of Cph8 is mediated by the chromophore phycocyanobilin, PCB, that is sensitive to red light with maximal absorbance at 662 nm Lamparter T, Esteban B, Hughes J. Phytochrome Cph1 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803. Purification, assembly, and quaternary structure. European journal of biochemistry. 2001;268(17):4720-30. .
When not exposed to light, PCB activates the phytochrome Cph1, thus promoting kinase activity through the EnvZ kinase. When the transcription factor OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, expression of genes regulated by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of PCB by red light results in a situation where the transcription factor"

RNA Scaffold Overview
In order to provide a direct application for the RNA binding abilities of PUF, an RNA scaffold was designed with the idea of serving as a platform for an enzyme conveyor belt. The array of enzymatic pathways which could be enhanced by a scaffold are numerous, though, we projected to increase efficiency and production of a resveratrol derivative called piceatannol.
The project consists of a couple parts, each a proof of concept and build-up of previous ones. The start of the project consisted of designing an RNA scaffold which is best tailored to PUF binding in a spatially specific manner. Once the scaffold was designed, synthesized, and purified it was important to show not only that PUF can bind specifically to its designated sites, but that the scaffold can support a concept such as a biological conveyor belt.
One assay which was designed to prove this was incubation of the RNA scaffold with non-specific endonucleases bound to PUF. The length of digested RNA parts would prove that PUF was binding specifically and appropriately to the designated sequences. Another assay would include tethering a split-fluorescent protein to wild-type and mutant PUF. An in-vitro gel-shift assay, or EMSA, would once again prove that PUF is binding the the appropriate sites. More importantly, an in-vivo experiment which shows fluorescence with presence of the scaffold and darkness without the scaffold would prove efficient enzymatic pathways could be achieved.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," each residue can be taken by 20 different amino acids.  For the assay we therefore need a high throughput method.
We adapted work of DeLoache, Russ and Dueber using the violacein pathway to measure the import effectiveness of tripeptides. The pathway consists of Violacein A (VioA), Violacein B (VioB) and Violacein E (VioE). It converts tryptophan into the green product prodeoxyviolacein (PDV). The first two enzymes, VioA and VioB, are expressed in the cytosol, and the third one, VioE, is targeted to the peroxisome with a PTS1 sequence. The degree of import can be measured by the intensity of green colour of the colonies. An efficient import signal leads to a strong import of the VioE into the peroxisome and subsequently to white colonies, because the intermediates cannot diffuse into the peroxisome to its respective enzyme. DeLoache et al. showed that there is a proportional correlation between the concentration of the green product PDV and a red fluorescent substance. The concentration of this product displays the import efficiency of the respective sequence.
This assay has been used for the evaluation of the generated PTS2 sequences. The VioE-PTS2 plasmids are harvested and cotransformed with a VioA-VioB plasmid. Each plasmid contains a specific auxotrophy marker. Consequently every growing colony contains both plasmids. To evaluate the respective sequence the concentration of the red fluorescence is measured. The more fluorescence is detected the more VioE is in the cytosol. Therefore the respective PTS2 is not that efficient. The other way around a low concentration of the fluorescent substance correlates with an efficient import via the respective PTS2.
Membrane Integration
In our design we worked with both,  the cytosolic import way and the the ER-dependant one. We first tested our hypothesis and then created membrane anchors that can be fused to you protein of interest C-terminally as well as N-terminal. This allows you to add proteins to the compartment that never been introduced to the peroxisomal membrane before.
Scientific background
Peroxisomal membrane proteins are synthesized on free polysomes in the cytosol and afterwards integrated into the membrane via two major pathways: one dependent on the endoplasmatic reticulum and one dependent on PEX19 and PEX3.

Leicester,2012,Team:Leicester#July2012_-_-_TEXT.html," process is very slow. The pestle and mortar was producing minimal results so the team switched to the grinder machine mixing our 'sugar' with glass beads to, by sheer force, crush the polystyrene down to an even finer grain.
(4:45) The grinding machine couldn't grind the polystyrene 'sugar' down, so the group has been seeing whether just adding the 'sugar' into agar may work on its own. Through experimenting with varying amounts of 'sugar' to agar (2.5% and 5% polystyrene), and varying the amount of agar used, the amount decided on is between 10 and 15 grams of agar/'sugar' mix at 5% 'sugar'. 20g of agar/'sugar' mix was just too deep as the 'sugar' just settled at the bottom or sides. At 10g agar/'sugar' mix, the 'sugar' is just below the agar's surface making it easier for bacterial colonies to access the polystyrene as a carbon source.

(10:30 am) The team that was here in the early morning had a quick briefing, and decided to get the minimal media ready. The ingredients used was exactly the same as used in the reference paper. This gave Chris some trouble trying to measure out the the salts, with some of them being only 0.001 grams per litre of water. This equates to 1 grain of salt in the container.
(12:00 pm) The agar has been autoclaved, and is now sat in the hybridizer waiting for our polystyrene to get crushed to be stirred into it. The polystyrene is proving to be very resilient and is resolving our focus to help degrade it.
(14:00 pm) The polystyrene has been frozen at -80oC for almost 2 hours in an attempt to freeze then smash it into a powder. It didn't work, but several references were found that temperatures of -130-150oC will then freeze it to a more brittle form that will then easily be smashed and can be used as a powder dissolved into the agar.
(16:15 pm) One of the other supervisors took pity on the team at this point so helped us out with a case of liquid nitrogen. However even flash freezing some"

mRFP under Arsenite Inducible Promoter ( Bba_K1106003 ) characterization
Objective
Asess mRFP production, stability and naked eye discernibility range under inducible conditions.
General procedure
Different assays were performed using E. coli (DH5α strain) harbouring a plasmid that encodes mRFP under arsenite inducible promoter (ArsRFP culture).
mRFP production at different arsenite concentrations
Method
ArsRFP cultures were grown with different arsenite concentrations ( 0, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000ppb). 1ml aliquots were taken after 24 hours and fluorescence was measured.
Results
mRFP fluorescence increases with higher arsenite concentrations, in a sigmoidal way.
Measurement of groundwater samples with pars_mRFP
Using the experiment above as a calibration curve, we calculated the concentration of arsenite in groundwater samples. To achieve that, we first had to linearize the curve. As the curve seems to fit a logarithmic function, we aplied a logarithmic transformation to the original data, setting 1,6 as the base and the value of fluorescence at 608 nm/OD as the exponent. This way, we got a good linear fit, and used the function obtained to estimate arsenite concentration from values of fluorescence at 608 nm/OD.
We then compared our method to an commonly used method for arsenic detection (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, AAS). the results show that, despite pArs_mRFP construct is not as precise as AAS, it can be used as a method to indicate the arsenic concentration at different ranges (and that is what we actually need!).

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#rMFC#ElectronTransfer_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria, yeast and fungi species. It is based on respiration in the presence of different metabolic relevant substances for example carbon sources, nitrogen sources or toxines. The system uses redox chemistry wherein a tetrazolium dye is reduced when significant respiration occurs. Tetrazolium dye change its colour, because the cells generate reductive conditions in the course of the electron transport chain. A tetrazolium cation is reduced to formazan by dehydrogenase from the respiratory complex I. This allow a statement if respiration occurs in the presence of different substances.
The E. coli KRX wildtype and E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF were incubated in the Biolog® system to test respiration in the presence of fumarate. It was expected that the E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF shows no activity in the presence of fumarate because  of the knockout of the C4 carboxylate transporter dcuB, which makes fumarate uptake impossible for E. coli cells.
The results of the Biolog® analysis are shown in figure 3.
Figure 3: Results of the Biolog® analysis of E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF in comparison to Escherichia coli KRX wildtype. Respiratory activity is shown under influence of fumarate.
Biolog® analysis showed that there is no significant respiratory activity of E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF in the presence of fumarate during the first 35 hours of incubation. Later on respiration occurs up to 50% of maximal respiratory activity of the E. coli KRX wildtype after 48 hours of incubation at 37°C.
The results in figure 3 demonstrate that the knockout of C4 carboxylate antiporter dcuB was successful. Respiration activity after 35 hours could be explained by a change in metabolism of E. coli cells. Based on cell stress in minimal medium bacteria use other ways for uptake of fumarate. It is possible that another transporter compensates the activity of the DcuB transporter, but activation and expression of alternative pathways require a space of time, espacially under limited conditions in minimal medium. This could explain the delayed respiration of E.coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF .
Anaerobic cultivation
We cultivated E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF under anaerobic conditions . We used M9 minimal medium with 50 mM glucose. Among growth characteristic we focused on metabolite analysis."

After the competition, the pipettes and coloured water were left out so the kids could continue to play.  This activity was very well received as the kids loved “dressing up like mad scientists!”
-------Lastly, we prepared a bag full of tube caps and asked kids to guess how many they thought there were in the bag. It seemed that the prize “Totally Wacky Scientist” captivated many kids because by the end of the day we had more than 100 kids attempt at guessing. This was simply one more initiative in order to promote iGEM and to generate interest in science for young kids.
-------While the kids were occupying themselves with our activities, the parents had a chance to take pictures and inquire about our project.  Many parents had questions about iGEM and specifically our project. We were able to explain the connection between the “arts and crafts” bacteria and our project, as well as the objectives of our overall project along with any applications. Jen Hill, a representative from Alberta Ingenuity, dropped by our booth for a visit and was surprised to see how well we tailored our project to our audience.
-------Campus Fair was an opportunity to see how few people understood the concept of synthetic biology. We learned how much work is needed to accomplish our goal of establishing a strong synthetic biology community in Alberta. The kids seemed to have a lot of fun and were very excited to take the gloves, tubes and pipettes home with them. Through Campus Fair, it is our hope that the adults, parents and children were able to not only gain an appreciation of iGEM and synthetic biology, but also to enjoy themselves at our exhibit. More importantly, the team had tons of fun and we were able to interact and express our excitement about our project with others.

Human Practice
Biology is an all-encompassing domain of science that enormously influences human life. Therefore, there is a high necessity of giving young people an insight into its consequences. Thus,  together with the team from Marburg, our team decided to create a boardgame explaining the basic principles of biology and evolution. Fortunately, our competent colleague from iGEM team Marburg (Tresor) came up with the idea of designing a board game called ""Game of Cells"" for our human practice collaboration.
The expressive name Game of Cells suggest the exploring and investigation of evolutionary processes and the construction of a cell. For this purpose the cell and its components are compared to a medieval castle to make it easier for young players to understand.
The principle item - the nucleus - is the king living in his castle (endoplasmic reticulum) and governing his kingdom. Vesicles illustrate carriages, which are needed for the transport of nutritions and proteins. A protecting, solid and reliable plasma membrane compartimentalizes the kingdom from the extracellular section. At the beginning of the game the players' cells only have the plasma membrane on hand, but as the game progresses, further cell components can be gained. Additionally, the players can acquire mutations that could lead either to positive or to negative effects for the cell. The first player that manages to gain all cell organelles and reach the finish wins and the game is over.
Here are the different game parts for free download. Now you only have to do some handicrafts and you're set to start the game!

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the prefix and suffix (about 15 bp) would be enough to attach our construct to the BioBrick backbone pSB1C3 . See figure 7 for gBlock assembly.
Figure 8. Adding homologous regions between
the insert and backbone
The situation became a bit more complicated when it came to attaching the Propane Plasmid 2 and the Cellulose Plasmid into the commercial pACYCDuet-1 and pCDFDuet-1 vectors. As these were cloning vectors, they already contained the T7 promoter, RBS and terminator. Better yet, since they are Duet plasmids, they contain all of these for two different genes. To avoid the risk of our plasmid producing an unwanted product from another vector promoter, we restricted the second expression system out completely. As our Propane Plasmid 2 construct was based on Kallio’s plasmid maps, which were also built into Novagen’s vectors, our T7 and the first RBS were the same as in the vectors. Thus, after our construct is in the biobrick backbone , we will use new primers which will remove the prefix of our constructs 5’ end and add a homologous region to the vector in the 3’ end (31 bp). With the Cellulose Plasmid, the T7 and RBS sequences differed from Novagen’s vectors, so we needed to design a forward primer as well which created a homologous region for the vector in our constructs 5’ end. Figure 8 on top left describes the primer design to transfer the Cellulose Brick into a commercial backbone and figure 9 below the transfer of a propane plasmid to a commercial backbone.
Figure 9. Removing the second expression system from
Duet plasmids. (The pink areas represent homology)
Amphiphilic constructs
To add the amphiphilic proteins, we used PCR to remove the terminator and the suffix from the end of our Propane Plasmid 1 and Propane Plasmid 2 Bricks. Our primers added a region to the 3’ end of our Propane bricks to create homology with the amphiphilic protein and its linker. The amphiphilic protein was synthesized including one linker, and for CAR we added a second one with a primer. A suffix had been added to the 3’ end of the synthesized amphiphilic protein with PCR primers.
These same methods were supposed to be used to create the Violacein construct with and without amph"

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," year, I had not tried doing a research, and was entirely confused with the sophisticated equipments in our lab at first. It is really fascinating to take a comparison between the past me and the person I am now. Though still frustrated with not-so-ideal results, I am skilled with the operation in our lab and surrounded by the passion about the competition and biochemistry much stronger when I decided to join the team.
Hi, I’m Yifan WEI and I am going to be a 3rd year student majored in Biology next semester. To fight in our team is a great glory to me. Maybe I can be called “Main Tank” in our lab work. I am the one who has been working in the lab for the longest time in our team and the one who obtained the most techniques in our team to aid the process of the experiment. I made my progress and was able to control the experiment independently. In the later period, I was even in charge of the characterization of the part “Bitter Pressure” without other teammates’ help.
Hi, here is Zhenlin ZHAO, I am primarily in charge of human practice. Games and Biochemistry are two of my favorite things in, probably, my whole life. In the middle of a discussion with the team, an idea struck me that computer game themed synthesis biology might be a perfect marriage between them and an efficient way to publicize the idea of iGEM. And then there born our iGEM game for human practice. Along the process of making this game, I have found not only so many interesting ideas and astonishing achievements of the iGEM precursors but also my passion in biochemistry.
Hi, I’m Pengji ZHOU and I am in my 3rd year of studying chemical engineering. What fascinate me most is the boundless possibilities existing in genetic engineering and how iGEM make it possible to gather numerous brilliant ideas all over the world. That is the main reason for my initially applying the team. But soon, I have found that our team is much more than that: the cooperation and encouragement is what keeps me and us holding on to our ultimate goal.
Hi, I am Wenming ZHU majored in chemical engineering. I am going to enjoy my 3rd year in Tshinghua University and how lucky I am to get the chance of being a team member in iGEM! Just like how I devote my passion into sports, I love the feel of challenge and achievement along the process of preparing for the final competition. No matter the experiments, the designing of our loge and T"

After acquiring the sequenced data meant to be analyzed, sequ-into handles each                                     uploaded file/folder as a                                     separated call. In the case of a folder, sequ-into searches for each file in that                                     directory down to the                                     deepest level of the directory tree.

var stats = fs.lstatSync(element.path)
if (stats.isDirectory()){
var allFilesInDir = fs.readdirSync(element.path);
processFilesForElement[element.path] = [];
allFilesInDir.forEach((myFile:any) => {
if(myFile.toUpperCase().endsWith(""FASTQ"") || myFile.toUpperCase().endsWith(""FQ""))
{
var pathToFile = self.normalizePath(path.join(element.path, myFile));

}
});

self.extractReadsForFolder(element.path);
}
}else{
processFilesForElement[element.path] = [self.normalizePath(element.path)];
}
});
All files that are pooled in a folder are handled as one file in the further steps                                     (ContamTool.py),                                     resulting in a combined analysis of all the files in that folder.
Reference Files
The next step is to acquire the FastA files that are used as a reference for the                                     alignment. As the user                                     might have similar requests repeatedly, it is possible to save reference files in                                     the app itself. To make                                     these files available even after the app is closed, we use a JSON file                                     to store their paths internally together with our default genome of Escherichia                                         coli K-12 MG1655.
Cross Plattform Compatibility
Now that the required data is accessible, the python script ( ContamTool.py )                                     handling the alignment, calculation and plotting can be called.
As the alignment-tool we employed in our python script runs asynchron but since we have to make several                                     calls for the                                     functionality of sequ-into, one for each file per reference, we call the python                                     script sequential.

The interesting thing is that after several questions which content we will analyze later, our last question was: “What is your opinion on GMOs (or Genetically Modified Organisms)?”, to which we mostly got “Rather negative” as an answer.
We found it interesting to compare the results of these two diagrams, as they perfectly reflect the misconception people have of the word GMO. We discussed these results with the experts we interviewed, you can read about it in our main article.
The next thing we wanted to know was whether the subject felt a good enough interaction with the scientific world. The answers we got show pretty clearly that it is not the case.
We also wanted to know who, according to the general public, is really responsible for the outcomes of scientific research, and how the subsequent technologies are used. The subject could choose several answers.
We were quite surprised by these results, as in Switzerland, direct democracy and referendums allow the whole population to vote on very specific questions, scientific topics included. And research in synthetic biology could have come to an end if in 1998, the federal popular initiative “for the protection of life and the environment against gene manipulations (initiative for genetic protection)” had been accepted, indeed: production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited. To us, seeing the people delegate the responsibility to researchers is the consequence of a lack of interaction. The subject of interaction is further explored in our main article.
Next, we quickly described the purpose of the iGEM competition, and we exposed the main idea behind our project (building independent transistors in cells). We then introduced some examples of organisms that could be designed using our project, or synthetic biology in general. Some were past iGEM projects, some we imagined ourselves, and they covered a lot of different domains such as energy, agriculture, medicine and information processing.
Algae that produce biofuel
Bacteria producing electricity
Wheat strain able to easily adapt to climatic conditions
Bacterium able to detect and degrade pollutants in a lake
Modified human cell able to detect and terminate a cancerous cell
Bacterium able to diagnose (in general)
Modified embryonic cell in order to cure a genetic disease
Bacterium that produces plastic
A minesweeper game made with bacteria
Piece of art made with multicolored bacteria
The only organism that gathered a vast majority of negative answers was the “Wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions”. To us this is also linked to the associations between GMOs and agriculture.

SIGNAL
Overview
Bacteria expressing genes that code for color will form interesting patterns when spotted onto agar plates in appropriate locations and allowed to spread out and intermingle. But what if we could increase the complexity of the patterns formed by implementing intercellular signaling between different groups of bacteria?
We decided to use parts from the natural quorum-sensing mechanisms of various bacteria to implement our intracellular communication system. If it works, we can for example cause two colonies of bacteria to change color or stop moving as they approach each other, hopefully resulting in interesting patterns.
A brief overview of quorum-sensing: Bacteria, such as V. fisheri, coordinate their gene expression through a system in which each bacterial cell produces a limited amount of signaling molecules, called AHL, which diffuse through the medium and reach other bacteria in its vicinity. AHL molecules bind to receptor proteins which in turn bind to specific promoters that then up-regulate downstream transcription activity. When the bacteria reach a certain density, the amount of AHL in the environment (and thus in the cells) will be sufficient to trigger this increase in promoter activity, and the genes downstream of the promoter will be ‘switched’ on. Below is a schematic diagram depicting quorum-sensing. (Taken from Utsunomiya University).
Currently we are working on 2 distinct groups of parts: 'Senders' and 'Receivers'. 'Senders' code for enzymes that produce AHL signal molecules, which diffuse out of the cell, through the culture medium and into the receiving cell, where a receptor proteins encoded by the 'Receivers' bind the signals, forming a complex which in turn can bind to and up-regulate transcription from their specific promoter.
Parts & Devices
We assembled the following devices using parts from the iGEM 2009 Spring Distribution:
Senders:
Lux Sender - produces 3OC6HSL, includes a double terminator for easy insertion in front of or behind any other device/part
Las Sender - same as above, but produces 3O-C12-HSL
Rhl Sender - produces C4-HSL
Cin Sender - produces 3OH-C14:1-HSL
Receivers:
Lux Receiver - receives signal from Lux Sender transmitted in the form of (Lux-signaling system AHL), which then activates/upregulates transcription downstream of this device
Las Receiver - receives signal from Las Sender

TJU_China,2018,Team:TJU China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," teams are in the same university. So, how can we miss the opportunity of collaborating with each other?!
There are too many biobricks this year, and the plasmid pSB1C3 used as vector always run out since only one man in         our group is in charge of this. It was very kind of Members from Tianjin that they helped us provide the backbone,         which ensured that we can complete so many biobricks we have.
Also, for response, we helped them compare the degradation of the origin with improved NanoLuc in 3 hours, and prove         the newly constructed NanoLucPEST could work effectively in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeBY4741.
Secondly, though not in the same university, the IGEM team of Nankai’s school of life science is the closest team         with us, only around 20 minutes’ walk. Therefore, there is no reason we don’t show up in the collaboration hosted         by them. There are nine teams together who communicated with each other on projects and individual advices or suggestions.

“Follow me to IGEM”
To tell the truth, we are a little surprised that the number of girls are about two times than that of boys in our University where the population of boys are three times than that of girls. We know that girls like beautiful pictures, and that is why we took part in this collaboration. The Bulgaria team has a tradition to take photos of every place they visit—together or part of them. That’s why they spread their idea for this collaboration. We took photos at some special places in our school and describe of the places.
Figure 5.Our school is the first college in China, which was established in 1895. Every year the school of life science takes part in the IGEM competition, and this year, we decided to do the “magic scissors”(the CRISPR-Cas system). This is a photo of the team members and our school’s monument, which is memorable to all of us.
Figure 6.After more than half year’s hard work, we picked an afternoon to take beautiful pictures around our university and this is one of the creation of us. We not only relaxed but also enjoy the work we have done. Though the idea was thought by the girls(they always like beautiful things), we are still glad to make it interesting.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and/or meet address some learning goals from an Advanced Placement topic in STEM. This was a necessary requirement to convince teachers to allow the activity into an already crowded class schedule.
The lesson plan should shift student appreciation and perception of: the interaction between science, technology and the use of technologies.
The experience should show some influence on “long term” behavior or attitude towards the responsible use of chemicals.
Assessments are Critical
Dr. Pagliarulo also made it clear that we absolutely needed to find assessments for evaluating the success of our lesson objectives.  He gave us some insight:
crafting “layered” questions that assess different levels on Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive understanding can be useful for probing what students understand and where they are struggling: for example low Bloom’s level questions might test memorization and vocabulary while some higher level Bloom’s questions might test a student’s ability to apply the core lessons to new situations
different objectives might require different types of assessments: in our case assessing whether students have different two different types of objectives.  (1) we are assessing the ability to teach certain concepts associated with science standards and (2) we are assessing student attitudes.  These require different assessment instruments.
assessment instruments themselves need to be assessed [REF #.1 page 191]: for instance, if a question is confusing to many students it may not be testing the knowledge or skill that we’re interested in assessing but rather the student’s ability to decipher the questions.  A good educational plan has a plan for assessing the quality of the assessments too.
Dr. Pagliarulo mentioned that one way to measure the outcomes of a lesson plan is to develop what is called a “pre post test”.  These are sets of questions that are given to students before (pre) and after (post) and activity to assess any learning gains.
We decided to create two sets of assessment instruments:
(1) Standard multiple choice questions that an instructor could use to assess state standards
(2) A survey for assessing student attitudes towards responsible chemical use and their role in this process. The survey we developed was based on pre-existing and validated assessment instruments on student attitudes towards science [REF #.2]
Note: Validating the assessment instruments is apparently a long process and would require us to run the lesson and collect data numerous times and to analyze the results.  Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are “good” or “poor” distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the “facility factor” and “discrimination factor” that test how easy or hard"

“Science is fun. Science is curiosity. We all have natural curiosity. Science is a process of investigating. It’s posing questions and coming up with a method. It’s delving in” - Sally Ride
In our survey we encountered some worrying results. Namely the     fact that 26% of the participants did not know what bacteria are.     This is something that alarmed us. It became clear that informing     people about synthetic biology was the key for making the world ready     for CryptoGErM.
The best way to do this, was through education. So, in     collaboration with ScienceLinX, we organized a day at the     betafaculty. On this"

Freiburg
Team Uppsala-Sweden has helped team Freiburg with trouble-shooting PCR. Uppsala shared the primer design of some light sensor genes, as well as information on touchdown PCR with Freiburg. Notably, the primer sequence for cloning cph8 from Jeffrey Tabor's pJT122 plasmid was disclosed by Uppsala. Furthermore, PCR protocols that proved successful were shown to Freiburg. This information was also present in Freiburg's notebook (16.08).
https://2011.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Notebook/16_August
In exchange, Freiburg allowed Uppsala to distribute The Oath on Uppsala's iGEM wiki. From then on, the two teams have maintained close contact, helping each other on numerous small but important questions.
TU Munich
TU Munich have had problems with assembling the red light-sensor cph8 with other DNA constructs. The ligation attempts persistently failed to work. In order to help TU Munich keep going with the progress, Uppsala sent a functional cph8 plasmid to Munich. TU Munich confirmed that they have received the plasmid and successfully transformed some cells with it. TU Munich also ""checked it for correct size on gel and it looks fine"". In exchange, TU Munich provided information on EnvZ/OmpR kinetics to Uppsala to assist team Uppsala with their modelling.
Bilkent UNAM Turkey
We helped the Bilkent Unam iGEM team by providing them with BL-21 E.Coli strain which was needed in order for their project to proceed.This strain was obtained from one of our advisor Anders Virtanen's lab. and prepared to be sent.It was confirmed that it was received.

Sample preparation
A simple blood draw is necessary for both our treatment companion and relapse detection.
The analysis of our biomarkers is done directly in the plasma, without the need to isolate them, sparing us precious time, costs and unnecessary contamination that can occur during nucleic acid extraction ( Abe, 2003 ). The first step for our sample preparation is the isolation of plasma from whole blood. As part of our experiments on ctDNA, we used commercially ordered human plasma for both practical and ethical reasons. The next step is to treat it with PBS then heat it at 95°C for 3 minutes to precipitate proteins.
Sample preparation for miRNA can theoretically be achieved in a similar way: Qiu et al., 2018 showed that is possible to perform amplification of miRNA directly in serum samples pre-diluted in DEPC-treated water and boiled at 95 °C for 10 minutes. We expect that a similar protocol might be applied also to plasma for miRNA, as measurements of miRNA between plasma and serum have been found to be highly correlated ( Mitchell et al., 2008 ).
Amplification of each biomarker is done afterwards, in order to have enough copies to be able to perform the Cas12a assay effectively.

miRNA
Due to the very low concentration of ctDNA in blood it is necessary to amplify the target prior to Cas12a detection assay. We chose PCR as it is a common practice in most laboratories.           It is important to note that it is possible to replace this method with an isothermal amplification, like LAMP or RPA, to get this assay closer to point of care.
One of the limitation of a Cas12a is the need for a PAM sequence near the target we want to detect. Following Li et al., 2018 and to overcome this limitation, we designed primers that would add the PAM sequence by introducing synthetic mutations. This enables us to virtually target any desired sequence regardless of existence of a T-rich PAM sequence near the target.
