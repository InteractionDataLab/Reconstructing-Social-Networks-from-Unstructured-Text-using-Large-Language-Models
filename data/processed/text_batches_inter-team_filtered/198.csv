Synbio is just a S-Din away!
SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
During our project “S-Din”, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project and took them into practices to confirm or to overturn our hypothesis. Then we tried to integrate them into our final project in order to improve the project functions and user experience.
At the beginning of our project, in order to get answers to questions about user needs, safety, software regulations and legal issues, we conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. They gave us useful and significant suggestions ( Silver page ). We have considered all comments from professionals and integrated them into our design of S-Din ( Gold Integrated page ). We conducted further user interviews and user needs analysis, promoted S-Din and synthetic biology to the public ( Public Engagement page ).
Please see our human practices highlights during the entire product development on our Gold and Integrated Human Practices page .
Silver
During the project, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project. These aspects can be roughly divided into two basic problems:
What advantages will our project have to raise scientists’ ideas, which may lead to a wonderful genetic design? Or what to raise ordinary bio-lovers’ interest, which may attract them to learn more about synthetic biology?
What impacts will our project have in different fields of society?
Through discussions, interviews with professionals or scholars in different fields, and searching related policies, we had a better awareness of our project in the context of scientific inspiration, societal attention, safety and security, and legal considerations. These inspirations help us improve our S-Din a lot.

Aalto-Helsinki,2017,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,". Once acne clears, it must be continued to treat the skin to prevent breakouts.
Additionally, for physical (cosmetic) treatments such as aestheticians facials or chemical peels, acne treatment typically costs $75-200 (65-170€) per session, with one or more sessions required per month. Once acne is cleared up, some patients choose to undergo additional treatments for scarring. These can include microdermabrasion and dermabrasion, which can cost up to $2,000 (1700€) or more, depending on the number of sessions needed.
Light and laser therapies can be used for the treatment of acne. There is, however, insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of these therapies. The treatment costs can range from $100-400 (85-340€) per treatment, and $600-1500 (500-1300€) in total. Most patients will be with somewhere between 4-8 treatments (3 weeks to 2 months).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

Colicin Ia with MCS: The truncated colicin Ia contains a multiple cloning site containing the restriction sites BamHI, KpnI, SalI, BglIII and NheI.
Colicin E9 with MCS: The truncated colicin E9 contains a multiple cloning site containing the restriction sites BamHI, KpnI, SalI, BglIII and NheI.
We decided to select a number of warheads.
Truncated bacteriocins with varying warheads: Our modified bacteriocins do not have cytotoxic domain, so that different cytotoxic domains, or warheads, can be readily added.
The warheads we have selected to add to the MCS of our truncated colicins are toxins Ssp1 and Ssp2 secreted from Serratia marcescens.
Design
Our idea was to design the constructs with our colicins under the control of our characterised pH sensitive promoters ( BBa_K1962013 and BBa_K1962014 ) and bile salts sensitive promoter ( BBa_K1962010 ). Therefore, in the presence of the chicken GI tract the colicins will be released in the stomach and upon interaction with bile salts in the intestine further colicins would be released. In order to do this we would first need to clone the colicin Ia/E3/E9 immunity protein with an RBS downstream of the pH and bile salt promoters to protect our producing cell However, we only successfully managed to clone the colicin Ia and E3 immunities ( BBa_K1962015 , BBa_K1962016 , BBa_K1962012 , BBa_K1962011 ). These composite parts were submitted to the igem registry.

Results

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," portable device that can illuminate 16 bacterial cultures with different intensities of blue light.
Luckily we had some knowledge of electronics in our team, too. Pietu designed the rig and built a foam-padded transportable casing that can be put in an incubator overnight.
Microcontroller
The core of the rig is an Arduino Nano microcontroller. The Arduino is responsible for the logic behind our illumination patterns.
The patterns in our experiments are fairly simple and could in theory be done without the Arduino, but we chose to use it due to its wide popularity and because we now could make advanced (and cool) animations on our rig. Also the Arduino acts as a 5V voltage regulator which provides the voltage for the second part of the rig: the Adafruit 16-channel 16-bit PWM controller.
LEDs
Light Emitting Diodes(LEDs) are current controlled components, and their intensity depends on the current passing through them. LEDs are great because they consume little power and don't generate much heat. It is important that the LEDs wont heat up the bacterial culture remarkably.
Controlling the intensity of these LEDs is trivial by varying the current, but this will cause the emission spectra to shift  (Muthu et al., 2002). Hence we chose a different, and very popular method for varying the LED intensity: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The idea behind PWM is to turn the LED on and off in very short intervals, up to frequencies of 1.6kHz. By varying the time the LED is on and off, we will be able to make a perceived difference in the intensity. The bigger the ratio of on-time versus off-time the brighter the LED.
Due to the hurry of making this rig, we chose to use a pre-made Arduino ""shield"" for handling the PWM. We chose a 16-channel 16-bit PWM shield from Adafruit. The 16 bits provide us much more range than the standard 8 bits of the Arduino (light intensity is an integer from 0 to 4095). Additionally, the Nano does not support as many channels, so having 16 LEDs provides more flexibility in our measurements. The LEDs we used are 5mm Blue 470nm LEDs with an intensity of 1800mcd, 15° angle, Vf@20mA:3,5V (Liteon: LTL-2P3TBK).
If you are building the same setup as us, we recommend you to get good quality LEDs from a known manufacturer who can supply a specifications sheet for the components.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," machine learning into our project?
What are our short and long-term goals?
What are the alternatives of our proposed detection mechanism? How can our 2018 project improve upon current methods?
How can we improve the 3D Fuge?
Lambert iGEM planned a meeting with Dr. Mark Styczynski, Dr. Saad Bhamla, Ms. Yan Zhang, Ms. Monica McNerney at Georgia Tech and Dr. Barr from Emory University to discuss the 2018 project. Lambert iGEM presented a proposal for the 2018 project in order to receive critical feedback from experts in the field. After hours of planning and brainstorming our design, we focused on how a lack of clean drinking water can lead to lower literacy levels.
Ms. McNerney and Ms. Zhang,  PhD students at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, advised us to look into a toehold switch construct. This construct would allow for specificity, which would allow us to detect specific pathogenic cholera.
Dr. Mark Styczynski is an associate professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Dr. Mark Styczynski has been working with Lambert iGEM since 2012, challenging us to consider the different variables in our project design and to expand upon our perspectives.

Simulating every single trajectory
1000 genes which are in state ‘A’ are seen as a whole in the above model. To make the simulation more convincing, we then simulate the trajectory of every single molecule. After that we synthesize all trajectories to get the final result.
Result
The concentration of Cre-Loxp :
Then we use green line to denote the number of genes which are in the original state and red line to denote the number of genes which are in the state after inversion. 1 trajectory:
10 trajectories:
100 trajectories:
1000 trajectories:
From the result, we can see the process more clearly. From the figure of one trajectory, we can see the inversion is reversible so a gene may reverse a lot when Cre-Loxp exists. And the inversion stops when Cre-Loxp is degraded to zero. From all the figures we can see the randomness decreases when the number of trajectories increases. And finally 50% of the genes become the state we want. In a Continuous markov process, when the state set is finite, there is a stationary distribution:
,and it also satisfies:
(π is the distribution of every state, S is the state set, q is the transition probability ) With this theorem, we can know that after a long time, the distribution of the four states will be stable which could also be seen in the figure of 1000 trajectories.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," purify BamA mRNA and add it to the reaction mixture as a template instead of DNA as we assumed that skipping the transcription step would increase protein synthesis rate. After creating a mathematical model that calculated the necessity of mRNA addition to IVTT system, we were able to generate a more efficient transcription-translation system in which we used both the purified BamA mRNA and DNA. This model clearly revealed that using both mRNA and plasmid DNA in our system was essential as BamA mRNA did increase the rate of protein expression while this eﬀect was proportional to the mass of initial DNA. However, after experimenting in the wet lab, we chose to use purified BamA as it was desired to reach higher expression yields of membrane proteins and it proved to be more effective as BamA mRNA degradation rate was considerably faster than BamA protein degradation rate.

Background
During the past several decades, display systems have been successfully implemented in linking the genotype to phenotype of particular proteins. While some of these systems naturally occur in nature, some are artificially created in laboratory. Overall, the display systems have been widely used for protein research. For a brief overview of these systems, click here .
One of the nearest future applications of SynDrop is liposome surface display. It stands out from the other display methods as it has fully controllable settings of an experiment such as the optimized interior composition for synthesis and adjusted exterior configuration for protein folding. Unlike cells, liposomes are free of unnecessary cross-talk and biological noise. Additionally, high-throughput production of liposomes might reduce the experimental time substantially.
To achieve this goal, we chose a prok"

The graph below shows the growth of our wild type E. coli strain MG1655, the MG1655/pSB3T5-K343007 and MG1655/pSB1C3-K343007 respectively.
Figure 9:Growth curve showing measured OD at 550nm. Samples were taken every hour over a 12 hour perion + one sample after 24 hours. In graph E. coli strain MG1655-pSB3T5-k343007 and MG1655-pSB1C3-K343007 is compaired with Wild type E. coli strain MG1655 showing no significant difference between the three graphs. No Lag phase is seen. All data can be seen under Raw data
From our data we see no significant difference between the plasmid carrying bacteria and the wild type. This can be said to be quite contradictory to our results obtained from the stability assay. The transitory stability of pSB1C3-K343007 suggests that it is highly unfavorable for the bacteria, wherefore it might be expected that the growth of the bacteria containing this plasmid would be affected. Thus, however much a disadvantage the plasmid pose to the bacteria, their growth are not significantly influenced by the plasmid. The added reproduction load due to the plasmids, might also prolong the lag phase of the bacteria. Whether this is the case can not be concluded based on this experiment as no lag phase was observed in this experiment.

OVERVIEW
Modeling is significant for supporting and improving the meaning of our project. Generally                     speaking, we hope to use mathematics methods to verify the feasibility and validity of our project.                     In this modeling, four core variables were introduced: fluorescence intensity of DFCH-DA probe,                     fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-Orp1 protein, external H2O2 concentration                     and intracellular H2O2 concentration.
roGFP2-Orp1 protein expression cassette is our core manner for detecting and measuring ROS level.                     In the further application of our device, users can calculate antioxidative ability by collecting                     roGFP2-Orp1fluoresecent intensities data. The whole modeling goes with the goal that making                     roGFP2-Orp1 realize it's proper functions.
To verify the functions of yno1/ndi1 genes and roGFP2-Orp1 fluorescent protein, DCFH-DA                     fluorescent                     probe was chosen as our output signal reference, which can detect and measure ROS concentration                     changes and present relative antioxidative strength. The process is indirect, so we set up Fluorescent                         Probe Model to normalize fluorescence intensities and H2O2 concentration, which made them comparable to each other.
To simulate the accumulation of intracellular H2O2 and set a relationship                     with external H2O2(the external H2O2 is the H2O2 we added in media), H2O2 Decomposition Model was induced.
With simulating the process that how roGFP2-Orp1 generates, reacts and degrades inside cells,                     roGFP2-Orp1 Michealis equation Model described the connection between roGFP2-Orp1 and intracellular                     H2O2.
With the three models mentioned above, we finally proved the accessibility of our roGFP2-Orp1 detecting"

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," to meet limits on phosphorus discharged to receiving water bodies (Tanyi, 2007). Often, these WWTPs have to choose between stable and efficient, yet very costly chemical phosphorus removal methods, or more unstable, less efficient yet cheaper biological phosphorus removal methods (Tanyi, 2007). This choice is usually dictated by the legal limits set on the allowed phosphorus concentration levels in the effluent. We learned through discussing these issues with Aqua Enviro , a leading water consultancy company that more stringent regulations often prompt WWTPs to choose chemical-heavy phosphorus removal systems.
Through talking to Aqua Enviro , we learned that wastewater legislations have tremendous impacts on the type of phosphorus removal technology used, on the thoroughness of wastewater treatment and on the way wastewater industry as a whole develops
Having realised the importance of legislations in the development of the wastewater sector, our team have decided to approach the task of researching biology-related laws with a global perspective in mind. To this end, we have established a global collaboration including teams from 10 countries and 5 continents; participating teams were based in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, England, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the US. Each team have researched GMM legislations in their country and shared their findings and impressions by contributing to a shared document. As a result, we have managed to analyse multiple markets, which has directed us to set up our Phosphostore business model in Canada, where we concluded the legislative approach towards GMMs is both safe and open as our collaborative friends convinced us.
Leading this iGEM Collaboration has expanded our understanding of GMM laws around the world, which in turn, helped us choose Canada as the best place to set up our Phosphstore business plan
Our envisaged customers are specifically Canadian WWTPs which use biological phosphorus removal methods. We chose to target Canadian WWTPs for a number of reasons. Firstly, a critical part of the technology we use to accumulate phosphorus in a bacterial microcompartment has a number of associated patents in the EU and the US ; as such, we would not have a lot of freedom to operate in those two territories. Additionally, the EU and US are the two largest markets for biotechnology, given the number of patents granted in the areas. Thus, we suspect that any patents associated in our project may possibly hinder our freedom to operate in those two territories in the future. Secondly, our technology is compatible mainly with biological phosphorus removal methods, especially EBPR method (explained below), which happens to be widely used throughout Central and Western Canada ("

Starter culture failure: Electric boogaloo
As per usual, the colonies attempted to pick for stater culture creation yesterday were unsuccessful.
Most likely due to the plates being very old; having to withstand steep changes in temperature and environmental conditions.
Decided to simply re-plate the colonies on an LB agar plate supplemented with 50 ug/uL Ampicillin (created on 4/12).  Plate was briefly warned to room temp, and 4 separate glycerol stocks were picked using glycerol stocks and streaked out on 4 separate plates.
Plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius overnight.  Will check tomorrow.
Preparation of Zymo Mix n' Go Chemically Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) expression strains.
Picked colony from BL21(DE3) plates given to us by Dr. Mark Arbing of the UCLA Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry DOE Protein Expression Core Facility in Boyer Hall.
Inoculated colony in 10 mL LB broth, shaken overnight at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours.
Inoculated 500 uL of starter culture in 50mL of 4 degree Zymo broth.
Incubated shaking at 25 degrees Celsius for 30 hours.
Will check culture at 1500 tomorrow for an OD600 of at least 0.3. Target OD600 before glycerol stock preparation is 0.4 (optimal cell content/competency OD).
Julian's Work
I split the successful starter culture between 2 150 mL cultures in LB with Chlor diluted 1000X; so 5mL culture in each
grew one culture at 30C and one at 37C both overnight. I did not check OD
In todd's lab we never checked OD and got good results so I am seeing how this works here and will do a comparison test. If you dont care about OD this reduces timing issues with culturing
Both cultures worked. I then spun down"

For the varying of length ssDNA from 50-100nt was used with one mismatch.
In all experiment single colonies were taken from appropriate dilutions and colony picked onto 500ɣ strep. plates. Number colonies that was growing on colony picked strep plates was counted. The transformation efficiency was calculated as the ratio between re-streaked colonies growing on LB and on 500ɣ strep.
 
Results
The transformation frequency varies from 18-50% in the oligo amount experiment, this seems to be a too high number when comparing to earlier results, and the standard transformation frequency for MAGE in E. coli. The data seems to suggest that the optimal oligo amount for transformation is 5 uM. This correlates with the optimal amount for E coli [7]. The Figure 4 below shows the transformation frequency for the oligo amount experiment. The oligo length data shown in Figure 5 seems to suggest that the optimal oligo length is 80nt this correlates well with the the optimal length for E coli being 90nt.

Construct 7 and construct 11 sequences received from GenScript were transformed into competent Top10 cells and plated on ampicillin. Overnight cultures and minipreps were made of the successful colonies.
To test our proteins, we needed to use purified versions of them. Therefore, we purified TALE A and TALE B and ran them on an SDS PAGE gel (shown below). The gel showed that we were successful in our purification.
Figure 29.SDS Page Gel of Purified TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ).
We also did a gel shift assay to test the binding of TALE A to its target site. We tried different concentrations for TALE A + [A] and we picked two of those to run TALE A + [B]. However, the concentrations of protein were too high. We will repeat the assay next week with lower concentrations of TALE.
Week 21: September 16 - September 20
This week, we did plasmid prep and verification digest of construct 9 ( pSBIC3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +link+K coil), construct 11 ( pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +Link+βlac), and construct 23. We had some good results for construct 11, so we did overnight cultures and mini preps and submitted it to Parts Registry for the DNA submission along with our other constructs.
We also repeated the gel shift assay, this time with TALE A and TALE B . The concentration range was from 0.1ng/uL of protein to 40ng/uL. Because Red Safe, which we used for staining the DNA, is not very sensitive we loaded higher amounts of DNA than recommended and the gel revealed nonspecific binding by the TALES.    We repeated the assay and added chromosomal DNA to prevent nonspecific binding, added the recommend amount of DNA (55pM), and stained the gel after it ran with SYBR Green, unfortunately, we were not able to see any bands at all.
We transformed construct 11 into E. coli BL21, cultured the colonies, induced them with IPTG and purified the protein. We performed Bradford Assay on our samples"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," varying amounts of homologous sequence (293 bp, 190 bp and 125 bp of homologous sequence respectively). A band around 3000 bp or 700 bp is visible for colonies transformed with PCR product amplified using primer 3. B. subtilis colonies which were transformed earlier in the summer (late June) and expressed RFP were used as a positive control, cPCR amplified a 3000 bp region. Invitrogen 1Kb plus ladder was used.
Figure 5: A cPCR using thrC specific primers was done on B. subtilis colonies transformed with PCR product. Untransformed colonies (UT) were compared with colonies transformed with PCR product containing 293 bp and 190 bp of homology. Invitrogen 1kb plus ladder was used to determine the size of the products.
Over the weekend we had our aGem workshop. We were fortunate enough to talk to Dr. Karmella Hyne, an experienced iGEM judge.  We told her that our transformed cells were not expressing RFP despite the fact that we had cells growing on selective plates and had results from the colony PCR which suggested that we had successful transformation. She suggested that RFP might be toxic to the cell or there was a transposon inserting into the gene inhibiting expression. As a team we decided to try this experiment using lacZ, an enzymatic reporter which we believed would be easier on the cell.
Week 20: September 8- September 14
After encountering many trials of unsuccessful transformations, we thought the issue with our transformations might have been due to the addition of inconsistent volumes of xylose. We were adding enough xylose to make the final absorbance 1.0 at 600 nm, but the starting absorbance was often not consistent. This meant that even though we were keeping the final absorbance and thus cell density consistent, the volume of xylose added was not consistent. There is the possibility that for some trials, not enough xylose might have been added for competency, which could be a potential explanation for our failed transformations. We thought that there might be a threshold for the addition of xylose required for competency, and that adding volumes beyond this threshold will still result in the competence of all cells. We reasoned that flooding the cells with a high concentration of xylose might be better to ensure that all cells are competent, instead of adding small amounts. We attempted transformation with final xylose concentrations of 3% and 5%, but we obtained the same results as previous trials with no growth on spectinomycin plates and thus no transformation"

Advertising Plan
A multipronged approach to advertising will be taken to our niche market.  Service companies and large government analytical laboratories will be the primary targets, however, we hope to be able to simultaneously be attracting interest from private companies in similar oil and gas service roles. Advertising will occur as follows in our timeline:
Year 1 - 2014
Social Media - We have established Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts to attempt to advertise our potential products and technology platform to our target market.  We will begin to advertise specifically to individuals in these markets using targeted social media marketing.
Conferences - Our group plans to attend market specific conferences to be able to network with key players in the industry.  We plan to use these connections to establish our reach in the marketplace.
Website - We will have a website where potential customers can come to learn more about our company and our product, as well as place orders and request quotes- point of sale.
Year 2 - 2015
In addition to Year 1:
Industry Specific Events - In addition to the conferences from Year 1, we plan to expand our breadth to trade shows, conferences, conventions, and key industry events.  We plan to hold kiosks and booths at these events to directly engage potential clients with a focus on establishing pre-sales of our technology to prepare for our technologies release into the marketplace.  We plan on investing in signage, fliers, brochures, a monthly newsletter, and other advertising components to achieve this reach.
Year 3 - 2016
In addition to Year 1 and 2:
Print Advertising - We plan on targeting key industry specific newspapers and magazines in our target market to expand our reach.  These will be important to potentially expand our market into private companies which may be more difficult to reach via conferences or other methods.
Endorsement - In order to gain confidence from our clients, we hope to be able to partner with a key player in the industry to gain market confidence in our technology.  We hope to gain their endorsement and utilize this to gain further share in the market place bringing on other companies in the space to adopt our technology.
Competitive and New Emergent Technologies
Our product provides a distinct advantage to our target market, being fast, affordable, portable, and robust. These are many elements which other general toxin biosensors do not possess. An analysis against other competitive technologies in the market follows:

Extract the assembled DNA. With a pipette, extract the supernatant containing the assembled DNA.
Add RDP Storage buffer. Add 20 μL of storage buffer to neutralize the sample for transformation and gel analysis.
Follow up steps
Gel analysis: Gel analysis is a fast way of assessing the efficiency of the assembly and the yield of the product. For a good build the major gel band should also be the longest with a size corresponding to the predicted length of your design. Typically a 1% agarose gel will resolve fragments up to 10 kb. Even if the desired product is not the major band, don’t give up! The preponderance of smaller bands should be inactive and will therefore be under represented amongst in the total colony count.
Cell Transformation: In our hands, builds up to 8 parts routinely yield hundreds of colonies using chemically competent cells. Use the cell type and transformation procedure your lab feels comfortable with, but keep in mind that the more ambitious your build becomes, the fewer colonies you will get. In these situations you may want to consider using a high-efficiency transformation"

Moreover, after we stopped the light, the current got back to the level it was before we gave the light.
Figure 8. CdS canincrease cathode current.
CdS quantum dots can speed up the electrons transfer process, pumping more electrons from the electrode to the bacteria in the same time utilizing light energy. This may results from the CdS quantum dots’ property as a semiconductor.
In summary, CdS quantum dots we provided can increase the cathode current with its semiconductor property in team XX’s experiments. Thus, this collaboration is fruitful with a new photosynthesis system developed, where they can further increase the speed of the electron transfer process that leads to the improvement of bio-film synthesis.

Scalability
We can transform AND gate into OR gate through a flip of the sequence between opposite loxP sites. Moreover, based on a similar idea, our system shows a strong scalability in further design. AND / OR Transformation is a typical pattern of two-input programmable logic devices. There are 16 kinds of two-input logical relations in all, as the table below shows.
Yi and Yi’ (i=0⋯7) stand for 8 logical relations seperately. For example, y1 stands for OR gate and y1’ stands for NOR gate. Pay attentions to the truth table. Y0(Y0’) shows that the output is always 0(1),which stands for a zero-input logical relation. Y6(Y6’) and Y7(Y7’) stand for one-input logical relation, which can be realized easily. Therefore, only the other 10 kinds of logical relations are real two-input logic which we really care about. Thus, we build a flip system with three modules. Flip Module 1: It’s same with our core module, which can help us choose whether we want a AND logic or an OR logic. For example, we can transform AND gate(Y4) to OR gate(Y1) by this module.
Flip Module 2: With the help of this module, we can transform A to A’ in our logic. For example, as the figure below shows, we use Y as our output, now Y = A’B(Y2), and we will get AB if we flip the Flip Module 2, then Y will be AB(Y4).
Flip Module 3: Using this module, we will be able to get XNOR gate(Y5) because it will help us start another circuit, as the figure below shows. For example, once the Flip Module 3 is activated, the expression of Y will be under the control of the promoter in this sequence. Combining it with the sequence above, Y will be expressed once A"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," this? With whom are you cooperating in Ethiopia?
Dr. Keenan:
A NGO based in the US. They have offices all over the world, but they have a big office in Ethiopia.
Kai:
If you use so many antibiotics, isn’t there the risk of generating resistances?
Dr. Keenan:
There has never been resistance reported for chlamydia. It is an intracellular organism and some people think that kind of protects it, so that it is not subject to selection pressures and therefore doesn’t become resistant. It is not tested very often. But I think technically when people culture chlamydia in petri dishes they got resistant chlamydia that way. But in the field, no one has ever seen it yet. It is a concern for sure but it’s not something that seems to be as important as in other diseases, such as tuberculosis.
Daniel C.:
What do you think is the biggest problem in the fight against chlamydia?
Dr. Keenan:
So first of all, each place where trachoma occurs is different. Ethiopia has like the worst trachoma in the world. Another place where we do trials in West Africa is Niger and trachoma there seems to go away much easier than in Ethiopia. For some reason, trachoma in Ethiopia is just very resistant. Like after giving many rounds of antibiotic therapy there is still infection being detected within the community. The biggest problem is sort of knowing the end-game. Should we just keep treating forever or should we take some years off? The WHO gave recommendations for how you should treat, but we don’t have a good way to say how long we maintain long infection rates. [...] A big challenge is diagnostics for sure. […] Everything is completely dependent on Pfizer. The moment, when Pfizer decides they don’t want to donate anymore, […] that would be a huge problem because these countries won't be able to afford the antibiotics. […]
Daniel C.:
Do you think it is achievable to eliminate trachoma until 2020?
Dr. Keenan:
No.
Daniel C.:
How is the diagnosis being made in developing countries? Are there any immuno based methods to detect chlamydia?
Dr. Keenan:
[...] [Chlamydia] is not very symptomatic. It is not like you have a lot of people that are going to the clinic and saying that their eyes are bothering them. It’s more that we have that kind of subclinical information and that leads to scarring, and that leads to trichiasis and blindness later in life. But kids don"
Chalmers-Gothenburg,2018,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a steady state after 3 days (Czerucka, D. et al. 2007).  Furthermore, it was found that in 96 % of the patients, the fecal concentration of S.boulardii was undetectable 3 days after dosing had stopped (Elmer et al., 1999) and that the yeast remained in the gut at most 4 days after stopped dosing (Czerucka, D. et al. 2007). This, together with the GRAS status of S. boulardii, let us assume that the yeast is unable to colonize the gut on its own, and that it will not outgrow the gut microbiota.
With the safety of the unmodified S. boulardii confirmed, the next question to address is if our system could affect patient safety once implemented in the yeast. The probability of this is low, considering that the pheromone sensing system in some cases causes cell cycle arrest (Williams et al., 2013), and thus inhibits the growth of the yeast to some extent. The risk of gut colonization by yeast overgrowth is thereby not likely caused by our system. If we next consider the anchor binding, our goal is to make the yeast bind specifically to the cancer cells and not offsite to the healthy gut cells. Based on this, we can conclude that with a functioning system the yeast should only remain in the gut if the patient has cancer. Of course, extensive preclinical testing of the probiotic would be necessary to confirm this.
Environmental Safety
One commonly used argument against genetically modified organisms is that they can spread in the ecosystem and, with them, their genetic material. There is a possibility that our genetically modified S. boulardii will survive in the sewage system and eventually end up in nature. Therefore, we considered what will happen with our yeast once it leaves the body of the patient together with the feces. One of the main risks with our modified yeast being released into the sewage system is the risk of spreading the ampicillin resistance gene, present in the plasmids used for transformation, to bacteria. However, transfer of genetic material from yeast to bacteria has not been observed (Czerucka, Piche, & Rampal, 2007). In addition to this, the genetic material transformed into S. boulardii would optimally be implemented into the yeast genome in the final product, thereby eliminating the risk of spreading ampicillin resistance.
We asked ourselves if our yeast could harm the nature by release of target molecule. We deemed this unlikely"
Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Infiltrate_-_-_TEXT.html,", though there was a small decrease in efficiency observed at pH 8.2.  This is a promising result due to the difference in pH between the phagosome and the cytosol.  Additionally, the high activity of TDMH even at low pH is promising as it will be required to function at low pH inside the phagosome.
Figure 8 pH influence on  TDMH enzyme activity
We add to M.smegmatis the proteins of an induced control, the uninduced strain of Bl21 and the induced strain producing TDMH.
Conclusions and continuing work
  We have shown that E. coli can effectively kill mycobacteria in culture by expressing the TDMH enzyme, now a BioBrick. We have further shown that E. coli and mycobateria may co-localize within macrophages, where LLO-based systems can effectively deliver protein payloads.
In the coming weeks, we will continue to refine our cell culture techniques to precisely characterize the effectiveness of our system in situ, within the living macrophage.
Figure 9 The effect of TDMH-induced E. coli on macrophage infection rates after 3 hours.
We scored fluorescence microscopy images of macrophages exposed to both E. coli and M. smegmatis expressing fluorescent protein markers.  The E. coli expressed LLO and were induced or uninduced for TDMH expression. For both treatments, we observed an increase in the infection rates of both bacteria after 3 hours. We attribute this to combination of the media with free bacteria, which macrophages continue to consume over the course of the experiment. TDMH induction slowed the increase in E. coli infection rates, which is likely due to the toxic effects of TDMH expression on E. coli, as shown in figure 4.

Meantime, the more replication and transcription errors we get, the lower or higher production we will get. The error rate function is $$errRate(t)=repRat(t)\cdot trsRat(t)$$ Where the replication error rate depends on the length of D-psicose 3-epimerase coding sequence, the multiplication of single error rate define the replication and transcription rate as follows $$repRat(t)=srepRat^{len}(t)$$ The length of mRNA is one third of the cDNA length, here we get $$trsRat(t)=\sqrt[3]{strsRat^{len}(t)}$$ Although errors can result in the decrease of production, the increase of production is also promoting on account of the uncertainty of variation. For a natural evolution system, we consider that the probability of production decrease and increase is equal, decided by the error rate per cycling period. Therefore, the average production rate is distributed normally with the mean of 0 and the variance of error rate. The production rate is shown as follows  $$grsRate \sim N(0,errRate)$$ If we set X as production rate,$\sigma^2$ as error rate, then we will get  $X \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$   And the probability density function is  $$f(x\mid 0,\sigma^2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$ The probability of production rate is   $$P(x_1 < grsRat < x_2)=F(x_2)-F(x_1)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}f(x)dx$$ The original production is also vital when we simulate the production of our system by reason that the larger our system is, the more psicose we will get in our manufacturing and it makes no sense to compare a certain system with another in a totally different scale. So the standardization and the estimation of original production for psicose is necessary.
Another improvement in our model is that the low rate of extreme mutation is included. When the extreme mutation happens, the extreme mutation will lead to a sever structure change in the protein, making it more efficient or invalid. On this condition, the mutation can be described as: $$f(x)= kx, Y \sim N(0,\frac{1}{X})$$ Where $X$ is the frequency of not extreme mutation and $Y"

We assume that within a short time dt, the light condition doesn’t change much. Using the kinetic model, we can calculate the concentrations of fluorescence proteins at the time (t + dt).Through an iteration of above process, we can predict the amount of fluorescence in the cell x at any time after the time t.
Details about the compartmental kinetic model can be found here .
Swimming rule: Motion control
Due to the work by Fan Bai, E. coli switches the direction of rotation in a stochastic way. We assume the following:
E. coli stays in either of the two motion states, clockwise rotating which corresponds to swimming in a specific direction and counter-clockwise rotating which corresponds to cell tumbling, and switches alternatively between the two states.
The time E. coli spends staying in either states follows an exponential distribution with respective means
In the swimming state, the bacteria swims straight in a linear direction; in the tumbling state, the bacteria changes the direction of swimming randomly using a uniform distribution.
As for the C. crescentus, we assume that
They swim in a similar way like the E. coli, except that the magnitude and the bias of C.Crescentus is influenced by the light regulated DgrA,DgrB and HfiA concentrations in the C.Crescentus Motion control system. The bias refers to the ratio of the time C.C spends swimming over the time it spends on tumbling.
The way in which the Proteins DgrA,DgrB and HfiA influences the rotation remains in detail unclear. We simply apply a mathematically negative influence from the related proteins to the magnitude of the velocity and the bias of states.
Division
We assume the following:
Time between successive mitosis can be modeled using an Erlang distribution
Plasmids repartition occurring at mitosis can be represented by a normal distribution
(Ref:Ervy 2012)
Simulation
Realization of the C.imager system is simulated using the Gillespie Algorithm implemented in Matlab by our team.
Results
Performance of E.coli versus C. Crescentus:
From the above picture, we can clearly see that C.Crescentus performs better than E.Coli, the simulation results answer our question at the beginning positively. You are free to load any picture you like for the bacterial sensing and imaging, the model can present the whole dynamic process.
A short gif below shows one of the simulation performance:

Synthethic biology lessons
In a brainstorming session with our team we discussed whether we thought subjects around synthetic biology were taught well in a good way in high school. All of us agreed that this was not bad at all. When we were in high school, we learned about a lot of subjects related to synthetic biology, but they were neven connected. Biology and chemistry for example were kept completely separate.
We are aiming to solve this by providing high schools with two different lessons on synthetic biology. An important requirement for these lessons is that it should be sustainable. It should be developed in a way in which it can be used more than once. Since we will not be part of the iGEM team in the upcoming years, the lessons are not developed to be taught by us, but by the teachers of high schools. This way, the courses can be used year after year.  We created PowerPoint presentations and course guides for teachers and worksheets and answer sheets for students.
The first lesson is about the societal impact of synthetic biology. This is illustrated with three examples: Golden Rice, Designer Baby’s and Gene Drives. The goal of this lesson is to let the students form an opinion about how synthetic biology can be applied in society. This lesson is applicable for high school students in general.

The second lesson is about a more technical aspect of synthetic biology. In this lesson the steps of a protocol for cloning are described in an interactive way. The steps that are included in the lesson are: digestion, l"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to the lipid environment.
Another observation is that the end of the unfolded beta-barrel is sticking out of the membrane, and contains many charged side chains as well, while the boundary between this part and the transmembrane domain is quite apolar. Overall this structure gives the impression to be still highly stable, but perhaps less stable than the native beta-barrel, anchored in the lipid bilayer.
Fig 5 Van der Waals representation of the side chains of OmpA in the membrane. The membrane is represented by dashed lines. The protein backbone is colored in magenta. White beads represent non-polar side chains, green beads represent polar side chains (of varying polarity, there are 5 different levels of polarity in Martini and they are all colored green), blue beads represent positively charged side chains and red beads represent negatively charged side chains.
As this large scale conformational change should have a large effect on the behaviour of the protein, the angle between OmpA and the membrane normal was measured over time. To visualize trends in the data, a running average was calculated with a window of 100 frames. Fig 6. shows that this angle oscillates stably around 84.9 degrees. However after 10 ms of simulation, the angle suddenly shifts to 84 degrees. This could be an indication that the usual right-angle of OmpA is perhaps not so stable in the new conformation this fusion protein adopts.
Fig 6 Angle between OmpA and membrane normal, running average over time. The angle oscillates stably around 84.9 then suddenly drops to 84.
Under the assumption that the fusion protein indeed retains this conformation, the unfolding beta-barrel and subsequent stable anchoring in the membrane is a novel insight. As the system is meant to function as a display mechanism for soluble proteins binding to it, it is likely that this change in conformation contributes to this mechanism. It is hypothesized that the protein-ligand complex flips across the lipid bilayer entirely to function as a display system, generally assisted by chaperone proteins. Since the angle between OmpA and the membrane normal becomes more acute over the time scale of the simulation, unfolding of the beta-barrel structure may contribute to OmpA flipping over the lipid bilayer to display its ligand.

Inclusivity
What was the goal of the survey?
The goal of this survey was simple: to examine how diverse and inclusive iGEM really is, and to then provide suggestions that might help make this organization more inclusive.The UAlberta iGEM team was interested in investigating the age, sex, gender, sexuality, and race demographics of North American teams to examine if there were any inclusion disparities within North American iGEM teams. We asked these questions with the expectation that iGEM would follow the stereotypical trends of STEM, that being that the majority of iGEM members will be white, straight, cisgender (those who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth) and male. We also took into consideration past work done within iGEM to explore similar issues. We are also basing our survey off the iGEM survey conducted last year by iGEMs Diversity Committee, and work done by Paris Bettencourt 2013.
Creating a more inclusive space, and improving diversity starts by being aware of the downfalls of the organization, and from there moving to address any issues that may prevent the organization from achieving diversity. This survey and our suggestions are in no way meant to make anyone feel bad or lesser, they are also not meant to call anyone out but rather to spark conversation between all members so that we can all make change.
Team UAlberta thinks that a survey of this nature, and suggestions that may allow iGEM to improve its inclusivity is important because like all things. iGEM is imperfect and there is always room to improve upon established systems. iGEM is also the perfect organization to spark change in, as iGEM is an organization that is driven by young people's idealism, providing the perfect atmosphere to drive progress within STEM both scientifically and socially.
Ultimately, we hope this survey and our findings can contribute to conversation within iGEM teams and the iGEM community as a whole, while identifying changes that must be made to ensure that iGEM is a safe and inclusive space that opens doors for women and minorities. This is our community, and by gaining a better understanding of our demographics and using suggestions to inform structural change we can foster positive development.
Team UAlberta also recognizes that there has been an increase in general presence of women and non-White"
Washington-Software,2009,Team:Washington-Software#Challenges_-_-_TEXT.html,"-D Polar Coordinant System can be difficult. Here, any position on or above the well can be described in terms of x, y and z offsets from a fixed origin. In our Model C, the robot is built with three 2-segment robotic arms with 5 physical constants (See the section on Mathematical Modeling ). Trying to determine the 3 angles that Motor 1, 2 and 3 must rotate to position itself to any point in 3-D space is nontrivial. Fortunately, we are able to simplify the reverse triangulation process by repeated application of a 3x3 rotational matrix.
Pneumatic Control and Mutual Exclusion
We use a single pneumatic tubing for 3 different pipette operations: aspirating, dispensing and cleaning. To do this, we developed a 3-way switch which is controlled by one of the motors. We also developed the software to acquire and release mutex (mutual exclusion) and prevent deadlocks.
Master Slave Synchronization
This part is extremely tricky, because of a limitation that is imposed by the hardware. For those of you that are familiar with NXT bricks, you will know that each brick can only be connected to a maximum of 3 motors. For this project, we need to use 6 motors, and hence we have 2 separate NXT bricks, ALPHA and PHI. The two bricks are connected using blue-tooth wireless technology. Implementing the Master Slave Synchronization between the 2 NXT modules using RobotC is quite tricky because RobotC uses a non-intuitive function and because when you attempt two-way communication, messages are lost. In our implementation, ALPHA serves as the Master Module, while PHI is the Slave Module. When ALPHA positions itself correctly at the right well, it will send a message to PHI so that it can perform the appropriate pipette operations like aspirating, dispensing or cleaning.
Robust Design to enable Multiple Plug-and-Play Modules
We want to design the software system to be extremely robust and it is able to work well with different physical implementations. As a proof of concept, we have implemented 2 different physical instances of ALPHA, (ALPHA-120 and ALPHA-90, where the inter-arm angles are 120 and 90 degrees respectively). These are 2 different pipette head assemblies with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. We have also shown that our same software works seamlessly on both instance of ALPHA. We can interchangeably mount either instances of ALPHA on the BETA frame, and it will work (see video here ) A flexible plug-and-play design is extremely important because it enables different iGEM"

I mailed the sponsorship pkg to GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) just as the Charitable Donations lady asked me to. Although she didn’t think iGEM’s goal this year matches the company’s objectives but she’s still willing to have a look at it.  I didn’t call any companies today because I’ve been continuously calling them for the past few weeks. I’ll do it Monday though.
Company 1’s donation committee reviewed our pkg and said that since that company does not have a presence in Calgary and they only support communities where they have operations so they declined our proposal. I sent her a thank you letter and asked for contacts.
In lab: (shadowing Jeremy) I made a 0.7% agarose gel for restriction digest of Colony 6 and colony 7. (we took C6 +7 from a plasmid PCR that was done earlier by Jeremy to verify the presence of LuxPQ-B-R-OU-B in AC plasmid. C6 +7 looked the most accurate after Jeremy ran it on a gel so we used it for the restriction digest today. )
The purpose of this restriction digest was to verify the size of the PQ-B-R-OU-B. He let me do almost everything on my own while he was there.  After we ran it on a gel, wells 2 and 4 (cut) was blank but the wells 3 and 5 (uncut) was clearly visible. We assumed there must’ve been a problem with the RD perhaps so we redid everything again. I made the gel again, etc. Yesterday, Jeremy did a RD of luxPQ and ccdb and left it overnight. Today we did a plasmid switch to transfer PQ  from AK to AC. We antartic phosphatased it and ligated it, then we did a transformation to transfer PQ plasmid into top 10 cells. Finally we plated it on Chlroramphenical plates and left it overnight.  The rest of the time was spent in the ethics meeting this morning and major lab clean up in the afternoon.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

Assembly of BioBricks in pSB1A8YL - The BioBrick Plasmid
""...and when is enough proof enough?""
Jonathan Safran Joer,
Everything is Illuminated
This page is intended to give brief overview of how we fulfilled gold medal requirement #3. For much more information please visit Molecular Tools .
Yarrowia lipolytica has a great potential to be a very versatile cell factory due to its ability to grow on a wide range of substrates. However, working with this unconventional yeast is troublesome due to the lack of molecular tools available for genetic engineering.
We want to open up for the possibility of using Y. lipolytica in the future to produce any desired product while growing on any kind of substrate. Our aim was to develop a plasmid able to replicate in Escherichia coli for easy cloning and propagation. In addition, the plasmid should also be compatible with both Y. lipolytica along with the BioBrick standard.
Our Proof of Concept
Design and assembly of a new plasmid (pSB1A8YL)
Expression of three BioBricks devices with pSB1A8YL in E. coli
Transformation in Y. lipolytica and detection of the plasmid with inserts
Express a heterologous protein in Y. lipolytica
Design of Plasmid
First step was to design the plasmid. We designed a plasmid (pSB1A8YL) based on the high copy plasmid pUC19 for replication in E.coli and pSL16-CEN1-1(227) for replication in Y. lipolytica.

Australia
In Australia, the use of GMMs is regulated under a nationwide legislative framework consisting of two main branches: the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Individual states and territories also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.
Brazil
In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules and fiscalisation of GMMs and its derivatives in the national territory. The National Technical Committee of Biosafety (CTNBio) is responsible for enforcing the laws and setting the rules for the construction, experimentation, cultivation, manipulation, transport, commercialization, consumption, release and discarding of GMMs and its derivatives.
Japan
In Japan, mainly Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the use of GMMs. With these ministries at the core, other institutions such as Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare are also responsible for GMMs in each related field.
Chile
Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology. However, the Agricultural and Livestock Service is responsible for the importation, sowing and propagation of GMOs, also regulating the exportation of seeds (Law N° 3.557/82 actualised Law N°1523/2001). The Ministry of Health, on the other hand, regulates the labelling of food made with the use of GMOs (Article 107).
Indonesia
The laws regarding the use of GMMs are regulated by 4 ministries: The Ministry of Agriculture, The Ministry of Forestry and Plantation, The Ministry of Health, and The Ministry of Food and Horticulture. They created the Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 21 year of 2005 (PP No. 21/2005) on Biosafety of GMO.
Korea
The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the GMO Law, established on Jan 28, 2001. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy takes charge of this law.
India
India is currently undergoing a massive overhaul in their laws and regulations regarding GMOs. Currently, there is a proposed “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017’ draft that has been prepared and opened for comments. Currently, under the proposal, the following 6 bodies are in charge of enforcing laws regarding GMOs and GMMs:

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Further_-_-_TEXT.html," natural mechanism, in an attempt to control R6K plasmid replication.
Pi-protein controls the initiation of DNA replication in gamma origin of R6K plasmid. By varying the amount of Pi-protein being produced through an inducible promoter (ptet*), the change in plasmid copy number can be observed using real-time PCR. This method is being studied because it could potentially offer a linear change of gene expression.
Also, this method provides an alternative means to control gene expression, other than controlling gene expression through the use of promoters and ribosomal binding sites (RBS); thus expanding the degree of control over gene expression.
Results
Characterization of plasmid controlling system. (A) Pir gene and gamma ORI co-exist on the same plasmid. (B) Pir gene and gamma ORI exist on different plasmids.
From the above figure, no significant change in copy number of plasmid (per genome) was observed upon induction by aTc when the gamma ORI and pir gene are located on different plasmids.
We speculate that this might be due to the high sensitivity of R6K ORI to pi protein. As reported by previous study, the overexpression of pir gene facilitates the formation of dimeric pi protein that conversely suppress the copy number of plasmid with gamma origin (Abhyankar, 2003). This can be simply understood as neither too high nor too low the concentration of pi protein will the plasmid copy number be increased. It is conjectured that there only exists a very narrow range of [aTc], which would affect the copy number; and that the range is hidden in one of the 10-fold interval of [aTc], regardless, our experimental setups might have shown the lowest possible copy number of p(R6K)-BBa_J04450.
Abhyankar, M. M. (2003). Biochemical Investigations of Control of Replication Initiation of Plasmid R6K. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279(8), 6711–6719.
As for p(R6K)-TPP-BBa_J04450, the result showed that there was a significant increase in plasmid copy number when the cells were induced with 10-3 μM aTc. However, a step-wise increment was not observed. Therefore, more measurement point on that particular range of [aTc], which is from 10-2 μM to 10-4 μM aTc, has to be set up in order"

cjBlue green chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320004 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of greenish-blue colored chromoprotein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.

We ordered 60mer FAM-labeled [A] (TALE A target sequence) and FAM-labeled [B] (TALE B target sequence) oligos and hybridized them with their reverse complement oligo to make double stranded pieces of DNA containing the target sequence of our TALEs. Using these target sequences and following the TALE Nitrocellulose Functionality Assay , we showed that TALEs bind to their target sequence. We incubated Ferritin fused to an Ecoil ( BBa_K1189018 ) to TALE fused to a Kcoil ( BBa_K1189029 and BBa_K1189030 ) to make the FerriTALE complex. The complex was then blotted on strips of nitrocellulose paper. The strips were then blocked with milk and soaked in the appropriate DNA solution. Finally, the strips were washed and imaged (figure 14 and 15). We performed a densitometery test on these results and were able to calculate the dissociation constant of the TALEs.

Tianjin,2018,Team:Tianjin#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," different products in subjective days and nights.
In our human practice , the survey inspired us the idea. We collected the data, sought help from experts, made market analysis to select the proper products. In detail, one of the S. cerevisiae combining KaiC with SasA at subjective dawn is able to initiate the expression of downstream target gene, which can translate into a kind of product with a refreshing effect, such as caffeine. In another S. cerevisiae, KaiC is bound to CikA or KaiB at  subjective dusk to generate the expression of another downstream gene, whose translational products can function as sleep-enhancing supplements or mosquito repellent, such as melatonin (we eliminated it later for unsatisfactory effect) and limonene.  In this way, the KaiABC circadian clock system can be used as a cell factory that alternately and periodically produces two different substances between day and night.
Our cell factory will serve as a platform for a variety of biotechnological applications, by varying the downstream target genes to achieve different functions, such as treatment of circadian rhythm disorders, automatic daily drug delivery, etc. To take an example, as we all know, intestinal microbes have a significant impact on human health such as immunity, emotions, and the body's own biological clock. Therefore, perhaps for the foreseeable future, we can introduce the KaiABC oscillation system or its evolution into a specific kind of intestinal microbes to synthesize and secrete certain chemical substances or biologically active molecules to achieve better regulation of the environment in the human body.
Figure 5  The schematic diagram of our cell factory
Based on this idea, we conducted experimental exploration of caffeine and limonene using the parts provided by iGEM. Caffeine is a xanthine alkaloid compound, a central nervous stimulant that temporarily dispels drowsiness and restores energy, is used clinically to treat neurasthenia and coma. It is also widely used as an additive for a variety of functional refreshing beverages. Limonene is a volatile monoterpenoid compound and produces a lemon-like odor with the effect of repelling mosquitoes. Besides, limonene could inhibits rat mammary gland and other Tumor development, d-limonene has also been used clinically to dissolve cholesterol-containing gallstones. Owing to the benefits mentioned above, inhaling limonene may also have positive influence on our health, with the potentials to prevent cancer and dissolve gallstones.

A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a software tool is only accessible if it is properly maintained, updated and if it has a community supporting it. What would happen to Neptune after iGEM? Where will Neptune be in 5 years? If we seriously cared about promoting an accessible workflow, we had to make sure we considered the future of our tool.
What is NONA?
And so we proceeded to reach out to the NONA Research Foundation, a nonprofit whose aim is to broaden access to and develop a community around open source synthetic biology software tools. As cited from the organization, “Nona creates long-lasting solutions to the challenges posed by the rapidly growing complexity of software in the synthetic biology community by using the power of open source.”
Integrating with NONA provided 3 long-term, sustainable solutions to promoting the accessibility of Neptune and microfluidics to the synthetic biology community.
1) NONA would distribute Neptune, allowing Neptune to have a “home” where is can easily be found (beyond GitHub.)
2) NONA is dedicated to integrating all open synthetic biology software tools under one umbrella, thus building a community of researchers and developers who who will use and support these tools. Thus, NONA will be a medium through which other developers can contribute to Neptune, and NONA will be a place researchers can go to learn more about how to use Neptune, ask for help, and so forth.
3) Overall, by having a dedicated community and website where Neptune will always have a place, we are making it very hard for Neptune to be abandoned. Quite the opposite, with NONA will ensure Neptune is sustained for years to come, while also providing the opportunity for a community to flourish around Neptune and similar software tools.
Passing Neptune to NONA
We met with members of NONA to discuss integrating Neptune with their foundation. Discussions went really well; indeed, while NONA offered us a lot in terms of accessibility and sustainability, we found that our team could give NONA a hand as well.
We agreed to pass Neptune along to the NONA community. Neptune, with its installation link and all of the documentation were passed along to NONA. In the coming weeks more and more of Neptune’s supporting content; wiki’s, tutorials and all documentation will be pushed to NONA’s site.
NONA will now holistically support Neptune and ensure it is a successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune"

CHARACTERISATION
Every great idea is turned to reality through actions. Following the design of our BioBricks, we carried out an array of experiments in order to characterise our BioBricks in experimental environments. Our project was varied and involved working with two different chassis - Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli. We also used Streptococcus mutants and a Lentiviral vector in our experiments. See more about the protocols here.

We can see from this graph that expression of trbK does indeed reduce the conjugation efficiency by four orders of magnitude. With this we have a method to prevent back propagation of the signal and we now have receiver side control over communication.

Verification and Characterization of Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1
A conjugation test was done using our conjugation protocol to verify that Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 was transmitted during conjugation.
Donors: NCCBNr# 2350 cells with R751 and Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 (TRI+CAM)
Receivers: DH5 α cells with J23100 (AMP)
Transconjugants A: DH5 α cells with R751 and J23100 (TRI+AMP)
Transconjugants B: DH5 α cells with Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 and J23100 (CAM+AMP)
The following table shows the calculated conjugation efficiencies (raw data here ):

The reason for the lower efficiency of Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 compared to R751 is the presence of the entry exclusion protein trbK. If a receiver cell gets Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1, it can still receive R751 afterward. But if a receiver cell gets R751, it will not accept Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 afterward because trbK expression will block incoming transfers.
This test will be redone with R751 ΔoriTR cells once they are available.

3HPA
.   Some of these modifications target for instance NADPH homeostasis.   During glycolysis cells produce NADH while the production of
3HPA
depends on NADPH.   Therefore, a misbalance between NADH and NADPH could arise, but overexpression of pntAB (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase) or gapA (NADP+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) has been shown to stabilize cofactor balance (See table for references). Another possibility to enrich the NADPH pool is to downregulate glycolysis while upregulating pentose phosphate pathway, which produces NADPH instead of NADH.   This can be achieved by deletion of NAD+-dependent gapA or deletion of pfkA (phosphofructokinase). Another critical point in the
3HPA
route are side reactions.   Pyruvate can be reduced to lactate or decarboxylated to acetate, what could be suppressed by deletion of ldhA (lactate dehydrogenase) or pox (pyruvate decarboxylase).   The flow from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA can be increased by overexpression of pdh (pyruvate dehydrogenase).   For acetyl-CoA there are also side reactions, for instance hydrolysis to acetate. This reaction can be suppressed by deletion of pta (phosphotransacetylase) and ackA (acetate kinase) or by overexpression of ald6 (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and acs (acetyl-CoA synthase) for the reverse reaction to acetyl-CoA.   Malonyl-CoA can also go into side reactions for fatty acid biosynthesis instead of the reduction to
3HPA
.   However, downregulation of fabAB (fatty acid biosynthesis) or inducible inactivation of fabAB has been showed to increase
3HPA
titer.   Additionally it has also been shown that site-directed mutagenesis of acc and mcr genes increases product titer (Kildegaard et al. 2016) ; (Liu et. al. 2016) .

The following protocols are based on knowledge recived from [ 2 ]
FS1.1
Day 1: The bacteria were grown in 5 ml-LB media overnight. The solutions used for staining were prepared.
Solution I:  The following components were added in the listed order:
• 5 g of tannic acid dissolved in 9.65 ml distilled water.
• 150 µl  9% FeCl3
• 100 µl 1% NaOH
• 200 µl formalin
Solution II:
• 2 g silver nitrate was dissolved in 10 ml distilled water
• 10% aqueous ammonia solution was added until the silver nitrate was dissolved. Approximately 2 ml.
Day 2: The bacteria were boosted in 5 ml LB-media to ensure that they were in the exponential growth phase when used for staining. They were diluted to approximately an OD550 of 1.
Preliminary bacteria work:
• The bacteria were centrifuged 15 min at 4000rpm
• The pellet was resuspended in LB-media to an OD550 of 3.
Staining protocol:
• A clean glass slide was used and Poly-L-Lysin was added onto a small area.
• 20 µl of the bacteria solution was plated on the slide and allowed to air dry.
• The slide was flooded with solution I and allowed to stand for 30 min before it was washed with distilled water.
• Solution II was added and was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and was washed with distilled water.
• The slide was flooded with a carbol-fuchsin solution and air-dried before washed with distilled water.
PBS were added to the area containing the bacteria and they were covered with a cover slide. The slides are now ready for examination under the microscope.

""There are 10 kinds of persons, one knows binary and the other does not know.""
Overview
Our software consists of several parts.
For the model, we developed a website Graphical User Interface named VisualSTEP that allows the user to adjust the parameters autonomously and it can display the simulation results of the model in real time. This can help others understand our model in depth and freely explore how our STEP system works.
For general biological experiments, we developed a user-friendly biological parameter calculator, which can be applied in several kinds of biology reactions, to minimize the burden of life science researchers calculating parameters before carrying out experiments. These calculators have been used in our wet lab and some experiments done by some third-party users for a while, and have gained a good reputation.
VisualSTEP
We obtained several conclusions which are closely related to the results of wet lab and can provide guidance for future experiments from our model, in which the effect of protease cleavage ability on dynamic range may be the most difficult part to understand. Hence, we develop the software VisualSTEP, now begin your own exploration!   You can adjust the parameters p1, p2 ,d1, d2 in our birth-death process model to find the effect of them on dynamic range. In general, p1>p2>0, d1>d2>0. Hence, the dynamic range is negatively correlated with protease cleavage ability.

SAFETY
Risk assessment plays a very important role in every scientific project, of course also for our iGEM project
. During the first week, we took part in a safety training about good laboratory practice. We further participated at a safety seminar before starting with the lab work. As horizontal gene transfer always represents a certain risk factor, we interviewed different experts to evaluate the safety assessment of our construct. The talks focused on the importance of incorporating deficiencies. After much discussions, we decided which strains are the safest variant for our planned experiment.
Due to our work in the lab, we had one person who was in charge for the safety precaution. Our “safety authorized person”             organized a training for all team members including fire drill and evacuation, how to behave in case of an accident             and how to render first aid. This safety training was also about good laboratory practice – correct waste disposal             and clean and decent laboratory work. To establish a good laboratory practice, everyone had to wear lab coats,             safety glasses and gloves. In addition to this lab safety training, we further had a safety seminar where all             people who worked at the institute participated. There we got used to all institute related safety questions.             Both safety seminars took place before starting with the lab work. The lab work was carried out within the             biosafety guidelines established by the Technical University of Graz. Due to our project, we took part at a skype             conference about safety organized by the University of Uppsala. Five teams from all over Europe participated at the conference .  The discussion was about general safety in the lab as well             as the  the potential risk of the designed constructs and what might happen, if they are released. One of the questions             was if we could anticipate how our GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) would behave, if released. We came to             the conclusion that there are no major security vulnerabilities, since we planned our construct according to             the iGEM safety guidelines. Aside from the safety precautions for the construct, we only used E. coli lab strains with             deficiencies such as BL21 DE3 Gold, XL1-blue,"
