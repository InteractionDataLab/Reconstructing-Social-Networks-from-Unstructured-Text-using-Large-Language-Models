Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#Game Discovery_-_-_TEXT.html,". A’s “undercover agents” quickly surround and eliminate B’s bacteria.
Discovery
The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within
    As we can see, A’s “undercover agents” quickly surround and eliminate B’s bacteria. This is also a good example of showing how important the strategy is.
    As the old saying in China goes, the easiest way to capture a fortress is from within. This strategy is also mentioned in the book Master Sun’s art of War, the most famous book on war in ancient China.This game tells the similar story. In history, we find that the seemingly indestructible empires were always ruined by troubles that arise from within but not outside.
    Don’t be afraid of playing chess in your enemies’ home! Maybe you are only one step away from success!
V Protracted Battle V.S. Blitzkrieg
    In this case, both sides own the same amount of bacteria. We can see it is interesting that A’s farmers grow fast firstly at first but are killed by B’ lethal warriors after a while.
Discovery
He who laughs last laughs best
    In the first 20 seconds, we can see that the amount of E.coli in side A is apparently larger. However, in the following 30 seconds, we can see that B’s warriors attack the E.coli from A and eventually get the victory. In this case, A’s farmers grow fast firstly but are killed faster by B’ lethal warriors after a while.
    We can often see similar conditions in real life. Someone maybe a nobody in his youth, but a somebody when his is old. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, many people might thought that Britain would probably be the winner as its military force seems stronger. However, after the 8-year war, American eventually won the war.
    He who laughs last laughs best. We should not lower our guard even if we are at an advantage.
VI Win the Battle Fast
    In this case, the amount of warriors in A is larger than the amount in B. One interesting thing about this situation is that warrior A stays very close to warrior B.  We can see that side A wins very fast.
Discovery
Destroy the core figures and the gang will collapse
    We can see that warrior A stays very close to warrior B at the beginning. Warrior B is the key figure in side B as farmer B does not threaten side B and we win the game if we can kill warrior B. In this case, warrior A kills warrior B first so that side A wins very"

Figure 5: Workflow 3, Retrieve simulatable CellML model of a motif.
Discussion:
Synthetic Biology is a very young field of study and still lacks the methodologies already established in other fields of engineering. To speed up the process of putting these methodologies in place, it makes sense to borrow from the other engineering disciplines. Systems biology already makes use of an e-Science approach using computerised workflows with great success. The approach serves to avoid tedious cutting and pasting of retrieved result from one software package to the next and thus saves significant amounts of time and effort to improve efficiency and accuracy.
Using the bottom-up approach to design, means that design starts with the most simple of identifiable parts, working its way up to a complex system composed of these parts (Cooling et al., 2010). This approach relates very closely to the development of software and fits in very well with a design and development approach similar to the software development life cycle. Thus, we proposed a Synthetic Biology life cycle which, apart from one phase, is almost identical to the SDLC.
The subtilin receiver model created by Cooling et al. (2010) provided all the virtual parts necessary for this research project. Creating a graphical representation of the model allowed us to identify the motifs which provided the first level of abstraction and encapsulation. The principles of abstraction and encapsulation were borrowed from software and serve the purpose of hiding the complexity of a design (Henderson-Sellers, 1997). Models consist not only of physical parts, but also need non-physical parts that glue the physical parts together for simulation purposes. These physical and non-physical parts provide the minimal parts required in the bottom-up approach. The rules for putting these parts together were captured in a database which allowed us to query the database for a series of parts in the correct order almost ready for simulation. Once the parts are extracted from the database according to the rules, programmatically extract the units that need to be specified in the model and the connections that need to be made between parts. A naming convention which allowed us to determine which variables from which parts need connecting. An alternative approach would be to extend the database to hold the information required for mapping parts and variables. This approach would simplify the creation of the CellML parts, but would complicate the design of the software and database.
With the database in place and populated we developed a RESTful web service that extracts the parts required for a requested motif, assemble the motif and returns it in CellML as a simulatable model. The service can return the CellML to the client, but it can also simulate the model"
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test_-_-_TEXT.html," kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."
Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," to facilitate, worsen and accelerate the development of some diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer, asthma, or chronicle rhinitis. Studies have shown multiple correlations between being in contact with air pollution and diseases that implicate inflammatory response or cell multiplication. Those correlations are statistical, and it is nearly impossible to prove scientifically the real impact of pollution over health, as it is only a co-factor (even if some in vitro tests are made). But the idea that both outdoor and indoor pollution impacts on health is generally admitted. A significant step is the 2016 OMS report, which quantify and affirm the correlation between air pollution and risks for human health.
The problem with air pollution is that it’s very difficult to make legislation on it. We have to inform, educate and act for a real change. We then asked him about the recent European decision about endocrine disruptors (The EU didn’t set a maximum concentration for endocrine disruptors), Dr Nhân Pham Thi explained to us that this decision is sad and difficult at the same time. Because those pollutants are only co-factors, there is no “truth” about them. You cannot know the limit between setting a realistic level for health and overly restrain the industry. With air pollution, there is always this contradiction between the qualitative approach (everyone agrees that it’s a problem) and the quantitative one (find precise, reliable experiment that shows the real impact of pollution is nearly impossible and would cost a lot).
City Hall of Paris
On September 11th, we presented our project to the City of Paris. Mrs. Caroline Daude, Transport Consultant, and Mr. Serge Orru, WWF France Advisor and Former Director, welcomed us to discuss our project. They were very interested in our project and in the fact that we are a multidisciplinary team. When we have our prototype, we will have to go back to City Hall, to discuss their support for the development of our project. Their remarks also helped us to develop our scenario. Together we discussed about how our product could integrate the Parisian ecosystem.
7th morning of the SEIQA college of experts"" (Health Environment and Indoor Air Quality)
On October 26th, two of our team members, Azéline and Juliette, participated in the working morning of the HEIQA panel of experts. They attended a series of conferences on indoor air quality and could interact with allergy and health specialists and people working on the development of indoor air cleaners. This conference confirmed and backed a conclusion we had formed: there is still too little work and studies on indoor air while it is the most dangerous and"
Alberta,2011,Team:Alberta#HumanPractices#Conferences_-_-_TEXT.html," was held at the University of Calgary and the three iGEM teams from Alberta attended. Don Chapman from Kent Imaging Inc. and Randy Thomson, entrepreneur in residence at NAIT were the keynote speakers. They taught us how to summarize our projects in a concise manner that explained them clearly and created interest in them. They emphasized the importance of protecting intellectual property in this technological day and age. Also stressed was the key in finding a need that was currently unmet and ensuring that that need would still be there in the future. We were also briefed on the concepts of marketing, valuation and funding.
All three groups gave rudimentary iGEM presentations after which we had breakout sessions with Lisa Brown, Dr. Wayne Materi and Dr. Prassana Bhomkar. In those sessions we discussed the science behind our projects, were given relevant pointers on how to tweak our projects and were given advice on how we could improve our presentations.
The weekend wrapped up by a talk from Cheryl Croucher, host of Innovation Anthology. She spoke to us about the importance of making our science accessible to the public. This is not only important because it allows people unfamiliar with our field to understand what we are doing, but also because it helps cultivate a culture of trust between the scientists and the general public. The second AITF conference was key to the development of our iGEM projects and challenged us both on group and personal levels.
ISMOS-3
ISMOS 3 was held at the University of Calgary from July 13 to 15, 2011. ISMOS3, the third International Symposium on Applied Microbiology and Molecular Biology in Oil Systems, was a conference where scientists from around the world came to explain their research in microorganisms related to coal, oil, and the oil sands. Two students from the team Alberta iGEM team, Murray and Kayla, attended.
There were many topics that were brought up that were interesting and relevant. The first was challenges in oil sands development where the key issues pertaining to tailings ponds were discussed. Many scientists were trying to assess the huge diversity of microorganisms and enormous number of operational taxonomic units in relatively benign and hostile environments found at sources of coal and oil. To do this they used both 16S RNA sequencing and the determination of the presence of sequences pertaining to specific classes of enzymes such as those involved in methanogenesis. There were even scientists who were characterizing the enzymes found in the extremophiles and trying to determine if they were of medical, scientific or industrial importance. The roles that microorganisms play in souring of oil wells, as well as the"

Survey Results
In the survey before the presentation, the results indicate that out of the 200 Wego high school students, most of them were neither familiar with iGEM nor the benefits of algae. After the presentation, the results from our second survey suggest that students have learned a lot more from the presentation given. In addition to understanding different components of iGEM, they are now more aware of the underlying advantages of age. Most importantly, as a result of our presentation, Wego Bilingual High School now intends to create their own iGEM team for the upcoming year.
Survey before the presentation:
Fig 1: Most of the students had never heard iGEM. Only 6% students have heard iGEM.
Fig 2: The answer for the question is Taiwan – only 31% students know that their country has the highest carbon emission around the world. This shows that more awareness has to be drawn towards Taiwan citizens in acknowledging the importance of alternative energy use.
Fig 3: The answer is 19.6 kg per day – nearly 80% students chose the wrong answer. This result also shows that most people are not aware the scope of carbon footprint and threat it has imposed on us.
Survey after the presentation:
Fig 4: 97% students(74% extremely clear + 31% clear) clear on advantages of algae after our presentation.
Fig 5: 95% students think there more research should be done on algae. That is, most students know the importance of algae research on energy after our presentation.
Fig 6: 97% students are more familiar with the field of synthetic biology after our presentation.
Fig 7: 50% students are interested in pursuing synthetic biology. This data shows that, as a result to our presentation, we have inspired students to engage in this competition and studying synthetic biology. As a result, Wego Bilingual High School now intends to build their own 2018 iGEM team for the following year.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have"

Finally, I began working on the iGEM articles for media purposes and for our meeting with Leanne next week. I should have that completed by this weekend. Tomorrow, I'll discuss my gel with Thane and Sonja and decide where to go from here in the lab. For marketing, I'll continue to contact companies (mostly via email) for sponsorship for this year and next year.

Testing...Testing
Today, a generic avatar was created (aptly named Generic Lennie) that was in a separate group that had access to our island. He was used to test each area on our sim. We don't want visitors to be able to move, objects, change script and make new permanent objects. For the synthetic Kingdom everything was in order:
All objects were not modifiable
Generic Lennie was able to move the vitamins, Bad Guy/Champion cells, quorum sensing bacteria and oil clean-up bacteria, which is ok because they have a self-destruct script inside
GFP station drag and drop worked!
This means that the Synthetic Kingdom is unofficially done!
VICKI
...And some more work on the modelling front
Chinee and I met with Afshin and Iman to align our models with each other. The SimBiology and Membrane Computing reactions were subsequently updated, so that we are now modelling the same thing where applicable. The only major differences lie in that the membrane computing model accounts for LuxS (which the SimBiology model omits) and the membrane computing model accounts for AI-2 molecules leaving the cell and going to another one (while ours just includes a reverse reaction for AI-2 binding to LuxPQ, as we are only modelling performance in one cell).
I helped Chinee download Latex and will provide a lesson on how to use that platform
I looked up degradation rates for GFP:LVA mRNA
Our sensitivity analysis crashes with the addition of more reactions to our model. I worked on fixing that, to little avail. I will try again tomorrow.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the Protoplastation and Tranformation protocol .
20/7/2018
Boxes: Regardless of mycelia and media volume the brown rice inoculated with A. oryzae were crumbly and the mycelia had only grown on the stop of the brick.  The white rice boxes (also with A. oryzae) were different according to volume of liquid media added to the rice. The less media, the sturdier the brick was to pressure from hands.  Adding glucose to S. commune boxes with saw dust did not make a difference. The brick is still very crumbly.
Baking of boxes: Rice boxes baked at 90°C and checked every 15 minutes. After the fire 15 minutes the paper surrounding the brick was very wet.  After discussion a new plan was formed: Rice is cooked when in water and surroundings are very hot, so we try to cook them quickly at high temperatures. Therefore: One rice box is baked at 90°C for two hours and then 200°C for one hour. After that the brick is baked 70°C O/N.  The other rice brick is only baked at 70°C O/N. Saturday they will be taken out and photographed. See designated photo entry for photos of the bricks.
Small bricks:  We have received ice cube trays to make smaller bricks, giving us the opportunity to make more bricks quicker and even different bricks at the same time.  First small bricks are made with spores and different ratios of saw dust, white rice and coffee grounds to see how they work together. To avoid contamination every other well was inoculated instead of each well. See picture.
Drylab Overview
This week Nicolai has come back. He assessed, based on the team's meetings with DTU Byg last week, that manufacturing metal inoculation boxes for Wetlab would become far too big of a task since it was unearthed that we would need over 100 boxes. It was decided that we order silicone ice-cube trays instead, both for us to focus on other pressing matters and for the consistency of the cubes. He also started work on a mission architecture including a design the brick for us to construct a martian hut. We obtained foam samples through a contact from last week. Hannah and Lau assisted the Myco-lab subgroup since they were struggling with their workload. At the end of the week, Nicolai began working on a DIY hydraulic press . We weren't going to be able to use the DTU byg machinery before a lab technician would return from his holiday in week 32. Mathias"
Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," previous m-dimensional vector. Now, every Amino acid is encoded as a concatenation of the two embeddings with a resulting vector of size m + k.
The secondary structure information may be incorporated directly as a result of our Secondary Structure Predictor model or - for proteins with known structures- can be provided directly as additional input. However, the latter can only be of use for model evaluation as, in practice, we are more interested to predict structures de novo.
The next step is to create a representation for every pair of Amino acids in order to create the full N x N tensor. For a pair (x,y) of Amino acids we concatenate their respective embeddings thus creating a new vector of size 2 * (m + k). As an alternative, we can perform an element-wise operation (e.g. multiplication) between the two distinct residue embeddings and maintain the resulting pair embedding dimension to m + k.
Now that we have constructed our tensor, we add several 2-dimensional convolutional layers to scan every Amino acid pair on our map for contacts. When training is complete, the resulting map is compared to the native contact map by specifying a probability threshold that distinguishes contacts from non-contacts.
Recreating proteins in three dimensions - TERTIARY STRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION
The final step of the process is to retrieve the 3d structure from the predicted contact map. To achieve that, we feed the contact map to FT-COMAR ], a tool that is able to recreate the tertiary structure by reading a contact map with values 1 (contact), 0 (no contact), -1 (uncertain) [ 2 ]. In our implementation, a contact is declared uncertain if the predicted probability is between 0.3 and 0.6. The resulting 3-dimensional information is written to a file that we can load to iCin3D to visualize and interact with the reconstructed structure.
What have we learned? - PRELIMINARY RESULTS
Due to limited access to computational resources, we were not able to train models of adequate performance to assess the changes in FimH tertiary structure or visualize the estimated structure of Apoptin in a reliable way. Although the models' performance were monotonously improving we could not reach convergence before the wiki freeze, as we were restricted by shallow architectures and small mini-batch sizes.
For example, for the Secondary Structure Predictor we obtained a 27% Q8 accuracy using a relatively shallow 2-layer architecture. Q8 accuracy measures the percent of residues for which 8-state secondary structure is correctly predicted. For the Contact Map Predictor, we set a probability"

--JR--Nano-dropped the Promoter plasmids that were recently purified. Almost all of the plasmids were over 100ng/ul concentration.
--CS-- We are still trying to get ahold of people for P. aeruginosa PAO1. Yesterday Bri sent the guy from www.pseudomonas.com an email and today Dr. Grose sent him one. Hopefully we will get a response from him in the near future about how we can go about getting our hands on some of that bacteria. Besides that we worked on the promoter library we have. We transformed the remaining plasmid from J23100, J23108, and J23110 into DH5α and plated that bacteria according to the protocol that we have. We also used the NanoDrop to measure the DNA concentrations of the plasmids that had already been isolated from the plasmid preps that we did as a class. All of the plasmids had pretty good concentrations and 260/280 ratios.
--BRK--Helped with nano dropping the promoter plasmid concentrations and received a response from the IGEM Part Request department that the EreB plasmid would be added to the 2014 BioBrick.
May 7, 2014
--CS-- Today we planned on doing plasmid preps for the J23100, J23108, and J23110 bacteria that we cloned yesterday but only the J23110 bacteria ended up growing and expressing RFP (which is the plasmid that we actually already have isolated— somebody had temporarily misplaced it). J23108 had a few colonies grow but none express RFP, and J23100 had nothing grow at all, so we decided to just refrigerate them and see what Desi thinks about them tomorrow.

--CS-- We were planning on doing plasmid preps today for J23108 but realized when we got here that we needed to inoculate the bacteria overnight in order to do those. So Julie picked a colony and grew some bacteria up from it and will take care of the plasmid prep tomorrow (Bri and I will both be gone).

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most harmful types of air poisoning around the world. CO gas is mostly released from the internal combustion of engines as well as the use of fuels such as wood and coal. Since CO is highly produced in urban areas, it presents a big danger for any living organism. The aim of our project is to convert CO into CO2 biologically, which then can be converted into oxygen with photosynthesis by photoautotrophic organisms. In order to achieve this, we plan to construct a biofilm containing the enzyme Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH). With the production of this biofilm, it may be possible to obtain a biological filter that can fix the ratio of CO and CO2 present in the environment. We also try to integrate a kill switch, previously developed by Berkeley, to our system for safer use of our biofilm as well as a cell limiter for better characterization of the biofilm activity

At the same time it proves that there is only one single extremum of $\sigma(\phi)$ for positive $\phi$, and we already know that this is a minimum from examining the graph.

Week 5: 7/11/10 through 7/17/10
Because the light sensor pieces are not cutting efficiently, we are working on digesting RBS in a more effective method
1. Digest RBS w/ buffer 3 & Pst
2. Acetate precipitate
3. Digest RBS w/ buffer 2 & Spe
We are doing this because PST is only 75% active in buffer 2  but is only 100% active in buffer 3
Proceeded to digest parts: B0034 (3) (Spe), I15008 (Xba & Pst), I15009 (Xba & Pst), I13453 (Spe & Pst), B0015 (Eco & Xba)
And the bands showed quite well
This led to the successful ligation of RBS w/ I15008, RBS w/ I15009, and I15010 with B0015
Ligations for the ON switch and the initiator continue to fail several more times, but more knowledge and insight is gained.  What is the cause for the failed ligations?  Perhaps it is the low concentration of the gel purification product?  We will nanodrop our miniprep and every step of the way to figure out where the concentration is being lost.  Are pieces not being cut?  We noticed a bunch of colonies on our vector controls.  Are we doing something wrong in the experiment?  We will run some tests next week.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," sell the phosphorus? - We would sell the recovered phosphorus together with the bacteria in which it is trapped as fertilizer to wholesalers for a standard market price.
3. In what way is Phosphostore better than the current biological phosphorus removal processes?
Firstly, Phosphostore would not require the anaerobic zone currently necessary in the EBPR process. Its current use, namely providing the phosphorus accumulating organisms with volatile fatty acids for energy accumulation purposes, would not be necessary as our bacteria are genetically modified specifically with the idea of phosphorus accumulation in mind. As such, WWTPs could save a lot of space. Secondly, as the anaerobic zone would not be required, the time needed for WWT process would be shortened. Finally, Phosphostore is more environmentally friendly as it facilitates the recycling of phosphorus, which is emerging as an increasingly valuable agricultural resource.
Long-term Growth Potential
We have identified three trends which indicate Phosphostore’s long-term growth potential is enormous. Firstly, more and more countries around the world are recognising eutrophication as a big threat to sustainable water supply; as a result, governments are adopting increasingly more stringent limits to nutrients concentrations in discharged water (UN Website). This increases the demand for stable, efficient and cheap phosphorus removal methods such as Phosphostore. Secondly, in the recent years, newly built WWTPs have been steadily choosing biological nutrient removal methods over chemical alternatives, which further increases the size of our target market (Tanyi, 2006). Thirdly, in the coming decades, the reserves of phosphate rock, the primary source of phosphorus used in the production of agricultural fertilisers, will steadily deplete, thus increasing the price of phosphorus recycled using our Phosphostore technology (Cordel et al., 2009).

I was finishing my third year in the Master Program in Biotechnology at NTNU in Trondheim, when I joined the iGEM team. My education has so far consisted of courses in molecular biology and chemistry. I have now moved to Denmark where I have started on my master degree in Biotechnology at the University of Copenhagen.
I joined the iGEM team with some knowledge of the principles behind synthetic biology, but I knew little about what kind of methods and techniques that were used. I feel now that I have learned a lot, both theoretically and practically, from this project and I´m really glad I got the opportunity to be part of NTNU´s iGEM team 2014.
Ronja Hesthammer
I joined the NTNU iGEM team as I was finishing my Master’s degree in Biotechnology. My specialization was biopolymer chemistry, however, my thesis was on characterizing of enzymes produced by micro-organisms in oil reservoirs. I have now moved to Bergen, a different city in Norway, and started my Ph.D. at the University of Bergen (UiB). My research here focuses on tetrahydrobiopterin as a key factor in the pathophysiology of diving.
The project our team chose to work with is of great importance in our society today, and I’m very glad to be a part of it. I have gotten to practice several methods during this iGEM participation, and learned some new ones. It has also been very exciting to work with the rest of the team members of our small, but extremely nice team.

WPI_Worcester,2016,Team:WPI Worcester#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ACG reporters efficiency confirmation by flow cytometry. The difference between the wild type and mutant reporter is consistent with the microscopy data.
The wild type used for this experiment was a sample of HEK293T cells that was not transfected. The data collected from the flow cytometry showed that the ATG eGFP cells had slightly higher levels of fluorescence when compared to the positive control. It was also noted that the wild type cells had slightly higher levels of fluorescence than the negative control. However, the slight difference and the percent of error for the wild type indicated that the wild type and the negative control most likely had about the same levels of fluorescence.
WT/PTC β-globin eGFP Reporters
The validation of the β-globin reporters followed the same procedures as the ATG/ACG reporters. The β-globin reporters had a similar design to the ATG/ACG reporters. With the β-glbin, the mutated version had a premature stop codon just before an exon junction in the globin sequence that was fused to the eGFP. The ""functional"" version of the globin reporter also had the globin sequence fused to the eGFP sequence, but without the premature stop codon.
Figure 6a & 6b: WT β-globin eGFP reporters, HEK293T cells, green/red fluorescence, 100X. The two images are of the same field.
In Figure 6a, fewer glowing cells are seen, and the fluorescence is visibly weaker than the ATG eGFP reporter. However, the PTC β-globin reporter, in Figure 7a, showed even less expression of the GFP. This difference between the WT and PTC reporters was consistently seen in all replicates of the experiment.
Figure 7a & 7b: PTC β-globin eGFP reporters, HEK293T cells, green/red fluorescence, 100X. The two images are of the same field.
According to the data (Figure 8), the wild type β-globin reporter showed a much lower level of expression (14.77% of positive control) compared to the ATG reporter. Therefore, the difference in the level of expression between the WT and PTC reporter is much smaller, which means lower reporter efficiency. The standard error, however, indicates that the difference that is present is very valid, and the premature termination codon is likely to have an actual impact on the expression of the GFP.

XY-Stage
To verify this we ran a variety of different single output configurations on a 96 well plate, using color and fluorescence as markers.
We created two initial configurations on the 96-well plate using colored water as a preliminary run. The first is of two simple blue circles and the second is the phrase “igem”. The sample volume in each well was 0.0479 mL.
After testing the system with colored water, we ran a single output microfluidic chip with GFP to obtain quantitative measurements. We created an output design of a smiley-face and verified the selection locations by running the plate in a plate reader. As shown in the diagram, the GFP mixture is appropriately dispensed onto the well-plate.
Fully Automated
Automation for TERRA is key because it reduces human error and frees up time for the researcher. Manual selection between outputs on the TERRA Adapter reduces the efficiency of the overall run because it not only requires the user to be on standby but introduces variable pressure differentials on chip during actuation. To automate TERRA, a control syringe system is used to select and redirect outputs on the TERRA Adapter, which is especially important for multi-output chips. To verify that TERRA is fully automated, we ran multi-output microfluidic chips. However, due to manufacturing issues with our microfluidic chips and lack of time, we could not run a multi-output chip on TERRA.

Retrospection of Survey
With a deeper research on treatment methods, the feasibility was verified at experimental level. But it still had a long way to go before it can be applied clinically. With our first survey results and some questions, we went to the hospital again, and conducted another questionnaire survey and interviewed some residents (Figure 9).
Preparation work:
Respondents: patients and doctors with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient of rheumatology department
Sample size: 30 doctors and 80 patients
Procedure:
1. List a questionnaire for patients and doctors (Avoid patients’ and doctors’ personal information).
2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
3. Contact relevant departments of the hospital.
4. Determine the process and the time.
Figure 9. Go to the hospital for in-depth investigation again
According to our plan, we came to Nanjing First Hospital and Nanjing Gulou Hospital for a questionnaire survey. The majority of patients showed great interests in our innovative therapy and explored the specific way of using this therapy after a conversation with them. Some patients were confident in our treatment and encouraged us to make more efforts in getting this therapy into clinical as soon as possible (Video 1). According to the survey, most of them have suffered from RA for more than 5 years. It was gratifying to note that more than half of the patients said they were willing to try Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy while others showed some uncertainty (Figure 10). But we believe this therapy will be more recognized with more future research.
Figure 10. The personal willingness of patients to try syn-Notch CAR-T cell therapy
Video 1. We have a deep conversation with patient
As for our survey with the doctors, most of the them have worked for more than 5 years (Figure 11), and they believed that the current drug treatment had shortcomings like severe side effects, a high recurrence rate and a chronic medication use (Figure 12), while Syn- Notch CAR Treg cell therapy had a more specific target and may show less side effects (Figure 13), which surpassed the existing treatment. Its safety was also further recognized by healthcare professionals. However, there are many problems remaining to be solved before it can actually applied clinically(Figure14), such as a limitation on large-scale production, quality control standards, etc.

SuperCell - the Synthetic Biology supermarket is a collaborative science and art project of the Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology of the Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg and the Media Art Department of the Bauhaus University Weimar. It all started with a simple request. Working in the context of bioart, the interest of the media artists was to get in contact with an experienced player in the field of synthetic biology. Through the iGEM website they learned about the successful participation of the Heidelberg iGEM team and decided to contact them. Prof. Ursula Damm and her students were delighted to find their request answerd by an invitation from the Team of Prof. Roland Eils to Heidelberg, where we had a very friendly and open informal meeting in february 2010. For the Heidelberg team it was obvious that through Synthetic Biology many innovative products will emerge with a big cultural impact on our every day life. The art/design-team Weimar on the other hand was curious to know how new lifeforms could be imagined and engineered. Further meetings in Heidelberg and Weimar followed throughout the year.
The interdisciplinary group discussed possible relations between art and science, presented their works, and -most importantly- found ways of collaboration transcending mere disciplinary borders. In Heidelberg the team started on a wet lab project soon, in Weimar the semester´s topic was Synthetic Biology.
During our collaboration the art students got to know about the highly organized workflow of lab-work, the relation between simulation and formal abstraction and security matters of Synthetic Biology. The science students were introduced to artistic approaches and methods of creating representations of ideas and products.
These events created the basis for our collective iGEM project, defining that this would be a project were scientists and artists work together closely and feed each other with ideas and details. This included the process of finding the topic and a playground to evolve and present our ideas in form of a supermarket. From there on the team met continuously on workshops where progress on single products, on overall design, big things and details of the project were discussed.  Eventually the collective brainstormings on products to fill the online shop, as well as producing video-comments, texts and images promoted further vivid exchange. All these ""close encounters"" allowed the teams to profit from each other not only in the preproduction and theoretical implications of"

For example, Hara et al. showed that autophagy was important not only for adaptation                                     to starvation, but also for preventing degeneration of neurons. They demonstrated it                                     by knocking out Atg5, a protein involved in autophagy, specifically in neurons using                                     Cre/LoxP recombination system, as its complete knockout is lethal to the organism.

SSR has been very useful for inserting genes into designated loci of a genome. This is more                                     advantageous than strategies based on homologous recombination (HR), in that 1) it is                                     more efficient , 2) concatenation effect [2,3] can be eliminated, and 3) selective marker                                     can be removed with ease. Such properties have been exploited into advanced techniques                                     such as recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) and serine integrase recombinational                                     assembly (SIRA), where multiple genes can be introduced and exchanged rapidly.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT#HW3_-_-_TEXT.html," In normal conditions it’s in liquid state.It will solidify with exposure of 320nm to 380nm wavelength UV light  We made the chip using the material NOA 81. The material is normally liquid, and when subjected to UV light from the 320nm to 380nm band, the material is quickly cured to form a solid with good hardness and toughness[4]. According to this characteristic, we can use soft lithography method to achieve the production of the chip . The reason why we used NOA81 as the material of our chip is not just it’s UV curing characteristics, the light transmittance of this material is also taken into consideration. The transmittance provided by the manufacturer is shown in Figure 1.3. At the same time, we also designed a verification experiment for the light transmission of the chip(can be found in demonstrate section )
 
Working Process
 Briefly,our chip went through following process between fabrication and finishing detection:
  ①:Injecting magnetic beads to Chamber 1,then freeze-drying the liquid.
  ②:Injecting engineering bacteria to Chamber 2,then freeze-drying the liquid.Then the chip is ready to use.
  ③:When needing detection,taking the chip,connecting the peristaltic pump and injecting a volume of sample and culture medium mixture.
  ④:After the reaction is complete, the peristaltic pump pumps the reaction solution into the chamber with negative pressure. The biochemical reaction takes place and enters the subsequent detection process

Introduction
 In our project, the chip is the carrier of biological reactions, its most basic function is to provide a growth environment for engineering bacteria. In order to be used smoothly as a biological carrier in our project, the chip needs to meet the following conditions:
  ①:The freeze-drying and recovery of engineering bacteria can be finished in the chip.And the engineering bacteria needs to keep a relatively high activity after recovery process.
  ②:The engineering bacteria can survive in the chip for the short period between recovery and finishing a detection.
 
Experiments
 In order to characterize the biological properties of the chip, we conducted a series of experiments on the basis of measurement of OD600 and the fluorescence intensity:

They also have special service team formed by individuals and authorized to develop activities on their own.
Two Cups of Water Sign Language: They set up sign language class at Shenzhen Centre Book Store, one of the biggest book store in Shenzhen, to teach people for free. According to their person in charge, people with hearing loss account for 1/10 to 1/5 who participate in learning.
Shenzhen Ear Caring Plan: This organization provide hearing aids and Cis for child with hearing loss, aiming to let them go to school and receive education just the same as normal healthy child.
We also cooperate with Southern University of Science and Technology Volunteer (SUV), a charity group organized by students in SUSTech. They have arranged activities to help people with visual disorder and their work is very impressive. Helping with hearing-impaired people could be the next thing they plan to do.
Activities
Commonweal organizations
After collecting and analyzing our questionnaires, we found that most people lack the experience of communicating with severe hearing-impaired people. However, they showed great enthusiasm on learning more about them and caring them as possible.
We contacted some charity organizations which regularly provide lectures and information for the public. For example, Two Cups of Water Sign Language set up courses every week in Shenzhen Center Book Store for people to learn simple sign language.
We think the biggest problem of people with hearing loss is caused by communication difficult. If normal people can learn basic sign language, they can have more contact with hearing-impaired people and thus discrimination and prejudice on this population can be largely decreased. Further, it is the simplest way to make people with hearing loss feel comfortable in this society.
The questionnaire also shows many people lack basic knowledge about hearing loss. Hence, we printed booklets and also set up several public media accounts to make the public focus on things about hearing loss people including news, scientific education, welfare, etc.
In the future, we plan to join these organizations and call for more people to participate. Also, we recommended SUV to collaborate with them and create more chances for SUSTecher to help people with hearing loss.
Also, due to the considerable people who showed their interests to learn sign language during our investigation, we will propagandize sign language teaching on our social media constantly.
Company cooperation
Notably, in the questionnaire, some interviewees suggested that there could be some applications (APPs) on cellphone, functioning to simplify the communication between normal people and hearing-impaired people, and thus make people with hearing loss convenient"

The whole operon is under the regulation of an ITPG-inducible promoter. It includes a RBS and a terminator. The operon it’s originally from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus but adapted to E. coli by P. Silver and D. Savage (“Modularity of a carbon-fixing protein organelle” Walter Bonacci, Poh K. Teng, Bruno Afonso, Henrike Niederholtmeyer, Patricia Grob, Pamela A. Silver and David F. Savage) in which they took the original operon pHnCB and added a tenth gene, csoS1D, located just outside the core operon and show to be necessary for the correct assembly of the carboxysome.
The pHnCBS1D plasmid was provided by David Savage (Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley).
Backbone brick
Description: This composite part corresponds to the low-copy backbone vector pSB4K5 with the pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ) and a RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). This will allow an easier assembly and expression for testing coding sequence as its expression is under an arabinose inducible promoter.
This part was constructed with a mutation in the Prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”) which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly.

The European
Experience
In Paris 2/07/2016
The iGEM IONIS team and the iGEM Evry team worked together to accomplish a great gathering of the European teams: an European Jamboree ! We organized over a week-end a symposium with more than 150 people that could assist to conferences and expose their projects, and create great network through the iGEM competition. We also wanted to give all European teams the opportunity to live an incredible weekend, by coming to Paris and being able to live the “science dream” in the city of light !

Cryo cultures of strains 168, BP233, BP234 were prepared with 90% LB medium and 10% DMSO. The cells were frozen and stored at -80°C.
03.05.18
Strains BP233, BP235 and 168 (WT) were incubated in 4 ml LB medium for 4 h at 37°C and 220 rpm. 2 ml of the culture was harvested, and the cells were washed in 1xC-salts and then resuspended in 300 µl 1xC-salts. BP233 and BP235 were plated on CS-glucose with and without 10 mM glyphosate.

As seen in this figure, both strains grow well on CS-glucose without glyphosate. Strain BP233 also forms a lawn on plates with 10mM glyphosate, while the wildtype does not form a lawn, but single colonies, which could be suppressor mutants. This leads to the hypothesis that GltT, which is a glutamate transporter, transports glyphosate into the cell. The strain BP235 was not stable, so it was constructed again!

During this summer we collaborated with other iGEM teams:
1. We sent a soil sample to the NRP-UEA-Norwich team .
2. We participated to the ""Bricks of Knowledge"" project of the Copenhagen team : Our video , Copenhague explicative video
3. We met with the Evry team to discuss our respective projects. We met the Evry's team during an afternoon in August. During this meeting, we presented the various aspects of our respective projects : the scientific part, the human practice part and the modeling part. After each presentation we debated, asked questions, and proposed solutions to improve the other team's project. At the end of the day we  had a big 4 o'clock tea.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," built with well characterized transcription factors (like OxyR for hydrogen peroxide) but you can dig for ‘your favorite’ transcription factor in databases such as DBD or RegPrecise where there is a huge amount of predicted transcription factors that can be used to develop biosensors for ‘your favorite’ compound.
Design & Construction
Transcription Factors and Promoters
In order to build a functional transcription factor based biosensor, able to assess ‘our favorite’ compound D-Psicose, we needed a transcription factor and an inducible promoter. Searching databases like RegPrecise, we found the PsiR of Rhizobiales. PsiR is a predicted LacI family transcription factor with high affinity for D-Psicose. This implies that PsiR is potentially capable of binding a consensus sequence in the promoter region and preventing transcription of the regulated promoters in the absence of D-Psicose, in a similar manner to the way LacI does in the absence of allolactose (or the synthetic IPTG).
PsiR occurs naturally in four different Rhizobiales species (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Sinorhizobium fredii, Sinorhizobium meliloti) where it regulates an operon while also self-regulating its expression. In all these species, the genetic context is very similar: the PsiR gene precedes the operon (that starts with the PsiA gene) and is in the opposite direction (as an example, see this region in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens genome ). Thus, the promoter regions of PsiA and PsiR genes are overlapping and face the opposite direction.
Using the BPROM webserver , we identified the -10 and -35 boxes that are in very close proximity to the predicted PsiR binding sites (the full annotations can be found in Parts Registry pages of these promoters ( BBa_K2448010 , BBa_K2448011 , BBa_K2448012 , BBa_K2448013 , BBa_K2448014 , BBa_K2448015 ). Knowing this, we extracted the 400 bp sequence upstream of PsiA and PsiR genes in each species in order to get 8 different biosensors theoretically psicose sensitive.
Since PsiR is a LacI family transcription factor, we chose to engineer a well-known LacI regulated promoter, pTacI, in order to make a minimal but strong psicose inducible promoter [4]. With the help of databases and literature, we identified a 20 bp consensus sequence on"

Conclusion:
Transformation of pDR111+message into E. coli MC1061 appeared to be successful. Transformation efficiency was low, only 12 colonies were obtained, but 4 colonies seemed to be correct clones. And those were colonies 1, 8, 10 and 11 (see Figure 5). Correct sizes of the bands were obtained: 572 bp. Those colonies were grown overnight (see cell culture protocol ) from pre-glycerol stocks made for colony PCR (see colony PCR protocol ).

Glycerol stocks ) were made and plasmid isolation was performed (see Mini prep protocol ).  Firstly, concentration of the plasmids was measured on Nanodrop. Secondly, plasmids were sent for sequencing and then stored at -20°C.
Sequencing:
Plasmids pDR111+message from colonies 1, 8, 10 and 11 were sent for sequencing )  with the sequencing primer Gb_insert_F2 ( (see primer list) ).
Conclusion:
Sequencing results showed that cloning of message sequence into integration plasmid pDR111 was successful. However just sequencing result 249 (Figure 9) has 100 % homology when compared to the reference (message sequence). Others have some bases missing or bases are not matching, it could be due to faulty sequencing. See sequencing results below.

NCHU team want to use eco-friendly biological process to remove dioxin which is a group of toxic chemical compounds and harmful to the environment. They had found a company in Shanghai called “Dajing”, which is relevant to their project. So we helped them to interview the manager of Dajing Company, collected suggestions on their project and answers for their question.
During our visit to Dajing Biotechnology Company, the manager emphasized the significance of NCHU’s project and introduced us how Dajing deals with the similar toxic chemical compounds from an industrial perspective. Besides, he provided useful advice as well as detailed answers to the questions that NCHU team asked.
After the visit, we collected interview materials and sent to the NCHU team. They followed some advice from the interview materials and improved their project.

And then you are taking antibiotics for other stuff, not for trachoma but for your cold, for your respiratory infection, but that treats more combating the chlamydia infection, too. So that is definitely true. If you have kids who might always have trachoma but get antibiotics for something else should have less trachoma.
Daniel C.:
Well, thank you Jeremy for that very insightful interview.
Dr. Keenan:
There are lots of trials that use chlamydia as their primary outcome for a clinical trial for trachoma. I am happy to send you a few papers. Basically, there are three big trachoma groups in the world. There is our group, there is the London School of Hygiene and then there is John Hopkins. All of these groups have recently done clinical trials with chlamydia. PCR for chlamydia is basically the standard outcome for any sort of clinical trial for trachoma. I think you mentioned that you have a hard time finding estimates. There definitely are estimates at least from Indonesia, Ethiopia, Tanzania, the Gambia and lots of other places.
Daniel C.:
Thanks a lot. We are definitely going to look into that. We actually have the means and the finances to go to Africa. Because we were thinking about seeing the conditions that the doctors and the NGOs are working for ourselves. And we wanted to ask if you have any contacts there that you can relegate us to.
Dr. Keenan:
Yeah. What are you interested in doing?
Daniel C.:
We would be very interested in to talk with public health professionals. Maybe NGOs working in the field, doing clinical trials and maybe with local doctors, if there are any from that specific country. In the clinics or outside in the field, where they are treating patients who have trachoma.
Kai:
So one aim would be to get information for us and for our project and the second aim would be to produce a small documentary to raise awareness and to show at the competition.
Daniel C.:
At that competition 3000 people are going to show up and they are mainly scientists or future scientist, students like us, who will be scientists in a few years. We want to show them not only the theoretical thought behind the whole application, but also the real-life- situation, the status quo and the main target of the application.

Making constructs to express putative α-glucan acyltransferases in E. coli
AIM:
To ligate four putative α-glucan acyltransferase genetic sequences: MAO , Rv3030 , Rv3034c , and Rv3037c into the standard pSB1C3 plasmid vector with and without an a LacI promoter.
METHOD:
We digested DNA components (putative acyltransferase sequences, pSB1C3 with LacI promoter and RBS) according to the restriction digest protocol with the relevant restriction enzymes to create compatible ends. The digestions were then run on an agarose gel and gel extracted to yield the digested DNA components. These were ligated and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. Putative clones were screened by colony PCR and liquid cultures of colonies with the correctly-sized inserts were prepared. The plasmids were purified by plasmid prep and sent for sequencing.
RESULTS:
The resulting plasmids were MAO with LacI promoter and RBS , MAO , Rv3030 with IPTG-inducible promoter , Rv3030 , Rv3034c with LacI promoter and RBS, Rv3034c , Rv3037c with LacI promoter and RBS and Rv3037c .

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"4 thoracotomies for benign lesions performed. Compared to the control, the false positive rate was a 3.1 times larger and patients were 4 times as likely to have an unnecessary thoracotomy. [2] With the risks of complications from diagnostic procedures, radiation exposure and effect on quality of life, there are major downsides to such a screening method. [4]
There is a lack of compelling evidence to support LDCT screening for lung cancer - however screening represents one of the most realistic prospects to reduce NSCLC mortality rates aside from reducing the numbers of smokers. With frequency and length of screening optimized to reduce false positives, LDCT may yet prove effective. [5]
Screening is also effective in many other cancers. However, the biology of the cancer has a strong effect on whether screening is likely to be useful. Screening would be redundant for indolent cancers - and treatment-related morbidities may mean it has a net negative impact. Screening is also ineffective for cancers which develop very rapidly, as they they are likely to present between screens. Therefore, very frequent screening is needed for high risk population groups but preventative action is usually more beneficial. [6]
Screening has a bias to detect indolent cancers, leading to overdiagnosis - often cancers detected will never become symptomatic or their progression would be so slow that the patient will die of other causes first. [7] Depending on organ type, indolent cancers account for 15-75% of those detected. Therefore, it is vital that a new method of screening can differentiate between indolent and progressive cancers.
MiRNAs have the potential to achieve this - it has been shown that a combination of miRNAs can identify NSCLC in asymptomatic individuals with 80% accuracy and  differentiate benign nodules from NSCLC tumors. [8] This would avoid the problems that accompany unnecessary further testing. Even if diagnosis still took place using LDCT screening, an effective way of measuring the relevant miRNAs (that our sensor could potentially provide) would be vital to classify a tumor and reducing overdiagnosis.
Our screening method could produce massive increases in the detection of stage I cancers with far lower cost and greater objectivity than current methods. It also could reduce the rates of overdiagnosis. Furthermore, the results of our test could conclusively rule out the possibility of cancer in certain individuals preventing the need for further investigation.
Benefits of our system
The problems with current diagnostic methods were also identified by doctors who completed our survey. Many patients have to undergo these tests - as there is no other way to rule"

Armed with only his quick wit and his two “hand gunz” (see picture to the right/left) has he been able to survive day to day in the rolling coulees he calls home. Some say that his smile has the power to scare packs of coyotes away while still able to lure deer into his striking range. While he has given up the solitary life of a rogue cowboy for life in a research lab he has not given up his true identity as the lone ranger in these parts. His dreams include designing and building a synthetic biology project with space application such that he may one day become a space cowboy. Seriously, he does want to invent and/or help invent a space synthetic biology project!

Hello world! My name is Jennifer and I have currently only slogged through three full years of my major, Biochemistry. I have just recently been sucked into this whirling vortex of a world known as iGEM due to many persuasive arguments and have not yet lived to regret such a decision (which is a good thing). Hopefully the science and technology, that will further our lives in the very near future, will keep the remainder of the summer and the beginnings of autumn refreshing and fascinating. In the mean time while I am not slaving away in the lab I will occupy my time with catching up on sleep that I have missed during my time as a real student of the University of Lethbridge. It’s a pleasure to introduce myself and hopefully new friendships will emerge in the nearby future. Peace out … for now.

The Amp plates made the day before worked.  However, the Kan plates (negative control, EPI300 pIJ790, and DH5a pIJ790) showed unexpected results.  The negative control, which only had untransformed K12 cells plated, had more colonies growing than those from the plates with resistance-transformed EPI300 pIJ790 and DH5a pIJ790.  Even then, there were only a few small colonies on the EPI300 pIJ790 plate and none at all on the DH5a pIJ790 plate.  It looks like the Kan plates may not be working, and it is possible that the EPI300 and DH5a cells with the pIJ790 plasmid are not competent.

June 18 Yesterday's plates did not grow, but the experiment was repeated today.
1) A gel from yesterday's PCR was shown to have some products that worked, while others did not. The MetA, TrpA, TrpB, and ArgE biobrick PCR's worked fine, but the ArgE-Kan cassette and the ArgC biobrick PCRs did not, and were not repeated today. From personal correspondence with Joe, his PCR was not working either, despite trying different cycles and conditions. He suspects that there may be something wrong with the template, given the inconsistent performance of the Kan plates.
2) The biobrick PCRs that did work were digested with EcoRI and PstI, as was the psb1C3 linearized plasmid backbone.  it was unknown whether or not the plasmid had any methylation, so DpnI was used only in the PCR product digestion. The procedure will be uploaded to the wiki in the near future. A gel was made showing the ligation products.
3) The biobrick ligation products were used to transform K12 cells and were plated appropriately. The successful amino acid-"

Main processes considered in this model are similar to basic circuit model, this model is special for its cyclic processes. To simulate the inversion function of recombinase, we need to switch different groups of equations by detecting some key values of pH.
○ Cre/Flp regulation circuit
Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT circuits are shown in Figure.8. To describe the function of recombinases, we set cyclic processes in our model.
Fig.8 Gene circuits of Cre/Flp regulation system
Our results show that with the application of Cre/Flp circuit, pH Controller can achieve automatic switch in acid and alkali production and stabilize environmental pH level (Fig.9).
Fig.9 Extracellular pH regulated by Cre/Flp regulation circuit. The final pH level fluctuates between the range where both promoters are repressed. To prove the function of circuit, initial environmental pH was set up to 8.0, indicating that our circuit had already been induced.
○ Bxb1 Regulation Circuit
The second fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinase Bxb1 (Fig.10). Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali.
Fig.10 Gene circuit of Bxb1
Here we assumed that Bxb1 had reached stable condition, where the inversion efficiency of Bxb1 to both sides were the same. Results show that with the Bxb1 regulation circuit, pH could be regulated to a suitable level (Fig.11).
Fig.11 pH level change led by Bxb1 regulation circuit. Bxb1 can invert the constitutive promoter to both sides, thus, the eventual pH level is determined by strength of both acid and alkali. To prove the function of circuit, initial environmental pH was set up to 8.0, indicating that our circuit had already been induced. Eventual pH is determined by functional genes, and can reach other value if functional genes are replaced.
○ FimE Regulation Circuit
The last fine-regulation circuit is led by recombinase FimE (Fig.12). This recombinase can only invert the promoter for one time.
Fig.12 Gene circuits of FimE.
Results prove that with the application of FimE regulation circuit, pH Controller can regulate environmental pH to the level determined by the strength of acid (Fig.13). ldh"

As a stock solution preparation, these DNA parts are pipetted with PCR water or TE buffer which is 100 times of DNA amount. The final solution is prepared as 100uM.
For each transformation procedures, the 10uM of stock DNA part in water is transformed. 1uL is taken from stock DNA solution and is added to 9uL PCR water.
Preparation  of Competent Cells
Inoculate a single colony of E. Coli cells into 50 ml  LB medium. Grow overnight at 37 C with moderate shaking (250rpm)
Inoculate  4 mL of the culture into 400 mL LB medium in a sterile 2-liter flask. Grow at  37 C shaking at 250 rpm to an OD590 of 0.375.
This  procedure requires that cells be growing rapidly (early- or mid-log phase).  Accordingly, it is very important that the growing cells have sufficient air.  Overgrowth of culture (beyond OD590 of 0.4) decreases the efficiency of  transformation.
Aliquot culture into eight 50 mL prechilled, sterile polypropylene tubes and leave the tubes on ice 5 to 10 min.
Cells should be kept cold for all subsequent steps.
Larger tubes or bottles can be used to centrifuge cells if volumes of all subsequent solutions are increased in direct proportion.
Centrifuge  cells 7 min at 1600 g,   4 C.
Allow  centrifuge to decelerate without breake.
We have not  attempted to determine whether deceleration without braking is critical to this  procedure. However, we do not use the breake for this step or for the  subsequent centrifugation steps.
Pour off subernant and resuspend each pellet in 10 ml ice-cold CaCl2 solution.Re-suspension should be performed very gently and all cells kept on ice.
Cetrifuge cells 5 min at 1100  g, 4 C. Discard supernatant and re-suspend each pellet in 10 mL ice-cold CaCl2 solution. Keep re-suspend cells on ice for 30 min.
Centrifuge cells 5 min at 1100 g, 4 C. Discard supernatant and re-suspend each pellet in 2 mL ice-cold CaCl2 solution.
It is important to re-suspend this final pellet well. The suspension may be left on ice for several days.

The DNA sequence of the prefix and suffix CAN NOT be altered in any way
Ideally the operon would be under the control of the repressible promoter suggested by Jeremy. This promoter would be upstream of the operon and ribosome binding sites, but downstream of the prefix
With the exception of the prefix and suffix (which cannot be altered) the following restriction sites are forbidden within the operon: EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI, NotI
If possible, we would like the genes to be optimised for E. coli and preferably B. subtilis as well
In order to easy gene separation, we would like restriction sites on either side of the vio C and the vio D genes.
Modelling
We have now developed several versions of our model for the amplifier. These involve a simple model, positive feedback and degradation of the activator protein. We also included dependence on a parameter for input transcription, describing changes in both arabinose concentration and binding properties.
We have some interesting results for the positive feedback latch. Our continuous model indicates that whatever the transcriptional input, the reporter is produced in the same way. This means that the latch would be switched at any input level. We plan to look at stochastic modelling to see if the same applies here.
We produced several graphs to show what happens when different parameters are changed for the latch. The most important is the following, showing the very small effect of changing transcriptional input - encapsulating the effect of different arabinose concentrations.
Data Analysis
We now have fluorescence rate calculated for all runs, and have normalised this for od. The next step is to take the steady state fluorescence rate per cell, and plot this against arabinose concentration. This should allow us to show the effect of the amplifier construct.

It can be seen that γ-PGA yield of the NK-Ipop was significantly higher than that of the wild strain. (Fig. 3)
Fig. 3 The γ-PGA yield of B. amyloliquefaciens NK-Ipop and LL3 Δbam. B. amyloliquefaciens NK-Ipop was cultured in the fermentation medium with 10 μg/mL tetracycline for 24 hours. and the wild strain was cultured in the fermentation medium without antibiotics. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed for B. amyloliquefaciens NK-Ipop, 2 independent experiments performed for B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam.
4. Safety
Taking safety into consideration, we must ensure that none of our microbe can grow outside of lab in case of leaking out. We verified our Asp auxotroph in B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 which was constructed by a markerless gene replacement method in order to delete its original pathways of synthesizing Asp. We provided the same medium without Asp to both Asp auxotroph and wild type of B. amyloliquefaciens LL3, the result indicated that Asp auxotroph couldn’t grow in Asp-free medium while the wild type cangrew normally.

1µL EcoR1
1µL buffer 4
2µL backbone plasmid
6µL ddH2O
Incubate at 37 degrees for 90 min
There is only one EcoR1 site (GAATTC) in the plasmid, so we should see 1 band at about 5kb
Ran a gel (1%, 170 V) on the backbone fragment (Wolfe primers) PCR product and restriction digestion result
Observations: the EcoR1 digest produced the expected band of around 5kb. The backbone did produce a 5kb band but also had a secondary smaller product, perhaps due to one of the primers annealing to a sequence that is a close match to its target.
Began gradient PCR on the selection strain backbone with Wolfe_R and Wolfe_F primers because of the large difference in melting temperatures between the two
Set the annealing temperatures within the PCR to go from 50-57 C and ran with 5 minute extension phases at 70 C

MORE ON NEU COLLABORATION
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
NONA Partnership
Nona is a nonprofit organization established to help document, maintain, and increase community access to open source synthetic biology software tools. The motivation behind Nona stems from the observation that a large portion of synthetic biology software tools that are created, despite being incredibly useful for their purpose, often see only limited support, development, and often they never come to full fruition. Too often, a large proportion of software tools made in academia will only see a limited amount of updates and support before the original creators of the tool move onto different project; when this happens, the software tool loses all use, documentation ends, and old or new issues don’t get resolved. To many synthetic biology software tools do not receive enough support and community attention to reach fruition.
Nona gives support to synthetic biology software by providing a platform to archive, document, host and distribute these tools. More so, Nona has a goal of culturing a community of researchers and developers around these tools: Nona aims to have a form where members of the synthetic biology community can discuss, ask and answer questions, and provide feedback about these software tools. And because the tools that Nona supports are all open source, there is a goal of fostering the growth of a developer community around these synthetic biology tools. Nona is a home for open source synthetic biology software tools, and we are proud to have partnered with Nona this summer as just a small part of our human practices ventures.
What did we do? Well, to start off, Neptune is already under the Nona umbrella of software tools. This summer our team met with members of the Nona board to discuss the future of Neptune and Nona, as well other ways in which our team could contribute to the Nona community. We had a total of 3 main meetings, with a couple smaller correspondences in between. The following conclusions"

An equal volume of isopropanol is injected and mixed with to the filtered solution during the flow into the silicone tubes, and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes.
At this point, the solution is collected in Eppendorf tubes and these tubes are centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 minutes.
The supernatant is discarded and the pellet washed with 500 µL of 70% (v/v) ethanol.
The tubes are centrifuged again at maximum speed for 3 minutes and the supernatant is discarded.
Finally, the pellet is dried and resuspended in 50 µL of water or elution buffer.
Results (The Seat)
As a proof of concept, we used a suspension of soil bacteria (obtained after several mild centrifugations of a suspension of compost in PBS sterile buffer)          to isolate metagenomic DNA. Up to now, we have been able to perform steps 1-8 with our robot, and we are still working hard on the implementation of the          final steps of the protocol. Figure 1A shows the Nanodrop analysis on the metagenomic DNA we obtained from the suspension. We isolated pure (A260/A280 and          A260/A230 ratios close to 2) and quite concentrated (90.5 ng/µL) metagenomic DNA, the integrity of which was also checked on a 0.8% agarose gel (Figure          1B). Interestingly, we also observed the bands corresponding to the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA on the gel.

Again the team followed the protocol set by Promega and only made a few changes:
Step 3 - instead of adding 100ul of Competent Cells to the culture tubes, only 50ul was transferred.
Step 4 - the DNA added to the competent cells was 1ul instead of 10ul (this is because we only had approximately 2-3ul of DNA remaining!)
Step 8 - the media used to grow the transformant cells was LB and not SOC
Once the transformation process was completed, both sets of E. coli cells (containing BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076) were plated out on kanamycin LB plates. These plates were then transferred to the 37C incubator for overnight growth.
Preparing cells for freezing down
The cells to be frozen down included the following: E. coli containing RFP, E. coli containing GFP, JM109 E. coli containing BBa_C0056, JM109 E. coli containing BBa_B1002, JM109 E. coli cells containing BBa_R0077 and E. coli cells containing pMUTIN4 plasmid.
6 tubes were labelled and to each of them, 5ml of LB was added. Anti-biotics were then added to the appropriate tubes (25ul of each antibiotic is the volume used for 5ml of LB) and the colonies added to the right tubes. The tubes were laid out as follows:

Principal component analysis (PCA)
What is the problem?
In assessing the main reasons of how the genetic pollution impact the world, we can analyze it from different perspectives, and the evaluation indexes are too numerous and complicated.
To make our assessing task easier, we need to classify all these evaluation indexes into various independent types according to the inherent characteristics of the indexes themselves. This is also called dimensionality reduction which can simplify our problem into various types. Through classification, we can also evaluate our projects through different independent perspectives. What is more, this type of classification can also provide some basic knowledge to classes.
After the classification we can not only analyze the problems from the main per-spective which avoid the trouble of assessing the same problem from too many indexes, we can also know the performance of one problem in different single prospects.
As for how to accomplish this task, we need to use the principal component analysis (PCA) method.
What is principal component analysis?
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each"

Fluorescence
E. coli plate fluorescence
When measuring fluorescence, two approaches can be followed
measure the light intensity sent to fluorescence protein, measure returning light intensity and compare
measure two samples, and detect the increase in light returned
which follows either an absolute or relative quantification. For most tasks however the relative increase in fluorescence is needed, and therefore this approach is also used for this device. Figure 2 shows the schematic principle of the fluorescence measurement with our device.
Figure 2
Schematics of fluorescence measurement
Characteristic Curve
An important observation for fluorescence measurement is that the linearity of the measurement highly depends on the chosen light sensor. If the light sensor is not linear over the spectrum of measurement, linearity would be needed to be corrected by software. Fortunately the characteristic curve of the TSL 235 R shows perfect linearity such that no software correction is needed.
This needed to be confirmed by measurements. We used an E. coli dilution series to perform this experiment. Figure 3 shows the recorded values. The linearity clearly can be seen, the regression coefficient of 0.99 also supports this.

SEU_A,2012,Team:SEU A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"�2 (D), Ψ2 (T), γ2 are all the relative value to Ψ2 (R). The rate of division and conjugation of bacteria at each point is decided by the quantity of nutriment in the neighborhood, making the update time of each point different. The details are as follows: 1．Initialize three cycles of tracking plane the same size as the simulation plane. 2．Two planes of two layers record the progress of bacteria's division cycle. Where there is no bacterium at the point of the plane, the progress of it is constant 0 .The third plane records the progress of conjugation cycle. The progress is not 0 only when there is a D and an R on the same site at the same time. 3．All the three planes need to be calculated at each step of the simulation. With the time of each simulation setted L minutes and r employed as the relative division rate or relative conjugation rate at that point of the plane. r×L/40+ξ will be added to each step and point according to rule 2, where ξ is a random factor. If the value of a certain point reaches or gets larger than 1 after a simulation, the value subtracts 1 and note the split /conjugation occurs once. The advantage of this cycle time trace system is: 1.Being able to trace and record the progress of the division and conjugation at each point and plane in the cycle and make it convenient to improve SDTC to more complex models later. 2.SDTC model time can be considered as continuous. Because of the different relative division and conjugation rate of different cell, the update of each point on plane is asynchronous. Actually, any simulation that operates with the time has to set a small step size. Once the step is tiny enough and the elements’ update is asynchronous, we can say the time is continous. 3.Easy to deal with the program and simulation. 2.4 Initial state D and R are randomly distributed of certain density in the two layer planes. The density of each plane can be controlled respectively. The nutriment filled the whole plane uniformly.    2.3 Assumptions We use The SDCT model established above to simulate within the observation area of a lattice with its side length setted 500. Di (R) + Di (D) = n (Di (X) is the initial density, n is a predetermined value). We want to figure out the relationship of the ratio between Di (R) and Di (D)"

Since fossil fuels bring tremendous economic growth where they are abundant, many countries are in search of it. Oil, in particular, is a nightmare dressed like a daydream, a demanding mistress; because despite the enormous sums of money oil attracts wherever it's abundant, it also brings political instability, armed conflicts or a ""mini-world war"" in some cases (Rabie, 1992). As soon as it's discovered, many countries and co-operations seek to control the oil present, and this often ends in international conflict as can be seen in the infamous instance in the Persian Gulf, where its oil caused or triggered 35 years of international and economical crises responsible for far-reaching consequences like perhaps the best known one; 1973-74 oil embargo (Rabie, 1992). Such disputes occur frequently, wrecking world peace, ruining lives of millions, raising eyebrows, making one question its ethics.
With all of these reasons concerned, it's a no-brainer to say that fossil fuels are vile; and we desperately need to cut their use. They harm in almost every single way possible; from an environmental standpoint to a political one. Abandoning fossil fuels is not just essential; but also possible, and viable.
Figure 5: Current solutions to fossil fuels. Retrieved from: https://cna.ca/news/the-challenge-of-renewable-energy/
Current Solutions
Despite the world relying mostly on fossil fuels, the high cost and progressively limited sources of them, along              with the ever so growing pressure of having to reduce greenhouse gasses' emission made renewable energy resources              more attractive (Abu-Rub et al., 2014).
The potential renewable energy has is virtually limitless; since renewable energy can replenish itself in a relatively              short period of time, it is sustainable (Abu-Rub et al., 2014; U.S. Energy Information Administration [eia], 2017a).              Renewable sources such as biomass, wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal are first to come to mind (EPA).
Wind energy, for instance, has a considerable potential for being a clean energy source, thanks to it not producing              pollution and wide availability (Herzog et al., 2001). Having been used since antiquity in windmills, this source of              replenishable energy started being used for electricity generation since 20th century in the West (Herzog et al., 2001).              Despite its potential, the costs exceed the supply by"

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#KyleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the samples did not grow well in the liquid cultures and there was almost a stringy characteristic to the cells in the tube.  For further investigate, we went to the Biology labs and performed Gramm Staining on 6 of the samples.  What we saw under the microscope was some cells that resembled E. Coli along with bacteria in a long string/beadlike form.  Our conclusion was that the samples were contaminated and that we needed to be more conscientious about lab cleanliness.
6/10:  There was not much work in the lab today.  I autoclaved some pipet tips that we would use.  Instead, the day was spent organizing how we would put together our different BioBrick parts into a full working construct plasmid.  This included how to take out the promoters in the original RBS plasmids, as well as which restriction enzymes to use.  We planned out the next week and assigned tasks to everyone.
WEEK 2: 6/12-6/16/2011
This week, as a team, we will combine the GFP gene and terminator into one plasmid.  Also we will continue to troubleshoot and figure out what went wrong with our transformations from Week 1.  If we need to, we will set up new transformations of our selected BioBrick parts.
6/12:  Came in on a Sunday to do liquid cultures plasmid prep of our original plated transformations of our selected BioBricks (5 promoters and 3 RBS).  Our theory is that contamination occurred when we made our liquid cultures the last time.  So we were careful in our aspectic technique and made two liquid cultures: one with LB, and one with LB + ampicillin.
6/13:  This morning I checked on the liquid plasmid preps from 6/12 and found that only two of the LB+Amp cultures grew while all of the LB cultures grew.  This meant that our transformation plates from the previous week were no longer selective to our Amp resistant transformed E. coli and were no usable anymore.  I did minipreps on the two cultures that did grow (an RBS and UV light inducible promoter), but they had poor DNA concentration like the week before.  So we did totally new transformations of the RBS and promoters of which we had DNA left in the 2010 iGEM plates.
6/14:  The transformations from yesterday grew overnight and I checked them this morning.  The negative control plate we did (T10 E. coli cells only"
Washington,2016,Team:Washington#Project1_-_-_TEXT.html," Our team then changed our plasmid building methods and decided to make three smaller plasmids and then do a double/tripple transformation. Since our plasmid is derived from the commonly used violacein plasmid ,pPSX vio+, we believe that our end products will be highly pigmented color signals that can be used to automate our system.
BioBricks
For 2016, the University of Washington's iGEM team has worked to develop four biobricks. These are as follows:
BBa_K2165000 : VioC (Codon Optimized for S. cerevisiae)
BBa_K2165001 : VioD (Codon Optimized for S. cerevisiae)
BBa_K2165004 : pCup1 (Biobrick Standard Assembly Compatible)
BBa_K2165002 : pCup1 + VioC (Codon Optimized) + ADH1
BBa_K2165003 : Gal1 + VioD (Codon Optimized) + Terminator
It should be stressed that without the other components of the Violacein pathway (VioA, VioB, and VioE, see part BBa_K726015 as an example), the substrate for VioC and VioD will not be produced and no pigment will be visible.
BBa_K2165000 : VioC (Codon Optimized for S. cerevisiae)
Figure 2. The proposed structure for VioC (Helmetag 2009). Rendered with PyMOL.
VioC is the final (fourth, or fifth if VioD also present) enzyme in the violacein pathway when expressed. VioC, alongside VioA, VioB, and VioE, processes its substrate protodeoxyviolaceinic acid into deoxyviolaceinic acid. Deoxyviolaceinic acid then decays, producing a pink-color pigment. When VioD is also expressed, protoviolaceinic is instead used as VioC's substrate, producing an intermediate which subsequently degrades into a dark, purple pigment called volacein.
VioC was previously available as a standalone part as BBa_K539513 , produced by NCTU Formosa's 2011 iGEM team ; however, BBa_K539513 is not codon optimized for yeast. The part developed by the University of Washington's iGEM team have been codon optimized for yeast in hopes to improve the efficiency of its translation. The CDS contained in"

Design Notes
Because there are illegal SpeI sites in the Trp promotor, all assembly had to be done with RFC21 standard (bgl bricks). Thus, we had to add the appropriate bgl-brick sites to all parts we worked with. See our team page for a more in depth description.

Part:BBa_K324051 - LacI-RFP-Bistable part-GFP
This is the Bistable part originally created by team PKU '07, modified by PKU '09, and now further modified by us. We have added expression of LacI before RFP and the CI434 regulated promotor. As described in , and detailed here this part has two stable states. Initially, the green, or CI434 state dominates. However, as CI is introduced, expression of CI434 (and thus state 1) is inhibited, and the bistable part switches to state 2, where CI and RFP are produced. We have added the additional expression of LacI in state 2.

Part:BBa_K324052 - pLac/Mnt-RBS-GAL4-ECFP-Term
This part is composed of the pLac/Mnt hybrid promotor with GAL4 and ECFP following. Expression occurs in the absence of Mnt + presence of LacI and IPTG.
Part:BBa_K324053 - Constitutive-RBS-LovTAP-Term
This part is designed to constitutively express the LovTAP protein (the light responsive protein BBa_K191006)
Design Notes
This part is modified from BBa_K191003, which contained pLac. As we desired constant production of LovTAP, this promotor was replaced. See here for more information regarding the role this part plays in our circuit.
