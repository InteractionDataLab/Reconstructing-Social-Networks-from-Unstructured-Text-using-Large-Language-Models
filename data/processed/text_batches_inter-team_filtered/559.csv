RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"As include a seed region, which is the region antisense to the target sequence; an Hfq protein binding region; a termination region, to stop the transcription of sRNA itself. Hfq protein was there to promote the sRNA-mRNA base pairing and increase the stability of sRNA-mRNA complex.
The seed region we choose was antisense to the 5’UTR region, which includes J61101 RBS and scar; also, we choose the protein coding sequence of mNeonGreen. Previous researches stated that the blocking could be performed by sRNA antisense to 70nt upstream or 15nt downstream.
2 Density Regulator
The other environmental signal we can detect is the cell density. As engineered bacteria accidentally felt out from the fermenter, it will be diluted by the environment; the density will decrease.
Quorum sensing device in iGEM is quite commonly used until now it has been used for 227 times, the entire system has been well characterized, so we used it directly.
The circuit was quite similar to F2420, but we changed the pTet promoter to pTac. We want the device to express lethal genes when cell density drops, as they get into and diluted by the environment.
The genetic circuit designed for density-regulated sensor contains an AHL acceptor protein and the quorum sensing pLux promoter. The acceptor protein is LuxR, which is constantly expressed (under promoter pTac) and forms AHL-LuxR complex with AHL molecules. The complex consequently binds to an operator lux box in the promoter region (pLux), which up-regulates the expression of the gene downstream.
Same as the thermal regulator, we have to invert the signal, so we choose a tetR family repressor. Yes, we did mention that protein transcriptional regulator is resource consuming, but the sRNAs were not able to block the expression entirely during our characterization. So, according to previous research and characterization, we choose PhlF repressor, since its repression is very tight. (Stanton et al.) PhlF will repress pPhlF promoter at PhlO region; the derepression is carried out by LVA degradation tag.
3 Integrase
One of the basic building blocks of our logic gate is temperature, through which we expect to control suicide switch. Under high cell temperature should the kill switch be turned OFF and contrarily under low cell density, which resembles the situation of strain leakage, should the bacteria express DNase or cytotoxic genes to kill themselves. So, we went through the registry, found that Peking iGEM201"

Synthetic Biology in One Thousand and one nights
VOSB( The Voice of Synthetic Biology) world service, I’m Jessica Williams. Welcome to our broadcast “Synthetic Biology in One Thousand and one nights”. Well, before we start tonight’s story, just close your eyes and imagine: You're now traveling to 2035 …
Section 1:
It’s an era of high-tech civilization. Termites are the cruelest killers of the Galaxy. Earth is their current prey, plundering all wood resources and eroding the planet. Presidential conference is proposed. The president trembles hands on the paper of nuclear missile launch. He knows clearly how the act will ruin the planet, but to burn and crash is the only choice to eliminate enemy and save people. In a pinch, a mystery man bursts in and tears up the document.
(P- president; M- man)
P: Who allows you to come in? (angry and despaired)
M: I’m coming to help avoid the tragedy and defeat the termites. We can absolutely crumble termites from within instead of confronting. The plan is based on the project of iGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015. ZJU iGEMers coated adapted"

Collaboration with Arizona State University
Our team was having difficulty assembling the two transcriptional units (VCP and PCP) into a multigene assembly. We contacted the ASU iGEM team to see if they could help with our problem. Stefan from the ASU iGEM team developed a cloning strategy to help our team assemble our multigene sensing plasmid within a few days of sharing the plasmid maps. This included designing primers for each of our transcriptional units in order to do digests and ligations using Type 1 enzymes (double digest + ligation). The ASU team also sent us an aliquot of their lab’s pET28 to use as the backbone for the multigene sensing assembly. ASU also helped troubleshoot minor problems that came up while trying to assemble and clone the sensing assembly, including suggesting a colony PCR, explaining protocols for assembling the multigene, and giving other advices/tips.  In return, our team helped out the ASU team by reading over their wiki and presentation.  As a result of this collaboration, our team was able to clone the sensing construct. We are very grateful to have received this tremendous help from ASU!
In return, our team helped out the ASU team by reading over their wiki and presentation.

Collaboration with University of Washington
The University of Washington iGEM team gave us general advice concerning our project and proofread and gave us feedback on our wiki pages. The UoWashington team also helped us with our presentation; we held a skype session where we presented our presentation to them over skype and they critiqued it and gave us advice.  In return, our team helped them out with their survey on GMOs and bioethics.   Also, at the Giant Jamboree, the UoWashington team sat down with us to go through the presentation, and gave us many recommendations and feedbacks. We were able to make edits to make our presentation better--thanks to the UoWashington team!

From 15th to 17th September 2016 at the University Paris Diderot campus, the FESTIVAL VIVANT brings together all those who transform, use, observe the living world in order to cooperate about: bioeconomy, biotechnology, agriculture, for a sustainable future?""
For the edition 2016 LIVING FESTIVAL, iGEM IONIS team was present in the «Village des initiatives » (Innovative village) We were there to present the Quantifly project to the world. As the event was open to the public, everyone could come and discover who we were and what we were working on. We had the pleasure to explain our project to children, old people, scientists, artists…
We also had a big surprise when we realized that 4 iGEM teams were also there ! It was a great time for all of us, and we got to spend more time with them, which is always nice ! Seeing them again after the European Experience and the iGEM Île-de-France Meetup was really fun.

iGEM week
In order to make students from Sup’Biotech discover what the iGEM was and hopefully to convince them to participate next year, we decided to do something that has been organized for the first time by the iGEM IONIS 2015 team: the iGEM Week. We managed to free some time in the students courses to organize project presentations and to get to spend some time with them answering their questions about what was Synthetic Biology, the iGEM and what we were doing. We also performed some food selling throughout the week in order to raise funds for our project Last but not least, we also organized a contest for the students: by groups, they had to design a scientific poster based on a previous iGEM project. The posters would be evaluated by a selection of teachers from the school, on various criteria such as design and scientific content. There were prizes to win for the best posters, and we had a lot of fun showing them all to the school !
On the last day, we organized a giant BBQ for all the school: the results were announced, and everyone had fun, students and teachers.
This event was an amazing thing to do, and we hope it will help to create an “iGEM-supportive"

Doug's Notebook
This is my notebook. This is my voice on TV.
The joys of being an advisor!
Anyway, welcome to my single notebook entry. Here we go. Team #3. Lucky #3. Numero tres. Third times the charm. Etc. This is my third time running an iGEM team in case you could not guess. My first two teams were at UC Berkeley. I was a post doc then. I had more time then. I had more energy then. I had more hair then. I had more jokes then. This year, now that I am a big time professor at Boston University, I figured I should run a team here. How hard could it be? Heck, it is going to be cheap since it is at MIT (cue humorous ""Wa Wa"" sound as I learn about regional jamboree format). I can handle a team of 10 students at BU. No problem I said. Needless to say this was another massive undertaking. I couldn't have done it without my other instructors (Orit Shaer, Traci Haddock, Swapnil Bhatia, Megan Strait, and Suma Jaini). THANKS A TON! Plus I have to say that again we had a TERRIFIC group of students. They never cease to amaze me. I am very proud of what they have accomplished and I can't help but smile when I think of how far they have come. Now that iGEM is winding down, I can say without hesitation that it was totally worth it and I would do it again (doh!).  So, why I am excited about our team?!?!?!
1. Our team is joint with Wellesley College. A year or so ago, I stumbled across this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf-zMFdlqQ4 (YouTube video). I thought it was really cool. I figured if we could get a great HCI project combined with the Clotho project it could address many"

Centrifuge the tubes for 10 minutes at RPM of 13200.
Gently pour the supernatant from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column. The plasmid DNA is now trapped within the membrane of the QIAprep column. Empty the filtrate and dry by inverting and tapping on tissue. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13200 rpm.
Add 750ul of PE buffer to wash the QIAprep column. Leave to stand for 5min. Spin for 1min at 13200rpm, then empty the filtrate and spin again. The outer tube of the QIAprep can be thrown away.
Place the inner QIAprep column into clean 1.5ml micro centrifuge tube. Elute the plasmid DNA by adding 30ul of buffer EB just near to the inner membrane. Allow to stand for 1 minute, then centrifuge for another minute. 30ul is just sufficient to cover the membrane cross sectional area.
Store LacI(1) and LacI(2) plasmid DNA at 4oC.
Phase III:
2ul of EcoRI buffer, 0.2ul of BSA, 1ul of EcoRI, 1ul of PstI and 11.8ul of DI water into one PCR tube and do a pulse spin at 2000 rpm. Then transfer 8ul from the cocktail mixture into the second PCR tube.
Add 2ul of LacI(1) plasmid DNA to  a PCR tube. Repeat for LacI(2). Centrifuge for a short pulse with rpm just reaching 3000rpm.
Incubate at 37oC for 2 hours (for preliminary analysis. For total ligation, allow incubation of at least 4 hours)
Prepare the agarose gel setup. Add 2ul of blue loading dye to 10ul of ligated sample in the PCR tube. Load 12ul of DNA marker, and ligated plasmid into each electrophoresis well.
Run the gel electrophoresis for 20min, ensuring the loading dye do not exceed the whole span of agarose gel.
Scan the agarose gel under UV.
Observations:
LacI operon 200bp corresponding to experimental gel electrophoresis
Conclusion:
Preliminary test indicated that the Miniprep was successful.

I grew up in a small village where the cow to inhabitant ratio is close to one. I prefer bacteria disassembled into their components rather than whole and healthily living.
Labwork is like cooking and I love both. Besides my life as a lab rat for iGEM, I am addicted to music, good books and my bike.
I chose to join the iGEM team because like cluttering myself with work.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#FutureScenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," released.
According to Moore’s Law, that states that the number of    transistors in a dense integrated circuit and its computational power    doubles approximately every two years, the cost per Megabase at 2015    was expected to be around $50; however, the computational equipment    associated with the DNA sequencing has growing exponentially decreasing    even further the price, besides the new techniques that allows a faster    and more precise analysis.
With all this information, our hypothetical scenario seems to be    possible in just a couple of years, in which novel upcoming techniques    are available on the market.
However, CryptoGErM is not only a system for the storing    of information, our system goes beyond that; rather than just storing    encrypted information, our system can be used for physical sending.
And if the system is in the wrong hands?
What would happen if the system would end up in the hands of a criminal? Which impact would it have?
To give an answer to this question, we propose a computational    simulation to model the behaviors of some of the agents that could use    the CryptoGErM system, within these agents, a potential criminal was    included. Please consult the AI Agent Model in The Modelling Section for further information and discussion

Since the PPAR-alpha promoter coding sequence could not be obtained from human genomic DNA, further experiment could not be preceded.
Glucose Regulated Protein (GRP78) Promoter
The commercial plasmid pDRIVE_hGRP78 (InvivoGen) was treated following manufacturer instructions (see manufacturer protocol ). GRP78 promoter was extracted out by polymerase chain reaction with engineered RFC10 prefix, suffix, AseI upstream of prefix and XhoI in downstream of suffix to facilitate cloning into pEGFP-N1 backbone (Addgene). pEGFP-N1 is a mammalian vector that contains constitutive CMV promoter and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as a reporter. We replaced CMV promoter with inducible GFP78 promoter by digestion and ligation. Since GRP78 promoter contained illegal restriction sites, two kinds of mutagenesis were conducted (see Mutagenesis protocol 2 and 3 ) for the elimination of XbaI. Due to time constrain, promoter activity in mammalian cell could not be characterized.
Fatty Acid Metabolism Regulator Protein (FadR) and pFadBA Promoter
The FadR (BBa_K817001) and pFadBA (BBa_K817002) DNA were obtained from 2013 distribution kit, submitted by NTU-Taida 2012 team. For expression in mammalian cells, pFadBA was cloned into mammalian vector (BBa_J176171) with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as reporter. After successful construct of pFadBA – EGFP – BBa_J176171, the plasmid was transfected into HEK293FT cell.
For the promoter regulation, we cloned FadR into BBa_J176171 backbone, with Kozak sequence and Nuclear Leading Sequence (NLS) for transcription and translation efficiency in mammalian cell.
After confirmation of the construct, Kozak Sequence – FadR coding sequence – NLS was cloned into pEGFP"

Cellulose binding domain
A cheap alternative purification method combined with a powerful immobilization tool could be the solution to prevail over other more expensive water cleaning methods like oxidization with ozone or using tons of activated carbon which just capture microcontaminates, but does not dismantle them. A promising solution to this could be cellulose binding domains (CBDs). Cellulose is ubiquitous and sustainable. Following this idea fusion-protein-constructs with cellulose binding domains have been made. To characterize a GFP has been introduced as a C or N-terminal domain of the cellulose binding protein. After delays in cloning the constructs for two fusion proteins with a T7-promoter could be finished, but did not express the protein in E. coli KRX and BL21. An alternative construct with a constitutive promoter could also be finished, but gave the same results. Changing the order of CBD and GFP was carried out, but was hampered by a base deletion in the GFP gene causing a frame shift and could not be redone in time.

Shuttle vector
A shuttle vector for site-directed recombination into the yeast P. pastoris does not exist in the parts registry and could be developed by our team. With this system it is possible to recombine a protein of interest with a N-terminal mating factor alpha 1 for secretion the protein into the media. This protein of interest could be cloned in frame with one restriction ligate cloning step. The selection depends not on an antibiotic resistance like zeocine, but on a complementation of histidine auxotrophy. This system is for us important because some of our laccases can not be expressed in the prokaryotic expression system E. coli, because the protein needs glycosylation. Read more.
Collaboration with UCL
The BioBrick BBa_K729006 from the University College London was characterized by us. Therefore E. coli KRX containing BBa_K729006 and E. coli KRX as a negative control were cultivated in shaking flasks and a growth kinetic was determined. The harvested cells were lysed via sonication and substances with a low molecular weight were seperated out of the supernatant. After purification"

where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged (it is equivalent to use pLux/Tet hybrid promoter).
The results is shown for each (we plot GFP concentration versus time and compare it with experiment measument):
Part:BBa_K176026 (Promoter Strength: 0.55 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176126 (promoter strength: 0.0192 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176128 (promoter strength: 0.0016 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176130 (promoter strength: 6.4E-5 1/s)
Toggle Switch
Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state."

Introduction Analysis Audiences Goals Key messages Tactics and Inputs Planning Budget and evaluation Recommendations
Audiences
There are several audiences who we want to approach. We can distinguish the audiences as internal and external audiences. Internal audiences are those who in general have a scientific background in Biotechnology while external audiences are those who in general don't have a scientific background in Biotechnology.
Internal audiences
Scientists
We would like to inform scientists who are interested in Synthetic Biology in general about our project. Therefore we focus on departments in our University like Department of Bionanoscience and Department of Biotechnology. We also focus on Kluyver Centre for Genomics of Industrial Fermentation.
Students
We focus on students of The Delft University of Technology Faculty of Applied Sciences and Leiden University Faculty of Science. Students form these Faculties are potential members for next year's TU Delft iGEM team. We also want to inform students from the other Faculties of these universities about our participation in the iGEM competitions and project.
External audiences
Sponsors and potential sponsors
Sponsors and potential sponsors are an important audience to us, because participation the competition needs to be funded. Potential sponsors are Biotechnology and gene technology companies. Other potential sponsors are the departments of our Faculty (Faculty of Applied Sciences). Our sponsors are mentioned on the Team wiki.
In science interested public
Synthetic Biology is a new field in the Life Sciences and the public isn't really familiar with it. We want to inform part of the public about our participation and project. The public is a very large and complex  audience, therefore we focus on a sub-audience within this audience. We will focus on people who read the science supplement of newspapers.
Becoming students
We also want to inform upcoming students about Synthetic Biology in order to gain there interest in Life Sciences in general.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.
Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of"

The resulting low crop yields cause many people to go hungry every year, and if climate change magnifies these problems, we could be facing a major food shortage. We decided to give back to those in our community who are already dealing with hunger by volunteering at a local food bank. Five team members sorted radishes for the food bank for four hours to show our dedication to ending hunger around the world.

BYU iGEM can count on every member, now that summer is over and all are again enrolled in classes.  We took time at the beginning of class to list our main projects (aside from research itself) from here on out: they include cloning our parts into the iGEM backbone plasmid, filming a synthetic biology techniques video to collaborate with another team, finishing the website, and publishing our synthetic biology Children's Book and collecting data to demonstrate that children who read it and the included parental guide improve their understanding of science generally and synthetic biology in particular.
Kelton and I are responsible to see the book published, and the data collected.  We set ourselves the following deadlines: Sep. 8th: Have in our possession the edited, shaded version of the book.  Redge (the illustrator) confirmed that he would finish by Sunday the 8th. Sep. 11th: Submit the book for publishing. Sep. 20th: Distribute paper copies/pdf copies to elementary school teachers and parents.  Children will be given a pre test before reading the book, and later a post test.  The test results will allow us to quantifiably show that our book improves understanding of synthetic biology among young children. Sep. 25th: Compile and analyze the data.
Several weeks ago, I read a paper indicating that lysogenic lambda is induced to lysis by host cell recognition of AHL's, the molecules used in bacterial quorum sensing systems.  I thought that our bacterial strain with the Lambda lysogen, TT9907, might recognize cholera"

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html," of the risks of a potential clinical treatment and ethical debates are two totally different things that should not be mixed up nor lead by the same institutions. Prof. Duboule also expressed concerns about fully stopping the research because of a moratorium, as it would represent a waste of time, above all for sick people waiting for a treatment (patients suffering from cystic fibrosis for example). In addition, moratoriums are, in his opinion, not the right way to address important questions. A third opinion, supported by Oliver Peter, assesses that the debate raised by CRISPR-Cas9 does not bring anything really new to the table compared with the Asilomar moratorium: “I do not think it [a moratorium] is necessary. For me, this technology is making things more feasible, but we have already debated this. And we already decided in our society that we do not want to interfere with the human germ line. There is nothing fundamentally new that one can do with CRISPR-Cas9 as far as I understand it”.
The role of Ethics
A topic that is often mentioned in discussions about moratoriums is the position and the role of ethics in the discussion. Recently, in the shadows of the very mediatized debate around CRISPR-Cas9 and the use of genetic engineering in medicine, ethics and bioethicists in particular have been described as a barrier to progress. An example is the editorial Steven Pinker wrote for the Boston Globe: “The moral imperative for bioethics” published on August 1st 2015 [5]. We also noted a tendency for scientists to expect ethicists to give clear answers to questions like “are we allowed to continue doing such or such experiment?” which is in fact a misconception about the function of ethics in such issues. Prof. Benaroyo makes it clear: “Ethics in itself will usually not give an answer as a matter of principle, ethics is reflexive, meaning that it will ask the questions and explore the issues”. Most importantly, ethics and ethics committees are not to be confused. Ethics committees are not and must not solely consist of ethicists. All stakeholders have to be represented. Typically, for a public health issue, it would mean scientists, members of an association representing patients, ethicists, sociologists, politicians and economists. The role of ethics committees is to make assessments, after having addressed the issues in a protocolar way, but not to lead a public debate between different parties.
A few final words
It seems very difficult for us to give any definite answer to the questions we asked about communication"

Lysate Purification via Column Chromatography
Using the collected supernatant form Sample 1, we optimize and troubleshoot a protocol to purify our protein using nickel column chromatography and gravity filtration. The column contains a Histidine resin that selectively binds to His-tagged proteins. The column is equilibrated and charged before the sample is run through. The sample is diluted in 1X binding buffer in a 1 to 1 volume ratio. The idea is to add solutions of successively higher concentrations of imidazole. Imidazole has an extremely high affinity for the nickel charged column, and by the time the elution buffer is added (250mM), imidazole will outcompete our Tamura proteins in binding, allowing the Tamura proteins to elute and drain through the column to be collected as the final eluate.
PROBLEM: The first step of the protocol states to run the sample diluted in 1X binding buffer through the column and collect what drips through as Fraction 1. About 5mL of Fraction 1 was collected before the column became clogged, preventing further use of gravity filtration. The contents of Fraction 1 are expected to be any unbound proteins, a.k.a. contaminant proteins that are not Tamura. As a result, we hypothesize that blockage is likely due to these contaminant proteins being too big in size, unable to flow through our smaller-sized pores in the column. Tomorrow, we will troubleshoot the protocol or attempt a new method to purify our protein sample."

Background
RNA thermometers are RNA-based genetic control tools that react to temperature changes 1. Low temperatures keep the mRNA at a conformation that masks the ribosome binding site within the 5’ end untranslated region (UTR). Masking of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence restricts ribosome binding and subsequent protein-translation. Higher temperatures melt the hairpins of RNA secondary structure allowing the ribosomes to access SD sequence to initiate translation 1. In terms of applicability of RNA thermometers in in vitro systems, they display certain advantages over ribo- or toehold switches: they do not require binding of a ligand, metabolite or trigger RNA to induce the conformational change 2,3, therefore are especially compatible with liposome IVTT system.
Although some acquirable and already tested thermoswitches can be found in literature 1,4, the field is still particularly underexplored. Possibility to design countless synthetic thermoswitches corresponding to different temperatures and of varying structure, is facilitated by computational models and RNA bioinformatics approaches. Together with two pioneers in this field from Vienna University (see Attributions ), we have de novo designed six heat-inducible RNA thermometers previously never mentioned in any paper or literature review. Not only did they complement SynDrop, but also helped expanding the library of well characterized and widely-applicable biobricks.
Concept of the Model
We have optimized the opening energy of the ribosome docking site, which is a stretch of 30 nucleotides starting at the beginning of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence downstream into the coding sequence. This region corresponds to the binding footprint of the assembled initiation ribosome and must be unfolded prior to the assembly of the ribosome machinery. The model optimized for that region to have a high opening energy (meaning low translation efficiency) at low temperatures and a low opening energy (high translation efficiency) at high temperatures"
NTU-Singapore,2015,Team:NTU-Singapore#Dairy_-_-_TEXT.html," the ATG start codon of wild type LDP. Hence, we minipreped the constructs and transformed them into WM3064 for conjugation into Shewanella.
We decided to complete our RBS characterisation by this weekend. Hence, we characterised mutants of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 on the same day. On the other hand, we finally succeeded in having our desired mutant, 6GT. Hence, we started the process of conjugating this mutant RBS with the GFP reporter into Shewanella. Some results of our mutants were mistakenly left behind, 5AG and there are some(7GT and 7GC) that are showing fluorescence intensities which are too low(we are speculating our results). Hence, we decided to make another round of measurement along with 6GT.
Week 4
We transformed and plated our constructs into WM3064 but the plates dried up on the second day as the agar was too thin. Hence, we redid transformation into WM3064. As time is running out, we did not carry on to make the operon of LDPM/LDHWT.
The final batch of RBS mutant characterisation was done this week. Moreover, we started moving our constructs into pSB1C3 for shipment.
September
Week 1
After obtaining the WM3064 strains with our LDHM/LDPWT construct, started to conjugate them into Shewanella and picked for colonies on the second day.
Conrtucts were also being moved in to pSB1C3 for shipment.
Week 2
We set up the MFCs for our mutants as well as made growth curve measurements this week.

From 2013 British_Columbia
 
We chose CRISPR to knock-out antibiotic resistance. CRISPR system is  a bacteria immune system which is used as gene engineer machine now. It has  three types and we chose the type II CRISPR system.
This system contains three parts. First, this system can express two  kinds of single strand RNA:  tracrRNA and  crRNA. crRNA’s structure is like “repeat---spacer---repeat”, the spacer part is  complementary to target gene’s DNA sequence, the repeat is complementary to  tracrRNA while tracrRNA can also have interaction with a protein coded in this  system --- Cas9, an endonuclease.
Once we modified the spacer sequence of a CRISPR system and  transformed it into bacteria, it will search for target gene (antibiotics resistance  gene in our project) in bacteria’s genome by crRNA. Once the target is found,  Cas9 protein will bind on this gene’s DNA sequence with the help of tarcrRNA  and crRNA. Then, Cas9 will make a small double strand break on the gene. So  this gene’s sequence will be modified by later homozygous recombination, result  in the knock-out of this gene.

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC Construction_-_-_TEXT.html," basic design of a microbial fuel cell is mainly influenced by the shape of the electrode chambers. A very simple design is called the “H” shape, which usually consists of two bottles or other vessels, connected by a tube containing material suitable for proton exchange. Further investigations underlined usefulness of such systems for testing of materials or parameters, but the power gain is rather low. This is most likely the case because of the slow proton exchange through the tubes and because of a high internal resistance  ( Oh et al., 2004; Oh and Logan, 2006 ).
There are many other possible shapes, like a cylindrical reactor with a concentric inner tube that acts as the cathode to enable a continuous flow. One specific design, proposed by H. P. Bennetto ( Bennetto, 1990 ), is often used for research purposes. The system consists of plastic elements in form of two solid plates and two frames, as shown in Figure 2. The frames are placed between the plates and form two reaction compartments, separated by a cation exchange membrane. Furthermore, every compartment is equipped with electrodes to enable a flow of electrons. To ensure the system is air-tight, rubber gaskets are fitted between the plastic parts. The endplates are held together by four threaded rods.
Requirements:
formation of a closed system
possibility for axenic cultivation
possibility for anaerobic conditions
large internal surface
Anode
Materials have to be highly conductive, biocompatible and chemically stable under the conditions present inside the fuel cell in order to be used as an anode. Many traditional materials like copper are not suitable, because they corrode or have a toxic effect on the bacteria. Platinum works excellent, but is extremely expensive. Several carbon-based materials provide a cheap but practical alternative. Regardless of the type of material, the electrodes surface area is a very important factor for current production. Previous investigations showed that current increases with the overall internal surface in the following order: carbon felt > carbon foam > graphite ( Chaudhuri and Lovley, 2003 ).
Requirements:
high conductivity
good biocompatibility
long-term physical and chemical stability
Cathode
Because of its low overpotential in combination with carbon electrodes and the resulting working potential, which is close to its open circuit potential, potassium ferricyanide (K3)[Fe(CN) 6]) is the most frequently used electron acceptor in microbial fuel cells in research scenarios ( Logan et al., 2006 ). However, one has to consider that the reoxidation by oxygen is very low and the diffusion through the PEM is"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," protein-based transcriptional regulators have demonstrated dynamic ranges over an order of magnitude higher, with widely-used inducible promoters regulating protein expression over 350-fold (Lutz and Bujard, 1997) and sigma factor-promoter pairs providing up to 480-fold modulation (Rhodius et al., 2013).Despite the inherent programmability of RNA-based systems, efforts at constructing large sets of orthogonal riboregulators have been limited to libraries of at most seven parts with crosstalk levels of 20% (Takahashi and Lucks, 2013). Typical RNA-based regulators employ interaction domains consisting of30 nts, which corresponds to a sequence space of over 1018 potential regulatory elements. Thus, the sheer diversity of possible RNA-based parts suggests that previous devices have not come close to realizing the potential of highly orthogonal regulation.
Figure 5: (A and B) Design schematics of conventional riboregulators (A) and toehold switches (B). Variable sequences are shown in gray, whereas conserved or constrained sequences are represented by different colors.
Much of this discrepancy arises from the significant sequence constraints imposed on riboregulators engineered thus far (Figure1A). Like natural riboregulators, engineered riboregulators of translation have invariably used base pairing to the ribosome binding site (RBS) to prevent ribosome binding, thereby preventing translation (Callura et al., 2012; Isaacs et al., 2004; Mutaliket al., 2012; Rodrigo et al., 2012). Because repression is caused by RBS binding, trigger RNAs that activate translation are engineered to contain an RBS sequence to displace the repressing sequence, which in turn reduces the potential sequence space for the riboregulator.
Previous riboregulators have also relied on U-turn loop structures to drive loop-loop and loop-linear interactions between RNAs (Figure 1A) (Callura et al., 2012; Isaacs et al., 2004; Luckset al., 2011; Takahashi and Lucks, 2013). U-turn loops are common RNA structural motifs formed by tertiary interactions that have been identified in ribozymes, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNA anticodon loops (Gutell et al., 2000). Although recent work has begun to show that loops with canonical U-turn sequences are not essential for riboregulators (Mutalik et al., 2012; Rodrigoet al., 2012), the engineered systems reported to date have continued their reliance on"

However, there are evidences shown that there is another model of pore formation caused by Cry toxin action in Lepidoptera. The interaction between Cry toxin and cadherin can trigger the programed death of by lysis.
5.The shortcomings of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.)
There is no doubt that Bt. stains own many advantages as biological pesticide, such as, efficiency and highly species-specific toxicity. Howerver, B. thuringiensis also does have disadvantages. Many strains are sensitive to the sunlight and their toxic proteins will degrade within a week.  To test the resistance of LLL29 to the sunshine, especially about UV, we measure the curve of survival as Figure6 under the different time length under different illumination time by using UV as Figure6
 
6.2A-Expression system
The interaction between Cry and Cyt toxins can enhance the toxicity to mosquitoes. Therefore, it is essential for us to develop a system which co-expressed Cry and Cyt genes together to kill the larvae of mosquitoes. For this system, the expression of multiple proteins is the most critical stage in synthesis biology. From previous studies, we found that an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been widely used to construct bicistronic or multicistronic vectors. But, due to the unbalanced expression of upstream and downstream proteins and the limit of their sequence lengths, we proposed a new strategy based on 2A peptide expression system. This system is based on a self-cleaving 2A peptide and much more efficient to cleave the upstream of 2A peptide. Comparing to the widely used method, multiple plasmids for transformation, Viral 2A peptide system not only works in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but also performs much more efficiently than that of plasmids, especially in C. reinhardtii. 2A peptides system was firstly discovered in Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). 2A peptide is a linker which used to separate functional proteins between upstream and downstream, and the length is about 18-22 amino acids long. 'Ribosomal skip' occurs during translation that results in production of independent peptides or proteins from one polycistronic. After cleavage, the 2A peptide remains fused to the C-terminus of the upstream protein when the proline is linked to the"

A solar panel manufacturer could for example prefer to produce the MLAs by themselves, instead of buying them from us. As licensor you have to think in detail about the legal aspects of your further licensor/licensee relationship.
Key Resources
It is important that we patent our product to ensure the exclusive rights to produce and sell it. The intellectual properties are therefore the most important key resources of the company. The patent will be associated with specific knowledge and expertise that is present within the company. Therefore, human resources are important for the company as well. Finally, the production capacity of the company is a form of physical resource that will make the company unique.
Value Proposition
The biological microlens is an extremely small lens that can be used to increase the efficiency solar panels. In contrast to regular chemically produced MLAs, our MLAs are produced environmentally friendly and eventually cheaper too. Therefore, the main value of proposition of our company is that with our product the efficiency of the solar panels of our customers will be improved with an environmental friendly and affordable method.
Customer Relationships
We will focus on creating a long-term relationship with our customers. Both parties have to adapt their production pathway to each other. Therefore, we expect that there will be a mutual dependency for a long period. If we become a licensor this will also result in a long term relationship. After all, the external party will have to build their own production facilities and they will have to produce the MLAs for a long period in order to get return on their investment.
Eventually we want to be known by our customers as a longtime partner that delivers high quality products. Since our company is a business to business company, we probably will have a limited number of customers and therefore personal attention will be a key factor to our company.
Channels
Our company will be a typical business to business company and there will only be business to business sales (B2B sales). It is expected that there is no interference of an external party such as a retailer. However, when our product will be sold to foreign companies, especially when those companies are located in a country far away from us, it is possible that we need a partnership with an intermediate party to make the distribution logistically possible and efficient.
Customer Segments
We expect that the main customers are solar panel manufactures. Their main goal is to produce efficient and affordable solar panels. However, in practice the efficiency of solar panels is still relatively low. With our MLAs the efficiency of the solar panels will be increased, which make our product useful for them"

*This year we collaborated with another iGEM high school team in Shenzhen, the SZMS_15_Shenzhen. Besides communication on projects and team founding, we help and assist each other achieving experimental or Modeling goals. We helped them achieve an experimental goal in their experiment “Houyi shoots the sun”part. “Houyi Shoots the Sun” We constructed this system with two different kinds of E. coli bacteria, one representing the sun and  the other representing Houyi. The working mechanism is described in the following: first we transform a plasmid with the serial EC 1.7.7.2 to simulate the sun. EC 1.7.7.2 is a sequence of an enzyme that catalyses an exothermic reaction., causing the E. coli representing the sun to rise its temperature constantly. It should be noted that the expression of EC 1.7.7.2 is regulated by LuxI through the QS system. Second, we transformed a plasmid containing LuxI into another kind of E. coli representing Houyi. Due to the fact that the expression of EC 1.7.7.2 can be repressed by the presence of LuxI, the E. coli representing Houyi can effectively lower the temperature of the previously described E. coli with EC 1.7.7.2.

Divulgation Activities in Barcelona
“The closer we get to people, the more they sympathize with the                             cause.”
Spain is the country that has more bars per inhabitant in the world.                             Therefore, if you ever want to catch people attention, you better go to any bar and present                             your project to the audience.
Since our project aims to ease celiac people life, we arranged                             divulgation activities over the summer in bars and coffee shops that compromise with                             scientific divulgation. It was a must that all bars had gluten-free meals in their menu.
“Learning by playing”
We offered games based on educational technology using Kahoot                             (game-based learning platform). We asked a set of questions to the audience:
What is gluten, a protein or a sugar? What is cross-contamination? Does                             gluten apports nutritional value to the food?
By answering this questions, we were expecting to clear up                             misunderstandings related to celiac disease. Over the project, we realized there are yet                             several myths associated with gluten-free food.
There is much work yet to do!
We also brought the audience the opportunity to know                         more about the iGEM competition and synthetic biology.

Introducing gluten free food at the University
“Time to cook! The BioIQS Barcelona team changed the laboratory                                 for the kitchen for a while.”
We baked around fifty cakes, most of them gluten-free, for demonstrating                             that life without gluten is pretty tasty.
During two days we sold cakes, cookies and candies at the entry hall of                             our university. We also made a challenge that consisted of eating two pieces of cakes, one                             with gluten and the other one gluten-free, and students had to guess which one was suitable                             for celiac people.
Collaborations
We visited the iGEM UPF CRG Barcelona Team. Being able to share what we                             were investigating, how we managed to deal with deadlines and fundraising was such a good                             experience.
It took part in front of the PRBB (The Barcelona Biomedical Research                             Park), where the IGEM UPF CRG Team is working"
USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#ConceptualFramework#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," Ι, the repressor Χ and, probably, some degradation term, μmR. So we can draw a visual representation of this system:
As we can see, with this representation it is easier to see the relations between the classes. Where the spheres represent my equations, arrows going to the sphere is an input and out is an output (When there is a block, like the one going out of mR, it represents that that doesn’t decrease).
Now, knowing these postulates, we can write our equations:
*Note: As said before, the differential equations are continuous equations. But sometimes it’s interesting to represent all these small variations in discrete time, for example. So that difference equations can be written, i.e., equations that represent the next state, t+1, as a direct function of the state before, t. A good example is the Nicholson–Bailey model, that describes the population of a parasite and its host, for time t+1 depending in the populations in the time t.
Our models are based in differential equations, you can check it as an example of differential equations.
Boolean Models
Other interesting equations for synthetic biology are the boolean equations. Boolean models are mathematical representations of a system where we just have states of variables, usually represented by 0 or 1, meaning ON or OFF, Expressed or not expressed. It’s interesting that this representation occurs in discrete time and with a deterministic bias. They show themselves very useful when you have a very complex system of expression, with many genes controlling each other, then you can easily assign states for each part of the system. Using this kind of model you have a huge simplification, on purpose, so a lot of information will be lost, therefore accuracy, but a lot to be gained in the analysis, specially with the aid of computers.
For creating this kind of model, as always, you need to understand your system, but in this case the regulation is simpler. Like with a differential equation, the visual representation can be very helpful.
The actual model has basically 3 aspects: The variables, their states and their effects in the others. The variables are your circuits or activators/repressors having their have their states as 0 or 1. They also have their effects one in the other, as activator or repressor.
Let’s again take a simple example. Suppose a system with 4 circuits, A, B, C and D. A acts as activator of D, and repressor of B. B is a repressor of C. C is a repressor of D. D is a"

Large Phage May - June Notebook: Experiments
Overview
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
UV Selection Test
I) Purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to subject small samples of phage to varying doses of UV light. This experiment is thought to work by selecting against phage with only one copy of each gene. When critical genes are knocked out of these phage, the phage cannot replicate themselves. Phage with multiple genomes (and thus, larger capsids) are much more resistant to UV light because they have multiple copies of each gene.
II) Expected Outcome
We predict that phage more resistant to mutation and UV light will be the ones that will survive the irradiation the best.
III) Materials
Liquid high-titer phage lysate
Parafilm
Overnight culture of E. coli
UV light (we used the UV light inside a BSL-2 hood)
IV) Methods
1. Under the hood, divide a piece of paraflim into sections, labeling each section with a time for how long that sample will be subjected to UV light. (We usually do 1 minute increments)
2. Place 20 uL from the phage stock on each section of parafilm.
3. Start the UV light for the incremental time amount. When the time is up, turn the light off.
4. Remove 10 uL from the first section and place it in 0.5 mL of E. coli in a test tube.
5. Start the UV light again, and repeat steps 3-5.
6. Plate out all infected E. coli samples in LB top agar.

Therefore, metadata of the DNA sequences describing how the part behaves and the experiments performed to create models of and validate this behaviour could be argued to be of less priority, though have been flagged as an area of improvement in the knowledge infrastructure.  Synthetic biology follows the evolving norm of openness but cannot escape from also requiring some level of uniformity and quality.
External Influences: Property Rights in Synthetic Biology
Writing peer-reviewed publications at the end of the competition is impeded, given resource and time constraints, as teams start preparing for next year’s competition. The participating teams do submit their research and data to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts which belongs solely to iGEM. There are also a handful of startups that have come out of iGEM (“iGEM Startups”, n.d.).
Treating biological parts as data is inherent in the field, with established agreements on their ownership, control, and release.  However, this is not synonymous to saying current practices for optimizing openness are without consequences in productivity.  Policies for openness by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts are evaluated for the opportunities and constraints they infuse into the data practices of the field.   The external influence of patent claims within synthetic biology will be shown to have effects on what data can be transferred across research environments and on the choices which scholars in synthetic biology make about what projects to pursue.
Given that the contribution and further improvement of parts are embedded in the competition, the Registry’s affiliation with iGEM has been mutually beneficial.  While the community resource can depend on continued use and subsequent growth and improvement, iGEM participants simultaneously have reliable access to parts and information in the repository so that they may engineer and design biological systems based on BioBricks  (Baldwin et al., 2012).  Incidentally, use of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts requires engagement with the “BioBricks Public Agreement” to facilitate such openness (“The BioBrick User Agreement”, 2015).  It entails a legal strategy aiming to reconcile open access to data through free use with the patentability of a product emerging from the combinations of parts (Baldwin et al., 2012).  As of 2012, the success of such a structure “remains to be seen” and its efficacy is under dispute (Baldwin et al., 2012).  Notably, several iGEM teams have engaged with this agreement: for example, Oxford iGEM proposed a reach-through license agreement as a better alternative. The University of Ottawa iGEM team documented their struggle with licensing in the submission of"

Growth curve of yeast in blood serum
In order to certify the feasibility of yeast maintaining its previous cell activity while reacting with histamine in blood serum, rather than become incompetent or being precipitated by antigens such as IgG in the environment, we carried out a series of experiment by culturing modified yeast in different ratio of blood serum. The ability of proliferation as well as cell activity are revealed by determination of growth curve in different groups.
One thing worth mentioning is that the blood serum (BS) we use is derived from mice with no immunogenicity. After extracted from mice, the product simply went through the procedure of precipitation and bottled without heat inactivation. Control group was set by filter sterilized half of the blood serum (FBS) to remove large protein and potential bacteria (. This procedure aims to judge whether the complement protein would influence the growth of yeast.
The experiment is designed as follows.
Table 3. The sample loading form
Due to the fact that normally yeast would enter logarithmic growth phase in 4 to 8 hours, we choose 1~7 h as the 1st stage measure point and 18~19h as the 2nd stage measure point to judge whether the yeast has entered plateau phase. The density of yeast is measured by OD600.
Fig.9 The growth curve of yeast cultured in YPD
E: 10% BS+YPD  F: 10% FBS+YPD  I: 1% BS+YPD  J: 1% FBS+YPD
As can be seen from Fig.9, the addition of blood serum didn’t influence the growth of yeast significantly.
Fig.10 The growth curve of yeast cultured in water
C: 10% BS+ water  D: 10% FBS+ water  G: 1% BS+ water  H: 1% FBS+ water
On the contrast, the addition of blood serum did enhance the proliferation of yeast when comparing the curve of H and G with C and D. What’s more, comparing the curve of adding the original blood serum or sterilized one, we can see that the original blood help yeast to grow better without any precipitation.
Fig.11 The growth curve of yeast cultured in pure blood serum
A: 100% BS  B: 100% FBS
Compared the curve of original blood serum culturing and the sterilized one, it is obvious that the yeast cultured in original product outgrew the sterilized group in the first few hours. Though the two group reach the same"
ColumbiaU_NYC,2016,Team:ColumbiaU NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"2440. Then, we picked colonies with different GFP      intensities to obtain a library of different constitutive      promoters as well.
Qualitative Analysis of Rhamnolipids
Regarding the production of rhamnolipids, we researched a      few different tests before deciding to try the CTAB      qualitative test with pure rhamnolipids. Furthermore, we      decided to try freeze-dry P. putida to determine what      percent of the bacteria would be viable after extended      periods of time. We could use this knowledge to determine      shelf-life of the mosquito repellent for commercial      applications.
Mosquito and Mouse Experiments
We reached out to several researchers as well in      preparation for future experiments. We contacted      Dr. Voshall at Rockefeller University who does mosquito      testing.  We want to determine what concentration of      mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids actively repel      mosquitoes. We also reached out to Dr. Christiano who      works with mice to discuss whether we can use her      laboratory to conduct rhamnolipid experiments using human      skin grafted on mice. In preparation for the meeting, we      drafted a set of experimental protocols and created a      Powerpoint presentation.
Community Outreach
We planned a community outreach project in which we can      administer a survey to individuals to determine if they      are highly attracted or unattracted to mosquitoes and then      use next generation sequencing to sequence samples of the      skin biome to deduce if there are any commonalities.

Freeze Dry
The initial freeze dry experiments were successful but we      realized that we need a more quantitative way to analyze      the success of the freeze dry. Perhaps, we need to      incorporate a survival rate or ratio calculation. We      decided that we need to also extend the timeline for the      freeze dry experiments to more closely mimic real world      situations.
Rhamnolipid Quantification
We conducted the CTAB experiments with the rhamnolipids      and blue halos were present. However, we realized CTAB      only works well for higher concentrations than what we      need to produce. Furthermore, we would need a more      quantitative metric than qualitative one. We brainstormed      and figured that we could use an image application to      measure the diameter of the halos and correlate that to      the concentration of rhamnolipids.
Community Outreach
We had several meetings this week one of which was with      Dr. Shaman, a skin swabbing expert, to"

Assembling the optimised bioplastic producing operon
We made two new improved constructs by modifying the native operon:
The modellers in the drylab predicted that an increased level of pha B enzyme will increase the amount of PHB produced and therefore we decided to change the native Ralstonia eutropha promoter and RBS to a strong constitutive E.coli promoter (J23104) and RBS (0034) in front of the operon. We have succeeded with the swap and built the new biobrick BBa_K1149052 which we refer to as constitutive phaCAB. In parallel, we have also assembled a different configuration of transcription initiation region: the ""hybrid"". Surprisingly, our results show that our ""hybrid"" phaCAB construct BBa_K1149051 significantly increased bioplastic production compared to native pha CAB. Please read on to discover more. </p>
We tested the promoter and RBS by cloning them in front of amilCP blue chromoprotein gene  ( BBa_K1149020 ). As you can see from the plate below, this expresses a bright blue protein, which became an intrinsic part of our BioNouveau palette.
In order to change the promoter, we designed a forward primer that binds to the beginning of the first gene in the operon and contains a Xba restriction site: Pha_Fw (cgcttctagagatggctactgggaaaggagccg). We used pha_Fw and the suffix primer G1005 primer pain to amplify the insert out of the backbone. The new promoter and RBS were J23104 and B0034 from the biobrick BBa_K608"
Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," due to the abundance of testing methods and less potential error for testing our construct.
We developed a feedforward loop for our circuit and framed our project in terms of canonical biological circuits.
We considered the weighted logic of bacterial compared to the digital logic of electronics, the presence of biological noise, and the issues of lag time in the response of our sensor.
We recognized the importance of the tuning of the two components of the circuit, the activity of the promoter, and the rates of degradation of the components.
Evaluating Biological Components
Recognition
At the beginning of our project, we had to narrow down the pool of gene candidates for each component of our biological circuit. We conducted literature searches and held prolonged discussions on potential sequences for use. In order to optimize our circuit, we turned to experts in diverse fields right at Cornell.
Exploration
Prof. Guillaume Lambert, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University
April 9, 2018
Professor Lambert specializes in biological microfluidics and the development and characterization of synthetic biological regulatory elements for the purpose of creating biological circuits. He first shared his concerns regarding lag time in receiving the frequency and with reporting the output. To solve this, he mentioned the possibility of tuning the system, with different degradation tags and using the orthogonal mf-Lon system. These suggestions had a major influence on our modeling and design process. We discussed the possibility of other reporters that could be used to screen the effectiveness of our system, such as antibiotic resistance genes that would be activated by our system. This reminded us to not simply assume fluorescence is the best reporter for our project. In our recurring contact with him, we continually addressed questions not only in our design, but also in the eventual testing of our circuit.
Prof. John March, School of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University
April 21, 2018
Professor March was one of the first experts we contacted to evaluate our biological band-pass filter based on his comprehensive knowledge of rewiring cellular signaling circuitry. He suggested approaching the problem of lingering protein intermediates and products in the system by using plasmids with different copy numbers to tune the relative levels of each type of protein. At this stage, we had not yet decided on how we would approach the temperature-sensitive activation of our band-pass filter. Professor March helped begin our search by providing us with resources on heat-sensitive promoters and heat-shock proteins. This eventually led to us looking into the RNA thermometer that is in our final design.

I graduated from the university’s bioengineering program this June and stuck around to help advise the team and build the project up. I am currently in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Ph.D. program at UC San Francisco, hoping to eventually apply synthetic biology methods to either discover new drugs or elucidate drug-bacteria interactions. While in Seattle, my past times were food hunting, movie watching, and city exploring. Now in San Francisco, my hobbies are food hunting, movie watching, city exploring, and complaining about rent.
Originally from Korea, she moved to Raincouver (Vancouver), Canada when she was in middle school and eventually to the United States for college. She is a senior majoring in Biochemistry and will be finally graduating in 2017. As a wet lab member, Sunny has been struggling to be friends with ""the Violacein"" pathway! Sunny is happy that iGEM has introduced her to the field of synthetic biology. Outside of iGEM, Sunny enjoys watching movies, playing ukulele, and listening to K-pop.

TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"edrop Approach. Two nanoparticle designs are shown above, with high and low concentration. By applying high conc. eyedrops first until [GSR] reaches Low Eq, then switching to low conc. eyedrops to maintain Low Eq, this approach reaches equilibrium faster.
Finding the Concentration of Eyedrop 1
We cannot change the shape of the concentration graphs, because we cannot change the amount of time to reach equilibrium. This means we can find a formula for the percent of GSR delivered. At equilibrium, the value is 1. By curve fitting an exponential to the graph, we find our ""percent delivered"" function.
The concentration depends on the desired amount of time to reach equilibriu, which we will call ""time limit"". By plugging the time limit into our percent function, we will know the percentage delivered at the time limit. We divide our goal concentration by this percentage, to find the equilibrium concentration of the red curve. Using the results our model, we can find the concentration of GSR in nanoparticles of eyedrop 1.
We built a functional calculator to find the concentrations of both eyedrops. This is an extention of the eyedrop provided at the bottom of the Model page.

Model 4: Eyedrop Prototype
We have found a nanoparticle design to deliver GSR. We also need to model the function of eyedrops, to determine the concentration of GSR-loaded nanoparticles to put in eyedrops, and analyze how sensitive the resulting system is.
Bioavailability of GSR Delivery
The eye is well protected from foreign material attempting to enter the eye. The corneal epithelium is the most essential barrier against topical drugs in eyedrops, and as a result, much of drugs in eyedrops are lost in tear drainage (Lux 2003).
Bioavailability describes the proportion of the drug that reaches the site of action, regardless of the route of administration. For example, it is estimated that only 1-5% of an active drug with small solutes in an eyedrop penetrates the cornea (Bonate 2005). In the case of nanoparticles, which are much larger than chemical molecules, more is lost (Fraunfelder"

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Results PR_-_-_TEXT.html,"formation. After mutation, the Leu-113 is replaced by Trp, which has an indolyl, an aromatic heterocyclic substituent. This causes another π–π stacking interaction (Figure 6), which increases the Van der Waals interactions, thus stabilizing the conformation. What’s more, Trp-113 generates another H-bond between VEGF and VEGF-scFv, which is contributes directly to the binding energy.
Figure 6. π–π stacking between Trp-113 and Phe-112 after mutation
The mutation of Tyr-134, however, has no significant influence on the Gibbs free energy. It may have minor effects on the conformation stability. Based on Monte Carlo method, RosettaAntibodyDesign does not always give the best answer.
After 4 point mutations, the binding affinity has increased a bit. The interface energy has decreased from -46.405 to -50.641 REU, calculated by RosettaDock.
Also, we have tested a previous part, BBa_K1694003. This is another VEGF-scFv, differing from the one we used. First, we used PIGSPro [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], a web-based tool to build the structure of immunoglobulins. The next step is finding the interface. After 5000 times of global docking and 1000 times of local docking, finally we find the interface of the previous parts, along with VEGF. After some structure refinements, we tested the binding energy of them. From the interface score calculated by RosettaDock, we can see a big difference. Therefore, our parts improvement work is successful.
Figure 7.Comparing binding energy between three types of VEGF-scFv
The interface score is calculated by RosettaDock, which directly shows binding energy.
Figure 8. Parts (BBa_K1694003) local docking RMSD
The interface score is calculated by RosettaDock, which directly shows binding energy.
RMSD is calculated compared to the final docking result, expressing the difference between local docking and the final result. There is clear interdependency between interface score and RMSD, which shows a potential well near the final result. Within the potential well, the structure will be stable. Therefore, our docking result is reliable.
Testing in wet lab
Above, VEGF-scFv was modified in silico to enhance its binding ability to VEGF ligand in our modelling. In protein expression and interaction section, we hope to mutate"

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#secondtry#KillingImprovements_-_-_TEXT.html," M. aeruginosa to test the binding ability of   the MVN produced by our E. coli. A similar MVN binding assay has been carried out by Kehr, J. C. et al. in   2006, but our experiment is different in that we fused eYFP to the MVN and we did the experiment with two different   strains of cyanobacteria.
We used pET-21a(+) as the vector to construct a plasmid for the expression of the His6-tagged version   of MVN-eYFP (see Fig. 4) During construction, we retained the promoter, RBS, His&#8901Tag and terminator that   were on the original vector. We inserted MVN and eYFP coding sequence into the plasmid via Gibson Assembly. After   the construction, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and induced afterwards to initiate   the expression. After lysing the cells, the crude extracts were applied to Ni2+-nitriloacetate columns   and the fusion protein was purified and later used in our binding assay.
Figure 4. Final construct of the protein-purifying plasmid. The promoter,   RBS and terminator are native ones on the pET-21a(+) vector. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein domain linker   added to avoid protein interference between MVN and eYFP.
The purified protein was later used in binding assay with two different strains of cyanobacteria, M.   aeruginosa PCC7806 and M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cyanobacteria colony were broken up by mild   sonication at first. The protein was added to aliquots of cyanobacteria culture and later observed under   fluorescence microscope. (Results here)
rTEV protease digestion assay
INP can help display our protein on the outer membrane, but the orientation is unsure. So we designed this rTEV   protease digestion assay to verify that MVN is oriented outwards into the medium. Also we can roughly estimate the   amount of outward-displayed MVN that can be digested each E. coli from the result too.
We constructed the functioning plasmid by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The plasmid uses pSB1C3 as the   vector and expresses the fusion protein INPNC-MVN-mRFP. We designed a 7aa protein linker named Linker2 between INPNC   and MVN which can be specifically recognized and digested by"

For next week, this is the list of things we need to accomplish:
1. Order new dropout media that has raffinose as its carbon source rather than glucose
2. Once the new media has arrived, we need to prepare the proper double dropout mix for media and for plates
3. Glycerol stock successful transformations from 7/4 and from 7/8
4. Additional double transformations of parts
5. (Most importantly) we need to run Test #1 again using what we learned yesterday.  Of course, 1-4 simply prepare us for re-doing Test #1
Concerning our next round of transformations, we have decided to focus on preparing for the test of our three available repressors.  This include GliR (Z0415), LexR (Z0412), and YY1R (Z0416).  One of the main reasons for focusing on these parts is that we currently lack a null activator part, so we cannot complete rigorous tests of our parts individually.  For testing these three parts, we will need to complete the following transformations:
GliR
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
3. pRS304* + GliR reporter (Z0510)
4. GliR (Z0415) + pRS306
5. nullR + GliR reporter**
6. GliR + GliR reporter**
LexR
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
7. pRS304* + LexR reporter (Z0418)
8. LexR (Z0412) + pRS306
9. nullR + LexR reporter**
10. LexR + LexR reporter**
YY1
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306

12. YY1R (Z0416) + pRS306
13. nullR + YY1R reporter**

Useful link: http://syntheticbiology.org/Abstraction_hierarchy.html
Week of June 15, 2009
Monday
Group meeting - presentations from Data Model, Plug-ins, and Visualization (Richard and me!)
Richard discovered there was a new Substance.jar library (for the skins) that might possibly work with JavaFX
We spent the afternoon trying to get Clotho to work with the new Substance.jar
Got Clotho working
But JavaFX plugin still crashes Clotho
Tuesday
Did some searching for other toolkits for making drag and drop GUI's in Java
Turned up an example of a drag and drop GUI made with Java AWT at http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Swing-JFC/Draganddrop.htm
Drag and drop GUI definitely doable in Java AWT, but cumbersome
We (Doug, Richard, and I) decided at the end of the day that we would just make the visualization piece as a standalone using JavaFX and somehow connect it to Clotho
Wednesday
Learning JavaFX
GUI applications with JavaFX tutorial: http://java.sun.com/javafx/1/tutorials/ui/
Got an icon to drag and drop
Designing the layout of our visualization piece
Thursday
Visualization meeting
Concluded that connecting a JavaFX piece to Clotho would be more troublesome that it is worth
Richard discovered that the NetBeans Visual Library API could be used outside of a NetBeans Module
Concluded that would be the best way to go, keeps the visualization piece as a Clotho plugin
Things to work on
Thumbnail drag (me)
Grid scheme (Richard)
Listeners (for mouse events)
Object to picture relationships
Visual library as plugin to Clotho

I spent most of this week trying to make a working thumbnail drag.  That is, I wanted to be able to have a pane with thumbnails and another working pane.  When the user drags a thumbnail image from the thumbnail pane to the working pane, a copy of the thumbnail image would appear on the working pane where the user let go of the mouse.  However, this turned out to be a very difficult task in Java/Netbeans Visual Library.  Netbeans Visual"

Applied Design for the advanced engineering of a lung-on-a-chip microfluidic device
Estimates from the World Health Organization predict a resurgence of bacteria to their long-lost top spot among the most devastating human diseases. How did it come to that? Since the discovery of Alexander Fleming, the first scientist that invented and proved the concept of antibiotics, over the years scientists have discovered a vast number of antibiotics to effectively treat bacterial infections. We could fight most bacterial threats for a long time which lead to a notion of false comfort that everything is under control! However, with the current overuse of antibiotics and acquired resistances among bacteria we are about to enter a new era, the post antibiotic era.  We are now reaching the tipping point, at which new strategies are required to overcome multiresistance and prevent a resurgence of devastating infections. Our Project will help to combat multiresistant-infections with a Trojan-Horse-Approach utilizing gallium-loaded siderophores as a resistance-resistant therapy.
Animal testing has been the method of choice for simulating and predicting human responses to drugs, chemicals, pathogens and environmental toxins; however, animal studies are costly, lengthy and controversial, and their results often fail to predict human responses. These problems raise serious economical, ethical and scientific issues in areas ranging from environmental monitoring and biomedical devices to the development of new therapeutics and cosmetics.
With our method we will create a possible therapy to fight the imminent danger of devastating pandemics from multiresistant bacteria. We don’t want to rely on animal-testing, but on the in vitro simulation of grown human cells in physiological condition. Similar solutions would include living cells cultured in 2D monolayers, 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) gels or multicellular spheroids. But these conventional models lack the ability to fully recapitulate integrated physiological functions at the organ level.
Organs-on-chips’ are microengineered biomimetic systems containing microfluidic channels lined by living human cells, which replicate key functional units of living organs to reconstitute integrated human organ-level pathophysiology in vitro. These microdevices can be used to test efficacy and toxicity of drugs"

With the help of e-SAM system, we can demonstrate gene-expression with modifying the switches.
Visit and feedback from high school teachers
In September, the team welcomed students from several high schools nearby and freshers in BNU, who had interests in biology and the willing to introduce our model to their friends. A few days later we received encouraging students’ responses from SanFan and other departments of BNU, who gave a high appraisal to our engineering model and told us to provide them with a more detailed proposal as soon as we would have it ready.
As a result, in October, several high school teachers from SanFan came to BNU to meet with our team to discuss the possible integration of our e-SAM system in their high school's biology curriculum. We provided them a live demonstration of how the e-SAM system works and we discussed the impact it would have on the high school courses of normal students heatedly. The teachers responded to us that one of the most disturbing questions about science curriculum was the lack of facilities. Many essential science instruments such as centrifuge can be too dangerous and too expensive for high school provide. They e-SAM system can make great contribution at teaching-cost reduction, worthy to spread across high school education.

BCCS-Bristol 2010 Biobrick
1. First Experience with BBa_k381001
Objective:
1. Test operation in liquid LB at 37 ° C and to KNO3 50 mM.
Methodology:
1. We used six falcon tubes of 25 mL. Three tubes were used for inoculation of the colonies from 06/09/11 and 12/09/11.
2. Two positive controls were prepared and one negative control for each test.
3. To positive control tubes we added 10 ml of liquid LB, 9.7 uL of chloramphenicol (33μg/mL) and 50mM of KNO3.
4. To negative control tube we added the same amount of LB and Chloramphenicol specified in the previous line, except KNO3.
5. Each tube was inoculated with the colonies; three of them with the conlonies from 06/09/11 and the rest with colonies from 12/09/11.
6. Tubes were incubated at 37 ° C for 48 hours.
After 48 hours we noticed that all the tubes for both tests showed no
change, including positive and negative controls. Our experiment was
based on BCCS-Bristol experiment. While reviewing the experiments of
Edinburgh in 2009, who designed the promoter used in the BioBrick
BCCS-Bristol, we realized that the promoter express better in minimal
essential media than in LB, but we do not rule out that we could have
made a mistake in the experience preparation prevented us from
showing the right results, which is why we decided to do the experiment
again.
2. Second Experience
Objectives:
1. Test the BioBrick operation to different substrates and temperatures, using KNO3  40 mM:
a. Substrates:
LB
Minimal essential medium
Saline solution
b. Temperatures:
8°C
23°C
37°C
2. Improve the characterization of the BioBrick tested in other substrates to study the performance of the promoter.

LacZ
The motivation for the use of the LacZ reporter sequence in our experiments stems from our initial attempts to characterise the PyeaR promoter sequence using the BBa_K216009 part created by the Edinburgh team for the 2009 competition.
LacZ is the reporter sequence used to assay promoter sensitivity by way of a β-Galactosidase assay - it encodes the enzyme β-Galactosidase. The molecular basis of this experiment is the cleavage of the compound o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside (ONPG), an analogue of lactose (the primary substrate of β-Galactosidase), to galactose and o-nitrophenol. The latter is a yellow product with an easily measurable absorbance at 420 nm. When ONPG is added to a reaction mix in excess of the β-Galactosidase enzyme, the production of o-nitrophenol over time is a direct indicator of the activity of the enzyme. Thus if LacZ is regulated by a specific promoter, the activity of the enzyme is directly proportional to the activity of the promoter.
From the data collected from this asasy, a value for the activity of a promoter can be derived using the following equation:
(A420 gives a value for o-nitrophenol concentration; A550"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid"

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Citizen Science_-_-_TEXT.html," developed with a group of students from University of Rennes.  This platform is used to store the smell evaluation data entered by Citizen Scientists. The Smell Game project web platform is available at: http://smellofus.synbio4all.org.To find out more about how this project emerged and was developed see the 'The Smell Game' page on the Wiki. Effect of deodorant on body odor According to Fig. 2A, wearing deodorant does not alter the intensity of the smell, while people that do not use deodorant are considered to have a more pleasant smell (Fig. 2B). This statistically significant conclusion is based on more than 400 analyses of 200 unique samples. Gender effect on body odor There is no measurable difference between male and female body odor samples, for both intensity (Fig. 3A) and pleasantness (Fig. 3B). This result is contradictory to the popular belief that females have a less intense and a more pleasant odor (http://aurasensory.com/blog/did-you-know/fascinating-facts-about-underarm-odor-and-bacteria). One explanation could be that most women shave their armpits, which seems to be a condition that favors the bacterial growth. Age effect on the odor intensity Odor intensity was found to increase with the age (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the odor intensity of the 10-20 year olds was lower than the 20-30, and 30-35 years old participants. We limited our study to these four groups, to reflect the demographics of the participants. Horror movie night experiment We collected samples of 17 donors before and after watching a scary movie. The samples were rated on a scale from 0 to 5 in strength and pleasantness. At least 4 people analyzed every sample. The difference between the after and before tube was plotted for every individual (Fig. 5). After statistical analysis, we found no global significant difference between the participant's body odor before and after watching the movie (Wilcoxon test, difference in strength p=0.69; difference in pleasantness p=0.84). Though, some individuals did experiment a significant change.
Achievements
Overall, more than 600 participants from all around the world collaborated with us (France, Poland, Colombia, Israel, UK). They were aged from 5 to 65 years old. We hosted several smell events where Citizen Scientists were able to learn about our project and participate in it. One of the events took place at the 'Cité des Sciences' (a known Science Museum in"

Analysis of human DNA extracted from stool specimens is a recent, simple and potentially interesting approach for cancer diagnostics and for colorectal cancer screening.
All of this taken into account, we decided to modify an organism, such as a probiotic bacteria or yeast, to secrete a sensor capable of detecting this L-DNA molecules and alert the problem to the patient. Check our Parts to see how!

Figure 5: Schematic of the fluoride riboswitch regulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP)
How CHOP works:
Using the ΔcrcB E. coli strain, which can accumulate fluoride intracellularly
The Riboswitch detects fluoride
Fluoride activates the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme
Which allows for the growth of bacteria on agar plates with the antibiotic chloramphenicol"

Software
Main packages
Python(2.7): The high-level programming language python was used in combination with Django to develop the web-based interface and client-side applications.
Packages, plugins or libraries loaded by some of our python functions
Requests: The purpose of this library is to do simple http requests.
Biopython (>= 1.61): Just like bioperl this package contains tools for computational molecular biology.
xhtml2pdf: The converter package xhtml2pdf was applied to generate pdf from HTML/CSS templates.
BeautifulSoup: The BeautifulSoup HTML/XML parser was used for quick-turnaround applications.
celery: Asynchronous scheduling framework.
kombu: Database-based message passing framework.
python-openbabel(>= 2.3.2) : Python bindings to openbabel for 2D (chemical) structure generation.
UNAFold and MFold utils: UNAFold was required by Gibthon for DNA/RNA folding predictions.
MySQL: The relational database management system MySQL was utilized for database creation and maintenance.
MySQL - Python connector: A conncetor between the programming language python and the database management system.
Django(>= 1.5): The web application framework Django was used to achieve an easier database connection and is based on python. Since we improved and added basic functions of Gibthon ( iGEM Team Cambridge 2010 ), the integration was easier to handle using the same frame work.
Django packages
django-registration: Handles user registrations and logins.
django-annoying: Gibthon uses this package. It is thought to eliminate annoying things in Django.
south: The south package handles database migration (database independent).
django-celery: The package was used for the integration of Celery (asynchronous task queue/job queue) into Django.
C++
CMake: Cross platform build system used by the NRPSDesigner.
MySQL C++ connector: C++ library for MySQL access.
libXML: C library for XML handling.
libcurl: C library for client-side URL transfers.
Boost.program_options: C++ library for command-line option parsing.
