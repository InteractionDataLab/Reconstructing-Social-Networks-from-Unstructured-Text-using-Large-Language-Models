Results from weekend plates:
From left to right, top row: 1mM IPTG with 0.075 mg/mL tyrosine, 1mM IPTG and 0.3 mg/mL tyrosine, and then 1mM IPTG and 0.6 mg/mL tyrosine From left to right, bottom row: 0.075 mg/mL tyrosine, 0.3 mg/mL tyrosine, and then 0.6 mg/mL tyrosine.
It appears that the bacteria were much too high a concentration; they formed lawns.  As we saw on the first plates, pigment production is reduced at high bacterial concentrations.  However, it is encouraging that the darkest plate is the one with the greatest tyrosine concentration and IPTG.
To follow up, the experiment was repeated with 1/100 and 1/1000 dilutions of bacterial culture on the following plates:
100ug/ml Ampicillin, 15 ug/ml CuSO4, 0.3 mg/mL tyrosine
100ug/ml Ampicillin, 15 ug/ml CuSO4, 0.6 mg/mL tyrosine
100ug/ml Ampicillin, 7.5 ug/ml CuSO4, 0.075 mg/mL tyrosine, 0.5mM IPTG

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the engineers of the future?” by Christina Agapakis & Patrik Boyle (Ginko Bioworks), USA 2010. After a short discussion, he gave us an introduction to the history of genetic engineering, its legal regulations and how it can be distinguished from synthetic life sciences. “ELSA” (or “ELSI”) stands for “Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects (or Implications)“ and is a concomitant research in modern life sciences. In the light of ELSA, he discussed potentials, risks and ethical views on synthetic life sciences.
The last lecture on 03.07 was given by our PI Ilka Axmann. She focused on genetic engineering methods that are currently used in microbiology. Her presentation started with simple information about synthetic biology to build a basic understanding. After that the newly obtained knowledge was trained with everyday objects, where the audience - with some help of PI Ilka Axmann - had to guess  the content of GMOs or genetically produced additions.
For us it is very important to give all interested people the chance to think about all possible aspects of Synthetic Life Sciences. In this context it was a desire for us to be available for all questions after each presentation. During pizza and drinks many listeners came to us with interesting questions and discussion topics, which could be talked about in a small group.
The results of our surveys show that there are still some concerns and prejudices against synthetic life sciences among the population. Some listeners were surprised and sometimes shocked as to which methods can be used in today's agriculture and which safe methods are prohibited due to ethical concerns. As feedback it was often a relief to know more about the topic and to understand the background better.
Survey
Furthermore, we surveyed the listeners before and after each lecture in order to get a general overview of the opinion on Synthetic Biology. As can be seen from Fig.1, 84% of the participants have previously dealt regularly with Synthetic Biology, 16% have dealt only now and then with it and none of the audience not at all. It becomes clear that our lecture series initially addressed only people who have dealt with the topic before, so it can be assumed that they are no strangers to the topic.
However, 50% of participants thought that Synthetic Biology has little or no impact on our daily lives (Cf. Figure 2). A balance arises in this question though as the other 50% of respondents disagree and are of the opinion that Synthetic Biology does have an impact on our everyday lives.
One of the most interesting questions on how much Synthetic Biology will change our lives has also been answered very"

Notebook – Results – 2. Confirmation of DNA sequence
As shown in Figure 1 (2AGL_DT), we confirmed the construction of crr gene encoding IIA(Glc) from E. coli into Biobrick format – flanking by restriction sites of EcoRI and XbaI at the prefix, and SpeI and PstI at the suffix – followed by the sequence of double terminator (BBa_B0015). The other constructs which able to be confirmed by DNA sequencing was the parental plasmid containing crr gene only. While the rest of plasmids did not contain expected sequence.
While the final construct to be expected, namely BBa_J04450 followed by constitutive promoter/RBS/crr/double terminator was actually the sequence of BBa_J04450 only as shown in figure below. The data from forward sequence and reverse sequence (Figure 2; J04450_CP_RB_2AGL_DT FWD/REV) revealed the prefix and suffix sequences clearly.
However, we can confirm the sequence of basic part in our project namely BBa_J23119 (constitutive promoter), BBa_B0034 (RBS) and BBa_B0015 (double terminator) alone. Thus for future works, we can confirm to use the plasmid for construction.

Fig 17: The pUC19 vector we choose to work together, it has the restriction sites and the characteristics we need.
Week 6 (16.08 – 19.08)
Miniprep & Sequencing of pUC19
As described above, the pUC19 vector was used and provided on plates, by our department. To get the DNA of pUC19 miniprep was done. Also, a miniprep of the apparently correct ccdB from the raster-screening was done. After that, the DNA was sent to sequencing and the results have shown that the toxin (ccdB) was not in the sequence anymore (Fig. 18). It was probably looped out by the cells because of its toxicity as a result of the leaky tac-promotor. It was possible because two identical ribosome binding sites at the beginning and at the end of the sequence were designed.
Fig 18: In this figure is shown that the toxin was looped out.
Therefore, a new primer was designed to modify one of the binding sites, as well as, removing the tac-promotor. The tac-promotor could be removed because since we used pUC19 there was no need for it anymore. pUC19 already includes a lac-promotor.
Week 7 (22.08 – 26.08)
Restriction & Ligation of the parts
After deciding to work on with red + mazF and blue + ccdB only, we did a PCR of the two gBlocks red and mazF, followed by a PCR product clean-up (using the protocol: PCR product clean-up kit from Thermo Fisher). The next step was to digest the fragments: red with the restriction enzymes EcoRI + Spe, mazF: XbaI + PstI and pUC19: EcoRI + PstI. Amounts of DNA were as following: pUC 1000ng, PCR-Products (red and mazF) 1000 ng; filled up with buffer and 1 µl restriction enzyme each to 20 µl. The digestion was performed at 37°C for 40 min, as well as, stopped at 80°C for 5 min.
Furthermore, the restricted parts were put together in a 2-step ligation reaction: red + mazF followed by Red_mazF + pUC19.
After ligation an aliquot of the plasmid was cut again by PstI to get a linear fragment and to check the size.

Cardiff_Wales,2016,Team:Cardiff Wales#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," to allow the dCas9 to be directed to an appropriate target sequence but to not cut at the sequence.
Following discussions with Secondary PI Dr Amit Jathoul we aimed to use the sequence of the modified Luciferase X11 enzyme that has been shown to provide a stronger light output when incubated with luciferin. We split the luciferase x11 sequence into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments and planned to attach these to the dCas9 sequence using a short linker sequence (agcagggctgaccccaagaaAaagaggaaggtAtgCggCggttctggGggAggttcAggt)
We synthesized the following IDT gBlocks:
dCas9: 1- 1368 bp
dCas9: 1369- 2739 bp
dCas9: 2738- 4101 bp
LucN: 1-1248 bp
LucC: 1249- 1641 bp
Our plan was to use NEB HiFi Assembly to generate clones that contained the entire dCas9 sequence fused to either LucN (dCas9-LucN) or LucC (dCas9-LucC). We would then use restriction enzyme digestions to introduce these into appropriate expression plasmids.
Unfortunately we were unable to generate appropriate clones using this strategy. This was most likely because of the difficulty in having a two-step process that did not allow analysis of the first step before the second was begun. The first step involved a challenging four-DNA-piece assembly into a single clone, which was then followed by a restriction digest using relatively large DNA fragments at low concentrations.
Later in the project we altered our cloning strategy to utilize a previously developed dCas9 biobrick ( BBa_K1218011 ). In this strategy we aimed to use NEB HiFi assembly to directly attach the LucN or LucC fragments to the dCas9 enzyme before moving these clones to appropriate expression vectors.
Unfortunately in our available time we were unable to make progress on this second strategy but the later development of this project will use this future cloning plan.

From the research of OUC, we can know $k_{dis}$ is the same with the intergenic distance dependence as follows: $$k_{dis}=\left\{\begin{matrix} {0.0072 \pm 0.0048 \qquad 0 \le d \le 25}\\  {0.0220 \qquad d=-4}\\  {0.0072+(0.0004)\cdot (d+10) \qquad -10\le d \le 25} \end{matrix}\right.$$  Where $d=n_{nt}-3$ and $n_{nt}$ is the number of single nucleotides between the starting site and the terminating site. For the different hairpin structure, the value of $k_{com}$ is different and is defined as the length of the hairpin structure:  $$k_{com}= k_{com}^{'} e^{-\beta \Delta Len G_{total2}}$$ Where $k_{com}^{'}$ is the coefficient of the hairpin complex function and $Len$ is the length of hairpin structure determined by the complementary base pairing. Considering $F_{coupling}=\frac{1}{1+C\cdot e^{- \beta \cdot \Delta G_{total2}}}$ as is shown in the hairpin coupling model by OUC, we can get the coupling efficiency as follows: $$cpEff==\frac{k_2 \cdot \delta_1}{k_1 \cdot \delta_2}=\frac{ \delta_2 \cdot k_2^{'} [ e^{-\beta \Delta G_{total2}}+r_{reinit}]}{\delta_1 \cdot k_1^{'} e^{-\beta \cdot \Delta G_{total1}}}$$

For the correct operation of our bistable we need a double ΔrybB-ΔSspb E. coli mutant. We have been sent ΔClpX (control strain) and ΔSspb mutants, and this week we have left the bacteria growing with the pKD46 plasmid in order to delete the rybB gene using the lambda red protocol (Wanner et al.).
Finally, we have grown strains with the iGEM plasmids pSB4C5, pSB4K5, pSB1T3 and pSB4A5 (expressing RFP) and the pMP01226 Apr lineage expressing GFP.
Week 3
This week we have made minipreps of the following plasmids: pKD46, pSB4A5, pSB4K5, pSB1T3, pSB4C5, pKD3, pKD4 and pSB1C3. We have digested the pSB4A5, pSB4K5, pSB1T3 and pSB4C5 iGEM plasmids with EcoRI and PstI in order to get them ready-to-clone our synthetic DNA.
To obtain the double ΔrybB-ΔSspb E. coli mutant, we transformed ΔClpX (as we will use the double ΔrybB-ΔClpx mutants as a control) and ΔSspb mutants with the lambda red plasmid (pKD46 plasmid with ampicillin resistance) by a heat shock transformation protocol. After transformation, we left the cells growing in ampicillin selective medium and we used as negative control ΔSspb and ΔClpx mutants that hadn’t been transformed. Next day, we observed colonies onto the experiment plates, but not in the negative controls. Two positive colonies of each strain carrying the lambda red plasmid were inoculated to make glycerol stocks.
We digested the pKD4 and pSB1C3 plasmids with PstI and pKD3 plasmid with SphI in order to have them linear to check purity and concentration by electrophoresis. We carried out the electrophoresis with the pKD3, pKD4 and pSB1C3 plasmid (digested"

Introduction
ω-3 fatty acids are a key component of the human diet. Our team is recreating this synthetic pathway in E. coli, using genes from the cyanobacteria Synechocystis and the trypanosomatid Leishmania major. Combining the DNA code for elongase and desaturase enzymes, we are planning to convert a fatty acid with a single desaturation into highly valuable ω-3 fatty acids.
Project description
Figure 1: ""Synechocystis sp.""
Figure 2: ""Trypanosome cruzi""
Figure 3: ""Leishmania major""
Omega-3 fatty acids are an essential part of the human diet (Bender, Bender, 1999). Human beings, like all larger organisms, cannot synthesize ω-3 fatty acids. This is due to a lack of the enzyme Δ15 desaturase, which creates a double bond at the 15th carbon of a long-chain fatty acid. Certain micro-organisms, such as microalgae and cyanobacteria, do contain this desaturase and can thus directly synthesize ω-3 fatty acids (Arts et al., 2009). ω-3 fatty acids then enter the food chain – algae are eaten by fish, and seafood is subsequently the main source of ω-3 for humans (Tonon et al., 2002).
However, the current economic policies of overfishing are a serious contributor to marine biodestruction. As the human population is estimated to rise to 9.1 billion by 2050 (Cohen, 2003), pressure on fish stock will increase. Additionally, global warming will reduce the availability of ω-3 (Arts et al., 2009):  in response to high temperatures, microalgae produce less ω-3 desaturated fatty acids and more saturated fatty acids, as desaturated carbon chains cause a lower melting temperature in membranes"
Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", undeveloped fields, or even their backyards so that flowers can grow, giving the bees more access to food. We used seeds from Smooth Blue Aster, Purple Prairie Clover, and Prairie Coneflower to make our seed bombs because they are native to Southern Alberta, and would not be considered an invasive species.
We distributed seed bombs to members of the public and informed them about our project and the plight of the bees. Many people accepted our project and showed their support by signing a petition that supported urban beekeeping in Lethbridge, which is currently illegal.
Urban Planning
As we looked around our city, we noticed that it could be improved in terms of having more flowers around parks and along roadways. By doing this, not only would our city look more aesthetically pleasing, but having more flowers would attract bees to our city. The bees would pollinate the flowers and thus help them survive. Attracting more bees would also help our local agricultural industry by increasing pollination of their crops.
To help focus our ideas, we contacted Parks and Planning officials from our city. Ryan Carriere, the parks planning manager for the City of Lethbridge, responded back to us and we had the chance to interview him.
Interview:
iGEM: We want to have more flowers in our parks and along roadways inside the City of Lethbridge. Do you think we can actually implement this idea?
Ryan: That’s a possibility. [One of the simplest ways] we could increase flowers is [by planting them] along roadways. Some of the problems we might have with that is getting a mixture of flowers that are drought-tolerant, low maintenance, and that are kind of native to the area. We can develop a seed mix like that, but obviously we would look to a group like yourselves to come up with that mix and help us with that. We would have to do some test pilots first, just to see. The price would have to be comparable to the grass seed mix that we use currently. In terms of putting more flowers into parks, Lethbridge is sort of unique in the sense that our river valley that runs through the city has a vast amount of flowers. We don’t use any insecticides throughout the whole city. So we aren’t affecting bees that way. But in terms of the small parks around the city, putting flowers in them, I don’t think would actually make a big difference in the bee health population. I know that Red Deer is implementing these pollinator parks, which to me is basically a ‘word of the day’. In the actual population of bees, putting"

We ran a PCR of the pC13BH minipreps to verify the success of the Gibson assembly on a gel. We also digested pC13AY in order to gel screen it and check if it is successful. We began constructing pA13AW by digesting and ligating pA13AM and pC13E. We also reran a gel of a colony PCR of pAK13AO. Next, we prepped pC13AT and pC13AQ for sequencing.

Ideas for the logo design:
keep it simple
banderole thinner

Mail to Prof. Schwab: Is the one enzyme that we suppose to be sufficient really enough?
Caffeine
2-3 Enzymes (we will use the pathway that uses 3 since it seems more realistic to work) Roman contacted the authors of some papers but did not get any response from them so we do not know how we will obtain the genes.
Gene synthesis is possible (3k bp) but it is questionable whether it is really worth the effort since pathway is rather complicated and concentrations will most likely not reach physiologically active concentrations.
Thaumatin
2 other sweet substances are already available as biobricks but their potency is questionable.
The gene Thaumatin is, as most of the other genes, not BBRFC10 compatible but this does not really pose a problem since it is easily fixable by quickchange mutagenesis.
Gene Synthesis
It is probably very time efficient to synthesize some genes, therefore we need to check what is the cheapest/fastest solution here. Look at

1) Registration for iGEM site & Team affiliation, required to update team wiki.
2) Access and update wiki..  Consider stylization, as well as information content. Who is our audience?  Team info - blurb and caption of team members. Couple of sentences about you and your interests.  Lab Notebook? - Openwetware connection.
3) Research biobrick parts by accessing in Registry of Standard Parts.  XF to see if new combination are already on file?  If not begin documentation of the 3 new assemblies, with image using standard BioBrick icons.  Document bp length of new parts to compare with Gel-Electrophoresis.  How do we test efficacy? (Part for PPM still in brick.)
Is the media okay, is the antibiotic right. Positive tells you whether the cells themselves were capable of taking up our DNA. (Ideally, they should use the same antibiotic resistance, as our parts.
Negative groups tells us whether the antibiotic and media was effective and that the cells were not resistant to the media.
We know that cells were competent they were able to be transformed, and the antibiotic was effective. So the remaining question is whether they were able to be transformed.
The ligation's are in question. Generally the restrictions and ligation's go smoothly.
Tom's Hypothesis is questioning whether the media plates may have been mis-labeled with the wrong antibiotic resistance. Since we used a different resistance for controls, there was no telling.
Possible denaturing of enzymatic proteins from the heat shock on the initial restriction? 80c kill cycle. Vector ? - Linear plasmids - was the amount to small...? Parts - size already was confirmed, according to Tom
No Transformations.... so now what? Primers still on the way. Don't need to go to scratch.

We took pictures from different samples and analyzed them with our software HoloPyGuy. We demonstrate the capture of a micrometer scale used in optical microscopy (first row), which is the prove of our resolving capability. Further on, we captured red blood cells (second row) and bubbles (third row) and analyzed their 3D structure. For a detailed explanation see our software section .

Micromanipulators
In order to align our DIHM setup, it is necessary to focus the brightest spot of the light source to the pinhole. Due to the tiny dimension of this setup, we need to manipulate the objects in the micrometer level. Therefore, we tested different micromanipulators. We started with a concept of BDan from Thingiverse , which lacks flexibility and proportion. Later on, we tried 3D printed flexible bearing micromanipulators , movable with a screw. They failed on accuracy and the ability to move in more than one dimension. Our last and final approach is to split the movement axes using screws for control, as demonstrated below:

The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An ""improvement"" is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. For instance: strengthening the expression of a part by mutating the DNA sequence; modifying one or a few parts in construct (Device) so that it performs its intended job better; improving a cloning or expression vector that can be easily used by the entire community; and of course, troubleshooting and fixing a part reported to be non-functional. Data from an experimental comparison between the original and improved part/ device is strongly recommended. We improved the J23102 J23106 J23116

Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
Great jobs we have done
We devised the tandem promoter scheme to combine a few promoter to precisely express target gene at a required level. Experiments were carried out to prove the feasibility of this plan. A model was constructed to predict the strength of tandem promoter, given the kinds, the number and the order of sub-promoters. We proposed the multistage promoter scheme to switch the expression between several ideal level. Experiments were done to construct the system. In order to insure the orthogonality of the system, the off-target tendency of the regulating protein - dCas9, has been carefully modeled by analyzing the data from six paper about Cas9 off-target behavior.

Experimental measurements
All experiments and measurements were conducted by student members of the iGEM Team TU-Munich 2013 . The team could build on the knowledge of Jeffery Truong, Ingmar Polte and Katrin Fischer who had already participated in last year's competition and already knew the most important techniques and the laboratory. They implemented the lab management from last year from the first moment on, such as our extensive Labjournal .  For the first usage of instruments we obtained an introduction into the lab techniques by an instructor. Measurement itself and the evaluation of the obtained data were done by us.
LC-MS Measurements
The LC-MS measurements were performed to confirm the successful degradation of pollutants by effector proteins which were produced recombinantly or which were expressed by transgenic moss plants. Here we contacted Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann, who already helped us in our last year's iGEM project with the detection of caffeine and xanthohumole. The responsible team member for the LC-MS was in both years Ingmar Polte who performed the degradation experiments, established the contact to Prof. Hofmann and brought the samples to the Chair for Molecular Sensory . At the chair, the student members Ingmar Polte or Andreas-David Brunner contacted the operator of the mass spectrometer (Mr. Friederich or Dr. Stark) with whose they did the sample preparation, the actual measurements and the data evaluation.
ESI-TOF Measurements
In order to confirm the correctness of recombinant proteins they were analyzed in the ESI-TOF mass spectrometer, which is present at our hosting laboratory. For this purpose a student team member did the sample preparation, calculated"

Arsenicosis
Consumption of arsenic contaminated food and water over long term of 5 to 20 years leads to accumulation of the heavy metal in body tissues starting from hair to skin epidermis causing several dreadful symptoms such as:
Hair loss
Hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
Bowen’s lesions
Peripheral neuropathy
Diabetes
Cardiovascular diseases
Still-births to affected pregnant women
Expensive Kits not affordable to the majority of suffering households in West Bengal and Bangladesh.
Cancers of skin, bladder, kidney and lung
Now one can filter groundwater before drinking. However, substantially high amount of As is also ingested through food. When contaminated groundwater is used to irrigate fields of crop plants such as rice or to fill ponds to rear fishes, the heavy metal enters their living tissues and starts getting accumulated therein. Later, when these cereals or fishes enter the human food chain they lead start being absorbed into the human body and getting accumulated in human tissues which later manifest into the symptoms of arsenicosis.
Based on the study conducted in high As contamination Nadia district of West Bengal, India:

Through their millions of years of evolution, cyanobacteria have developed amazing capabilities that I would like to employ for societal needs. By unlocking the secrets of nitrogen fixation in a photosynthetic cell, we could one day transform agriculture to keep up with the demands of our ever expanding population. My passions are solving puzzles (in and out of the lab,) as well as exciting students about the mysteries of science and helping them develop the tools to become society’s problem solvers.

Among all the intestinal tract diseases, diarrhea, bellyache and stomachache are the most common ones. In this part of survey, we mixed intestinal diseases and tract diseases intentionally, and we are surprised to see that only 50.69% of participants can distinguish one from another. However, people know about detailed intestinal diseases, i.e. 70.6% heard about IBD . They also know about common treatments of these diseases. 60.44% know about dietotherapy, 66.21% know the Chinese traditional treatment. Medicine and operation are the most known. 26.37% are conscious of fecal bacteria transplantation, along with the strict test it needs to run, which could be considered a disadvantage. The other advantages of tradition treatments mentioned by participants are pain (58.52%), immune system disorder (53.57%), drug allergy (52.2%) and others (i.e. slow effect). 64.19% of participants never came into contact with any propaganda or advertisement on intestinal diseases, and most (95.87%) of them feel it important to strengthen people’s comprehension of intestinal diseases.
In the second part we asked about gut flora. Most of participants believe the relationship between gut flora and intestinal to be symbiotic. Nearly all of them heard about Escherichia coli, while 49.18% knows Enterococcus faecalis.
In the third part we started propagating our project and gain feedbacks.
In conclusion, the result gives a proof of our initial conjecture that people are unconsciousness of the severeness of intestinal diseases, while they have been suffering from such things greatly. Besides propagating our project, we managed to make respondents aware of the differences between tract diseases and intestinal diseases and the detailed treatments to these. Consequently, we keep popularizing the knowledge in this field, as we always do.
Social Media
People nowadays spend a lot of time on social media, gaining information fragment by fragment. Subscription account on WeChat is a very popular form of social media in China. In the previous survey, our team found out that most Chinese know little about intestianl diseases and much more superficial about synthetic biology, many of whom having no idea what it is.
In order to create a window for our team to communicate with the world, our team applied and managed a WeChat subscription account, trying to share the knowledge of synthetic biology and trending news about medical treatment responsibly.

Today ‘s debate day to formulate our strategies for the ligation of our biobricks with professor Spartaco Astolfi.
We calculated the tconcentration of each cut biobrick  and we had:
BB Essential cut with EcoRI + SpeI = 2ng/ul
BB for Bioremediation cut with EcoRI + XbaI = 1ng/ul.
BB E0840  cut with EcoRI + XbaI = 5ng/ul
BB K346004 cut with EcoRI + XbaI = 20ng/ul.
To develop a methodology is important to the ligation system to have the same amount of vector /DNA linerazed and fragmented in order to be inserted. O BB Essential (at 2ng/ul)  will be ligated to  BB for Bioremediation, to BB E0840 and BBK346004, in which BB Essential  will become the fragment inserted in each of the  linearized vectors (cut  with EcoRI  and XbaI).
Regarding the amount of base pairs BB Essential is two times smaller than E0840, 5 times smaller than BB Biorremediation and approximately the same size as K346004.
With these information we concluded that the amount needed of DNA for each ligation system is:
Based on the amount needed of DNA needed for each ligation system – Always trying to get an even amount of molecules –we made our very own ligation system:
We’ll digest it tomorrow

Angeles Hueso Gil
Hello everybody! I am a biologist in her last year of a Biotechnology master.
I was a member of Valencia 2009 and 2010 iGEM team and I enjoyed so much both competitions that I wanted to participate one more time.
I am eager to start my PhD next year and feel the suffering but comforting experience of making science.
My main hobbies are reading, writing,      drawing, bellydancing and when my budget lets me to do it, traveling.
Carles Palanca
Hi! I have always enjoyed abstract topics like music and mathematics. Somehow I got interested in something much more terrestrial like molecular biology and I      decided to study biochemistry as my main career. I was a member of the Valencia iGEM team in 2009 and I have so many good memories about the whole project and      the Jamboree that I wanted to be a small part of the whole thing again. Now I'm doing my PhD in structural biology. I love music, so you can always see me singing     or maybe playing in some pub if you are lucky.
Dorothy J. Dankel
Hi! I am an advisor to the Human Practices team this year! I am a researcher at the Center for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities at the      University of Bergen in Norway. I work with Ana Delgado on the project ""Reflexive Systems Biology"" and it is exciting to use some of our insights from this      project on systems and synthetic biology with the Valencia Biocampus team!
My main hobbies are football (soccer, watching and playing), reading, tasting      new foods, and visiting family members around the world.
Guillermo Rodrigo
Currently, I am an EMBO long-term fellow at CNRS, France, working on       RNA synthetic biology and modeling biological systems. Born in       Valencia in 1983, I obtained the B.Eng. in Industrial Engineering in       2006 (UPV and Ecole Polytechnique), the M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics       in 2008 (UPV), and the Ph.D. in Biotechnology in 2011 (UPV), receiving       the fellowships UPV excellence, GVA FPI, HPC-Europa (IDRIS), and EMBO       short-term (MIT).

Protocol
Measure out 100mL of 1x TAE buffer
Transfer buffer to 125 mL flask
Weigh out enough agarose to make a 1% gel (in our case 1.0 g of agarose was the right amount)
Transfer agarose to 125mL flask
Melt agarose in microwave until solution is almost boiling, stirring every 15-20 seconds (should be around 2 minutes)
Allow agarose to cool (do not let it cool to the point where it is hard)
Add 5 uL of Red Safe to the cooling agarose
Assemble the gel pouring apparatus by inserting gate into slots
Allow gel to cool until flask can be handled comfortably
Place comb in the gel rig
Pour agarose into gel tray
Allow to solidify. While the gel is solidifying prepare the samples. Add your sample and 1 uL 10x Loading Dye, 4 uL of DNA and 5 uL of water
Pour 1X TAE over gel so that gel is covered by a 3-5mm buffer
Load samples into lane (Don't forget to load a 1kb+ ladder into one of the lanes)

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Collagen_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant synthesis of human collagen is impossible; it has in fact been done. However, replicating that work would have been quite difficult in the time available without representing substantial innovation. Instead, we looked to possible mimetics.
Bacterial Collagen
Fortunately for what was rapidly becoming an Escherichia coli-centric team, there exists a whole class of proteins known as ""bacterial collagens"". These proteins have the same supersecondary structure and Gly-X-Y repeat as human collagen without relying on hydroxyproline in the Y position,7 making these sequences easier to manipulate and bacterial synthesis possible. Unfortunately, despite the suggestive moniker, bacterial collagen has not been well adapted to provide structural integrity to large regions of extracellular matrix in areas of regular high stress such as arterial walls and skin. As such, it has no natural mechanism to form a network of long, cross-linked fibers, and there is a dearth of data on how such a matrix might perform. Still, it might prove a viable collagen mimetic given successful assembly of a fibrous matrix. Returning to human collagen mimetics for a moment, the length of native collagen has been one factor that makes production difficult, and there has been some interesting work done with relatively short peptides working around this difficulty.
Peptide Tessellation
Some recent work has been done to create a potentially infinitely long self-assembling collagen-like triple helix, made possible by the design and synthesis of short peptides which assemble in a staggered fashion into a triple helix with sticky ends, permitting the continued addition of the peptide monomer indefinitely into a long fiber. Sticky ends are most familiar in DNA applications such as restriction cloning, but sticky-ended DNA fragments can also be created by combining two DNA single strands (as in the work of this team on melanin binding ) due to the specificity of base pair interactions. Tanrikulu et al. used lysine/aspartate charge pairs to similar effect, forcing a staggered assembly.8 Cejas et al. chose to use short 30-residue length triple helices which would interact and form longer chains through stacking interactions of aromatic terminal residues, and lateral assembly into wider fibrils potentially by the same mechanism.9 These are just two examples of what is a fairly diverse field of collagen-mimetic peptide exploration,10 but many share a dependence on solid-phase peptide synthesis.
A transition to recombinant synthesis in an organism is difficult. These short, non-native structures would not necessarily be post-translationally modified correctly and would be difficult to purify, with even short purification tags resulting in major disruption of the structure and even an initial formyl"

“BioGUIDE v1.0 software is FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY,     no medical or diagnostic use for applications of the novel Biobrick     constructs generated through our software has been described “
“No military (defense or combat) applications will be allowed in     future”
Methods
Part Extraction Standards
All information about the parts that are essential in experimental     setup of iGEM projects has been utilized. The information for the parts     available provided with all three 384 well plates in Spring 2010 distribution     have been standardized. Our standardization criteria have been discussed     in detail under Database Standardization. ER diagram has been generated     which simply describes the organization of the data. Around 70% of the     parts information has been fetched by the custom parsing code from XML     and Excel files provided by iGEM. Rest of the data had to be collected     and organized manually as the organization of these data cannot be standardized     to generate an algorithm. This step was one of the most time consuming     steps in our project. For each construct and Biobrick the information     collected was; Activity, Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor     for promoters and Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor information     valid for synthesized molecules (mostly proteins and RNA fragments etc.)
Combination
Rules (Image Combinations) In order to build our input/output relations     graphs first we run our algorithm on the real combination dataset which     contains all few thousand different possible combinations of the biobricks.     But after performing all combinations for the first few hundred biobricks     application’s rate slowed downed tremendously, which also become very     time consuming for displaying biobricks graphs. To overcome this bottleneck     we have developed a new strategy, where we have only used the construct     combinations of the biobricks distributed within the plates. Moreover,     according to information gathered from the subparts of the constructs     distrubuted, we also collected the subpart assembly order, such as 1st:     promoter, 2nd:rbs, 3rd:coding seq, any internal parts and the Last:     terminator. Each specific Biobrick type has been assigned a number as     a unique image ID from 1 to 19. Gathering the information on subparts     was not a direct forward process. ImageID assembly orders for each construct     has been used to extract the type information for each subpart with     that construct. This innovative approach helped us to"
Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the large metabolic are produced and consumed, such that a steady state condition (the net flux of each metabolite is zero) is maintained [3]. The flux values are obtained by a linear program solver established in MATLAB that provides possible solutions while optimizing a specified objective function [3]. The media components were all added to the model and were constrained to values that resemble the uptake rate of our lab strain.
To calculate the growth rates of E.coli BL21 the reaction that was made the objective function was 'Ec_biomass_iJO1366_core_53p95M’.  This reaction in the model defines the survival of the bacteria and the flux through this reaction shows the growth rate of the bacteria on different energy source which are typically found in diet.  This reaction was then further constrained such that flux values are obtained, that represents the synthesis of L-DOPA and Dopamine by the bacterial strain, while the survival reaction also occurs in the model [4]. This use of a dual objective function, also known as Flux Variability Analysis, was essential in order to give a more realistic value for the estimated production rate.
The non-native reactions added were:
For L-DOPA Synthesis:
For Dopamine Synthesis (two step reaction):
The media components added were:
Acetate, Adenine, L-alanine, L-arginine, L-asparagine, L-aspartate, Biotin Calcium, Cobalamin, Chloride, Cobalt, Copper, L-cysteine, Iron (II),       Iron (III), Folate, L-glutamine, L-glutamate, Glycine, Sulphide, L-histidine,     L-isoleucine, Potassium, L-cysteine, L-leucine, L-lysine, L-methionine, Magnesium, Sodium, Niacin, Ammonia, L-phenylalanine, Phosphate, Panthothenate, L-proline, Propionate, Pyridoxal, Riboflavin, L-serine, Sulphate, Thiamine, L-threonine, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, Uracil, L-valine, Xanthine [7]
All the components were constrained to an uptake rate of 1 mmol gram of dry weight per hour (mmolgDW -1h-1). Carbon/Energy source and Oxygen levels were constrained to an uptake rate of 10 mmolgDW -1h-1 [7].

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KaraNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," One very vague exception (along the lines of ""Something bad happened"") kept appearing, and we just couldn't figure out what it was! Instead, we called it a day, checked in, and went on home.
28 - 29 Jul 2012
The weekend was spent on checking off the laundry list of fixes found during the MIT user studies, in preparation for the BU studies. We got Nahum's search integrated and search in all/search in one type working. Some minor fixes included adjusting drag thresholds to be less sensitive, fixing a bug in which parts did not always appear in the next level, threading data sheets and primer testing, swipe-deleting for parts and Level 1 modules in the workspace palettes, and auto-generating un-draggable templates for building modules (which become active when full). The mysterious exception from before seems to be gone, too - I think I deleted the initialization invocation at some point, and replacing it seems to have fixed things.
User Studies 2 and Fin. (July 29 - August 02)
30 Jul 2012
Traci and Sonia testing the MoClo Planner
Today we had a user study at BU. Our first group was Traci and a grad student from her lab, Sonya. The second was Shawn and Monique. They exposed a lot of flaws in the program, most importantly the ones that were caused by our misunderstanding of primer design as well as several other important, though not necessarily MoClo-related, bugs. They all offered great feedback, but Traci especially gave us a wealth of information on what they needed from the MoClo Planner and what areas of it needed work. A long day, with all the trouble you could ask for with moving things around and setting things up, but we got a lot out of it.
31 Jul - 01 Aug 2012
After all that, our first priority was to handle the aftermath of the user study at BU. There's so much that Traci gave us that it's hard to know where to start. Veronica and I overhauled the layout of the Primer Designer to show more of the data that Traci, Shawn, and Monique asked that we show, while Casey worked on getting things that the backend didn't provide for us in its current state. I picked up on one enormous glaring flaw that had somehow avoided detection until Traci and Sonya spotted it yesterday - that in the Primer Designer, some parts had the wrong sequence. It was the sequence from the dummy data sheet we made for testing purposes, and it was being used because unless users explicitly requested the data sheet, the"

Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"grants up to 1000 $ USD and aims to encourage collaboration between students and incubators, so our early stage product can come to life [36].
We also believed in crowdfunding as an effective platform to fund our project. In order to gain a broader perspective on this new trend, we attended an event hosted by Daniel Daboczy, CEO and co-founder of FundedByMe. He highlighted the astonished switch suffered during the last decade. While crowdfunding was only used as a desperate option to seek for funding, nowadays many companies widely believe in this movement. Lastly, his key advice to newly formed companies was to gain exposure and attract investors (Public event D Daboczy 21 Aug 2018).
We want to grow professionally by seeking inspiration and expanding our network. We attended the launching event of the Startup Guide Stockholm Vol. 2. founded by Sissel Hansen (Figure 10). Its content allows entrepreneurs to expand their network and empowers their business. We also attended the Sthlm Pitch Meetup event where we could mingle with many investors and experienced entrepreneurs.

Regarding the private funding, we are delighted to mention that reputable pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Merck have highly contributed and helped us from the beginning.
Lean Canvas
As mentioned before, the Lean Canvas model helped us summarizing our key business principles (Figure 11).

Industry Perspectives
AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca is a Research-Based BioPharmaceutical company. Their operational facility possesses a private treatment system for the water coming from their equipment. While visiting the company (Figure 13), Peter Gruvstedt and his colleagues showed great interest in our approach. They are indeed open to better cost-efficient alternatives.
Figure 13. Andreas, Vilma, Josephine, Peter (Process Engineer) and Blanca during AstraZeneca visit.
Discussing the different implementations of Biotic Blue, Peter proposed their fungal department as a valid option since the conditions are optimal for our enzyme. He was positive and receptive about our closed system concept. Biotic Blue can potentially build the right expectations in the market, considering that further research and improvements will be needed.
Pharem Biotech
Pharem Biotech is a company focused on advanced enzymatic degradation in the field of water treatment. In our visit, we were welcomed"

3.3 Method
Figure 18. The testing of processing device.
The processing plasmid and input plasmid were co-transformed into the Escherichia. Coli (BL21 (DE3)) strain as experimental group and only the processing plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia. Coli (BL21 (DE3)) as control.
Single colonies were used to inoculate 5 mL LB media supplemented with 50ug/ mL ampicillin , 50ug/mL kanamycin and grown overnight at 37°C.And the control was used to inoculate 5 mL LB media supplemented with 50ug/mL kanamycin.
The next morning, overnight cultures were inoculated with 5 mL fresh LB cultures supplemented with antibiotics at 1:100 dilution. Cultures were grown at the desired temperature in constant temperature shaker following 3 h or 5h of growth (Both the experimental group and control were set two contrats further to test if the inducer, IPTG for experimental group and AHL for control group, would make influnece. ), then cells were plated in triplicate in a 96-well BD-Falcon plate. The optical density at 600 nm and fluorescence (X excitation = 475 nm and X emission = 515 nm) were measured using a Perkin-Elmer plate reader every 15 or 20 minutes.
When cells grow to mid-stage, one of the experiment groups was induced with 100uM IPTG, the optical density at 600 nm and fluorescence (X excitation = 475 nm and X emission = 515 nm) were measured using a Perkin-Elmer plate reader every 15 or 20 minutes after 3 hours ,at the same time cells were grown at 30°C. (Figure 17)
3.4 Result and discussion
Figure 19. The value of fluorescence intensity changes over time, the time begins with all the E.coli growing to mid-log.
The result indicated the processing device without Cre recombinase was in high fluorescence and the processing device with Cre recombinase was in low fluorescence, it works as expected. And whether it was induced by IPTG had no difference, the reason was mentioned in the tight regulation test for input module, because of the leakage of Cre recombinase. We also found the experimental groups grew better than the control with only processing plasmid. (Figure 18) Maybe the positive feedback caused more loading, but the negative feedback didn't. So we chose the data when all groups"

3)  A large percentage of the current electronics are not renewable and contribute to growing volumes of e-waste. One of the components is copper and other non-renewable metals used in circuit boards. Our technology would replace these and allow for old circuits to be revamped. How much of an impact do you think this will have on the global e-waste production?
Franco: If all the ethical aspects have been cleared, meaning if there are no controversial implications, it is undeniable that your technology could have an important role. In the past few years in Italy, great focus has been brought on environmental sustainability. The planet should not consume more than nature can produce. If I remember, it is called environmental footprint.
Anneliese: I think that if this technology managed to reduce the amount of non-renewable materials involved, and could therefore reduce the amount of waste produced by this industry, it would have a positive impact.
4) The charging stations that we proposed would contain bacteria to produce the energy. What are your views on the matter?
Franco: At a first glance it is quite unsettling to think about. However, if the public would become knowledgeable about this idea, it could have a lot of potential.
Anneliese: I think this is a very exciting and innovative way of producing energy, which could, if developed, have the potential to reduce our over-reliance on non-renewable sources of energy.
5) What do you think will make this new technology, in terms of live bacteria producing energy, attractive to the general public?
Franco: To make the public accept this technology it is necessary that all the ethical implications are laid out, that it is proven to be safe and that if follows a principle of sustainable development.
Anneliese: If this technology could reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, in an affordable and reliable way, it could become popular and attractive to the general public.
6) Based on our research there are 8 potential nuclear power plant sites, of which only 5 are currently in development. We are planning to use one of the three available sites to cut down costs of establishing a new infrastructure. What are the main concerns, in your opinion, if we are planning to use this nuclear reactor site as a pilot plant for our project?
Franco: The main concerns are definitely safety and the public’s approval. In a Country such as Italy it will be remarkably hard to help the idea come across, mostly because of"

Glasgow,2014,Team:Glasgow#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," an estimate consume 23.4 billion litres of water on household uses per year.
Considering that only 11% individuals disagreed with the use of bacteria-cleaned water in the household, it seems that there could be potential to market the end product of the biodesalination process for household use. However, to be certain of this a wider-reaching survey would have to be conducted.
Applying our Switch to Biodesalination - the Science
E. coli is not very salt tolerant so we would transform our switch into a halophile such as a species of cyanobacteria. However, there is still a problem as halophiles manage to survive at high concentrations by expelling salt. This is in opposition to what we require the bacteria to do to desalinate water as our idea depends on encouraging the bacteria to absorb salt.
We sought advice from a research group (Dr Anna Amtmann and colleagues) within the University who work on biodesalination in collaboration with the University of Sheffield, Newcastle University and Robert Gordon University. Dr Antmann works on encouraging cyanobacteria to absorb salt. At the University of Sheffield the research group in collaboration work on the separation of cells. Dr Catherine Gandy and Dr Jaime Amezaga work on the public opinion of biodesalination at Newcastle University and if we were to continue on with this project we would love to work in collaboration with them in conducting a wider-reaching public survey on biodesalination. Furthermore, if we were to continue with this project, one of our focuses would be informing the public more about GMO.
The requirements for microbial biodesalination are –
A cyanobacteria strain that can grow without the addition of nutrients other than what is present in the natural environment in large quantities. The idea of Dr. Anna Amtmann and her group is for this to be a natural process carried out by phototrophic cyanobacteria.
Another problem that must be conquered is inhibiting the expulsion of salt ions from the cell.
There would also need to be a system for control of expression of salt uptake genes, which is where our switch comes in.
Furthermore, there needs to be a system to separate the cells, which is also where our switch could be of use if the gas vesicle production could be enhanced to allow the cells to float well enough to be separated.
To demonstrate the steps that need to be taken for this technology to be used for biodesalination on an industrial scale, the stage gate approach will be used. We have applied this system as it provides opportunities for reflection. We also wished to try to incorporate the concept of Responsible Innovation into"

Overview
To expand the thought of our project, we go talk with professors and went for visit. During the times, we are inspirited and come up with better ideas and results. These events change our way of thinking, and help us have more comprehensive conclusion.
Forums
Not only do we focus on the future education, but also chasing for a better achievement of our project. During the May, we have invite five professors to our forums to discuss with us about our project ideas. All the professors are have a large stock of knowledge and gave us many useful advises. And the one who affect us most is Professor Yang from Tianjin University, who is one of the leading experts in structure biology in China.
After listen to our whole project idea, professor asked us, why don't we raise the idea up into a theory. According to him, our project is good, but too much simple. He advised us to sum up the main steps of our experiment and put it into reality. Because of the affection from Professor Yang, we formulate our thought and create the Training Protein System which can be used in all the protein enzyme in theory. To test and verify the new system, we put it in use of PETase and finally confirm that the system is valid.
Contact with the PET factory
Polyethyleneterephthalate (PET\PEIT) is the condensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. PET is fully dense and high crystallinity with ester bond in molecular chain, which is possible degraded. And biodegradation, which means taking advantages of microorganism, such as bacteria and fungus, to degraded plastic, has broad application prospects result from its low cost and high degradation efficiency.
In order to gain more specific data about PET market at present, we called Tianjin Naipu Technology Co., Ltd for help. After a negotiations, opposite side promised us that we can go to their factory for a visit. We go there in August and receive the warm welcome.

In cell signaling, the enzyme hoxBC-hoxJ,  combined with Hydrogen, catalyzes the reaction of hoxA –P dephosphorization, We model this  rate using the Law of Michaelis–Menten kinetics, this model involves an enzyme,  E, binding to a substrate, S, to form a complex, ES, which in turn releases a  product, P, regenerating the original enzyme. This may be represented  schematically as
where (forward rate), (reverse  rate), and (catalytic  rate) denote the rate constants, the double arrows between S (substrate) and ES  (enzyme-substrate complex) represent the fact that enzyme-substrate binding is  a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation of  P (product).
Under certain  assumption– such as the enzyme concentration being much less than the substrate  concentration – the rate of product formation is given by

Transcription
Transcription is a complex procession.  However, it is well established that initiation of transcription is the major  factor in determining overall rate of mRNA production. Transcription initiation  is a process influenced by a number of key steps including: promoter escape,  binding of the RNA Polymerase onto the promoter, isomerization, and formation  of the closed RNA Pol complex from the open complex, and your Escherichia coli strain. In this model,  we will assume that binding of the RNA polymerase is the rate determining step  in transcription initiation.
Thus,  our key assumptions for transcription are:
 1. For the constitutively expressed genes (hoxA, hoxB, hoxC,  hoxJ), we can assume that they are at maximal transcription.
2. hoxP transcription rate is determined primarily by the amount of  substrate (hoxA) bound to the DNA and the strength of the promoter hoxP.  Maximum transcription rate occurs when all binding sites are filled.
 3. Promoter strength (in Polymerases  per second) is a constant, and represents the rate of transcription at maximal  expression.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," perception of life and if so, how. The questions meddle with traditional and established viewpoints.
It seems that the possible negative effects of the pursuit of understanding life (the devaluation of life) are not a reason to stop research, mostly because people argue that the value of life cannot be changed (but might even be enhanced) by understanding the mechanisms of life. A majority of 90% would not pull back from fundamental research on the principles of living matter even if the the value of life cannot be secured.
Modifying organisms by the using genetic engineering tools should be available because of the (possible) benefits that it carries along, as outlined by the majority of the group. Only a small group is worried about the consequences that these techniques might have when meddling with evolution. Although the techniques are well studied, the complexity of DNA and the translation system are not yet completely understood and should make researchers use genetic engineering with care, and only apply it for beneficial purposes. A risk/benefit assessment could help identifying when these techniques should be applied.
One of the biggest contributors to synthetic biology research and possibly one of the most controversial researchers in (synthetic) biology is Craig J. Venter. His project on creating a minimal genome is groundbreaking and raises a lot of questions, primarily by media machinery. Whether the research of Venter is new or not is a difficult question, the surveyed group does not have a universal answer. Reasons for that can include that more specific knowledge on his research is needed, and that it is hard to define when an approach or technique is typically new. Nevertheless, the technical challenges that Venter faces are acknowledged.
Although he is pushing the technology as far as it goes, over 80% does not believe that Venter is playing God by creating life artificially. Nevertheless, the majority also thinks that the public will perceive the research as controversial, thinking that Venter is trying to create new life forms. A relatively large minority of think that the public will presume that he is only putting biological components together. An important point is to focus on the importance of proper communication in order to inform the public objectively. Using statements such as ""playing God"" might draw the wrong attention.
Amongst the main issues in synthetic biology are bio-safety and bio-security. Both the dangers of errors and terrors are addressed in the survey, as well as the attitude towards risk-taking in this emerging field of science.
The majority acknowledges the possibility of the production of a biological system containing some hazardous error and most believe there is regulation needed to prevent this. 34% does not see this possibility as a real thread and think either that there is sufficient"

A New Standard for Biobrick Construction
The Registry  includes a growing number of parts for use in yeast, but there currently exist  no BBa compatible yeast shuttle vectors.   In our work, we have chosen to utilize Sikorski yeast vectors to  integrate BBa parts into yeast chromosomes.   [1]   With genomic insertion, each  transformation is stable, being reproduced with the rest of the  chromosome.  Additionally, exactly one  copy of each insertion is present in transformed strains, allowing for precise  control of the relative expression levels of multiple elements.   The Sikorski vectors can be transformed into  E. coli for construction and propagation.   There exist four integrative vectors in the pRS30x family, each  integrating at a different auxotrophic locus and containing the amino acid  synthesis gene to fill that auxotrophy as a marker for integration.   The vectors are not suitable for Biobrick construction- they each contain one extraneous Biobrick site, and lack the standard cloning site.  Thankfully, there is a standard method for cloning BBa parts onto the pRS30x vectors for yeast chromosomal  integration: [2]
Digest the BBa vector containing the finished construct and pRS30x vector of choice using the following enzymes:
Sikorski    vector (marker)
insert & vector digest
pRS303 (HIS3)
EcoRI, SpeI
pRS304* (TRP1)
EcoRI, SpeI
pRS305 (LEU2)
XbaI, PstI
pRS306 (URA3)
EcoRI, SpeI
Alternatively,  the final BBa construction ligation can be done as a double insertion onto a  pRS30x vector.  We did all of our pRS vector insertions this way.  The three-way ligations work well consistently, and many variations (e.g. combination of promoters and coding regions) can be generated with relative ease:

a. communicating with other iGEM teams
#Korean Regional Meetup  8/15 @ Lotte hotel Athen’s Garden
The three Korean teams gathered together and presented their own projects. We had an opportunity to show our idea and receive comments during Q&A sessions. Particularly, one overgraduate team called Korea_U_Seoul team asked us why we used E.coli instead of other microorganisms. We answered that it is for accessibility. Since our project is headed toward the welfare of farmers, we focus on the technology that is “available” and “easy” for them to use.
We also offered some opinions about two other teams. Three Korean teams collaborated to achieve better at Giant Jamboree. It was indeed a great time.
#i GEM mentors
Gha Young Lee, David Brown, Ricardo Chavez  We have applied for Pilot Mentorship Program, and were able to meet three great mentors who had experienced Giant Jamboree. In particular, Gha Young helped us a lot. She shared her experience about preparing for Giant Jamboree. We can’t wait until meeting her at Boston :) Also, we have skyped twice during the summer vacation( 7/1/15 10AM and 8/17/15 11 PM in Korean time) and got advice about part submission, human practice and the purpose of our project.
b. communicating with Bio Ethanol Research Institutes
#Jeon-nam University Bioethanol Research Institute 8/19
We started exchangin emails with JU Bioethanol Research Institute on August 19th. We not only introduced our bioengineering project but also Our questions were related to the problems that this institute encounters during their research. It answered that the economic feasibility and construction of infrastructure were the main problem it often faces.
c. Testing other teams’ systems
We’ve tested some systems of other iGEM teams such as Korea_U_Seoul,Nankai and Paris-Bettencourt."

Developing Our Team
In order to achieve our goals and develop FREDsense, we required a diverse background of skill sets. Seven members of the 2012 Calgary iGEM team joined forces to become part of the FREDsense team. Our skills represent a variety of technical specialities ranging from genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology to electrochemistry. To ensure our venture's success, we enlisted the aid of technical, business, and legal experts to our advisory board. This has aided in producing a dynamic team that will be able to deliver on FREDsense's goals and bring our technology to market.
Building the FREDsense Team
Our team is composed of seven students from diverse technical backgrounds, all who were members of the 2012 Calgary Collegiate iGEM team where this technology platform was initially developed from. To suppliment our skills we have also enlisted the aid of several key advisors from diverse technical, business, and legal backgrounds to sit on our advisory board and act to guide FREDsense Technologies as it develops.
Team Members
Our team consists of seven members from diverse technical backgrounds. Each member played a critical role in developing the technology from the 2012 Calgary iGEM team and has played a significant role in playing multiple roles in business development of FREDsense Technologies.
Iain George
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary. I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.

I don’t forget that...
I don't forget that every moment is special, every discovery today is innovative, and tomorrow comes better, but we need to move rapidly ahead and dream of something new, more diverse.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
I chose iGEM because of the opportunity to create something new, the thrill of the unexpected, the confrontation with the unknown and the wonderful time spent with an abmitious team.
Yordanka Kostova
Hello iGEM! My name is Yordanka Kostova and I have recently finished my bachelor degree in Molecular Biology. My thesis was about micro RNAs that have the potential to be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia. I am from Plovdiv – the town that is chosen to be the European capital of culture for 2019  - Yay! I moved to Sofia in order to join the Bulgarian iGEM team and soon after that I started working as a clinical scientist in a medical lab. As you can see I am very passionate about everything related to biology.
Interests, hobbies, leisure time:
My other inspirations include rock music, skateboarding, poetry and pets – a dog and a cat at the moment. I love spending time with my family and friends, going to concert shows, playing guitar (not that I’m good at it) and reading.
I don’t forget that...
I believe that through science and innovation people can really make a difference. I know that small steps still count and that there is no need to become a huge and famous name in science in order to be useful for society.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
I believe that with our project we can make the production of bioactive components easier and faster. This gives me the strength and ambition to work harder with my teammates.

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," to a reference amino acid distribution locally on one's own computer. This ranking can be generated in a matter of seconds, rather than taking several minutes. Because it ranks all proteins in a proteome, CompositionSearch can also generate a figure for the significance of the similarity of a given protein to a given amino acid distribution, using the similarity of the rest of the proteome as a statistical distribution function.
Availability and Usage
CompositionSearch may be downloaded here .
CompositionSearch is a command line utility, provided as a Java jar file. It can be invoked from command line on any system with Java 7 or later installed, with the following syntax:
java -jar CompositionSearch.jar prot.fasta freqs.txt out.csv
where ""prot.fasta"" is a FASTA-formatted proteome, and ""freqs.txt"" is a file containing the desired amino distribution to match. It should be formatted as plain text, according to the following example template:
A 0.134
D 0.044
E 0.04
G 0.228
I 0.033
K 0.021
L 0.04
P 0.08
R 0.009
S 0.151
T 0.038
V 0.083
Note that this may contain as many or as few amino acids as desired. The frequencies, however, are interpreted as absolute, so if all amino acids are represented, they should add up to 1. (See below for discussion of how the optional -N and -X flags affect this interpretation).
""out.csv"" in the above example line is the destination path to store the results of the calculation. The output will be a spreadsheet in csv format, which may be imported into your favorite desktop spreadsheet application (e.g. Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, etc.).
After execution, out.csv will contain a spreadsheet showing the reference distribution, and, in order by similarity to the reference distribution, the amino acid distributions of all proteins in the proteome. Protein name, similarity ranking, similarity score (Euclidian distance between amino acid distributions; lower is better), and similarity p-value (on the curve of other proteins in the proteome) will be listed for each protein.
The following optional flags may be used to change the program's behavior:
-N
This will cause the program to ignore amino acids in the proteins that are not in the distribution list. In other words, this means that the frequencies given refer to frequencies relative to only the the other amino acids listed, instead of all amino acids. To clarify:
Without the -N"

Knockout designs in our project
Pex 9
Pex9 is a recently discovered import receptor for PTS1 proteins, which is induced by oleate and is an import receptor for both malate synthase isoenzymes Mls1p and Mls2p. In order to get a completely empty reaction room, a Pex9 knockout was designed to prevent unintended protein import.
Pex 31 & Pex 32
It has been shown that knockouts of Pex31 and Pex32 leads to an increased Peroxisomal size, but additionally the membrane permeability was affected ( Zhou et al. 2016 ). This effect can be used as a tool for engineering membrane permeability by knocking out or overexpress both genes."

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"FP has 8 amino acid mutations. Point of its sensitivity of redox states is                         two Mets which locate in the surface of protein. Once the cell is in a reduced state, the                         disulfide bond between two methionines will come into been, leading different absorption of                         light at two wavelengths. Specifically, the response of roGFP2 to H2O2 is                         reflected to its excitation spectrum (emission wavelength is 515 nm), which has a max absorbing                         peak at 405 nm and 490 nm. The peak value changes with the oxidation state of environment and                         this change is reversible. Measuring the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the roGFP at                         two wavelengths can reflect the changes of intracellular redox state in real time. [11]
However, roGFP dosen’t only reacts with H2O2, but also other oxides,                         which means it gets                         oxidized generally, there’s a lot of interference. So according to information about Yap1, we                         found that compared with Yap1 and Grx (Saccharomyces cerevisiae gluten), Orp1 has a                         specificity to H2O2, instead of all kinds of ROS. [12]
Fig. 7 How roGFP works.
Also there is similar transformation of intramolecular disulfide bond in Orp1-roGFP fusion                         protein to intermolecular transformation between Yap1 and Orp1.

With reference to the part designed by Cornell University in 2017: BBa_K229600                         , Constitutive Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S, the roGFP2-Orp1 (C82S) fusion protein sensitive                         to the intracellular redox state response was selected as the signal output of our project.

We also optimized the codon for roGFP2, making it more suitable for translation system of Saccharomyces                             cerevisiae cells.
Summary
Having established each part of our system, we can achieve our original aim “Detect and measure                         the antioxidant in living cell”. Let’s review how we design the whole gene circuits.

Danzi_Kesh_8,2015,Team:Danzi Kesh 8#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," in relation to other kits which are cumbersome and heavy.
Affordable for every pocket.
Safe to use: external and harmless check. 
Using the product is simple and easy.
Alergln will allow celiac patients to eat safely without worrying about the presence of gluten in food.
Reduces ""gluten-free"" food costs in cases where the manufacturer noted the possibility of gluten presence where there was no gluten to start with.
There is no such kit to the best of our knowledge, so in an investor's perspective there is substantial economic viability.
Alergln will reduce the embarrassment of young celiac patients, for example in school where there is a question whether food contains gluten or not.
Financing
Initial capital raising will be done by identifying a group of interested investors. The initial funding will include construction of a building, purchase of raw materials, recruitment, and writing work procedures. 
Since this is about writing a patent (apparently there is no such kit), there is a need to channel resources for patent registration.
Safety
The product does not contain chemicals.
Product is sensitive in detecting low and negligible concentrations of gluten, that do not cause abdominal pain (the exact value is still under review).
Alergln is an external test and is therefore safe to use. 
Key partners
Migal Institute in cooperation with the Tel Hai College - our partners in knowledge and how to give and execute our presentation. With their help we are able to produce and present the product in the best way possible.
There is a need to find a group of investors who would be willing to invest money in the idea and fund the initial cost of the product.
Moving Alergln to the consumer
Alergln will be distributed to all consumers and will be accessible wherever food is sold (supermarket, restaurants, shopping malls, etc.), Pharm stores, online, and pharmacies.
Competitors
There are gluten-free detection kits on the market, but they are cumbersome to carry and operate. According to a YouTube video, it takes a minimum of 8 minutes to identify gluten and we want to do it immediately.
There is (to the best of our knowledge,) at the moment no company in the world which is developing a similar product for identifying gluten in food. Other laboratories around the world, such as a group of researchers from the University of Alberta and a IGEM Team San Andres Chile, are developing an internal system to neutralize gluten in the body.
Statistics of Celiac in Israel and the United States
An estimated 1 in 133 Americans, or about 1% of the population, has celiac disease.

The Hendrix College IGEM team
The Hendrix College IGEM team was founded in the spring of this year, 2014, in Conway, Arkansas. We initially learned about the IGEM competition through a genetics lab, where we used a sample kit of BioBricks to create simple biological machines. We are an interdisciplinary group, made up of several different majors, and each person's skillset and knowledge is invaluable to the team as a whole. Our goal for this year is to do a creative, challenging, and useful project which will hopefully benefit the lives of others and create further interest in IGEM and biological engineering at our college.

I am a very active person and I really enjoy playing softball, hiking, as well as all things science. I believe that the future of medicine and biology as a whole lies in our ability to understand and manipulate the genetic codes. In my spare time I fight crime as Jean Grey.
Alex McIntyre
Hey! I'm Alex, and I'm a Junior Psychology Major/Biology Minor from Fayetteville, Arkansas. I love all things medicine, and so naturally have my heart set on medical school. Other than academics, I'm active in my school's social committee and student senate. My two favorite things in the world are sleep and pugs. I was known for being the control freak in lab, but I like to think of myself as a perfectionist.​ I'm excited to not only be a part of the first team from Hendrix to compete at iGEM, but also from Arkansas! In my spare time I fight crime as Iceman.

I’m a Health Science (Physical Therapy emphasis) major and Spanish minor at Hendrix College. In the future, I hope to complement physical therapy with art therapy as a means to help people achieve a more complete healing. I’ve begun this integration with my thesis, studying the effect of expressive art on the psychological well-being of injured athletes. Working on Hendrix’s iGEM team is attractive to me because the procedure is a sort of artistic expression in the medical field; each team has creative license in designing their own project, fashioning a “genetic mosaic” to address a problem of our world. In my spare time I fight crime as X-23.

1976
Monsanto patents the herbicide, Roundup.
1982
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the first genetically engineered drug Humulin, a form of human insulin produced by recombinant E. coli bacteria. Prior to the development of synthesized human insulin, patients were dependent on animal insulin, which was more costly, less accessible, and sometimes caused infection. Humulin is identical in structure to human insulin.
1983
The first transgenic plant, a tobacco plant resistant to antibiotics, is created at Washington University in Missouri, USA.
1986
The first field tests of genetically engineered (tobacco) plants are conducted in Belgium.
1987
The first field tests of genetically engineered (tobacco and tomato) crops are conducted in the United States.
1992
The U.S. Department of Agriculture approves the ""Flavr Savr"" tomato strain, intended to be resistant to softening and consequent rotting, as the first genetically engineered food to be granted a license for human consumption. Production ceased in 1997 due to poor crop yields and high mounting costs.
The FDA declares that genetically engineered foods are “not inherently dangerous” and do not require special safety testing or specific regulations. This is because they align more with the category of “whole foods”, which the FDA does not oversee, rather than “food products.”
1994
The European Union’s first genetically engineered crop, tobacco, is approved for use in France.
1997
FlavrSavr tomatoes are taken off the U.S. food market due to increased competition from longer-lasting, conventional varieties.

Lysis-based transcription factor selection
We implemented a prototype of our lysis selection system by experimentally validating four essential aspects of the strategy:
1) demonstrating that we could effectively lyse cells:
We ran platereader experiments involving growing cells to stationary growth phase and then induced with IPTG. The resulting optical density indicates that lysis occurs, with increased lysing efficiency as a function of increased IPTG concentration.
2) demonstrating that DNA could be recovered from the supernatant
We made a large culture of cells containing the lysis cassette and an RFP-containing plasmid and induced with IPTG. We collected samples of the supernatant every hour and quantified the amount of DNA in those samples by transforming the DNA and counting CFUs and by qPCR. Both quantifications revealed the same result: RFP plasmids were recovered in increasing amounts as time went on.
3) demonstrating that the appropriate cells (those with the desired trait or mutant DNA) would lyse, leaving the other cells intact
We made a co-culture of cells. One culture had the lysis cassette and an RFP plasmid, while the other had a GFP plasmid and no lysis cassette. Upon induction with IPTG, the qPCR and transformation methods of the previous experiment showed that RFP was recovered in large quantities and only trace quantities of GFP are detected.
4) demonstrating that promoter strength (i.e. transcription factor- DNA binding) has a direct impact on the amount and speed of lysing
We ran a platereader experiment with multiple cultures"
Cornell,2012,Team:Cornell#testing#project#wetlab#2_-_-_TEXT.html,"B expression is detected in cell lysates but MtrB is not, indicating the necessity of MtrA in assembly of OM MtrB complexes [7]. This tight interaction between MtrA and MtrB has raised the possibility that MtrA may be embedded within MtrB, thereby allowing MtrA to come in contact with OM cytochrome proteins. Given the periplasmic length of approximately 237 Å and the localization of MtrA and CymA to the OM and CM membranes respectively, it is hypothesized that additional PECs, likely MtrA or NrfA paralogs, are necessary to complete the transfer of electrons between CymA and MtrA in MR-1 [7].
MtrC and OmcA
MtrC and OmcA are two c-type decaheme cytochromes located on the extracellular surface of the OM [4,7]. In vivo cross-linking and in vitro experiments have shown that these two OMC readily complex and that this binding synergistically increases the reductase efficiency of the complex [7]. The current model of MtrC-OmcA metal reduction posits that MtrC and OmcA bind and reduce Fe(III) oxides directly [7]. Study of MtrF, a MtrC paralog, has provided structural evidence supporting the role of MtrC and OmcA as the terminal reductases in Fe(III) oxide reduction. MtrF folds into four domains with domains II and IV, the pentaheme domains, forming a core. Two split-b-barrels, domains I and III, surround the pentaheme cores [4]. Domains I and III are thought to be responsible for binding and reducing Fe(III), domain II for the direct transfer of electrons, and domain IV, for physically interacting with the MtrDE (a MtrAB homolog) complex [4].
The Essential Role of MtrB in the Mtr Respiratory Pathway
In addition to serving as a conduit for electron transfer from MtrA to OM reducatses, MtrB acts as a scaffolding protein. MtrABC complexes are readily isolated after Triton X-100 treatment [7,8]. Isolated MtrABC, when solubilized into liposomes, readily catalyzes transmembrane electron transfer [7]. While MtrAB complexes readily form in the absence of MtrC, MtrBC complexes are not detected in a mtrA deletion background 7. Moreover, while isolated Mtr"

Activity 4: Public speech for seeking suggestions of project on campus
In order to collect feedback about our project, we held a public speech from fellow students in different departments as well as some university professors. During the public speech, we made a brief team introduction to all students and teachers about XJTLU-CHINA iGEM team for 2016. During the activity, we highlighted the expected outcome of our muta in vivo project and the potential benefit for the society in future, especially the production of benefit mutation for agriculture and the practical use in pharmaceutical companies.
Besides, we consulted some professors seeking for the solutions of some obstacles when conducting the experimental practical. Especially we found the reasons of repeated failure in conducting the experiments. They also provided us with suggestions in the ideas and designs of our team project.
Activity 5: Road show at 2016 International STEM Festival
An international science festival focused on core literacy and STEM education attracting hundreds of students and their parents to see the latest science and technology innovations. The 2016 International STEM Science Festival featured a series of activities including project experiences, a forum and the 2016 World Robot Olympiad East China competition. As novel student research group of synthetic biology at XJTLU, we invited two other iGEM teams (ZJU-CHINA & NYU-Shanghai) taking this opportunity to publicize the significance of iGEM in promoting STEM subjects in synthetic biology area.
The four-day event invited experts from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Finland, as well as more than 40 well-known domestic and international enterprises, including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard Development Company and Oracle. In particular, throughout this festival, hundreds of students and their parents are attracted to see the latest science and technology innovations.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-HP G_-_-_TEXT.html," antibiotics should NOT be used. We completely agree with this statement; finding out which antibiotic to use is more effective in helping to solve the worldwide antibiotic resistance problem. Another piece of feedback was to use larger test tubes for the detection. Currently, we use 1.5 mL eppendorfs in which the detection is done. Paul recommended to perform the detection in larger tubes to increase the visibility and to be more user-friendly.
See our applied design page and our demonstrate page .
Integration in our project
There were several interactions with stakeholders that heavily impacted the direction of our design. Integrated Human Practices was extremely valuable in shaping our project. In response to dialogues with the public, risk assessors, and potential users, we changed our design from a GMO-based lab tool to a safe and reliable end product. Key points that we took from discussions with stakeholders were that the method needs to combine a simplified sample preparation, a fast, easy readout and the possibility for on-site use. We integrated all these in our project, by designing a cell-free method that can be stored for up to two weeks and produces a visible readout.
We started by finding a relevant case in which our device could make a contribution. Through a conversation with a veterinarian, we were advised to narrow our scope to mastitis, an udder infection affecting dairy cows.
Every milk farmer faces mastitis, a challenging udder disease affecting dairy cows.
Bouwe Gall Frank (veterinarian)
This infection is not easy to get rid of; udders are exposed to the open environment, making the infection a common re-occurrence. All dairy farmers we spoke to in the Netherlands have had to deal with mastitis. Farmers want to have fast administration of antibiotics when treating this disease, as time is of the essence. Our tool makes sure that fast treatment of mastitis can be done in a responsible way, without misusing antibiotics, thereby helping to prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Looking to mastitis, we adapted our tool to detect relevant resistance genes in the common pathogen, Staphylococcus Aureus (SAU), causing this disease.
It is relevant to be able to detect SAU pathogens. As there is a huge difference in sensitivity for antibiotics considering MRSA, it would be added value to have a conclusive result on the sensitivity.
Maaike van den Berg (veterinarian)
After talking to experts with expertise in mastitis from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#HP#Silver#Elderly_-_-_TEXT.html," the young people of today’s society really understand what it is like to be an older person? We see elderly people all around us, we all empathise with our own grandparents, but can we really understand the struggles and difficulties of being old without living the life of an old person ourselves? The fact that Monika said that “such brilliant young people care about us old folks” has made us think more deeply about what we can do to understand this on a deeper level.
There have been a number of 'old people simulation suits' on TV down the years; suits that simulate what it physically feels like to be an old person. These suits have been designed to make the person wearing the suit increase their empathy and understanding of what it is like to be an older person.
NHS hospital staff have actually used this suit within the training programmes of their elderly healthcare professionals to give them a better insight into how their elderly and dementia patients feel when the try to perform basic tasks. It is currently used as a tool for optimising and improving healthcare. As demographics shift, we want to understand the needs of the ageing population better to be able to create a future which is easier for the older people, more accessible and engaging. This tool will allow us to study and improve the life of tomorrow by allowing us to optimise and improving our novel therapies for the growing ageing population.
So we decided to go above and beyond and simulate physical changes of being old using our very own simulation suit. Our engineered suit has been designed by using everyday items to mimic certain physical characteristics of old age (a cheaper version of the real suit). In order to design this suit, we did a lot of research into what characteristics we could easily simulate.  Professional simulation suits mimic the following characteristics:
Increased fatigue.
Reduced flexibility in joints and muscles.
Difficulty in vision and balance.
Restriction in movement.
Therefore, our simulation suit was made by:
The addition of heavy weight: this can be used to mimic fatigue and arthritis.
Straps around arms and legs and tight clothes: that would limit flexibility and ability to move fast.
Glasses: mimic debilitating eyesight as we age.
Headphones: mimic reduced ability to hear well.
Our suit was then tested by our team members who performed the typical tasks that a UCL student would carry out. The members felt that it was hard to carry out everyday tasks and felt like, prior to using the suit, they never thought that simple activities would be so difficult. They also mentioned that they have an increased respect for old age and even stronger determination to make BiosynthAge the beginning of something real. Below is a video of the"

As China is a large country with 1.3 billion people, China actively researched on ways to use biotechnology to produce efficient crop field and increase the yield. The most famous instance is the super hybrid rice developed by Dr Yuan, Longping in 1975, which significantly increased the income of Chinese farmer and moreover, has successfully supported 1/5 of the total world population with only 7.2% cultivated area in the world (Gan, 2009).
Medical science biotechnology
Chinese also used biotechnology in medical science to help developing medical treatment and public health. From 1959 to 1965, numerous Chinese researchers focused on synthesis of bovine insulin and successfully accomplished their research. The paper about artificial synthesis of bovine insulin was published to Science in China in April, 1966. This is a hallmark of synthetic biology in China, since the research is a symbol of the era when China started to synthesize protein manually (“新中国档案: 我国首次人工合成结晶牛胰岛素蛋白”, 2009).
Chinese government also invests a large amount of money on medical science to create new, efficient and safe genetic drugs and vaccines. Nowadays, genetic drugs and antibody drugs are replacing the less specific chemotherapy to cure cancer patients. Along with his trend, the rising consumption power and health awareness of the public stimulate the government to actively develop the vaccine market.
Biological pharmacy industry
The import and export volume of China's biopharmaceutical products was US$ 377 million in 2007. This value represents 48% increase from 2006. In 2007, the import volume reached US$ 336 million and the export volume was US$ 41 million. The growth rate of export volume in 2007 had declined from the level of 58% in 2006 to 26% in 2007. Although the export of Chinese biopharmaceutical industry constantly kept a high growth rate, the volume was still very small compared with the import volume. This sharp contrast indicated that China's biopharmaceutical products accounted for a very low market ratio in international market (""Market report on,"" 2009).
Biotechnology Industry Funding
Chinese government plays an important role in providing funds. The current funding for R&D of Synthetic Biology in China is mainly through the government's National High-tech Research and Development Project, National Program on Key Basic Research Project, and National Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Chinese government officials plan to grow R&D spending from 1."

Try to think outside the box. What is the absolute worst case scenario for human health or the environment that you could imagine?.
The absolute worst case scenario requires our strain to be very efficient in the bean root infection process. It also requires our strain to be bad at or lack at all nitrogen fixation, and to acquire a great viability in free life. With these assumptions, the infection of a bean root with our strain would kill or exclude other strains from the root and deprive the bean from the nitrogen fixation process. The free life viability would allow our strain to remain in the soil and infect more plants in its surroundings. The constant competition for roots would always exclude nitrogen fixating bacteria, stopping the fixation process at all in the release environment, affecting all life forms given that nitrogen is required by all organisms.
We believe this scenario to be completely out of the question for the following reasons:
The strain that we are working on (CFN42) presents a naturally very low fitness when competing with other Rhizobium etli strains.
The hydrogen production system consumes reductive metabolites, which carry energy. This consumption is expected to reduce the modified strain fitness compared to its unmodified counterpart.
None of the hydrogen pathway components are expected to interfere with the bacterium-plant communication, or the infection system. So our strain is not expected to increase its infection efficiency.
It is possible that hydrogen production interferes with nitrogen fixation, either reducing its efficiency or inhibiting it at all. Yet, Phaseolus vulgaris has a system that senses nitrogen fixation and has the ability to kill bacteria lacking the system. If nitrogen fixation is lost the strain infection efficiency is expected to be diminished by this system.

Congratulations! We have decided our project “TW”, and now we can concentrate                       on completing our project. But it’s not a good idea for us that our gene circuit is a little bit                       complicated. We have to hurry to do experiment to make sure that we can finish our project on                       time.
As we order the genes of the sensing system from IDT, we plan to construct our                       regulation system firstly.
We meet a few trouble that the gene from the iGEM Distribution Kit is NOT                       right? It cost us some time to choose another gene in the kit. And finally we successfully get                       the correct gene we need at the end of June.
