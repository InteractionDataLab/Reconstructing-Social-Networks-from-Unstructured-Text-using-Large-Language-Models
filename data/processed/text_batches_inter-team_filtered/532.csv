We collaborate with SZU in Biobrick part as well. We tested and found that one of plasmid in 2018 Distribution Kit had error sequences and we sought for help from Team Shenzhen University. We than characterized the part together to make sure the sequence of Biobrick part is correct.
XMU-China
This year, the XMU_China team is also working on microfluidic chips for building a hardware platform, thus we think it would be beneficial to have a discussion over our projects and get some suggestions.
On 16th, Sep 2018, we had an online collaboration with this year’s XMU iGEM team. The two teams engaged fiercely in the discussions of projects and experiment techniques. Their core design is to set up a centrifugation disk to detect the single strand DNA as biomarker to some sort of disease in a cell-free system.
Our team laid questions and helped their team with the microfluidic chips and the flow parameters in the centrifugation system they were working on, and members from the XMU-China team mentioned that we should focus more on presenting our main idea as a synthetic biology related question and showed us the way to present it more coherently. They also gave some advice on cell signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions, and recommended several related articles to us.
Our team also got great inspirations from their design of Wiki pages and poster. It’s till this point that we realized how to create a more simple and concise Wiki page.
GreatBay_China
We assisted a high school team, GreatBay_China Team in Shenzhen. We invited them to our lab and introduced some basic concepts in Synthetic Biology. We exchanged our ideas on project design and provide some experimental and technical instructions. The high school team aimed to reconstruct the whole enzymatic pathway in both E.coli and yeast using Biobrick. They tried to build a stabilized promoter which can regulate the transcription level regardless of it copy number, which will be applicable for different transformation methods in Synthetic Biology. We also provided some experimental materials to help them to set up a better experimental procedure.
iGEM Asia-Pacific 2018 Conference
Members on the team made a visit to the 2018 Asia-Pacific conference held by team NCHU. During the three-day convention, teams from the mainland of China, Taiwan and Japan had a great experience.
During the time in NCHU, we presented our idea to several"

The overall media volume of chemostat will be 500 ml due to the limit of the IPTG amount. The steady state is approximated to take 10 hours but it may vary radically. Diluting rate is kept to 0,072 1/h and glucose feed 20 g/L. When OD600 reaches its balance, IPTG is added to the media to a concentration of 2,0 mM. Induction will take another 10 hours so the overall process time will be probably few days. Gas products will be measured with GC-MS analysator which will be connected with the outlet stream of the chemostat. Because the reactor size is limited (2 L), only few sensors can be attached to the same unit. We will measure the cell density, pH, dissolved oxygen and composition of outstream gas."

Subsequently, we measured the fluorescence intensity of these promoters and related it to the actual promoter strength. The experimental results are shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8 The fluorescence intensity reached a stable stage after 60 min. The fluorescence intensity is measured with the inducer, L-arabinose at 1 mM, 37℃, 200 rpm . The promoter strength is related to the relative fluorescence intensity compared to the control group (K206000 without the inducing of L-arabinose).
Then we fitted the actual strength and the predicted strength, as can be seen in figure 9, the coefficient of determination is 0.8924.

Apply our algorithms to more species. Now Pro-decoder is designed expressly for prediction and evaluation of E. coli promoters, in the near future we'll study the transcription regulation mechanism of other species and try to apply our algorithms to an extended range of species.

UC_Davis,2012,Team:UC Davis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," are redoing the transformation. This time, instead of adding 1 µL of the vector, we will add 4 µL, 5 µL, and 6 µL. Hopefully this increases the amount of cells that take up the vector and therefore the mutated plasmid. The other two transformations were perfectly fine. We continued the SDM experiments on the DNA that came from the SDM of yesterday (pre-transformation) as well as B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 to fix the dehydrogenase mutation. We ran the gels of the SDM and we did not see any bands before or after digestion with DpnI, which digests methylated parental DNA. However, we continued on with the transformations. Gel run on R0010+B0034+E0240 and B0034+Full Cutinase. Second round of SDM done. Transformations of first SDM PCR.
Wednesday August 29th
It turns out that we should not have done the second round of SDM on the DNA straight from the previous SDM reaction. The plasmid DNA must be methylated for the reaction to work, and the only way the DNA gets methylated is in the actual cells. Our new plan is to wait for the sequencing data to come back after each round of SDM to see if we have the correct sequences. Then we will take the correct ones and do a subsequent round of SDM. We redid the SDM with the B0034 + Reductase + B0015 and we finally finished the transformation at 9PM! We transformed with MG1655. Ran screen on second SDM run with and without DPN1.
Thursday August 30th
We started the process for making some DH5 competent cells so that we have a ready stock on hand. We also revised the wiki and added some more information to the pages. We ran a gel on the PCR screen of the SDM reactions to fix the aerobic mutations on J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase and K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase and B0034 + Reductase + B0015. We only had bands show up correctly for the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase and K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, so we prepared liquid cultures for four colonies each in preparation for miniprepping"

Capture SELEX Protocol
Figure 2: This is a graphical overview of the process of Capture SELEX. In brief the candidate aptamers from the random library are attached to beads via their conserved internal domain. Then the target small molecule ligand is introduced with enough time to allow any oligos that bind to dissociate from the beads and bind the ligand. Sequences that come off the beads are iteratively enriched and re-selected for a number of rounds to generate a pool of sequences that express demonstrated binding affinity to the target small molecule.
Acknowledgements and Further Resources:
Our team is immensely thankful to Dr. Mark Ditzler, and Stanford Professor Christina Smolke for giving us feedback on our proposed SELEX protocols. Furthermore, there has been very valuable previous iGEM work done on aptamers that we benefited from greatly when considering what aptamers could do and designing our experiments. Notably, in 2015 the team  at Heidelberg University began developing software that can generate novel aptamer sequences in silico (MAWS).

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#17 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," this exercise is to see whether the bacteria that have survived the chloramphenicol treatment really have been given this property by taking up gfp-rrnb. If the bacteria can't break down the starch which surrounds them on these plates then they have surely taken up the plasmid vector; if they can break down the starch then they might have received the resistance by other means. It may also mean that the vector may have integrated into another area in the Bacillus's chromosome. Today we shall be adding iodine to the plates so that we can assess whether the transformed B. subtilis can break down starch.
What we did
The overnight plate with the B. subtilis growing on it was removed from the fridge (where it had been stored) and taken to the fume cupboard. This agar plate (with the lid removed) was then placed directly over another plate containing iodine crystals (the lid of this plate was also removed). The surface of the agar plate (containing B. subtilis cultures) was directly facing the iodine crystals so that any iodine vapour would hit the colonies of bacteria and the starch surrounding them.
Observations and Results
Before the iodine process was carried out it was noted that no colonies grew in square 1. In this square wild type B. subtilis (which has the amyE gene intact) was plated. The reason for no growth was due to it's lack of resistance to chloramphenicol (an antibiotic added to the starch plate). However in the other squares, which contained 'transformed' Bacillus subtilis, there were colonies present as resistance had been inherited.
After a few seconds of exposure the starch present in the agar plate began to darken and eventually turn black in the presence of iodine vapour. After a minute or so, the whole plate was blackened with iodine vapour.
When looking at the colonies in squares 2-46 there were no clear halos surrounding them. They were all surrounded by the blackened starch with no clear areas. This meant that the starch had not been broken down around them and therefore the bacteria had lost their ability to break down starch.
Conclusion
Stochastic Switch team: LB + starch plate containing Bacillus subtilis with disabled amyE after being treated with iodine - Note there are no halos around the bacteria
After attempting to transform Bacillus subtilis with gfp-rrnb, it appears that the bacteria have successfully taken up the vector plasmid and integrated it into it's own genome (in the correct area, i.e. in the amy"
BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," nutrient intake ability is set as at most 10 units, and the plasmid’s average processing ability is 2 units at a time, under the assumption that the absorbed amount is totally proportional to the gene expression level. Individual E.coli with 0 to 200 plasmids are considered, and after the simulation for 3600 seconds, we count the total amount of nutrients utilized by each kind of E.coli, which reveals the total amount of target protein produced. Then the gene (taken by each plasmid) expression level within each group of E.coli can be calculate, and its change are drawn into the curve below.
Ribosome fall-off rate
But one thing left to be mentioned is that, the express possibility of target gene can differ from the gene in charge of promoting cell growth (i.e. glucose dehydrogenase). Since the target gene can be successfully expressed as long as the promoter combines with the ribosome, while the subsequent TGATG sequence allows for a ratio of  fall-off , therefore results in a decrease in the expression level of glucose dehydrogenase.
The possibility of fall-off is relevant to the length of target gene, which situated before the TGATG sequence, while the gene of growth-promoting part is relatively fixed, which follows the TGATG sequence, and our task is trying to figure out, the change of fall-off rate with respect to the length of target gene.
The intensity of ribosome-sequence combination can be measured as their binding energy through translation, which we assume to be proportional as the length of target gene. Referring to [], the fraction of time that a ribosome elongates the translation process and remains in combination with subsequent sequence. $F = \frac{1}{1+C \exp(G_bind)}$, $C$ a parameter representing the ribosome-assisted unfolding coefficient, while $G_bind$ is the binding energy between given target gene and the ribosome. The curve describing the remaining rate of ribosome, with respect to the length of target gene, is shown.

Educating junior high school students on synthetic biology
To further promote synthetic biology, we gave a series of lectures on synthetic biology as wells our current and previous iGEM project to a group of 40 junior school students from Sichuan province. They also visited our lab and showed great interest in synthetic biology.
Education program of Sichuan's junior high school
In the lecture about our current project, we mainly introduced optogenetics and several interesting studies including the Havard hybrid stingray. Besides, we also introduced some classical ethological and psychological experiments including Pavlov's dog and Skinner box which inspired our experiments. Finally we gave them a chance to use the microscope to observe the C. elegans we are working on.
Talking about interesting facts about C. elegans
Observing living C. elegans
We also showed them the optical and microfluidic devices we built for the project. Most of them had never been in a research lab before. We believe many of them will remember this experience for a long time. We also successfully shown them that science, especially synthetic biology is really fun!
Cohosting iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
2017 Southern China Regional Meeting was hold in Shenzhen at April 29. Our team helped Shenzhen University iGEM team to organize the meet-up. 
It provided the teams from Southern China with a great opportunity to showcase our inspirations and projects, and share our thoughts on the projects of other teams. It also facilitated a number of collaborations between teams. Another purpose of the meeting was to provide the high school teams with an opportunity to find help from college teams. At least 4 high school teams in Shenzhen found help from more experienced iGEM teams.

Throughout the course of our project, the Northeastern iGEM Team has collaborated with the following organizations and iGEM teams from other institutions.
Harvard University iGEM Team
The Harvard iGEM team has been a valuable collaborator during the last couple of months. The Northeastern team has worked with the Harvard team to help characterize four of their PETase producing plasmids. These plasmids were characterized using a fluorescence intensity assay after inducing the transfected bacteria with IPTG. Results showed a significant increase in fluorescence in bacteria containing the PETase plasmids as well as a significant decrease in growth when compared to a negative control. The Harvard team has been working  to confirm the expression of our NOX protein in BL21 cells as well as His-tag purifying the protein. We are excited to see the outcome of those experiments and are grateful for the collaboration effort between both Northeastern iGEM and Harvard iGEM.
University of Virginia iGEM Team
Boston University Hardware iGEM Team
The BU iGEM Hardware team generously offered to print a microfluidic for the characterization of our CsiD promoter that can analyze multiple concentrations of various carbon sources in parallel for imaging with a fluorescent microscope. We are thankful for their support.

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," Questionnaire
The literature shows that IBD is frequent in young, so we want to investigate young people's understanding of gut health and IBD. We produced relevant questionnaires and posted them on a social website, and ended up with 291 responses.
After the survey data came out, we immediately analyzed and discussed with our instructor, professor Ding Chen. Here are some important conclusions:
i. Young people know less about bowel disease and IBD
Only a few people pay attention to information related to intestinal diseases, and most people only pay attention to information related to problems or other special situations. Awareness of intestinal diseases and IBD is low in some developed regions.
ii. Young people have a concentrated source of information about disease
When we surveyed participants for information on bowel disease or health, we found that the vast majority of their information came from the Internet.
iii. Young people lack intestinal health awareness
When asked if they would take care of their gut health in their daily lives, nearly 80 percent of the participants said they would not take care of their gut health. This contrasts sharply with the rapidly rising incidence of the disease.
iv. Intestinal diseases affect people's normal lives
For participants who have been identified with bowel diseases, we asked questions about the impact of bowel disease on their lives, most of whom believed that it affected their lives.  Some even thought that some bowel diseases significantly reduced their quality of life.
v. In the treatment plan, people care most about efficacy
In this questionnaire, we asked participants what factors they were most concerned about in the treatment regimen. Participants were asked to rank the effects, costs, side effects, risks, and access approaches, and most of them rated efficacy as most important, followed by cost, side effects, risks, and ease of access. This inspires us, when designing treatment, in order to satisfy people's expectation to cure, work hard on curative effect more.
vi. Most people do not know about bacterial therapy
Finally, we asked the participants to talk about their acceptance of our proposed treatment. Those who fully accept and reject are in the minority, and most people hold a neutral attitude.
conclusion
This questionnaire has timely solved some problems of our team and pointed out the direction of our future work.
Ⅰ. Public understanding for the intestinal disease and IBD is insufficient, we need to do some of the other more popular science activities to publicize the relevant information, improve the awareness of the public.
Ⅱ. The selection of drugs and treatment design needs to consider a number of factors, we should collect more social opinions, trying to make an effective, safe and"

Outreach
The GT iGEM team has developed a collaboration with a local high school that is in the process of forming their own iGEM team. The GT iGEM team will provide the high school with technical assistance throughout their own competition. To begin the collaboration , the GT iGEM team took a trip to Lambert High School at the request of teacher Janet Standeven to visit the Biotechnology Class and newly forming iGEM club team. Lambert High School is currently the only high school in Georgia to begin forming an iGEM team, and we were excited to assist in this process. The students were mainly Juniors and Seniors who have taken biology courses before. We spent an hour and forty minutes with each class discussing synthetic biology and quorum sensing to give them perspective on opportunities in synthetic biology and iGEM.
Quorum Sensing Activity
We started with a simple quorum sensing activity designed by Dr. Mark Styczynski to get the students up and moving. We gave each person a card with a shape and two colors, and asked them not to share their card with anyone else.
There were six cards of each shape, each with varying colors. In the first round, students could pick one person to ask what their card had on it. If the two cards had the same shape and one color matching, they became a pair. If not, they returned to their seats with no pair. In the next round, each student could ask one person about his or her card.   The pair could only ask one person as a team, but the color could match any of the colors in the group (the shapes would have to all the same). After asking their one person, they had to sit down again. Rounds repeated like this until the whole group of six was found. Prior to the start of a round, if there was a group of three, they could announce one of their colors. If there was a group of four, they could announce their shape. The numbers of singles, pairs, threes, etc. were counted after each round.
The point of this activity was to show the students that bacteria communicate with"

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Human Practice#Meetups_-_-_TEXT.html," introduced the concepts of Synthetic Biology and gave insight into their current projects. The talks were followed by a cosy get-together with barbecue until the late evening.  On Sunday, each team had the chance to present their innovative project ideas to the other teams and discuss it. In the afternoon, team members could attend workshops in which the subgroups talked about biosafety, bioethics and a Germany-wide SynBio Day. Later on, we enjoyed the nice weather by spending the evening in a beergarden with typical Bavarian flair. On the last day, our guests had the opportunity to stroll around Munich’s inner city or even take a short guided sightseeing tour, before attending the workshop at the CASLMU covering Synthetic Biological Tools for Single Cell Analysis. Besides talks by Erez Braun (Haifa) and Roland Wedlich-Söldner (Münster), almost all iGEM teams introduced their project ideas and received further feedback from the audience.
All in all, the meetup was a great opportunity to get to know young, aspiring researchers, to learn about each other’s projects, and also network to develop policy & practices ideas or possibly even bundle projects together.  We thank the CASLMU and our other sponsors for enabling this event and of course all participants for making it such a great success.

Aachen Meetup
We also participated in the Aachen Meetup with three of our team members. Although we had the misfortune of driving 700 km of highway on the last school holiday in some parts of Germany, we finally arrived in the wonderful town of Aachen on Friday night after a ten hour drive and checked in at our cozy Hostel . Since we were really excited about the program that Team Aachen organized, we only had a small walk around the historic city center and made our first culinary experiences before going to bed early in order to be prepared for the Meetup. The program started in the afternoon, and was a warm-hearted welcome by Team Aachen and a reunion of team members who already got to know each other at the Munich Meetup (which was awesome too). To calm down the excitement, Aachen organized a funny game of Jeopardy, building the perfect platform for Team Darmstadt to entertain the rest."
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," amplificated via PCR with Golden Gate compatible overhangs from the biobrick VioABCE (Part: BBa_K274004).
By Golden Gate cloning the peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) was attached to the C-terminus of every pathway protein. Combined with the other necessary parts of the toolbox they represent the level 1 plasmids.
The PTS-tag marks the proteins for the import into peroxisomes. This should first of all point out the functionality of the yeast’s natural import mechanism and also be the basis for demonstrating our own modeled PTS*, proving our designed orthogonal import mechanism . Furthermore we also aim to optimize the working conditions for the enzymes inside of the reaction room - the peroxisomes. For example to vary the pH with new membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. To secure this change, we can also check the current conditions by our designed sensors .
There are several methods to verify the pathway’s enzymes. First of all, violacein and several intermediates (prodeoxyviolacein, deoxyviolacein, proviolacein) are colorful and the production in yeast can be visualized easily. Furthermore we added a His-/Flag-tag to the N-terminus of every protein (see geneious plasmid cards) to confirm their expression via SDS page and western blot. After verifying the presence of the enzymes the next step is to test their functionality. Before performing in vivo experiments in yeast an in vitro assay was implemented. For this the three enzyme pathway leading to PDV was reconstructed, testing VioA, VioB and VioE. To enable the best conditions for the enzymes, the pathway was studied intensively and all needed cofactors were calculated and added to the in vitro reaction (see protocol prodeoxyviolacein in vitro assay ). This included FAD, MgCl2, catalase for decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and the substrate L-tryptophan. The in vitro reaction was followed by qualitative analysis via HPLC and mass spectrometry.
Optogenetic enhancements
Optogenetics provide a useful tool for controlling cellular processes with high spatial and temporal precision. These include the expression of certain genes as well as the interaction or separation of two proteins. As many of our toolbox’s aspects benefit from precise control, we wanted to include optogenetics as a way of increasing its variability. Our plans included optogenetically controlled protein import, control of compartment size and number, and control of product secretion.
Introduction
Our optogenetic toolbox enhancements can be divided into three subgroups:"

Repeated PCR on things that had previously failed, and got the final amino acid biobrick. It should be noted that I ran reactions with either PFU or phusion, and only the phusion worked. This may have been because of the low volume (0.5 uL) used.

The culture has been proven to be transformed successfully with the 3I plasmid! They grew colonies on the Chlor plate and not the Kan plate.
Learned how to miniprep
Checked out some cool posters for the microbiology Conference, and found that there is a assay of interest. The assay (2,6 DCPIP) helps organisms to grow on a diesel contaminated soil.
- Ruichen
All amino acids have been PCR'd out of the genome, and several colonies appeared on the ArgE ligation transformation plate. One colony was selected and grown in culture. The rest of the biobrick ligations were redone and allowed to ligate overnight.
The digests of the products were done with EcoRI and PstI in buffer 3, as opposed to the EcoRI-HF and PstI in buffer 2 we did previously. This was done because PstI has 100% activity in buffer 3, as opposed to 75% activity in buffer 2. Also, we learned that EcoRI-HF has 0% activity in buffer 3.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

If the drug itself is toxic or metabolized to produce toxicity, then it is necessary to control the dosage strictly and conduct periodic blood biochemical examination during the drug use. As for complement activation, make clear whether it is due to individual specificity or universal situation. It can be taken simultaneously with drugs that inhibit complement activation or optimize its structure. In this way, once something unexpected happens, we can stop using the drug or replace therapeutic plan. It is common for currently used drugs to have liver toxicity, so the drug can still be used in clinic regardless of its liver toxicity.
Cooperation among groups
At the end of August, we attended FAFU_CCIC
Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University Conference of China iGEAMer Community , and spent three days there.
The meetup is held for teams to share ideas and help each other. When communicating with other teams, we heard team BGIC-Union need plasmids which we designed last year. Upon this realization, we decided to offer them the plasmids, click here for details in collaboration page. In a few words, we had a fulfilling time in CCIC!
Exactly at this meeting, we found the project of team Lanzhou is relevant to our project in some extent; their project is A novel method in controlling weeds and pests by tandem RNA Interference. Then we made communication in specific experiments at the venue. We want to express our greatest thanks to CCIC, which provided a nice platform for teams to get together, know each other and discuss the possibilities of cooperation.
After CCIC, we made deeper online interaction with team Lanzhou with more team member participated.
In this online interaction, we talked about each team's project mechanism, newly encountered situations in experiments and progress of modeling and human practice.

Publizing with new media
This year our track is fundamentally advanced. Because our product--miRNA inhibitors--is not familiar to the general public, our necessary first step to get public engagement is to let them make friends with miRNA and our project!
In order to achieve a greater influence and outreach, we decided to have our popular science article pushed forward by WeChat subscription (The WeChat ID of the subscription account is zaxue8.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," largest share of nearly 63.7%.
According to the U.S. patient registry 2015, hypertonic saline was prescribed to 21.5% of children in the age group of 0 to 3 years and 41.9% children in the age group of 3 to 5 years. Increasing prevalence of CF among newborn babies is one of the key factors responsible for growing demand for oral drug formulation.
Country wise, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. North America accounted for the largest revenue of $ 2,396.4 million in 2016. CF is most prevalent in North America.
Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing segment with the lucrative growth rate of 18.8%.
Currently according to the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Therapeutics Market Analysis By Drug Class, the availability of CF-specific drugs is low, however, growing approvals and product launches in this market are anticipated to impel growth.
COPD and Asthma:
Key drugs employed for control and diagnosis of asthma and COPD may be classified on the basis of their types which include bronchodilators, leukotriene antagonists, and immunosuppressants.
For asthma, the combination therapy segment including inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting beta-agonists dominated the overall therapeutic class market in 2015. This segment captured over 48.0% of the global market share and this drug class boasts of the following benefits: enhanced therapeutic effect, extensive availability, and enhanced patient medication adherence.
The inhaler segment for asthma includes dry powder, metered dose, and soft mist inhalers. The metered dose inhalers (MDIs) segment dominated the overall market in 2015 in terms of revenue share at over 45.0%. This is majorly attributed to, among others, reliability, versatility, self-containment, easy availability, portability, and cost-efficient medical aerosol delivery option. Increasing requirement for emergency treatment options aimed against sudden asthma attacks and portable devices constitute the crucial determinants contributing towards the largest market share possessed by the dry powder inhalers (DPIs) product segment.
Nebulizers demonstrate significant benefits in the home healthcare section which is expected to provide this segment with future growth opportunities. Nebulizers are small, portable, and able to dispense medication directly into the respiratory tract. These associated benefits are expected to boost its usage rates in the future13.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," genetic research going on today has the potential to benefit all species on the planet, and even if this potential is not fully or quickly realised, the science is a fascinating intellectual exercise in itself. In any event, in the eyes of the universe our meddling is ultimately inconsequential. For these and other reasons, we should not limit genetic research with arbitrary legal restrictions or lambast it with endless moral posturing. Any specific ethical issues that do arise should be discussed sensibly, rationally and openly. The scientific exploration should be allowed, and encouraged, to continue.""

“It strikes me as perhaps showing a tendency towards impatience and a desire to circumnavigate what I feel is the necessary incremental nature of concept development into a final product.  While some people might have liked if we had just spat out the Porsche 911 at the start of the 20th century without the decades of development and tweaking and Morris Minors, we may have just killed much of the country in one (very) swift move had a Porsche been the first car out on the road.  Are not the “mistakes” and sustained time to create improvements and corrections in fact fundamental to the triumph of the final product? To the pride it inspires?  I also wonder about the idea of the “individual researcher”  engineering these things undermines and marginalizes the teamwork of generations – friends, family and neighbours that are represented in the traditional “genetic engineering” of breeding, co-operative effort that resulted in the myriad of breeds that are of use to us today.  Perhaps the ability to make whatever we want, exactly how we want it, whenever we want it underestimates the glory of a truly beautiful disaster.”

“I feel that such work should definitely be possible.  The work I do has so much safety procedures to prevent unregulated contamination, sometimes I think the regulations are if anything a little too overbearing.  I have no problems on work with bacteria, viruses, stem cells, plants etc, although I wouldn't unhesitatingly approve of work on human or say, other mammalian tissue or specimens.  Similarly I have no problems with the ideas of artificial life or patents as they are, although obviously nature shouldn't be patentable.  Well intentioned research, regulated as well as in the industrialized countries on a global scale, would be of great benefit I think.  Ethical issues are a part of how you grew up, we tend to take on our parents and environments ethics and although viral work for instance sounds scary to people, increased education and responsible"
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Blog#14-07-14-01_-_-_TEXT.html," to each and every of the several hundred antibiotics we have developed. Especially places like hospitals, where antibiotics are used day in and day out, are receptacles for multi-resistant germs such as the methicillin-resistant ‘’Staphylococcus aureus’’ (MRSA).
In Europe alone, 3.2 million people annually infect themselves with nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, infections. More than 37.000 of these infections end deadly. Survivors are hospitalized for a long time, and on average cause 4.000 euros of additional health care costs. In all of the EU this sums up to an economical loss of 1.5 million euros per year.
However, the problem is mostly human-made: We downright breed such resistances through the liberal use of antibiotics with humans and animals. A series of provisions could at least prevent that the process gains momentum and that new super bugs arise more quickly than researchers can develop new antibiotics. Such strategies could, for example, include a tighter regulation of antibiotics distribution. “Antibiotic drug consumption is a major driver of antibiotic resistance. Variations in antibiotic resistance across countries are attributable, in part, to different volumes and patterns for antibiotic consumption”, a research group wrote in The Lancet Infectious Disease this July. On top of diminishing the spread of antibiotic resistances, lowering the consumption of antibiotics could have another important positive effect: It would lead to that we are not continuously maltreating our own, helpful bacteria in our gut.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and those modifications is probably a very huge stress and affects the E. coli propagation mechanism very much which is why we controlled it by a gate meaning that as long as there is no glucose in the medium which gives them energy to reproduce and produce things in general there will be no lure or toxin production. So all these lures and toxins are only produced when glucose is available in a certain concentration for the bacteria. But of course it is still not a guarantee that it will work out in the end as well. However, this is one of the measurements we have taken so far.
You have mentioned before that there are breeding sites of mosquitoes. Do you have a few preferences? You are also testing those mosquitoes, so you are also conducting field tests and you probably know a lot about the ecological cycles of mosquitoes because you are researching on that. Do you have tips on where we could place our traps the best if we intend to use them on the field to protect a village efficiently?
Dr. Hammond: So I am actually terrible at answering that question. It is a big concern within the project. I get to hear about very clever people telling me about how you are supposed to do it but as a molecular biologist I am not the best at this but you do have these breeding sights for different types of mosquitoes which are typically this sort of stagnant pools of fresh water in the rainy season that are not large and typically straided. That is the sort of thing I like to go for. But that is going to be the larvels breeding grounds.
The adults will come together in swarms and they usually like to swarm in very specific areas so some of the best experts can tell you exactly where they will swarm but there is not much knowledge across the whole of Africa. There is knowledge about a couple of villages.
But in general for your trap I guess the best thing would be inside someone’s house. And potentially in Africa lots of the houses are built using eaves. And eaves are sort of like an opening in the roof. You have this opening where the roof and the wall meet and allows air to go in and keep the home cool. And at the same time doing that it allows CO2 and all these odors go out of the house and the mosquitoes smell that and then they come in and they fly straight through the eaves. So if you had to place your traps at theses eaves perhaps you would be catching mosquitoes as they are coming in into the house right where the odors are coming out most strongly. So you can benefit from the odors that are naturally coming out of someone’s home and then lure"

This year, FAFU-CHINA team had many collaborations with many Chinese teams and exchanges parts with them. We helped different teams to design protocol, construct the parts and verify their results independently. Meanwhile, other teams helped us to build model, test the accurate data and purify the expressed protein. Parts exchange also played an important role in collaborations.
Collaborations with SZU-China team
On 17thJune, Junhao visited the Shenzhen University and their team (SZU-China) after Synthesis Biology Meeting. SZU-China focused how to utilize Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii to produce more hydrogen. We also tried to express toxin proteins in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii. Based on the various background, they transform plasmids into Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii by glass-bead method while we used electroporation. The genetic transformation in Chlamydomonas reintmrdtii is still big problem, with their help, the transformation of Cry10Aa-2A-Cyt1 was successful by glass-bead method.
Meanwhile, due to various and unknown reasons, SZU-China encountered a common problem that they failed to get any clone or amplified the PSB1C3 plasmid could not get any clone in the lab. We reproduced their experiment in our lab. Luckily, we got the positive result and figured out that their Chloramphenicol was inactivated.

The synthase catalyzes the formation of the corresponding backbone by IPP and DMAPP, and synthesizes different terpenoids via cytochrome P450 catalysis or other carboxyl, hydroxyl and glycosylation modifications. Due to the complexity of its metabolic regulation network, it involves many layers and a wide range, which is the difficulty of current research. Therefore, through the study of the important anabolic regulation of terpenoids, it is helpful to promote the discovery of the mechanism of metabolic regulation of the steroids.
In addition to genetic engineering and optimization, optimization of the fermentation process is also an important strategy to increase the yield of terpenoids. E. coli recombinants can be fermented to yield up to 2.7 g/L limonene, and 435 mg/L in glucose, as optimized by carbon source and using glycerol as a substrate. Through the optimization of the medium carbon source and introduction into the dodecane/water two-phase system, the yield of the recombinant E. coli myrcene producing myrcene reached 58 mg/L. In addition, using the fed-batch fermentation strategy, the Pseudomonas putida engineering strain producing linear monoterpene flavoring geranyl acid can ferment and produce 193 g/L geranic acid.
At present, the research on microbial heterogeneous synthesis of scented spices has made some breakthroughs in recent years, but still faces many problems to be solved. Among them, the choice of chassis cells is one of the key factors for the success of microbial synthesis of terpenoid compounds. At present, the most commonly used steroid-like chassis cells are model microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but they are often not realized in the expression of some key enzymes, protein folding and effective cell localization. Recently, a few primitive organisms with relatively simple genetic manipulations, such as Nicotiana benthamiana, ginseng root, and Physcomitrella patens, have been applied to the heterologous synthesis of some complex terpenoids. However, the genetic manipulation and production conditions of these plant cells still have this great limitation. Up to now, the yield of most engineering strains is still limited to the level of milligrams per upgrade, so the development of a more productive chassis cell, more efficient approach to assembly methods and adaptation of artificial biological systems is the synthesis of microbes and spices. The key to industrial applications.

GaTech 2010 Biobrick BBa_K410000
Objectives:
1. Test the BioBrick operation to different substrates and temperatures:
a. Substrates:
LB
Minimal essential medium
Saline solution
Lunar land
b. Temperatures:
8°C
23°C
37°C
2. Improve the characterization of the BioBrick tested in other substrates to study the performance of the promoter.
3. Define the Biobrick promoter strength at the temperatures and selected substrates.
Methodology
We chose 4 temperatures:
• 5-10°C
• 10-20°C
• 20-30°C
• 37°C
These temperatures were selected so we could evaluate the response to cold shock in various ranges of our BioBrick. Since the lab equipments we had available couldn’t reach temperatures between 10-20°C this temperature was not used during the experience. Finally, the lab equipment allowed us to make the experiments in: 37°C, 23°C and 8°C.
We also chose 3 different Growth Media:
• Saline Solution
• Liquid LB
• Minimal Media
These growth medias where selected to evaluate the response of our BioBricks in different metabolic pathways.  We prepared 9 15mL Falcon Tubes, these tubes contained:
• First 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Saline Solution + a colony of the BioBrick.
• Second 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Minimal Media + a colony of the BioBrick.
• Last 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Liquid Luria Broth + a colony of the BioBrick.

The ""super"" plasmid ligation product from last week was transformed into chemically competent DH5𝛼. Growth was very slow, however after a couple of days colonies were seen on the plate and 8 colonies were mini-prepped and digested with NotI-HF for confirmation.
Week 26 (October 23 - October 27, 2017)
The ""super"" plasmid colonies digested with NotI-HF in Week 25 were run on a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 30 minutes. Several colonies produced the expected band sizes (4.8kb and 2.0kb). Figure 5 below shows 4 of the digested colonies. Colony 6 had the crispest bands and lowest amount of faint background smearing seen at other band sizes, therefore it was chosen to be transformed into BL21(DE3) for protein expression.
Figure 5: Screening results of 4 colonies of DH5α transformed with pSB1C3-PhaCAB-Phasin-HlyA Tag. Plasmids from these colonies were digested with NotI-HF and XbaI (D) then run on a 1% agarose gel at 100V for 30 minutes. The molecular ladder (L) is visible on the far left and the expected band sizes, obtained from Benchling Virtual Digest, are visible on the right. Undigested plasmid (U) was used as a control and the digests from colony 6 (colony used for cloning into BL21(DE3) for secretion assays) are visible in lanes 6-7.
Transformation of pSB1C3-PhaCAB-Phasin-HlyA Tag was successful and many colonies were obtained that can be used to carry out a test of PHB secretion.
Week 27 (October 30 - November 3, 2017)
Kaitlin performed a secretion assay. The asssay was carried out in triplicates, with a negative control of pSB1C3-PhaCAB. After induction with IPTG, samples were separated into intracellular PHB fractions and secreted fraction samples by differential centrifugation after either 24 hours or 48 hours of incubation. The results of this assay can be seen here and more experimental details about the assay can be found on our Secretion page.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Though S. cerevisiae doesn’t naturally produce ß-carotene, it has been shown that with the introduction of two carotenogenic genes from the carotenoid-producing ascomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, S. cerevisiae could synthesize ß-carotene (Verwaal et al., 2007). These two genes are crtYB which codes for phytoene synthase and lycopene cyclase, and crtI, which encodes phytoene desaturase.
Additional overexpression of crtE (GGPP synthase) from X. dendrorhous, and an additional copy of a truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase gene (tHMG1) from S. cerevisiae were both reported to increase the carotenoid production levels in S. cerevisiae (Verwaal et al., 2007). A more recent study also showed that ß-carotene synthesis in this yeast could also be increased with codon-optimization of crtI and crtYB, and by introducing the HMG-CoA reductase (mva) from Staphyloccocus aureus rather than the truncated HMG-CoA reductase (tHMG1) from S. cerevisiae (Li, 2013).

And this collaboration results would help us verified the function of the gene tetA, which would provide a tetracycline resistance to the original E.coli, and help us better to improve our detecting chasis in the project.
Near the end of the 2018 iGEM competition, we have borrowed the HPLC machine to measure the content of tetracycline in the water samples and degraded solutions.
In this year, TUST-China have a close contacting with the team NKU-China in many aspects, not only in the experiments but also sharing some interesting failure bugs during the project going and established a good relationship.
Collaboration with  XJTU-China
We have exchanged our team logo with the team XJTU-China, and we draw their chemical structure formula with the E.coli including GFP reporter on the petri dishes, and then we have invited some other students into the lab to draw some logos on the dishes. We want to let more people close to the biology.
Collaboration with  Peking
We have attended the synthesis biology lessons in Peking University in the winter holiday. And in this holiday meeting, all of us got plenty of molecular knowledge and those good for us to continue our project in next time.
Collaboration with  Jilin_China
We are invited to attend CCiC in Shanghai. There, we met and exchanged ideas with the members from team Jilin_China. We introduced our projects and built up mutual facilitation with each others. After that, we got contact with them to discuss our projects and possible             collaborations we could do.
Changchun, Jilin is a typical industrial city with lots of heavy industry factories and biological product factories, which could provide us with polluted water for tetracycline detecting and degradation. If we want to detect the antibiotic pollution situation in this area, the team of Jilin_China could provide the local water samples for us to testing. And then, we can use the water sample to measure the tetracycline content with HPLC method.
This year, Jilin_China focuses on SynRT, they did a site-directed mutagenesis of superfolder GFP in iGEM part registry(BBa_I7469616), sfGFP(BbsI free). They would like to construct a standard partof sfGFP(BbsI free)(BBa_K2541401) However, after several trials, they failed in ligation, we helped them to address this scientific barrier."

CGU_Taiwan helped us independently verify our OmpR234 overexpression results using a different dye, crystal violet, which is also commonly used to stain biofilms (figure 3-18, B). Interestingly, both biofilms characterized in our assay are found around the glass coverslip and do not seem to stick well to the glass surface (figures 3-16A & 3-17A).

When all three constructs were compared, we find that overexpression of both OmpR234 and CsgD (BBa_K2229300) increases biofilm production the most (figure 3-19). BBa_K2229300 also increased adhesion to our glass coverslips, and we could see a layer of biofilm which remained attached to the glass surface after the washing steps (figure 3-19, A).

XJTLU-CHINA
Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University iGEM team hoped that we completed the following descriptions, but their model design changed later, and this program may be abandoned by them.
XJTLU would like to complete a model describing exosome carrying mRNA into the BBB (blood-brain barrier). It is necessary to construct a relationship about the parameters. We assisted them in the construction of the third model. Our main work is to establish a mathematical model that calculates the effective residual amount of mRNA that reaches endothelial cells after t at a certain size. The method is to read the material they provided and other material we found to understand their model concept, analyze the main factors affecting the remaining amount: secretion loss and degeneration loss, and then discuss the rationality of the model.
The overall purpose of their third model is to simulate the following figure. The purpose of simulating this figure is to obtain a range of effective values of mRNA that finally reaches the nerve cells by simulating the process by which the exosomes pass through the blood-brain barrier.
OUC-China
We have contacted Ocean University of China in the early stage to reach a cooperation. We will provide a PDF version of our Synthetic Biology comic book in our campus synthetic biology and iGEM publicity activities, which we will explain on the day of the event.
On September 28, 2018, the iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University and the Science Association of the College of Life Sciences jointly organized the iGEM science popularization activities on campus. The whole activity focused on “Going Close to the Laboratory – the Daily Life of the School Team"",""Going Close to the Competition - the Experimentation Task and Benefits, ""Going Close to Dreams - Recruiting Talents"" Three themes, using the panels to present synthetic biology knowledge, iGEM competition profiles and team composition, as well as new topics for this year's iGEM team.

Reporter plasmids assembly
Back to Reporter systems || Ptet | Plac | Plasmid details
We built two different systems: one containing TetR + RFP and another containing TetR + LacI + RFP.
In the first readout system, RFP is repressed when TetR binds to its Ptet recognition sequence. However, the sequential use of  two repressors in the second system allows us to have a direct activation of the selection gene when TetR binds its recognition sequence.
First readout system:
Second readout system:
We need several plasmids to build our two systems:
A reporter plasmid for the first system: J61002 Ptet-RFP
A reporter plasmid for the second system: J61002 Plac-RFP
A plasmid with TetR for the first system: pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR
A plasmid containing TetR and LacI for the second system: pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI

Also, I decided to model the degradation of the thermosensitive protein with a mass action kinetics law. So I implemented these two new formulas. Results showed some problems because the system didn’t change the state.
On Wednesday I met Luis, Adri and Manuel to show them my advances. However, Manuel found some mistakes in my models, and we worked to fix them. We decided which work must be done before September.
On Friday I received a book which will help me to understand some reactions of the system.
Week 5
Holidays!
Week 6
In these two weeks I work at home. I made many implementations in Matlab, simulink and Simbiology. I tried to find the best tool for doing a stochastic integration. Matlab’s scripts seemed to be the best. I spend much time adjusting models.
Finally I start reading information about the following system, the modified toggle switch, however I don’t understand how the improvements works, so I decided to wait to September and meet Félix.
Week 7
Almost the entire team is back from holidays and we start again the hard work. I met Luis and Adri to catch up. But almost the whole week I continued working on my models putting them ready for next week’s meeting. Also, modeling basic toggle switch must be done, because the deadline is two weeks later!
Week 8
After the meeting with the entire group, I talk to Félix to be informed about how works the improved bistable. Also, I talk to Amalia, to have some parameters values, due to she had made many experiments with the basic bistable.
The rest of the week I spend my days trying to implement the modified model. I had lot of problems in this purpose.
Week 9
I finished my work on Matlab and my programs seem to work without many problems, so I start making my working report.

I could put up a sentimental quote here that expresses my love for synthetic biology. But that's something I can't put into words. The only reason I joined iGEM was this passion to do something, to work on biological system that can bring about a difference, to do synthetic biology. Life is simple.. Eat, Sleep, Clone and Repeat.

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#halo_-_-_TEXT.html," a low amount of cells for inoculation there was a long lag phase of nearly 10 hours. During this phase the glycerin concentration was approximately constant. The following cell growth caused a decrease of glycerin concentration and of pO2. After 11 hours the value fell below 50 %, so that the agitation speed increased automatically. After 21 hours the deceleration phase started and therefore the agitation speed decreased. The maximal OD600 of 9.9 was reached after 22 hours, when the cells entered the stationary phase. The glycerin was completely consumed. The cells were harvested at this time. It might have been better to cultivate a few hours longer.
Since Regionals: Purification of BHAL
The harvested cells were resuspended in Ni-NTA equilibration buffer and mechanically disrupted by homogenization . The cell debris were removed by centrifugation and microfiltration via Millipore Pellicon XL 50 . The supernatant of the cell lysate was concentrated with Millipore Pellicon XL 50 with 10 kDa and loaded on the Ni-NTA column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 cm-2. Then the column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) Ni-NTA equilibration buffer . The bound proteins were eluted by an increasing Ni-NTA elution buffer step elution from 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazol) with a length of 80 mL, to 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol) with a length of 80 mL and finally to 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol) with a length of  90 mL. This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In figure 3 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak. A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated here . The chromatogram of the BHAL elution is shown in Figure 3:

We sent 7 colonies for sequencing to determine whether the dCas9 system is present in Plasmid 1. We ran the digestions from Monday on an analytical gel and got two bands: <1 kb and ~ 5 kb. We were expecting bands of <1 kb and ~9 kb, so we are wondering if there is some contamination. We had our biweekly meeting with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard and discussed the meaning of these conflicting bands.
Rescue PCR was done again to make sure that we had enough gBlock since we have been using them to re-do failed reactions. Updated website attributions page. Project page created for codon optimization project. Inverse PCR on pFTV accomplished using new reverse inverse PCR primer. Inverse PCR and Rescue PCR products ran in gel, excised and purified. Digestions with Pst1 and Cla1 ran overnight.

The relationship between residual antigen concentration and                     time
In order to optimize the antigen fixation time, the relationship between the remaining antigen                         concentration and the fixed time was made.
From this, the reaction formula \(\mathrm{α}\) can be obtained and the pattern diagram                         ω1 is given, where \(A\) is the antigen and \(M\) is the concentration of the                         reaction site on the slide. Since the addition liquid fixing and treatment methods are                         unchanged, \(M_0\) does not change.
$$A+M\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}A-M \tag{ α }$$
Fig.ω1 Fixed antigen pattern
If \(\theta=\frac{[A-M]}{M_0}\), that is, the position occupied by the immobilized antigen                         accounts for the percentage of all positions of the entire slide. Then by the dynamics                         relationship, the following relationships can be listed:
$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=K_a(1-\theta)[M_0][A]-K_d\theta[M_0]$$
If \(θ\) is determined, that is, the proportion of the number of fixed positions of the                         slide, it is usually the maximum concentration under the premise of disturbing the liquid                         crystal. Experimental data gives that \(θ\) is generally optimal between 0.05 and 0.1. Let                         \(b=\frac{K_a}{K_d}\), the relationship can be got:
$$[A]=C_1exp[-K_a(1-\theta)[M_0]t]+\frac{\theta}{b(1-\theta)}$$
In this way, the relationship between the residual concentration of the added antigen and the                         reaction time can be obtained (4):
$$[A]=C_1exp[mt]+n\tag{4}$$
Therefore, based on this relationship, the relationship between the residual antigen                         concentration and time can be predicted, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b).
(a) One Concentration
(b) The relationships of multiple concentration
Fig.2 Relationship between residual antigen concentration and time                                     when immobilized antigen
Combining the formula (2) in the content of the gray scale model, the relationship between the                         fixed time and the gray value of the relationship (5) can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 3.

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," response to DNA damage is the SOS response [Friedberg et al 1995, Walker et al. 1996].   This systems can be divided into two class: the SOS Photoreactivation repair and the  SOS respond triggered by RecA protein. The first uses the photolyase, a poorly expressed enzyme(encoded by genes phrA and phrB)  which  binds the pyrimidine dimers and uses the blue light to split them apart as showed in Figure 13. Otherwise single stranded DNA produced by several DNA-damaging agents can be bound by RecA protein, resulting in conversion of this protein to its activated form. The RecA repair system doesn’t need light and Lexa protein controls the expression of 43 genes [Courcelle et al. (2001)]  that cooperate together to repair the extensive genetic  damage (Figure 14). RecA and LexA proteins play an important rule for the regulatory of SOS Recombination System.  A LexA binding site is present in all the SOS promoters genes' and it works as a repressor of SOS system. In presence of DNA damage (DNA Single Strains) RecA becomes active and interacts with LexA protein, the repressor of the SOS genes [Wagner et al., 1999] . This interaction triggers the autocatalytic cleavage of LexA and consequent destruction of its ability to function as a repressor, which results in the derepression of SOS genes [Mustard and Little 2000; Fernandez De Henestrosa et al. 2000]. When the damage is repaired, DNA single strains are not present in the cell and the RecA protein no longer promotes the auto-cleavage of the LexA which is restored to its initial repression level (Figure 15).

My name is Feifan Xu, a junior student. It is my great honor to become part of iGEM LZU-China 2015. To be honest, I am a diffident guy more or less. So work like electrophoresis PCR or other molecule experiment are quite suitable for me. My primary job is parts construction. Besides that, the measurement of part expression quantity and a little MFC work is also my duty. I like swim in my free time. I love computer games too. After the experiment of the passing year, I find out a truth. The only failure is give up, if you keep fighting, hope is coming.

We also collaborated with Team Tianjin by sharing ideas, protocols and information. Later, we helped them to characterize their biobricks BBa_K821001 and BBa_K821002 using fluorescence stereomicroscope.
OUC_iGEM Team
Also we established a positive, cooperative, and steady relation with OUC-China . Our team and OUC iGEM helped each other a lot this summer. We helped them to build stochastic model and gave some important advice about their program, which provides guidance for the experimental implementation.  Reciprocally, they shared DNA material of agarase, an enzyme that degrades agar, with us, which is very useful for our 3D bio-printing.

Degradation rate of laccase11 must be taken into account due to suboptimal conditions
Results
We ran three simulations in SimBiology, each over a different timespan to analyse how laccase production changed over time. In the first second of laccase production, we see polyethylene degradation beginning from around 0.6 sec:
After 10 seconds, the first few molecules have been degraded.  The constant diffusion of POPs into the cell is essential for the continuing degradation:
At 100 seconds, the rate of degradation has risen to almost 1 PE molecule per second and we can assume that this will continue as long as the supply of POPs remains constant:
From these results, we can see that our bacteria will degrade polyethylene linearly after an initial non-linear increase in degradation. However, these graphs do not indicate which factors, such as initial concentrations, parameter values and environmental conditions are affecting degradation.  For this reason, we decided to run a sensitivity analysis on our model to test the robustness of the model.
Sensitivity analysis
We used SimBiology's sensitivity analysis tool to compute the sensitivity of the cell to variations in each model parameter and the initial amount of each DNA species. The aim was to find out how each of these impacts on the final concentrations of degraded PE and laccase.
The results show that the amount of PE degraded is dependent on the kinetics of the laccase reaction (see the paramters labelled R8.k17 and R8.k19 in the upper bars in the diagram below, which correspond to the Vm and Km values  of laccase respectively). On the other hand, the amount of laccase degraded outside the cell is most dependent on the translation rate of laccase (see the parameter R6.k20 in the lower bars of the diagram). In addition, it also moderately affected by the rate of diffusion of laccase outside of the cell (see R7.p10) and therefore on the amount of laccase which ends up outside of the cell (Lexdegp).
The original aim in the development of the degradation model was to analyse the effect of POP, which acts as an environmental factor, on PE degradation. However, through the use of sensitivity analysis, it was deduced that there are more important parameter considerations (such as enzyme activity and translation rates) to take into account. It is reasonable to assume that POP levels are present in constant amounts, hence allowing for degradation of PE which varies"
Paris_Bettencourt,2011,Team:Paris Bettencourt#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," groups with the leaflet on the left and without on the right
Their basic idea is to create two leaflets explaining respectively biology and modelling to people who are from the other discipline. We therefore sent them videos of pairs of students taking their tests (one from each background); these students pertain to the CRI's undergrad and master students (www.cri-paris.org). The choice of the target group emanates from the fact that these students represents a balanced mix of biologists and maths/physics and little did they know of synthetic biology. As for the test itself we followed the protocol that was discussed and decided upon with the mentor and members of the Grenoble team. For more information, see: Grenoble's human practice page .
Sharing strains collaborations :
Thanks to the Peking iGEM team , we re-used their 2007 iGEM project result (the push-on push-off system) in our own project. They kindly sent this device to us as well as microbial strains. We are indebted to their team leader for participating to a couple of our reunions at the beginning of our project during his stay in Paris; his ideas helped us moving forward in the different competing projects we had in mind.
Thanks to the Fatih Turkey iGEM team , we shared plasmids and protocol for B. subtilis transformation. We have also rewritten all together the main B. subtilis registry page, curating it for non-functional and mis-assigned BioBricks as well as peer-reviewing the working parts we used.
Our ibpA-mCherry strain were sent to the Dundee iGEM team for a better characterization their sphereactor.

""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
This week one of our team members left for a conference in Slovenia, and took advantage of the opportunity to meet with the Slovenian iGEM team. Despite having one less person in the lab, the results obtained were quite encouraging! Standard lipid samples of BL21 with no insert prepared a few weeks ago were analysed using the Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) Analysis technique through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry(GC-MS). We showed BL21 cells produced some 18:1, but no polyunsaturated fatty acids…So we already have results that will act as a base reference to compare with transformed cells! After doing some reading, we also realised that the 18:1 the cells were producing was not the one we need (with a double bond at the Δ9 site), so in the future, the appropriate 18:1 will be fed to the cells for the Omega-3 pathway to occur. After many ligations, transformations, colony PCRs and incubations, it seemed like we finally ligated ELO6 and Δ12 into our vectors, but diagnostic tests have only shown to be positive for Δ12 desaturase. We transformed BL21 cells with the vector containing this gene so that next week protein expression and a lipid profile of these cells could be done.
Week 8
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
BL21 cells containing Ni1 and two samples of Ni2-  Ni2(1) and Ni2(2 )- had been induced and grown overnight at 16 degrees.  The resuspended cells were split into two eppendorfs, one was frozen.  The other was used to prepare samples for running on a protein gel, each sample was run twice. This was then transferred onto a membrane and blotted in 5% milk overnight in preparation for a western blot the following day  The membrane was taken from the rocker in the cold room and left in 10% milk solution at room temperature for an hour. It was then cut in half so that each section contained the 3 different samples.  This allowed us to do two different western blots, one with anti his antibodies, that should bind to our two new nickel peptides and anti GST which should bind to all our samples due to the GST tag our protein is attached"

Conclution
    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.
1. The final concentration of chloramphenicol is not clearly defined in the experimental protocol. Although we have made the experiment proceed smoothly based on experience, we believe that accurate antibiotic dosage requirements are still necessary;
2. Regarding the use of the plate reader: although there are some descriptions in the experimental protocol that explain the experimental design and a simple explanation of the plate reader, we used the plate reader incorrectly at the beginning of the experiment, leading to a invalid data. So we still expect more instructions on the setup and use of the plate reader;
3. Regarding the preservation of competent cells: we have transferred the competent cells position between buildings due to the change of the laboratory position, which took about 10 minutes. And in the transformation experiment, the competent cells stayed outside for too long. These improper storage of competent cells made the bacteria grow very unsatisfactorily after plating. Therefore, the preservation of competent cells is very important.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter2_-_-_TEXT.html," of interest     in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)     and their vast array of applications in     both space exploration and terrestrial     uses such as the delivery of medicine     and monitoring the environment, the     2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM     team is pioneering the development of     a fully biological UAV for scientific and     humanitarian missions.
We are working to engineer cells to synthesize cellulose     acetate as a novel bioplastic, characterize biological methods of     waterproofing the material, and program this material’s systemic     biodegradation. In addition, we aim to use an “amberless”     system to prevent horizontal gene transfer from live cells on the     material to microorganisms in the flight environment.
So far, we have: successfully transformed Gluconacetobacter     hansenii, a cellulose-producing bacterium, with a series of     promoters to test transformation efficiency before adding the     acetylation genes; isolated novel waterproofing protein bands     present in wasp nest material; transformed the cellulosedegrading     genes into Escherichia coli; and we have confirmed that     the amberless construct prevents protein expression in wild-type     cells. In addition, as part of our human outreach project, we have     been in touch with leaders in the fields of UAVs, synthetic biology,     and earth sciences, and it is clear that biodegradable UAVs could     have a significant impact on the industry.
Plan for future steps: For the production of cellulose acetate, we plan to use directed     evolution to select for those organisms which produce the polymer     with highest acetate content.
For our wasp protein waterproofing project, we plan to transform     yeast with the genes for the cellulose waterproofing proteins and     run a high throughput assay to isolate the colonies that produce     the most water-resistant products.
Finally, for our biodegradability project, we plan to link the     production of our esterases and cellulases with a quorum sensing     time-delay mechanism.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
Cambridge JIC 2016
SCAU-China 2016"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," are reusable between different biosensor systems, such as fluorescent protein coding sequences or devices which amplify signals. However, these parts rarely get reused. For example, the Cambridge iGEM team (2009) developed a library of sensitivity tuners which were able to convert polymerase per second inputs to a desired polymerase per second output, allowing a biosensor developer control over the sensitivity of their systems to various target analyte concentrations. This project was impressive enough to win the competition. However, despite the parts' clear usefulness, there is no documentation that the parts have ever been successfully reused within the iGEM competition. We suggest that this is due to the difficulties in assembling biosensors systems – the screening of a library of sensitivity tuners would require the ability to easily generate multiple sensor circuits. Although only one part would be changing in each circuit variant, current genetic engineering techniques mean that parts are tightly coupled together, preventing the simple swapping of parts. Therefore, we propose a modular, multicellular system for biosensor development, using a cell-to-cell communication system to eradicate the requirement for further genetic engineering of reusable biosensor devices (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Multicellular Sensynova system.
Cell-to-Cell communication
Bacteria have native quorum sensing systems which enable cell-to-cell communication through the production and detection of hormone-like auto-inducers. These molecules allow the synchronisation of behaviour in large populations of bacterial cells (Waters & Bassler, 2005). One such system involves the autoinducer AHL (Acylated Homoserine Lactone). AHLs compose of a lactone ring with an acyl side chain containing between 4 and 18 carbons (Churchill & Chen, 2011). Various AHL synthases exist, which produce AHL with different modifications and side change lengths. AHL receptors are sensitive to AHLs of specific length. For example, it has been found that the Rhl system, producing and detecting AHL of acyl carbon length 4 and the Las system, producing and detecting AHL of acyl carbon length 12, exhibit little crosstalk – the receptor component of the system is sensitive only to carbon chains of the correct length (Brenner et al., 2007). The orthogonal nature of the AHL family of autoinducers has enabled their use in a variety of synthetic systems. They are often used as biological “wires”, linking either inter- or intracellular processes. These “wires” have been previously used in a number of synthetic biology systems, e.g. Gupta et al. (2013) and Tasmir et"

Construction of aceB constitutive expression construct. While all components of our intended aceB construct were obtained, the construct is yet to be completed. The full construct with EF-1alpha promoter, mitochondrial leader sequence, aceB gene, reporter protein and polyadenylation sequence are to be assembled in pSB1C3 backbone.
Tests of promoter efficiency. GRP78 and FABP1 promoter efficiency can be measured by fluorescence intensity of green fluorescence protein at different fatty acid concentrations.
Construction of inducible glyoxylate shunt construct. The inducible promoter is to be fused with two functional genes, aceA and aceB.
Transfection of construct for the inducible glyoxylate shunt. The construct developed to establish the inducible glyoxylate shunt is to be transfected into HepG2 cells to test its functionality. We plan to place the cell in media of containing different concentrations of fatty acids. The fatty acid uptake rate of our cells engineered for inducible glyoxylate shunt will be compared with that of those expressing constitutive glyoxylate shunt.

astaxanthin synthesis
Fig.2-1-8 astaxanthin
Our team synthesized astaxanthin for the first time in iGEM. Thus the carotenoid synthetic pathway reached the end. This work was done by assembling the new BioBrick part crtW and zeaxanthin synthesis constructs we designed. From the result of “zeaxanthin synthesis”, we decided to use pBad/araC promoter and double plasmids construct. After constructing the new BioBrick device ( BBa_K395706 ) to synthesize astaxanthin, we characterize the function under the condition I in table<2>.  Thus we confirmed astaxanthin by TLC (Fig2-1-6 spot IV).
By introduction of crtW gene to the crtZ plasmid (the second construct of five combinations in “zeaxanthin synthesis”,having pBad/araC promoter), new spot ((Fig2-1-6 spot IV) appeared on TLC plate. The spot shows lower Rf value than that derived from crtEBIY (II) and a little higher Rf value than that derived from crtZ-crtW(III). All the Rf values of  spots corresponded to reported values  respectively. [2 ] Thus we succeeded in characterizing astaxanthin production activity of crtW. ( BBa_K395705 , BBa_K395706 )
For the same reason as “zeaxanthin synthesis”, we examined under several conditions →table<2>.
In the consequence of TLC, we could confirm that these four samples were astaxanthin.
Not only astaxanthin but also another spots were produced at II.
We regarded them as intermediary metabolites between zeaxanthin and astaxanthin.
The activity of pBad/araC promoter is measured in detail on another page. →click

Quantities of the RecA protein return to baseline levels within 4 to 6 hours, since the event. This decrease, causes the removal of signal-induced repair of DNA damage, eliminating the agent that activates the RecA protein, resulting in increased concentration of the LexA repressor.

Why was it chosen to work on this project?
The interest in improving the radiation detection system for people working in the area of ​​Health was due to the fact that members of the group were interested in the idea of ​​studying Medical Technology or Radiology, so that most of them knew about the risks and protocols Which should be maintained in order to minimize the possibility of serious damage to the radiation emitted by the equipment used, such as the use of dosimeters, which measure the radiation exposed in the medium. But through research we discover a need in this area, because these instruments mentioned above are very sensitive to light, moisture and heat; Factors that would alter their results. In addition, the most important point was that there was no immediate delivery of information from the device, since, according to Chilean legislation, dosimeters used in laboratories are sent to review the SEREMI, monthly, quarterly and even semiannually, depending on the institution And that, in the event of an overexposure, it will be a late warning and damage will have already been caused. Adding information to this, the dosimeters of better quality currently have a very high value in the market, so not all laboratories can access these devices. Also, the lack of safety for radiologists and medical technologists also encouraged our team to create the system that would provide accurate information that will warn the professional who is in danger. The bacteria detects ionizing radiation at harmful levels and when this occurs it gives off a lemon scent and a violet pigment, alerting the specialist that he is in an environment with levels of radiation harmful to his body and also can evacuate the area in time to reduce the amount of damages possible"

Our Philosophy
During the whole course of the iGEM competition, we tried to keep an open dialogue with experts, as well as with the society. Our ultimate goal was to keep our project aligned to the real societal needs around MERS-CoV detection and rapid containment during a potential outbreak. The received feedback let us understand the real challenges behind field diagnostics and enabled us to broaden the existing diagnostic approaches to novel paths. By doing so, we hope that we set a solid basis which can actively help and inspire researchers and healthcare practitioners all over the world.
The Problem
The Hellenic Pasteur Institute
During the brainstorming phase of the competition, before concluding with our project, we had the chance to discuss with different researchers from various backgrounds. Our visit to the Hellenic Pasteur Institute during these very first steps introduced us to the fields of travel medicine and diagnostics. We understood the significant difficulties that viral detection and monitoring enclose. Dr Pelagia Foka highlighted the necessity of alternative on-field detection methods for the prevention and containment of future epidemics caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The need for portable diagnostic alternatives, detached from intensive laborious techniques posed a specific scope for the rest of the project.
After discussions with Dr Petros Iliadis, we realized the constraints of classic immunoassays currently in use for disease diagnosis, such as the protein production and purification cost that sometimes make this kind of tests inaccessible to the end-users. In addition, since these tests detect the products of the immune response against the parasite, they cannot detect the infection in early stages, before the response occurs (window-period). For the aforementioned reasons, we turned our attention on the very promising field of molecular diagnostics for viral detection.
Setting as our primary goal the development of a molecular detection method suitable for on-field diagnosis, we yet had to figure out how to get there. Harnessing the possibilities of synthetic biology, we decided to make use of the toehold-switch technology in a cell-free environment in order to detect the MERS-CoV"
