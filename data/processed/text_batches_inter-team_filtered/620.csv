UT-Tokyo,2015,Team:UT-Tokyo#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"_0)$. Then $(u_0, v_0)$ isn’t a “stable“ point. Conditions for a point $(u_0, v_0)$ to be stable are known as     $ f_u + g_v < 0\\    f_ug_v - f_vg_u > 0 $  These conditions can be expanded to cases of three and more factors.
2. Turing Pattern
For Turing Pattern, such points are required that satisfy the conditions of…
・stable when dilution isn’t taken into account
・not stable when dilution is taken into account
When you consider dilution, the equations change into     $ \frac{du}{dt} = f(u, v) + D_u{\nabla}^2u, f(u_0, v_0) = 0\\    \frac{dv}{dt} = g(u, v) + D_v{\nabla}^2v, g(u_0, v_0) = 0 $   these conditions can be changed into   $ \frac{du_s}{dt} = f_uu_s + f_vv_s + D_u{\nabla}^2u_s\\    \frac{dv_s}{dt} = g_uu_s + g_vv_s + D_v{\nabla}^2v_s $   In the same way as 1.Stability, given u,v are proportional to $e^{ikx}$, it can be deduced that  $ \frac{du_s}{dt} = (f_u - D_uk^2)u_s + f_vv_s\\    \frac{dv_s}{dt} = g_uu_s + (g_v - D_vk^2)v_s $   that is    \begin{eqnarray}   \left(   \begin{array}{cc}    \frac{du_s}{dt}\\   \frac{dv_s}{dt}   \end{array}   \right)    =    \left(   \begin{array}{cc}    {f_u - D_uk^2} & {f_v}\\    {g_u} & {g_v - D_vk^2}     \end{array}     \right)     \left(     \begin{array}{cc}     {u_s}\\    {v_s}     \end{array}     \right)    \end{eqnarray}

Techno-Edge
Techno-Edge was the event which the department of technology of university of Tokyo held. The purpose of this event was to appeal department of technology to junior high or high school students. Many laboratories and academic circles such as Robotech took part in this event. iGEM UT-Tokyo also participated in it to appeal synthetic biology.
Not only high school and junior high, but also primary school students came to our booth and were interested in our explanation.

Presentation
We participated in the annual meeting of the genetics society of Japan at the invitation of iGEM Nagahama team. We made an oral presentation in the workshop of synthetic biology and took part in poster session. There were many iGEM teams, and we could introduce iGEM in Japanese academic society.
Moreover, specialists gave advice to us, and we were inspired by professors of synthetic biology.
We also joined in Japanese Society for Cell Synthesis Research.

Collaborations
We collaborated on modeling with Nagahama.
Their project aimed cadmium collection using Escherichia coli which has positive chemotaxis for aspartic acid, then we constructed simplified model of chemotaxis       and simulated behavior of E. coli by using probability and random function.
Their wiki explained the result of modeling.(→<a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:Nagahama_project#Modeling "" >link</a>) We constructed equations in their simulation including the equation that determines E. coli to choose going straight or turning in probability, and explained equations to them.The figure describing the result of simulation is made by UT-Tokyo. All code for modeling is here.(→<a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Counter/Project/Humanpractice/nagahama.c?action=raw "">link</a>)

Outreach
Initiatives
Documentary
In order to educate younger students we contributed in a documentary dealing with biomimic. About how the nature build and how we can apply that in building synthetic nature from biobricks. Inspiring examples.   This supports the wish to cover different way of learning.  Inspiration. Put it into another context.
Life Science and Beyond
In order to inspire younger university students and spread the word about iGEM we participated in a conference dealing with different initiatives for students interested in expanding their studies to exceed the ordinary study programme. Many students showed  interested in iGEM. Tell about what synthetic biology implies.
Biobrick Workshop
Knowledge sharing is an essential part of the development of project.  We arranged a workshop for the other iGEM teams.
The DTU iGEM team 2014 decided to repeat the success of the BioBrick workshop hosted by the DTU iGEM team of 2013. The BioBrick workshop is a gathering of the iGEM teams of Denmark (KU, SDU and DTU) for a social learning experience about the core of iGEM and genetical engineering.
The BioBrick workshop was hosted over a weekend at DTU where the teams received lectures about; Primer design for USER-cloning, the online tool PHUSER that can be used for designing primers, the core of iGEM, how to receive medals and Wiki design and editing in iGEM. The teams were also introduced to several need to know laboratory procedures; PCR, Gel electrophoresis, Purification of DNA from agarose gels and USER-cloning.
The overall idea was to give the teams a solid introduction to the iGEM competition, the wiki and a basic hands-on experience with essential laboratory techniques when working with engineering of biological systems.
Another important purpose was to generate team"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

Moreover, laboratories are governed by special panels who also decide on ethically ambiguous issues. The DIYbio community will lack the means to enforce ethics-consciousness across the board.
Proposition’s views
The ""proposition"", the supporters of DIYbio within the team, feel that restricting DIYbio, or banning it alone, does not solve the issue at hand. If we must be cautious, we must at least wake up to the fact that DIYbio is already here and deal with it. If we can be a bit more supportive, then we can identify DIYbio's strengths, and recognise its potential to be the next big thing.
The proposition is definitely aware of safety and security risks involved, but avoiding the issue is not the solution. We would like to suggest a slightly different approach. If we can argue that being IT-savvy helps people become more secure online, then by similar argument, being bio-savvy will actually make people safer as well. Via communities like DIYbio, biological knowledge can reach the masses. The community can work towards inculcating good safety practices and a strong sense of ethics & responsibility among those interested. As they learn biological techniques, they will also come across the need for such measures, thus increasing their bio-savviness.
So, the new generation of DIYbiologists & DIYbio-aware/tolerant public will actually be more informed, and more equipped, to deal with biological accidents than an un-initiated individual.
Recommendations
Moving forward, DIYbio can become a sustainable and interesting community. From what we have gathered from our research, our survey and our debate, the following are the top issues that must be addressed to ensure the success of DIYbio.
Publicity & Outreach
Accountability & Transparency
Safety, security & ethics
Publicity & Outreach
DIYbio must get the good word out about their work and their goals. Doing so will serve the dual role of attracting interested parties as well raising awareness among the general public. Once the masses are familiar with DIYbio, then the initial shock and resistance against home experimentation will be more manageable. The DIYbio official website tries to catalog a comprehensive list of any and all press articles that have covered them here .
It's great that DIYbiologists are working on finding cheaper alternatives to make it a more inclusive hobby. DIYbio can also work on introducing a sense of direction and purpose into the community. This can be done by organising competitions, having themed discussions, or in general, organizing inclusive activities for the community. We believe that such"

Besides our team members, to what extent were the supervisors part of our idea? After consulting other iGEM teams, we decided that the patent should be shared with the supervisors. For the novelty of our project, it was important that the to be patented subject was not published already. We encountered problems with our own disclosure here due to our outreach and education activities. The most difficult part of a patent is the inventivity. Since we combine several methods of degrading cellulose together, this was an important option for patenting. Subsequently, we also had to think about the financial aspects of the patent. Would companies pay to use our technology? We discussed this factor with several investors and several companies that are highly interested in our product.

“……In this month they introduce to me what is the IGEM, the competition process, award-wining requirement and so on. In the meantime, they answer my question seriously, and teach me with full patience…… When I came back to my university, I will report what I have learned. I will continue to study synthetic biology knowledge. At the same time, I will try my best to build an IGEM team belonging to our school. In here, I enriched myself every day. Though very tired, but I am satisfied and happy. Not only do I gain the knowledge but also I make a lot of good friends. Thanks for the IGEMers of Tianjin University. Thank you for your help.……”

Meet Ups
Univeristät des Saarlandes, Germany
This April，we got a stunning chance to have an international communication right inside our school. A 15-people visiting group from Univeristät des Saarlandes, Germany which include 13 undergraduate students major in Chemistry and biology and 2 professors paid a visit to our School of Chemical Engineering. One of the professor in this group is the alumni of our school. He contacted our team and told us though he was surprise, his German group members indeed pointed in particular that they wanted to have a conversation with our iGEM team. We smiled and explained it was easy to understand because iGEM was also popular in Germany, let alone they were in Chemistry and biology major. Thus, we had a whole afternoon communication with them. We presented our project in 2012 and 2013 at first. Then we both shared about how to brainstorm new ideas and some fun we met in the lab. Finally, they introduce us about the medical field, which we were not very familiar but was very common in Germany iGEM project"
Tsinghua-E,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," Tianhui MA, a senior-to-be student majored in chemical engineering while minored in economy. Joining our iGEM team has been one of the most correct choices I have made in college since from here I’ve got the real feeling of being a part of a team and the understanding of the concept of cooperation as well as competition. As a novice, the primary part I am in charge with is the designing and actualizing of our wiki. Sharing ideas with my coworkers is like watching a firework show --- the infinite sparkles of innovations.
I am Beiduo RAO majored in chemical engineering and I am supposed to have my last year in Tsinghua University as an undergraduate students. I applied for this iGEM in an attempt to broaden knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry to which I have a plan to devote in the future. I always enjoy the happy time in the lab doing experiments. It makes me feel proud of myself, especially in terms of operational ability, and figure out a new definition of myself in the harmony of this team.
Hi! I’m Hao SUN and I am going to be a sophomore once more time in the coming new semester. Please hang on a second if you were considering me as a bad student with poor grades. Things became both complicated and simple after I joined our iGEM team. Though majored in ChemE, I am the leader of the programming part. As confused as I’ve got with the larger and larger gap between my status quo --- a student majored in chemical engineering --- and my real talent and interest --- computer and programming, my dream hiding in the bottom of my heart is becoming clearer and clearer and finally up to the surface. I changed my major to computer science and thanks to iGEM, I find me the true self this time.
Hi, I’m Hewei TANG a senior student majored in Chemical Engineering. I enjoy the whole procedure of taking part in this awesome IGEM team and working with my fellow teammates. Taking in charge of Human Practice, I find a brand new perspective to appreciate synthetic biology and what it can do for our life. I hope that synthetic biology can be a widely accepted concept one day and that everybody can know how it will make a difference.
Hi, here is Han WANG, a junior student majored in chemical engineering. Tasks in our iGEM team are strenuous and at the same time challenging and enjoyable. As a sophomore last year, I had not tried doing a research, and was entirely confused with the sophisticated equipments in our lab at first. It is really fascinating to take"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#safety_-_-_TEXT.html," it is environmentally toxic at higher doses. Not being biodegradable, it spreads through rain water in soils and in river waters. It accumulates on the soils and vineyards are polluted. Its spread is facilitated by water and wind erosion. This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it’s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.
This compound also modifies the biosphere since it is toxic for worms and microorganisms living in vineyard soils. Furthermore, copper sulfate does not distinguish harmful and beneficial fungi. It disrupts, for example, the development of mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with the plant’s root to help the access to nutrients from the soil to the vegetal. The microfungi that decompose the material to fertilize the soil are also in danger.
These effects are poorly seen on an area not exceeding the current authorized limit in organic farming (4 kg of copper per hectare per year, according to AFSSA (French Agency for Food Safety)). However, in terms of conventional agriculture, there is no limit for this substance. The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn’t sufficient:  copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished. It is therefore necessary to take more drastic measures by reducing the use of this substance.
For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses. It is found in insects, fish, mammals and all herbivores, carnivores or omnivores. However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms. We must not underestimate the long-term effects of chronic copper use.
Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water. Living near the wine places, like winemakers, are the most exposed.
Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, in excess in patients, is a peptide which is mainly aggregates (plaques) characteristics of the disease, and is present in soluble form in healthy patients.
In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal amounts. It can protect neurons against oxidation. However, several studies have shown that copper plays a key role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. It is also"

Dr. Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio
I am an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. I have been involved with teaching/mentoring in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since 2003, primarily to develop and deliver the Honours Cell & Molecular Biology course, a core requirement in the curriculum. I have taught every offering of that course and received numerous accolades from the Faculty and the students, most recently winning the Teaching Excellence Award for 2010-2011 from the University of Calgary Students Union. This is my second year as an iGEM Instructor and my interest in the program springs from my belief in the value of inquiry as a means to getting students engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and developing habits of becoming lifelong learners.
David Lloyd
This is my fourth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate and now as a team advisor for Calgary for the second year. I am in the process of completing my MSc in Biochemistry and have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology. In the future, I hope to merge my passions for Biochemistry, Cell Biology, and Synthetic Biology into an exciting career, opening up a biotechnology company around biological solutions to everyday problems. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!
Dylan Silver
Dylan is a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Plant Biochemistry studying starch metabolism. First-time member of iGEM, he joined the 2012 University of Calgary team as a Senior Advisor after learning about the intriguing and challenging project focused on the remediation of oil sand tailings ponds. His extensive knowledge in molecular biology and enzymology provides assistance to students with their experimental design and troubleshooting. Dylan is thrilled to be part of the iGEM team – an enriching community that offers valuable experience for future endeavors in research and development in synthetic biology.

I am in my fourth year of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program in the Southern Alberta Cancer Biology Research Group at the University of Calgary. The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the second year that I have worked with iGEM and it is has been a great experience for me.

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#project#fungal sensing_-_-_TEXT.html,"_K914003) in order to test the resistance levels. Since all of the clusters contain multiple illegal PstI sites, it was decided to insert the cluster directly in the SpeI site of the biobrick suffix.
PP1263-5 from P. putida could be isolated from the wild type strain used at our own facilities. The original strains referred to in the research papers for the other three organisms were not available. Therefore homologues genes, with high levels of sequence identity (>98%) were identified and obtained from microbial collections.
Results
All clusters but FuaABC were successfully isolated by PCR but cloning proved to be more difficult. Initial attempts to ligate the cluster behind BBa_J04500 in psb1C3 and transform it into E. Coli yielded no results. Although colony PCR showed a positive colony in some cases of the FDT cluster, plasmids isolated from these colonies were not of the right size to contain the inserts. Sequencing one of these plasmids with the VR and VF2 primers showed insertion of a small fragment containing the end and start of the primer used to PCR the cluster and a small palindromic sequence of 8bp. (ATCGATGCTA)
Membrane proteins can potentially be toxic when expressed at a too high rate. Therefore the construct was inserted in to a low copy number backbone (pSB3K3 / pSB4K5). Additionally the three genes of the smallest cluster (FDT-123) were separately expressed to see if one of them was the cause of the possible toxicity.
Successful transformants were obtained in pSB4K5 for the whole FDT cluster, FDT-2 and FDT-3 under a pLac promoter. Once again the whole FDT cluster showed up successful on colony PCR, but failed to show the expected results when a restriction digest was done on isolated plasmids. Sequencing showed again inclusion of both the primers and a small palindromic sequence (TAGCATCGAT/ATCGATGCTA).
Given that both FDT-2 and FDT-3 were successfully cloned but the whole cluster or FDT-1 separately did not yield any results,  FDT-1 , which has homologues proteins in all 3 clusters is the most likely cause for toxicity.
Future Work
Expression of the complete cluster has not yet been achieved. More research is required to understand the function of the different parts of the resistance cluster. Ideally functionality could be proven using a FA sensitive knockout strain of P. putida itself with which could be restored"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 7_-_-_TEXT.html,". With our lack of functioning competent cells looks like it's not going to happen until earliest next week.
We also began thinking about what we're going to show at the meet up in a week. We've been invited down to the Google               campus in London by the UEA team to discuss (and more importantly, present) our projects. Paul and Emmy therefore began creating a poster for it, and Oli and Tom began talking about how to order our presentation.
Thursday
Well, some of the plates seem to have colonies. They are rather small though, so we will probably wait another day or so before we start doing anything with them.
We got started on making more chemically competent cells, for use in conjunction with the electrocompetent cells. Hopefully if one fails, the other will work. Naturally, this involved the transfer of various clear liquids into other clear liquids, as well as the production of clear liquids. Such is the life of a bacterial consommé chef.
Tom attempted the colony PCR for the third time with some changes in the PCR programme. Still no luck... After some research, we decided that it is probably a better idea to miniprep the plasmid out of the cells, since colony PCR seems somewhat unreliable. Tom has began preparing some overnight cultures of the E. coli.
More biobricks, as well, as Charlie both plated out and ordered some more. With luck these will be easier to use than the magnesium sensitive promoter.
Friday
There is even more growth on the plates today. Unfortunately it looks like most of what has grown is some sort of fungus in the agar. Nice halos surrounding dense black cores are a testament to our failure at aseptic technique.
It also looks like our ampicillin has been degraded due to incorrect storage, so we made up a fresh batch and stored it. This may explain the observation that we have many small colonies of e.coli growing where they should not. Hope still remains, however, that the large colonies are still representative of successful transformants that can be used by us. We're culturing them up, though we don't imagine they will be usable.
Paul made up some chemically competent cells as well, which can be used in conjunction with our electrically transformable cells. We made two batches (due to miscalculations in the number of autoclaved eppendorf tubes we would need), one of them ended up going through an extra freeze-thaw cycle. He has transformed the first batch with pUC19, so if all works out we should be able to see growth on agar plates tomorrow. Then"

To give an overview to the university which GMO we are currently working on there are lists, where every new GMO has to be listed. Those lists are also sent to the responsible institution in Brandenburg, GER. They also had an eye on what we were actually doing.
Lab Safety
The best preparations and precautions can never replace paying attention to safety while working. These rules apply to everyone working in a lab of the university of Potsdam.
• Do not eat/drink inside the lab.
• Do not use make up.
• Do not pipette by mouth.
• Wear a lab coat, long pants and closed shoes.
• Keep chairs, bags, cartons etc. out of the evacuation routes.
• Keep windows and doors closed.
• Do not leave potentially dangerous reactions unattended.
• Stay with the used electronic device until it has reached its final speed, temperature, etc.
• Use nitrile gloves, heat or frost protection gloves when needed.
• Do not touch anything with nitrile gloves if not labelled differently.
In order to prevent us from being alone if a problematic situation occurs we were not allowed to be the only workers in the building. This also counted for late shifts and weekends. Among us we had the arrangement to never let anyone be on his own in the lab, especially when we did not share our lab with others anymore.
Our contacts gave us extra instructions for specific devices (e.g. gel electrophoresis with EtBr, gel extraction on UV light). The EtBr especially, that was used to tag our DNA in the gel, had to be handled with care since it is suspected to be a mutagen. It was only allowed to be treated in delimited areas, with labelled equipment and, of course, with gloves. Electronic devices were never to be touched with gloves.
Laptops and phones were mostly kept out of the lab. For seminars and planning we used seminar rooms that are not included in the S1 area. Lab coats had to be left in the S1 area and were only allowed to be taken out after autoclaving. We are quite a large group. Therefore, communication is everything. Keeping everyone up to date made sure no one got confused with chemicals or organisms.
Big thanks to everyone who supported us! You helped us getting our project done safely.

We continued working on our plasmid map today. There are seven genes that we are cloning into E. coli to allow it to sense and respond to the V. cholerae quorum sensing system. Those genes are:
BamHI site: LuxPQ operon with med promoter
BamHI/PstI site: HapR with own promoter
EcoRI/PstI site: GFP with HapR promoter (forward direction)
XhoI/EcoRI RFP with Qrr4 promoter (reverse direction)
HIndIII/XhoI: Qrr4 with own promoter (reverse direction)
HindIII/SacI: LuxU/O with med promoter (forward direction)
SacI/XbaI: CqsS with med promoter (forward direction)
Because of interference with the restriction sites, the cloning sequence needs to be: 2,5,3,6,4,7,1
The map of the final construct will be: (CP = constitutive promoter, hapRp = hapR responsive promoter, Qrr4Rp = Qrr4 responsive promoter) CP-LUXPQ; hapRp-HapR; hapRp-GFP-term; Qrr4Rp-RFP-term; Qrr4Rp-Qrr4; CP-LuxO/U; CP-CqsS
Associating GFP and RFP to the hapR and Qrr4 promoters respectively, will allow us to easily test whether our construct is working correctly. When placed in a high-cell density (HCD) solution of V. cholerae, the hapR linked GFP will become activated in our E. coli. Similarly, in low-cell density solutions of V. chol"

Simultaneously we were writing an application to the institutional review boards to gain ethical consent for a clinical study. We received ethical consent from both boards. To our knowledge we are the first iGEM team to write a full (40 pages) application for ethical approval of a clinical study. Throughout this study we will accompany social workers, that provide tapeworm-chemoprophylaxis to villages and ask people receiving chemoprophylaxis (as part of a preventive program supported by the Indian Ministry of Health), for a stool sample. The stool sample will be analyzed by Dr. Mishra using light microscopy as the golden standard for diagnosis of T. solium.
With the remaining sample we will examine how will our test and other novel tests for rapid diagnosis of T. solium are working in an Indian diagnostic laboratory. In addition to collecting more molecular data on T. solium and validating our test, this study will also allow us to add data to the epidemiology of the disease in India: Once completed it will be the third largest clinical study examining the prevalence of T. solium in India.
NTD Lab
Our Approach to NTDs
The aim of our project, facilitating diagnosis of T. solium infection, is a topic set within the field of synthetic biology, but with connections to many other domains. The targeted infection is listed as one of the 20 communicable diseases that are mostly affecting poor populations – a neglected tropical disease (NTDs). Stopping the spread of such diseases is thus not only a matter of medical progress, but also of an improved education, higher hygiene and sanitation standards as well as of more equitable communities. This also means that the challenge of NTDs is not only taken on by biologists and physicians! Politicians, health workers and NGOs as well as the private sector have for a long time made efforts to eliminate these diseases. With the NTD lab, our team aimed to bring all these players together to discuss how innovation in the field of these poverty-associated diseases could look like.
On the 17th of May 2017, we thus invited more than 100 participants to the premises of the Humboldt Graduate School. The event was split into two main parts: in an interactive “project fair”, our team presented its work to the participants next to projects of NGOs such as the Christoffel Blindenmission (CBM) or of other scientific institutes such as HTW Berlin.

Performed a double dialysis
100g of PEG (10k MW) in 900 mL of water
loaded 10 mL of 3.7% w/v silk into dialysis cassette
note: when loading the silk, I accidentally applied too much shear stress -- I tried to inject while the needle still wasn't fully inside the cassette. When the needle did penetrate, the silk solution then bursted out. I didn't observe any particulates in the cassette, but it is possible that some small volume of the silk already sheared into beta sheets.

A single square is composed of four pixels: one filtered red, one for blue and two for green, making colorful digital imaging possible.
To be brief, the creation of CCD sensor directly guided the design of digital camera so that users could store, edit and delete pictures as they wish, which opens a brand new world for photographing and design.
Biological Photography
Black-White Photography
Can you imagine? Engineering Escherichia coli is able to see light! The work was published in Nature in 2005. Scientists constructed a circuit allowing E. coli to sense light and export chemicals that make the medium black. Thus, we will see the lawn of bacteria to function as a biological film with high-definition( about 100 megapixels per square inch). The light receptor Cph8 is a chimaera containing the photoreceptor from Cph1(green) and the histidine kinase and response-regulator from EnvZ-ompR(orange). With an adding circuit which is able to convert them into phycocyanobilin(PCB), another part of the photoreceptor, red light drives the light sensor to a state in which autophosphorylation is inhibited and darkness leads to the expression of LacZ. LacZ catalyses the formation of a stable, insoluble, black precipitate from S-gal.
Fig.6
However, are bacteria able to see the light and produce a colorful picture with high-definition? we human need color. We would be miserable when seeing the beautiful world withour light, so do bacteria. Consequently, this year what we are attempting to do is to let bacteria feel colorful lights and make a colorful world for us and for them:)

Overview
Models
Simulations
Background
This module is concerned with killing the E. coli bacteria after successful drug protein production and encapsulation. Killing will be activated by an increase in temperatures from 28°C to 42°C.
Model for cell death
Based on the genetic circuit , we know that
The lambda cI promoter is repressed by the protein cI that is produced constitutively under the strong promoter J23114.
At 28°C, functional protein cI will bind to the lambda cI promoter to repress it. Restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI will not be produced.
When there is an increase in temperature (from 28°C to 42°C
[1 ]
[2 ]
), there will be a de-repression of lambda cI promoter, causing restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI to be produced.
Our goals
We aim to:
Explore how temperature correlates to restriction enzyme concentration, and see how it affects the population of live cells, so as to characterise the effects of temperature on cell death.
Develop a model of the number of dead cells as this correlates to our live and dead cells assay. (hyperlink to assay). From this, we can monitor the rate of killing and perform data analysis to obtain the necessary parameters.
In summary, our model will allow us to characterise the effects of temperature on the parallel production of restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI, that are required to kill E. coli. We can also characterise the extent Dam methylase can protect E. coli against cell death. (not yet done)

Additionally, we developed a sgRNA model which identified the optimal exon-exon target site by searching for the least sgRNA’s required to cover all possible variation of the target sites due to synonymous mutations of EPO coding sequence. A sgRNA array of the resulting 12 sgRNAs can be used in a single library preparation, utilizing the multiplexing capability of dxCas9 ( Cong et al., 2013 ). As a result, we could simultaneously test for the gene doping variants, improving the efficiency of our method.
Figure 5. Targeted integration by our fusion protein. The sgRNA loaded dxCas9 binds to the target DNA via complementary matching. The transposase integrates sequencing adapters next to the target site.
Further, we implemented multiplexing with barcodes to improve method efficiency, reduce cost, and expand the throughput. We created a barcoding webtool to generate unique barcodes, which are integrated into the adapter sequences that are ligated to the target sequence. This  allows us to sequence samples from multiple different athletes in the same run and trace the output sequence back to corresponding barcode ( Bayliss et al., 2017 ).
4. Targeted sequencing
After library preparation, we sequence the samples using a MinION, portable real-time sequencing device, from ONT. Only targeted sequences with adapters are translocated through the pores of ONT’s via the nanopore motor protein. The remaining untagged DNA will not be sequenced. By making a simple enzyme substitution, we transformed ONT’s established next generation sequencing platform into a targeted next generation sequencing platform .

We processed the data obtained from ONT MinION sequencing runs with our tailor-made data analysis software tool . The software consists of an algorithm that aligns all the files generated by our sequencing run sequences with our pre-existing database, containing expected gene doping sequences. Based on the alignment score, the sequences are classified into gene doping DNA or non-gene doping DNA, eliminating any false positives that might have been sequenced. The software strengthens the robustness and reliability of our method, allowing us to determine whether gene doping DNA was present in the athlete’s blood sample. To go a step further, our algorithm has the capacity of expanding the database as it detects new gene doping sequences, thereby simultaneously evolving with gene"

BioBricks origin and amplification in pGEM T-Easy.
Parts origin;
-Based on the team’s 2014 construction, known as essential Biobrick (BBa_K1355004), the sequences of RBS+MerR+Terminator (MerR) and RBS+MerT+RBS+MerP (MerTP) were amplified by PCR and then purified.
The purified amplicons were bound and transformed in the cloning plasmidial vector, pGEM T easy, to obtain essential restriction sites in further Operon Mer construction and cloning processes.
After being transformed, some clones were selected and went through colony PCR to confirm the bound insert. Then, clones were inoculated and its plasmids extracted with a Kit to subsequent digestion by using only Eco RI (knowing that there were two restriction sites for Eco RI upstream and downstream to the cloned sequence, and the confirm the insert.
MerR amplification in pGEM T easy;
For the digestion test, were expected two bands at the electrophoresis gel: the first of approximately 3015 base pairs(for pGEM T easy) and other from cloned inserted of about 534 base pairs, representing Mer R band.
MerTP amplification in pGEM T easy;
For the digestion test, was expected two bands at the electrophoresis gel: the first of approximately 3015 base pairs(for pGEM T easy) and other from cloned inserted, about 674 base pairs, representing MerTP band.

For this construction, we utilized a part from last year containing RBS+MerA+Terminator B0015 (MerA) and another specially synthesized for this construction, RBS+MerB.
The parts were transformed by electroporation, and its clones were selected for later cloned plasmid extraction.
As soon as the plasmids were confirmed through electrophoresis, a digestion test was performed with EcoRI and PstI, prove inserted clones.
For the MerA digestion, the expectation was of two bands: one from MerA insert and the other from plasmidial vector pBSK, with the insert length of approximately 1823 base pairs and the vector"
BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#EthicsAndSafety_-_-_TEXT.html," project.
First, we met with Prof. Ute Deichmann, an expert in History and Philosophy of Science. Prof.  Deichmann gave us an initial                                 overview of bioethical issues in research. We learned that ethics issues are reviewed and examined as soon as a new                                  scientific method or technology is being developed and becoming useful for different applications. Furthermore, ethic                                  issues might arise during the research process. For instance,  researchers confronts ethical questions regarding integrity,                                 objectivity and authenticity during the research process. Therefore, researchers should ask  themselves what the motivation                                 that fuels my research is. The researcher's desire for knowledge and achievements should not overcome the obligation for                                  ethical values such as dignity, integrity and candor. Thus, we learned that ethical issues need to be considered in many                                  aspects.
Second, we learned that our designed product is encountered with a relativity new term called genetically modified organism                                  (GMO). GMO is an organism whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques. GMO became wildly                                  used to produce genetically modified crops, medications, medical devices and nano-technology. Furthermore, GMOs is widely                                  used in many aspects of scientific research.
We also learned that there are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, when a marked difference can be                                  found between the United states that favor for GMO products while Europe union is basically against.
Third, we asked ourselves what is the potentially harmful consequences that may emerge when implementing new technology.                                 Does a genetically modified organism can have a negatively effects on the environment or on human being? Such concerns                                  are also considered a biosafety matter as creating a GMO is accompanied with lots of uncertainties regarding its future                                 effects on the environment. Apart from biosafety, synthetic biology raises also biosecurity concerns, as products of                                  synthetic biology could potentially be used for malicious intentions.
The regulation of bioethical issue in Israel
In recent years, effective biosafety laws and regulations have been adapted by several countries to prevent terrorists and                                  other hostile powers from obtaining dangerous biological agents, technologies, or information that would allow them to                                  develop and manufacture biological weapons.
In 2008, the Israeli parliament (""Kenesset"") decided to tighten biosecurity measures and legislated the regulation of research into biological disease agents law, which provides a legislative framework to conduct research involved biological                                  disease agents. The law calls for the establishment of a council to regulate and monitor research on select infectious                                  disease agents. It also prescribes institutional committees with defined responsibilities and identifies means of control,                                 including penalties and liabilities.

Introduction
Welcome to our wiki! We are the University of Southern Denmark's iGEM team and we have been waiting in great anticipation for the chance to tell you our story.
Our adventure began with a meeting between strangers from eight different studies. Despite our different backgrounds, we had one thing in common; a shared interest in synthetic biology. Soon after this first meeting, we were herded off to a weekend in a cottage - far away from our regular lives. The cottage was a place to bond and discuss project ideas. It immediately became apparent that being an interdisciplinary team was going to be our strength as each member had unique qualities that enabled them to efficiently tackle different aspects of the iGEM competition. So, we made it our goal to take advantage of these qualities.
We decided to make a proof-of-concept project. Specifically, we wanted to use bacteria as a novel and greener solution for solar energy storage. This project was later dubbed the PowerLeaf – A Bacterial Solar Battery.
Since it is a one-page wiki, you can just keep on scrolling, and you will be taken on a journey through our iGEM experience.
Achievements
At the Giant Jamboree 2017 we succeeded in getting a Gold Medal and were nominated 'Best Energy Project'.
Bronze Medal Requirements
Register and Attend – Our team applied on the 30th of March 2017 and got accepted the 4th of May 2017. We had an amazing summer and are looking forward to attending the Giant Jamboree!
Meet all the Deliverables Requirements –  You are reading the team wiki now, so that is one cat in the bag. You can find all attributions made to the project in the Credits section of the wiki. The team poster and team presentation are ready to be presented at the Giant Jamboree. We also filled the safety form , the judging form and all our parts were registered and submitted.
Clearly State the Attributions – All attributions made to our project have been clearly credited in the Credits section .
Improve and/or Characterise an Existing Biobrick Part or Device – The characterisation of the OmpR-regulated promoter BBa_R0082 was improved, as the level of noise was studied on different vectors.
Induction and inhibition of the pBAD promoter, BBa_I0500 , were studied, whereby the characterisation of this part was improved.
Furthermore, we characterized if the periplasmic beta-glucosidase could make E. coli live on cellobiose in fluid medium BBa_K523014 , submitted by the "
ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Modeling#Construct1_-_-_TEXT.html,"-error inspection of the correct promoter. From a informatics-heuristical point of view, we suggest working in a binary-logarithmic ""divide-and-conquer"" fashion, always choosing a new candidate promoter that is between 2 promoters having expressions levels too low and too high.
Outlook
For the constraints here we have optimised the parameters by hand using some intuition. In line with the general trend of computational optimisation of biological systems, we aim to optimise the dynamic range by mathematical optimisation of certain free parameters (such as the promoter strengths). This procedure is non-trivial and rather demanding, involving non-linear optimisation. This could increase the dynamic range further.

Parameters & kinetics
Biochemical Reactions | Defining the Initial State of the Model
The complete model uses 18 kinetic parameters and 11 biochemical  reactions. We got 13 of these parameters researching the literature and we estimated the range of values for 2 of them. The remaining 3 we adjusted to the observed results. Reaction kinetics were gotten from the literature,  and if no evidence was found then we assumed it to be Law of Mass Action.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"oints of the Interview
“Envirobot” had the aim to develop an eel-like robot with built-in biosensors that can either go on predefined missions or autonomously react to molecule concentrations in water.
The project was carried out over 4 years with more than 10 collaborators from 5 different research institutes in Switzerland. The material value of the final robot was about 10.000 USD.
When building the robot, main obstacles were the robustness and speed of conventional biosensors.
Due to legal regulations and missing contamination in swiss lakes, the robot could not be tested in the field and was therefore trained with modeling data or collected samples.
In general, biosensors outcompete electronic sensors regarding the number of detectable molecules, thus enabling their use for environmental monitoring.
Consulting Experts
From the idea, over the design to the execution of our project, we consulted experts and were able to benefit from the knowledge in their respective research areas.

Prof. Petra Dittrich ETH Zurich Biosystems Science and Engineering Petra Dittrich is Associate Professor for Bioanalytics at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering since 2014. Her research in the field of lab-on-chip-technologies focuses on the miniaturization of high-sensitivity                     devices for chemical and biological analyses, and microfluidic-aided organization of materials.
Integrated
Renaud Dubè PhD at Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) at ETH Zurich Renaud helped us in finding a suitable robotic platform for our project. He especially informed us about the most commonly used robotic platforms which were very important to us as they served as a reference when we decided to go                     for our own design.
Sensing
Integrated
Prof. Sarah Maddocks Cardiff Metropolitan University In a publication from 2008 (Maddocks and Oyston), Sarah reviewed the structure and function of LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) family proteins. Since they are the largest family of prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins, we                     wanted to know whether our idea of visualizing transcription factor binding to DNA could be realized with them. LTTRs bind constitutively to DNA and activate transcription by changing the DNA bending. We discussed possible                     options of visualizing this DNA bending but Sarah recommended not to use them for our project but rather look for a system where DNA binding is induced by a signal molecule, which we found in the EnvZ/OmpR system.

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," part of National Engineering Month, the University of Ottawa organized the Engineering Family Fair Day. Multiple booths featured tools and activities to showcase engineering to the general public, including young kids. The uOttawa iGEM team was invited to participate and we set up a booth of our own where we displayed our children's book (Human Practices Project 2013) and guided participants through multiple activities including DNA base pair matching exercises and ""DNA bracelet"" making. We even talked to some young students about possible careers in synthetic biology and related fields.
The Ottawa International Children’s Festival
In May 2014, the uOttawa iGEM Team ran educational science activities at the International Children's Festival in Ottawa. Children of various ages visited our table to read Mr. Cool's Microscopic Adventures and make bracelets spelling their names based on a DNA/amino acid code! Throughout the day, we were able to disseminate fundamental biological concepts such as mitosis, meiosis and amino acid code to the students. The students were extremely receptive to the novel ideas that the activities offered. Both parents and students found the activities to be unique and creative, which made the science not only detailed but fun as well.
The Mayfair Community Carnival
Every year, Farley Mowat Public School in Ottawa hosts the Mayfair carnival and invites families from across Ottawa to take part. Over the years, the Mayfair has grown from a small school fundraiser to a community-wide, must-attend event. This year, the uOttawa iGEM Team was there to run activities for kids and talk to the families about iGEM and synthetic biology. We prepared fact sheets about our iGEM Team and handed them out to attendees. We chatted with the parents as the kids enjoyed making DNA out of marshmallow and candy, among other activities. Our booth was a huge hit and it was so rewarding to see the looks of awe on the kids' faces as they twisted the DNA double helix they had just constructed.
We also had the pleasure of chatting with the Mayor of Ottawa, Mr. Jim Watson, who attended the carnival and visited our booth.
Enrichment Mini-Courses Program
The Enrichment Mini-Courses Program offers talented middle school and high school students from Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec the opportunity to explore a field of interest in a university setting. Each year, nearly 3000 students participate in this weeklong program and the University of Ottawa is a major participating post-secondary institution. This year, the uOttawa iGEM team did three presentations as part of EMCP courses. We did presentations in both English"

Figure 3  Output format of the EvoCS module: For every position of the protein of interest a vector of length three is produced. The first position of the vector stores the amino acid in one-letter code, the second the most frequent amino acid group and the third the proportion of gaps aligned to the residue of the target sequence
Results
As output an array is constructed containing the residue from the reference sequence, the preserved residue or residue class for all sequences, and the percentage of gaps of the MSA at this position. This gives us a list of point mutations within a preserved residue class which proved to be evolutionary important/robust in nature, and hence can be ruled out from the considered residues for mutations. Furthermore, the preferred class of amino acid may help us in choosing appropriate replacement amino acid for a residue, since amino acids with similar physico-chemical properties can more likely be replaced with each other.
MHCBoost
Motivation
MHC (Major Histocompability Complex) encodes for a group of proteins which are important for immune recognition, histocompability at transplantations and the immunological individuality. The MHC genes are divided in class I and class II. The MHC proteins in humans are encoded by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. HLA is highly polymorphic, because of numerous alleles for each gene that encodes the MHC molecules. Every allele binds to a specific set of peptides. The MHC class I molecule presents only peptides from intracellular antigens that can activate cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ cells).
Inside a cell, peptides are proteolytically cleaved by the proteasom in smaller fragments, which are subsequently transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by a Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP).  Afterwards, the peptide will be loaded on an MHC-I molecule and represented on the cell surface. This mechanism allows the adaptive immune system to determine whether or not a cell contains malicious components.
Since the LC of our botulinum toxin based shuttle protein enters the cell together with its cargo, it would also be cleaved by the proteasome and would eventually be presented on the MHC molecules. Since the botulinum toxin fragments are unknown to the human immune system, an unwanted immune response directed against the neuronal cells could be triggered. This scenario is most likely to occur"

Once our cage has been designed and purified, it will be necessary to experimentally verify that the cage properly forms and breaks when exposed to thrombin. As of now, our group plans on using dynamic light scattering and conjugation of fluorescent markers to verify these occurrences. I began investigating the inner structure of the cage to look for serine residues that could be swapped for cysteines to use in conjugation reactions. The premise of this experiment is such that the cage will properly form to sequester the inside residues from fluorescent conjugation molecules on the outside of the cage. only when exposed to thrombin will the cage break and allow access to the mutated inner residues containing cysteine, which will conjugate with fluorescent markers to allow easy visualization with a fluorescent microscope."

Possessing promoters which are active under a desired condition, at a desired strength and in a specified tissue is of great value for Plant Biotechnology, Gene Therapy and fundamental research in Bioscience. Therefore, it has become a desire to synthetically construct promoters responsive to a variety of pathways. We explore two ways to the synthesis of promoters: On one hand, we have developed a bioinformatical model and database (HEARTBEAT) describing the structure of promoters responsive to user-defined inputs. On the other hand, we have developed a biochemical method for the synthesis of randomized promoter libraries. Using this method, we have created a library of constitutive promoters of varying strength. Also, we have created libraries of promoters putatively responsive to a variety of pathways. We have screened these libraries for functional, pathway responsive promoters and present a detailed characterization of a NF-κB responsive promoter of our making. We finally discuss ways to combine randomized biochemical synthesis and bioinformatical modeling to propose a method towards the generation of promoters of complex regulation (i.e. by multiple pathways).

Collaboration – Mentoring iGEM Team UNIFI 2017
The iGEM team UNIFI is representing the University of Florence and is participating for the first time in the iGEM competition. As the only Italian team this year, they took the chance to collaborate with other iGEM teams beyond their own country borders. We met the iGEM team UNIFI at the European iGEM Meetup in Delft on 7th to 8th July and initiated the mentoring. Afterwards, we started this collaboration, with weekly skype conferences (Figure 1) in addition to intensive communication via email.
Figure 1: Skype meetings with iGEM UNIFI for a two-way collaboration.
During the mentorship we picked certain topics for every skype meeting. Those topics covered technical and practical advices concerning the wiki and important points for human practice among others. Together we discussed all the gold medal criteria and gave tips how to fulfill them. Furthermore we discussed organizational aspects of travel and stay in Boston. During one skype call our HTML programming expert Maximilian answered questions concerning HTML coding.
In return for the mentorship, iGEM UNIFI helped us characterizing two BioBricks. To make sure that Escherichia coli is able to take up the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates from the cultivation media we had to introduce a heterologous transporter. One of the BioBricks encodes a complete   nucleotide transporter PtNTT2 ( BBa_K2201004 ) originated from the algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The second BioBrick is a truncated version missing the N-terminal signal peptide ( BBa_K2201001 ). This N-terminal signal peptide leads to some kind of toxicity in E. coli. Through cultivation experiments we wanted to investigate the extent of the toxicity by comparing the growth of the strain expressing the full version of PtNTT2 to the ones expressing the truncated version.
iGEM UNIFI had the capacity to perform the same cultivation experiment we performed using a microscale bioreactor. This ensured automatic measurements for OD600 values which would decrease errors concerning µmax. This characterization from iGEM UNIFI led to a more accurate estimation of the toxicity of a full length version compared to a truncated version of PtNTT2.

In the morning, we have checked the plates and obtained some pretty colonies!
We have inoculated 4 colonies per plate to be incubated overnight at 37C
In the afternoon, we planned the assembly of our BBa_J23100-BBa_B0034-TPH1-BBa_B0015. We have digested the gBlock1 with EcoRI and gBlock2 with PstI. Then we have performed the Gibson assembly of digested gBlock 1, gBlock 2, and linearized pSB1C plasmid, followed by the transformation .

Bifidobacter
There was only one colony on our plates from the Gibson assembly! We suspect that this is because the overlap between the linearized pSB1C3 backbone and our synthetic constructs was not long enough. We plan to try the Gibson assembly of two gBlocks alone tomorrow, followed by ligation to the plasmid backbone. We will see if this works better!
We have also purified the DNA from the transformants of four promoters from Monday. Some parts from the kit were missing, so we spent 4 hours on making a miniprep! This is bad!

Northwestern,2018,Team:Northwestern#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," addition to new therapies being created to fight bacteria.
Additionally, we asked for suggestions and things to consider when molding our project. Dr. Mendelson proposed that we carry out risk analysis to evaluate the chances of our therapeutic working and weighing the risks and benefits of this delivery system. He also advised us to be specific about what genes we are trying to target while remaining cautious. “Antibiotic Resistance isn’t just because of genes. Superbugs have multiple resistance mechanisms, disabling the genes doesn’t mean it’ll surefire die.”
Takeaway: Our conversation with Dr. Mendelson helped us be more considerate with the language we use when referring to antimicrobial resistance. When talking about antibiotics, this website only uses the terms ""antibiotic resistant"" or ""drug resistant infection""; according to Dr. Mendelson, most of the population can understand these terms, a first step to combating AR worldwide. Dr. Mendelson also convinced us to carry out risk analysis for our protein delivery approach.  .
Interview with Dr. London
Dr. London is a WGN radio correspondent and currently resides in rural Maine. Dr. London practices general medicine and is active in healthcare policy. Dr.London recently made news as she devised a reusable epinephrine autoinjector to combat Epipen’s controversial price increase.
Dr. London emphasized the importance of physician-patient relationships and public health policy to lowering the rate of antibiotic overuse. Hospitals are essentially hotbeds of bacteria, more so than individual physician practices. People without insurance (due to de funding) also have the tendency to wait until things are bad before rushing to the emergency room, where carers unfamiliar with the patient prescribe antibiotics “just in case” the problem is a bacterial infection, which it's often not.  Dr. London believes our project is a clever idea, as antibiotic resistance must be attacked on all fronts with as many new ideas possible. The onus, however, lies with us to educate the public about gene editing, which often sounds like a dangerous idea to the average citizen.
Takeaway: We tried to take Dr.Londons emphasis on educating the average citizen that genetically modified does not inherently correspond to something negative. For example, while presenting to CTD students, we made an “ethical consideration slide” that balanced the pros and cons of potential genetic engineering applications. Projects such as experimental mosquito (i.e to fight Zika) or GMO foods often get a bad rep in the media, but have many positives such as disease eradication and feeding hungry populations.

b. Setup a 96-well plate with your cultures.
c. Take the measurement and record it.
Step 2: Dilute your samples to an OD600 of 0.5
a. We did not dilute samples to an OD600 of 0.5. The BioTek plate reader has an OD accuracy between 0-4, and the fluorescence values will be normalized to     OD600 value for each culture in triplicate.
Step 3: Measure your samples.
a. Set your instrument to measure GFP
b. Measure your cells.
Alternate Protocol or Additional Details:
The resulting fluorescence data from the plate reader was processed using the Imperial 2014 iGEM Team InterLab Study: https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial/InterLab_Study . Background absorbance and fluorescence     were subtracted from all samples assayed as a blanking control. The resulting absorbance values were then used to divide their respective resulting     fluorescent values to generate a fluorescence per OD unit value (FL/OD). The average FL/OD of the negative control culture with empty vector (R0040) was     subtracted from the FL/OD of the devices to remove background cell fluorescence, resulting in a FL/OD600 value. These values were then divided by the     conversion factor determined from the standard curve generated from a sodium fluorescein control assay to derived a final unit value as the equivalent     ng/mL fluorescein per OD600 unit.

It mainly distributes in Northeast region(30 million mu), Middle North region(15 million mu), Northwest region(30 million mu), Coastal area(15 million mu) and North China(10 million mu). Dr. Jiang also introduced the basic principle of transform the saline-alkali land. That means moisture comes with salinity. Sometimes they combine with each other, but in other times they separate. In spring salinity comes back to soil and in autumn moisture from rainwater will absorb the salinity from the root layer of soil and so on.
But in these procedures we’ve found some key points that the transformation to the saline-alkali land can’t be once for all in many situation. Towards some saline-alkali land with big evaporation, it’ll be salinization again once stopped dealing. At the same time, since many governance means are based on water to appeal salt nowadays, it will cost a lot of water resource when declining the salt of soil. After that, we introduced our project to Dr. Jiang. Our project is that leaving bacteria live and reproduce in soil permanently to appeal Na+ and K+ from surrounding soil so that the salinity of soil will be declined. Through our project, we can find a new method to transform saline-alkali land without water.
Dr. Jiang affirmed our thoughts. He thought this method had great prospects. Meanwhile he also pointed the soil had complex problems. So the bacteria we use and transform must be alive and keep reproducing in this environment. And biology genetic safety is also a key point. We finished talking in ease atmosphere. By communicating with Prof. Jiang, we determined our direction of research more firmly. And we will regard the suggestions Prof. Jiang gave as reference while applying our method.
The conversation with Prof. Li
3rd August 2018, our team visited Professor Ming Li from Collage of Natural Resources and Environment in Northwest A&F University.
Prof. Li is majored in algology and algal biotechnology. What aroused our curiosity and thirst of knowledge is the contribution the professor did. So we visited Prof. Li with our project.
When we talked with Prof. Li, we introduced our project. Before our meeting, our project just aimed at declining the salt of saline-alkali land by using modified bacteria. However, Prof. Li put forward the shortage of our project, going straight to the heart of the matter. Whether the modified bacteria can survive and reproduce on natural saline-alkali land is a severe problem. Because natural soil can’t provide bacteria a suitable growth environment.

If this was the only thing you knew about Hana, you’d think she’s a pretty cool person. Hana hopes to become a research scientist and a university professor studying the genetics behind endometriosis, while working as a part-time K-Pop connoisseur. In her free time, Hana likes to dance in her seat while studying while listening to hard rock, as well as conduct excessively moderate online shopping.

Summary
Silver
In order to improve our projects, we have several interviews with experts in Microbiology, Medicine and Food, to collect information about diabetes, sweeteners, advantage of D-psicose as well as market and possible commercialization of D-psicose. Additionally,we visited the elders in Xi'an Jinqiu Nursing Home, Xi’an Jiaotong University community , to collect their problems on medical treatment and daily diet, as well as to popularize our projects about healthy sugar substitutes D-psicose. In our WeChat public account, we not only introduce and promote the IGEM competition concept and our project, we also regularly post scientific articles in synthetic biology to gradually walk the public into life sciences.
Integrated & Gold
Our human practice work is integrated into different stages of the project. To learn about the possibility of D-psicose as a drug for the treatment of diabetes，We had a deep interview with Dr Guo, who is a doctor for diabetes treatment. To collect some information about the current sweetener market, and situation of sugar production, we visit companies related to sugar production. To investigate the public's perception about sweeteners and predict the future market of our products, D-psicose，we have collected over one thousand questionaires.
Public engagement
Public participation is very important given that the IGEM competition is a competition that was born to solve practical problems. We actively joined various communities to involve the public into our project. Social media like Wechat public account, Twitter, and public mailbox are constantly used to communicate with the public and other teams. We also conducted questionnaires for online and offline surveys. In addition, social practice of IGEM competition is including offering lectures on synthetic biology, visiting nursing homes, and handing out health manuals.

Friday was our trip to Stanford to meet with Cesar, Prof. Drew Endy, and some of the people working with them.  We left at 9 in the morning and drove down to Stanford, where we first had a meeting with Cesar about the big picture to agree on the pieces that were necessary to connect our two projects.  We then had a mini tour of campus while walking to lunch.  Afterward, we met with Prof. Endy and Cesar and showed them what we had of Spectacles and Eugene.  They also talked about their projects.  Later in the afternoon, we were invited to a seminar series Prof. Endy and some others were trying to start.  Finally we had dinner in downtown Palo Alto.  Unforntunately, no one brought a camera, so we don't have any pictures.
Week of July 20, 2009
This week I've been fixing things that weren't quite done or done right.  These include:
Export after rearranging parts reflects those changes
Name changes to parts propagate throughout all devices in the frame
A unique wrapper for each widget (especially for those representing nested devices)
No longer need a HashMap storing wrapped parts, parts are stored directly in _eugeneComponentDecs in Manager
Properly put parts created from thumnail scene into Manager, including creating necessary ComponentDefs and PropertyDefs
Device name can be changed
Checks are in place to prevent the user from using illegal names
Names cannot be empty
Names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
Names must begin with a letter or an underscore
All parts and devices must have unique names
Week of July 27, 2009
This week, I implemented clear workspace and fixed the parts combo box so it creates parts properly.  I also refactored names that had Component in them to have Part instead.  Then I went about setting up a project for ClothoII and downloading the code for that so I could look at how to connect to it and a database and start thinking about the implementations pane we want to put in Spectacles.
Thursday was the SynBio BBQ.  We drove up to Tilden Park in the Berkeley hills, where we filled ourselves with hot dogs and other goodies while mingling with iGEM teams from Stanford and UCSF as well as some high school students in a synthetic bio program at"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"2021. Provided there is an increasing demand for enzymes in global market, it is safe to say there is also an increasing demand for protein engineering solutions. Also, the global protein engineering market is expected to reach $3.09 billion by 2025, according to a 2017 report by Grand View Research.
Our solution
Our team is ready to take the first steps into the new era of enzyme engineering. We believe we can accelerate the creation of novel enzymes immensely by:
Using our CAT-Seq technology to immensely advance the pace of novel catalytic biomolecule by enabling the swift exploration of sequence-function space.
Applying the vast sequence-function data to our developed Reaction Generative Adversarial Networks in order to accurately predict novel enzyme activities.
We have achieved the proof of concept of our project, therefore we already have a strong starting point from which can seek further research and development improvement.
With our proposed solution we can specialize in two main areas:
1. Unique enzymatic product development for a particular company. For example, this may be a fully finished and optimized single or multiple enzyme solution. After the product development is finished, customer would receive full development process information and appropriate enzyme sequences.
2. Service-type business solution. Companies which require optimization of their currently used product synthesis route or fundamental enzyme or enzymatic pathway research would have the possibility to buy this type of service from us.
Startup Competition by Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology
In spring, Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA) in Lithuania has held a startup competition called “Searching For Innovators”. We have participated in this competition with our CAT-Seq and ReactionGAN systems. Of course, at spring our project was in design stages, yet the motivation and ideas we had on how we could solve the current problems of novel biological part creation has left the judges a huge impression.
For this reason, we have Won the “Searching for Innovators” competition! The prize was a year long support in the from of active Mentoring. MITA will now help us establish a business, consult us in the topics of business strategy, finance, marketing and other.
That said, a high-technology startup that we plan to become after the iGEM competition would most benefit from accelerating in the international startup accelerators in hubs that are focused around Life Sciences and Biotechnology, and that is what we plan to do after the iGEM!

We suspect the NP reacted and oxidized when being treated with water which would result in a much higher melting temperature.
Nanoparticles produced with ferritin can also be used in various other applications (Figure 13). As example, they can be directly used inside the ferritin cage for molecular imaging (Wang et al., 2017b). When extracted, they can be used as antibacterial agent, in particular silver nanoparticles (Wang et al., 2017a) and as biosensors (Castro et al., 2014)

Growth in the presence of Glucose only
Testing the effects of glucose concentration on cell growth: This experiment will be linked to diauxic growth.
Rationale: A cell culture in the presence of glucose grows exponentially. Once it uses up its resource, it stops growing and the population density saturates.
Raw data 06/10 Media:II09_rawdata.xls
Growth in the presence of Glucose + 2ndary carbon sources
Testing the effects of different secondary carbon sources on cell growth with a fixed initial glucose concentration. Rationale: A cell culture in the presence of glucose grows exponentially. Once it uses up its resource, it stops growing and the population density saturates. However, in the presence of a secondary carbon source, the cells enter a second exponential phase where they grow and saturate once again when the secondary source has been used up.
NOTE: Same raw data file as above!
Growth in the presence of Glucose + Xylose
Testing the effects of different xylose concentrations on cell growth, for a fixed initial glucose concentration: This experiment will be linked to diauxic growth.
Rationale: As above
CRP promoter
Review on CRP promoter results
Prelim test-Growth on glucose and xylose and effect on CRP promoter 07-10
A simple test of all xylose and all glucose to test if GFP is generated.  Found out that GFP levels are about the same and quite low for both xylose and glucose (ie both do not express)
CRP promoter and varying glucose 09-10
Growth on different media and effect on CRP promoter 10-10
Supposing that Secondary carbon sources repress the CRP promoter, we proceeded to test which media gives the best CRP output.  It appears to be 10% Casamino acid.

The retrotranscriptase (RT) is a special protein capable of retrotranscribing a RNA molecule into a DNA molecule. In the case of the EC86, it acts on a special sequence of RNA (msr-msd), a non-coding RNA. Once transcribed, the msr-msd sequence folds into a secondary structure guided by the base pairing of the inverted repeats that flank this sequence. The RT recognizes this secondary structure and uses a conserved guanosine residue in the msr as a priming site to reverse transcribe the msd sequence and produce a hybrid RNA-ssDNA molecule called msDNA (i.e., multicopy single-stranded DNA).The msDNA contains the synthetic message that would be inserted in the bacteria genome for the memory acquisition.
Wild Type Cas1 Protein: BBa_K2761001
Gene sequence for the expression of Cas1 from Escherichia coli in its wild type form. This protein is one of the two Cas proteins responsible for new DNA spacer acquisition in the bacteria's CRISPR locus (array). This action is done by a protein complex hexamere made up of 4 Cas1 dimers and 2 Cas2 dimers. It has been shown that these proteins are commonly conserved across the major types of CRISPR-Cas systems. To properly use Cas1 protein it should be expressed along with Cas2 protein and a PAM sequence found in the msDNA in the system design for spacer acquisition. The Cas1 protein gene contained in this part expresses the protein without any tag for further identification.

Overview
“Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects the work.” (Peter Carr, Director of Judging) is the comment which gives a clear definition of all Human Practices activities. Therefore, we tried to answer two questions: how can synthetic biology affect the world? And in which way can the world affect Iron Guardian? To answer the former one, we chose to collaborate with different teams and thought the issues we are working on vary from team to team, we all wish and try to utilize what we learn to solve practical problems and make the world a better one. What’s more, we integrated the social influence into our project to answer the latter question. With communication, economic benefit and responsibility as our important focus, we interviewed professors and employees in related industry, and showcased the great economic benefit of our project. By distributing questionnaire and analyzing the data acquired, we managed to explain and improve our project according to the public concerns and suggestions. The new concept of “ 3+ net ” raised by ECUST will also help all teams to create, to reflect, and to improve.

Education : To spread the main ideas of synthetic biology and stimulate young people’s interest is a significant task for Iron Guardian. Therefore, we participated in the Science Camp in ECUST and presented our project briefly. Also, the lectures and activities we organized also worked as a platform for students to know more about us.
Collaborate : This year, we collaborated with many teams and got a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. On one hand, we worked with IIT-Madras to make a short video about DNA&RNA, and designed the cartoon image for our project. On the other hand, we collaborated with two high school"

Almost all the seats were occupied by audience.Since the term of iGEM competition is almost a band new term for them, they showed great interests and talked with us enthusiastically. We gave them a plenty of suggestions according to the experience of our project and finally they claimed that they would recruit members this semester and register for a team next year.  .
2016
Engagement Ⅰ：Debate
To make the ordinary students engaged in iGEM, we team Tianjin together with Beiyang Environment-Protecting Association held a debate competition discussing ethical issues provoked by the application of synthetic biology, aiming to publicize the conception of synthetic biology and arouse attention to biotechnology. The debate began at 20 p.m., Sep.28th and lasted for an hour. The topic was whether it is safe to curb environmental pollution with artificial modified bacterium. Our team members were invited as special guests to watch this intense competition. During the interval, we gave out iGEM handbooks and souvenirs to audience. After that, we made a brief introduction of synthetic biology and our project. Generally speaking, the debate was very successful. We were delighted to collaborate with Beiyang Environment-Protecting Association. It was glad to see that everyone participating in the game were intrigued by this subject. The successful hosting of the debate epitomized our great publicity of synthetic biology.

We made the public engaged in our project this year with the method of questionnaire survey. Actually we conducted two versions of surveys this year. The former one has been clarified in part Engagement Ⅲ ：Social Media. As for the latter one, we investigated the daily use of plastic products and the attitude of people towards the bio-degradation of plastic.
The following pictures are our partial results.

Monique set up the cultures and conducted the characterization experiments and analysis under Evan's guidance.
Traci, the team adviser, oversaw the team's work and experiments throughout the summer. Specifically, she taught Shawn and Monique how to design primers and run MoClo reactions. Traci also taught them some of the protocols they used in their research and helped them troubleshoot some of their PCR and cloning problems. Traci built the B0034 inverter.
The website template is from our 2011 iGEM team's wiki page ( BU Wellesley Software ). Traci edited the css file and created the new pages for this year's wiki. It was a full team effort to fill in the various Wiki pages.
Sponsors
We'd like to thank all of our sponsors for their generous support. Without the support from the following Boston University departments and various industrial companies, we never would have been able to compete in iGEM.
Thank you very much!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#LindaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"’t leave the lab report. As we work with our eLabNotebook project at Wellesley, this made me reflect on some of the things that we need to implement to ensure that scientists can have an easier time following these moral and ethical protocols.
June 19: Starting to code!
Research is finally rolling. We realized that we don’t actually have a lot of time left to really implement a project, because not only do we need to code multiple projects, but we also need to analyze, design, implemet, and test it multiple times. With only 7 weeks left, that’s actually not a lot of time. So today, I was assigned with the back-end of this MoClo planner that we’re going to try to work on.
I know some bio, but in the end, I kept on running back and forth (literally- cause somehow we’re at separate rooms) between our bio team and our cs team, so that I didn’t break any bio/cs rules. I realized that I really do enjoy working in an interisciplinary field. The idea that each people specialize at a different topic and we all come and work together, contributing a different field of knowledge and perspective is just so cool!
June 20: Working with 4 monitors
Today, research was busy. My project for today was to make a sample parts datasheet using HTML5, CSS, Javascript.
I’ve never taken CS110 (a course on Computers and internet) and have only dealt with web coding minimally. So today, I pretty much had to learn it all and code a template that fits to what we want. It was challenging, but fun. My solid background in Java has allowed me to quickly understand how html works. But still, I had to keep on refering back to references and googling ideas to see if what other people have done. At the end of the day, I was able to get a pretty solid webpage sample of it and I’m proud of how much I had to learn today.
== June 21: Down...load...ing...==Down..load…ing…. (so much waiting…)
I’m becoming such a tech person! I had been trying to download microsoft 8 for the whole day yesterday and today and it finally got to work around noon. So now, I need to transfer what I’ve been working on in Dreamweaver to Microsoft Visual Studio Express, which to be honest, I don’t have a clue. I’ve been trying to work my way around it but i seriously would need some help. I’m definitely learning a lot, and it"

We thought that it was very important to experiment safely and wrote this policy on“iGEM 2013 basic safety form”too. Our team members think that the experiments done in dangerous way are meaningless. Therefore, we took care to protect biodiversity against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Also we really took care our project didn't have any bad effect on environment and human body.
Therefore, we received the safety guidsnce from our instructors to experiment safely at laboratories. In the guidance, we are taught that how we should write the experimental data in notebooks and how we should use  experimental devices or chemicals are in the laboratories.
Also we’ve experimented along their lab’s rules.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Cadmium_-_-_TEXT.html,", with recent studies revealing cadmium exposure has serious effects on embryonic development of grazing animals (Nandi et al. 2009).
Nephrotoxicity
In humans cadmium is nephrotoxic leading to damage to the proximal kidney tubules, which are the main site of accumulation.
Heavy metals such as cadmium have been shown to be involved in reactions that produce reactive oxygen species which leads to amplified lipid peroxidation, damage to DNA and an upset in calcium homeostasis (Manca et al., 1991; Kumar et al., 1996; El-Maraghy et al., 2001; M´endez-Armenta et al., 2003; L´opez et al., 2006).
There is evidence that cadmium serves as a competitive ion to calcium as it blocks all known calcium influx routes and also interferes with any neurotransmission initiated by calcium (Viarengo and Nicotera, 1991; Guan et al., 1988; Usai et al., 1999). However there is also evidence that cadmium ions increase the concentrations of calcium in a cell – this concentration is usually cytotoxic leading to cell death (possibly the mechanism by which cadmium kills) (Orrenius and Nicotera, 1994).
Bone demineralisation
Exposure has also been linked to bone demineralisation. Cadmium was also responsible for causing a condition termed Itai-Itai Disease initially reported in a population in Toyama, Japan (Nordberg, 2004). The condition is characterised by the weakening of the bones, resulting in pain especially in the spine and leg bone areas. Progression of disease starts off as a gradually debilitating condition whereby the patient may find walking almost impossible. From that point onwards, the additional symptoms onset rapidly – these include kidney disorders, extreme pain, and bone breakage from the slightest of disturbances (an example is coughing). The end result is death (J.W. Hamilton, 2009)
Cancer?
It has also been recently suggested that low level exposure to cadmium can increase cancer risks, and cadmium has since been classified as a human carcinogen (Jarup and Akesson. 2009).
Neurotoxicity
Cadmium also has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, even though the amounts reaching the brain are small (Pal et al., 1993). The significance of the blood-brain barrier and cadmium neurotoxicity are confirmed in rat experiments, where infant rats suffer a larger degree of cad"

This shows the process that occurs with the T7 System. We induce the Lactose inducible promoter with IPTG as it mimics the lactose and cannot be broken down by the cell. This allows it to continually perform transcription on the construct embedded in the genome of the BL21(DE3) and thusly constantly produce the T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the gene(3).This T7 RNA Polymerase binds to the T7 Promoter and starts transcription on the construct within our plasmid pSB1C3. This then creates the mRNA which will undergo translation and produce the protein encoded by the gene due to the E. coli RBS on the construct. Part BBa_I712074 .
 Ribosomal Binding Site
The RBS we have chosen for our constructs is an E. coli Ribosomal Binding Site, Part BBa_B0034
 Terminator
The terminator we have chosen for our constructs is an E. coli terminator. Part BBa_B0015 , it is a double terminator made up of one BBa_B0012 terminator and a BBa_B0010 terminator."
Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Notebook#CL 2014 7 18_-_-_TEXT.html," playing around with the Marchantia genome data with Gos:
what Bernardo et al have done before: predicted open reading frames with geneious (see mRNA fasta file), translated into amino acids, fed the sequences into Blast to get their names (see XML excel file)
from looking at the ORF predictions: there are too many reading ORFs of which half are 100 aa long, so Gos suggested setting 300 aa as the min length for a gene. It seems like all the ORFs start in frame 1.
still according to the mRNA file, there also seems to be, for the same frame and the same ORF: how is ths possible? Seems strange...
Miha
Ran a PCR with all of our chromoprotein genes and the plasmid backbone. The PCR products were separated on a gel. After screening, the N7 localisation sequence, attached to some of the chromoprotein constructs, was not successfully amplified. The PCR with this fragment was then repeated (Guy). In addition, I prepared a large batch of electrocompetent Agrobacteria, hopefully to suffice for the rest of the project (if it worked). The GFPLti and RFPLti AgroB transformant O/N cultures were discarded as they would likely become non-viable until Monday. This step will be repeated on Monday.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"Prof. Melinda Jones is the Associate Dean for Non-Traditional Undergraduate Studies in the School of Nursing of Texas Tech Univeristy. She currently teaches courses in health law and ethics. Dr. Jones is admitted to The Supreme Court of the United States, the State Bar of Texas, and is a member of the Lubbock Bar Association, The National Association of Nurse Attorneys, American Nurses Association, and Sigma Theta Tau International. She attended the “University Immersion Program” of Sichuan University and taught “Bioethics in Clinical Practice” for two weeks in West China Medical Center. We asked Prof. Melinda Jones several enthics questions for our project. Especailly the dialysis part of our project, which may cause risk in the clinical trails.
Prof. Melinda Jones stressed a few key aspects in the bioenthics we had to notice. She thought as for clinical trail, autonomy must be considered as the first thing. The patients should fully know the details about the project, what benefice it might bring and the risk the patients might take. Seperated from that, nonmaleficence is the also an important thing to consider, no matter for animal expriment or clinical trail of our dialysis device. For all these kinds of experiment, we should get the permission from the authority who is responsible for this to make sure to avoid the unnesscessary suffering for animals and harm to people. We don’t want our patients to get worse after the research.
Those principles play important roles in our animal experiment design. We compare many methods to establish the mouse model, but due to our lack of pracitce in gavage, we decided not to take risk to do this, according to the nonmaleficence principle. We replace the standard yeast extraction gavage method to the adenine feed method to establish the HUA mouse model to reduce the hurt as much as possible. And she suggested us to put our permisson of the Institutional Review Board for our animal experiment on the poster to clarify it. We adopoted this idea.
