Questionnaire
We prepared two (very similar) questionnaires:  ""Attitude survey of genetic engineering"" and ""Attitude survey of biotechnology.""  They are almost the same, but ""Attitude survey of biotechnology"" contains a little different question from ""Attitude survey of genetic engineering"". We only changed the word ""genetic engineering"" of the survey for ""biotechnology"" in order to make ""Attitude survey of biotechnology.""
And we attempted to indicate difference of image between ""genetic engineering"" and ""biotechnology"".

""Lange Nacht der Forschung""
On April 29 we were able to present the iGEM-competition, synthetic biology, as well as, the general idea of our project at “Lange Nacht der Forschung”. This is an event organized by the Austrian broadcast to show the general public what we are doing in research including chances and visions.  Together with the institute of molecular biotechnology and ACIB we facilitated the visitors to get a first glance at microbiology, enzymes, and the field of genetic engineering, as well as, synthetic biology. For example we did an isolation of DNA from strawberries with ordinary consumables. Especially the DNA isolation was our task, together with the Austrian part of the last year’s iGEM Team “Manchester-Graz”. All over the event we extracted DNA together with hundreds of visitors, while a few of us gave an introduction to DNA and the general construction of a cell. Furthermore, we created a poster about our project and answered different questions about it and about the topic in general. The range of asked questions was enormous. There were some easy ones like:
Q: What is the difference between DNA and DNS?
A: DNS is the German expression for DNA. The A stands for acid. In German it would is S for “Säure”. In the course of time DNS was replaced by DNA also here in Austria.
Q: Why do we need genetic engineering? We did not need it for decades! Why now?
A: Our modern world would not work without genetic engineering anymore. Many things in our daily life are made by microorganisms; E.g. citric acid and insulin, just to name 2 very popular examples.  The next thing is that it is true that we had no need for genetic engineering in the past. But what we can see is that the mankind wants to spend less and less money for food and other commodities. Without plants and genetic engineering it would not be possible to provide 1kg of pork meat for less than €2,-  Even our forefathers did kind of genetic engineering. For sure they did not use our methods, but they always cultivated the best and biggest plants for"

Results of the colicin activity test
The bar diagrams above show, that in case of a mixture ratio of 1:1 even for uninduced killer cells (i.e. a AHL concentration of 0 nM) a killing affect can be observed.  In case of an AHL concentration of 250 pM, the lowest mixture ratio of killer:prey leading to an observable killing effect seems to be 1:50. That means, at an AHL concentration of 250 pM, one single killer cell is able to kill 50 prey cells.  In case of an AHL concentration of 25 nM, this threshold rations rise up to killer:prey = 1:100. That means, for a higher induction level of the killer cells, the killing efficiency, i.e. the amount of released colicins, rises.  For a mixture ration of killer:prey = 1:500 even at a AHL concentration of 25 nM no killing effect could be observed.
The figure above shows the GFP vs time and OD vs time curves for prey:killer and prey:reference respectively, each at a mixture ratio of 100:1. The figures for prey:killer (GFP as well as OD) shows, that there is an observable killing effect for the AHL concentrations of 750 pM and above. For the concentrations 500 pM and lower, no killing effect could be observed, that means, the GFP and the OD respectively rise in the same matter, than they do for the prey:reference curves. This is due to a continuous growth of the prey cells (expressing GFP) because of a lack of colicin in the media. According to this results, the threshold AHL concentration for an observable killing effect in the case of a prey:killer ratio of 100:1 seems to be between 500 pM and 750 pM (see dose-response curve for this prey-killer ratio below).

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

The entrepreneurial stream of iGEM has given us the opportunity to explore the economic impact of synthetic biology. In previous iGEM projects with which the group has been involved, we were not required to consider how our project would fit into a specific market or effect the economy. For entrepreneurial iGEM, we had to learn how to do market research and adapt our financial projections based on the market. We had to develop a whole new skill set, learning how to integrate business and science.
Many first time iGEM students are faced with tackling the steep learning curve of understanding synthetic biology while learning new lab skills and usually balancing classes at the same time.  In order for this to be undertaken appropriately a few key skills are required, practiced and built upon.  These include organization and time management, these are a unique experience for each student, and are required in the end to sync with those of their team mates. As a team we have learned that available time to contribute to the project might now always line up and that the work will still need to be completed.  This has led us to develop skills in project management, where a global overview of the project is required.  From this perspective we are able to work on setting goals and understanding outside commitments so that we can align a work schedule with available time.
Dr. Ute Kothe, Associate Professor of Biochemistry, has seen first-hand how the Synbiologica team has grown and learned from High School, Collegiate and Entrepreneurial iGEM in these ways. She states, “The entrepreneurial iGEM opportunity offers students the richest learning environment I have ever seen. The four students in the Lethbridge team, whom I all know personally, have grown significantly while working on this project. They all have acquired a range of professional skills that are far beyond what is offered in a regular science program. Obviously, they have gained deep insight into management, budgeting, patenting, creating business plans and other topics associated with forming a start-up company. But in my eyes even more valuable is what they learned about themselves: these students have experienced that with motivation and determination anything is possible. They have learned that they can learn anything if they want to. They have developed an incredible independence. They have learned to communicate with any type of person to promote their cause. All this not only helps them in their entrepreneurial iGEM project, but it will be a catalyst for their future careers in any type of field whether it will be scientific, entrepreneurial or even something entirely unrelated.”

Week 8: June 17 - June 21
An issue we addressed this week was the assembly of gene constructs to test ferritin in our system. A tentative strategy plan has been proposed. Coordinating this plan with the TALE and linker teams is necessary to ensure compatibility among the many components of this project. Upon receiving commercially-synthesized genes, we will order primers to use the Golden Gate assembly method.
To test whether the synthesis of magnetoferritin is successful, we must first synthesize it using the method proposed in week 4, where the native ferrihydrite core is converted to apoferritin then magnetite. Using a magnet with a relatively strong pull force (about 50 lbs.), we hope to see the magnetoferritin respond in solution.
We must also confirm the applicability of using ferritin as the Prussian blue reporter system. After generating ferritin with a Prussian blue ferrihydrite core, we will manipulate the core type, pH, coloured substrate, and temperature to test the feasibility of this method. If these tests are futile, we may need to develop an enzymatic reporter that will function in parallel with our system. The necessary materials have been obtained for these experiments, and results will follow shortly.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
In order to use beta-lactamase as a potential reporter system it was necessary to use designed primers to PCR out the gene from the backbone of the pSB1A3 plasmid (it is present here as it conveys ampicillin resistance). Three primers were designed in order to retrieve the beta-lactamase gene just by itself as well as having it with a His-tag in order to aid with protein purification. After the PCR was performed the resulting DNA was run on a gel to confirm the gene size (Figure 2). This PCR appeared to be successful based on size (900-bp and 927-bp for the beta-lactamase and beta-lactamase with His-tag respectively) but after sequencing it was determined one of the primers contained a design error resulting in a truncated gene. The primers will be redesigned in order to successfully achieve the extraction of the beta-lactamase gene from the pSB1A3 plasmid.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Human Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," an interesting conversation about the application, they would leave the decision making to the patient whether or not to make use of GMOs.
Discussing GMOs to prevent the overuse of pesticides
The subgroup considering a case where GMOs were used to treat a disease on plants were more reluctant to the use of GMOs. Most of them were frightened by the step towards usage of genetically modified organisms outside the lab. Thereby they emphasized that they would be afraid that our device would be transformed into something potentially harmful. Considering this, the usage of GMOs outside the lab was less favourable than to use of GMOs inside the human body.
First of all they commented that, if our device is to be applied in the way we proposed, we would still make use of pesticides, which are not the most impeccable substances either. Therefore they would rather see a different solution to this problem. Also they stressed that the benefits of using the GMOs should outweigh the risk. For example; they value human lives more than money or comfort.   The general idea behind their arguments was based on the fact that you should not use something, if you don’t know the consequences. And since the usage of GMOs in the environment could possibly affect all, also the people who are opposed to the utilization, they reject this idea. They would rather see a scenario where everyone can decide for themselves if they will get in touch with GMOs or not.
Discussing GMOs to detect diseases in cattle
Our final group studied the case of using GMOs to detect diseases in cattle. One could state that this group was most open-minded towards the application of GMOs. They even went beyond the idea of using GMOs for detection/treatment and stated that one could as well genetically enhance the cattle itself if we knew the causes of these diseases. Thereby they expressed that according to them it is the most important that there is transparency from the designer towards the public. But also there should be an open-mindedness of the audience towards the ideas of the designer.
The group did encounter some complications in the use of the bacteria as we proposed it.  First of all they stated that the bacteria should be made harmless after usage. Therefore they proposed heating the mixture to a high temperature to kill bacteria.
Secondly, if the device is to be used by farmers themselves, this would mean that we would have to trust their judgement. Maybe, if it could bring great economic problems to the farmer, he or she might hide the presence of a certain infection. In that case it would be useful if some external authority judged the results from a test.  Furthermore they explored our idea by"

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using our lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. “R0010 BL” showed a 2x increase in fluorescence across inducer concentration; other components remained static.
B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. No significant change in fluorescence was observed in any component other than R0010 expressed in BL21.
Additionally, we also used their protocol as a means to test the validity of the two parts. Similar to our protocol, stationary phase cultures were grown overnight. The following morning, those cultures were pipetted into their allocated rows with prepped, diluted inducer concentration corresponding to the appropriate column. The fluorescence values we measured followed no strict patterns and greatly differed from plate to plate. Since the deviations we obtained for each point were significant, the results from this experiment were inconclusive.

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Overview | Design | Results
Circuit Model
Circuit Design
To begin construction of this plasmid, the DNA sequence was generated and edited in ApE, a DNA editing software available through the University of Utah, from several existing plasmid sequences available through other labs on the Penn State campus. The construct was rationally designed to include two start codons within 7 nucleotides of each other, and thus in different open reading frames.
Each codon, labeled RFP-coding ATG and sfGFP-coding ATG for simplicity, codes for a different reporter in the respective reading frame of each start codon. The first start codon, RFP-coding ATG, if recognized by the ribosome, will translate the reporter RFP. The second start codon, sfGFP-codon ATG, will translate the reporter sfGFP if recognized by the ribosome. Super-folder GFP (sfGFP) is used to allow for the nonsense codons of the out-of-frame RFP sequence preceding the sfGFP reporter which would inevitably be translated prior to the green reporter sequence should the ribosome recognize the sfGFP-coding ATG. The super-folder protein will fold regardless of this nonsense sequence, facilitating the measurement of codon slippage through the measurement of fluorescence
To prevent premature termination of the translation of either reporter, all stop codons in the respective reading frames of each codon were eliminated through amino acid sequence substitution.
Circuit Construction
Initially, 4 gBlocks, available through IDT as oligos with overlapping 40bp sequences complimentary to the adjacent oligo, were used to perform a Gibson Assembly reaction with a digested dRBS1 vector. After several failed attempts, a second approach was implemented. Oligos for the missing circuit sequence were designed and annealed, according to their complimentary 20bp overlaps, and inserted into the nearly-complete vector using Gibson Assembly. This attempt was successful, and the initial construct was verified with sequencing.

Figure 2: Figure from Lou et al. showing that the relative relationship is preserved when RiboJ is used as an insulator.
First, we wanted to make sure that RiboJ worked the way Lou et al. had outlined, so we characterized RiboJ in the Biobrick Backbone. We reconstructed some of the characterization parts from Lou et al. in the Biobrick Backbone and then proceeded to characterize the impact of RiboJ (Figure 3)
Figure 3A
Figure 3B
Figure 3A and B: Measurements of plLacO-1 sfGFP and cI-GFP with (B) and without (A) RiboJ. Our findings were consistent with Lou et al. Notice how the relative expression curves collapse with RiboJ compared to the ones without RiboJ which do not. Measurements were done in triplicate using FACS. MEFL was calculated using Spherotech beads. The reporters (Bba_K2066014, Bba_K2066015) were located on a high copy 1C3 plasmid while the repressor LacI (Bba_K2066016) was constitutively expressed on a low copy 3K3 plasmid.
While we confirmed the findings of Lou et al. that the relative expression of different proteins under one promoter converges, we also noticed that absolute expression of the same protein is altered by the inclusion of RiboJ. Furthermore, we noticed that the direction of this shift changes based on the promoter used (Fig. 4).
These phenomena led us to initiate a thorough characterization of the impact of RiboJ on the absolute gene expression levels of widely used promoters, including the entire Anderson library of constitutive promoters. We designed a library of promoter characterization constructs with and without RiboJ (Bba_K2066057-K2066108), which consist of the Anderson library as well as additional inducible promoters on a standard superfolder GFP expression cassette. To our knowledge, this will be the first such targeted characterization effort on these promoters in the literature.

In fact, we assembled BBa_K1028000 (encoding for Si4, from iGEM Leeds 2013 ), BBa_KBBa_K863110 (encoding for CBPa, from iGEM Bielefeld-Germany 2012 ), and BBa_K103003 (encoding for BpA, from iGEM Warsaw 2008) , and separated them by using flexible linkers in order to preserve their conformation and their biological activity. To make our protein easy to purify, the sequence of a HisTag was added at the 5’ end, followed by the TEV protease-specific cleavage site sequence to allow the removal of the His-Tag after purification. To be certain of our protein’s expression, we intentionally added ATG initiation codons at the beginning and TAA stop codons at the end of the sequence. Next, cis-regulating elements, such as T7 terminator and T7 promoter, were taken from the pET43.1a(+) vector to flank the composite sequence, and iGEM prefix and suffix were added. BamH I and Hind III restrictions sites were added to the beginning and the end of final sequence, respectively2 (Fig 3).
Figure 3. DNA corresponding sequence encoding for the fusion protein Si4-CBPa-BpA.
We optimized the coding sequence for expression in Escherichia coli with Geneious software, and we took the precaution of avoiding restriction sites of iGEM prefix and suffix. By taking advantage of the free 20bp offered by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), we sent several sequences to be synthesized which encoded the fusion protein and several control sequences (Table 1).
Once we received DNA sequences, we amplified them by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned them into TOPO vectors[3] (Fig 4). Since Taq polymerase contains a terminal-desoxynucleotidyl transferase activity, adenine were added on each extremity of the PCR products, allowing TOPO cloning. Resulting “TOPO-insert” plasmids were introduced into competent TOP 10 Escherichia coli by heat-shock transformation, and bacteria were grown onto LB plates added of ampicillin to increase plasmid amount. Since resistance gene to ampicillin is present in the TOPO vector, only transformed bacteria were selected. After growth, bacteria were harvested and plasmidic DNA extracted.

By observing the correlation between the 3 graphs, the turn events of the number of projects done is in 2011 where it increased by almost twice than in 2010.
Conclusion
After reviewing the past human practice projects in a detailed manner, it is safe to say that human practice is becoming a large part of iGEM. Furthermore, the space for improvement and future development was found by looking in to regions and types of projects done.

        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)

To remove doubts in the data from the bone incision experiments, due to possible experimental error we should repeat the experiments. This would ensure that the experiments are reproducible and reliable.

It is recommended to write a “.flags”-file, because there are several input parameters to be defined,         but it is also possible to define them via console user interface. For the categorization of the scaffold, we chose the automatic determination and set the following cuts, like the Baker-lab commonly used: cut1: 6 Å, cut2: 8 Å, cut3: 10 Å and cut4: 12 &#8491
We used this algrithm to simulate the evolution of the tyrosyl-tRNA with the amino acids Nitrophenylalanine and CBT-ASP     We obtained 13 synthetase sequences for CBT-ASP, and 43 sequences for NPA, which fit well into the binding site according to the ROSETTA score.

Carrying out the PCR
The cycle for the PCR was as follows:
One cycle involving the reverse primer pGFGrrnBrev only with the large degenerate oligo as a template - this is to convert the single-stranded oligo into double stranded DNA. To denature the oligo 90C was needed, to anneal the oligo 60C was needed and to extend the oligo 72C was needed.
The forward primer should then be added and the mixture given 30 cycles (each cycle lasting 1 minute) of 90C denaturing, 54C annealing and 72C extending.

K2541003_J, K2541004_J, K2541010_J are the measurement results of Jilin_China, and K2541003_N, K2541004_N, K2541010_N are the measurement results of NPU-China. The height of the bars corresponds to the normalized fluorescence.
We are very grateful to NPU-China for helping us with this experiment.
Here is the link to the wiki of NPU-China.
3.NEU_China_A
This year our team and NEU_China_A sent experimental materials in the Distribution Kit each other. These materials greatly helped both sides. We sent Nitrate reporter: PyeaR-GFP composite (BBa_K381001) and Test Device 4 for interlab (BBa_J364007) to them. PyeaR is a nitrate and nitrite sensitive promoter and NEU_China_A replaced GFP with a blue protein. The promoter PyeaR expressed the blue protein under the induction of nitric oxide. So they can use this part (BBa_K381001) to detect nitric oxide. NEU_China_A sent superfolder GFP (BBa_I746916) to us for part improvement. This year, We used sfGFP_optimism (BBa_K2541400) as an improvement part. Compared with iGEM superfolder GFP (BBa_I746916), it has no BbsI restriction site and can be used for Golden Gate assembly. So we used the part (BBa_I746916) from NEU_China_A to verify that it contains BbsI restriction site.
Here is the link to the wiki of NEU_China_A.
4.TUST_China
This year, we built a friendly relationship with TUST_China. During the meet-up in NKU and CCiC, we exchangd ideas about projects.
TUST_China focused on tetracycline detecting and degradation this year, so they would like to collect polluted water in most places in China. There is a river called Yongchun River which is closed to several bio-product factories near Jilin university. We provided a water sample from Yongchun River to TUST_China so they can detect antibiotic pollution to enrich their projects.
Back again to our SynRT, we made an improvement that we did a site-directed mutagenesis of sfGFP ("

Webdesign
The webdesign was entirely done by Florian Albrecht who has programmed different websites before. He also wrote the webdesign tutorial we put online to explain other teams how to use the code, developed by our team. The graphic elements used on the website were created by several different student members (such as Ingmar Polte, Katrin Fischer, Jeffery Truong, Rosario Ciccone and others) using the open source vector software Inkscape. The only component that was bought are the two direction signs used in the header (obtained from http://vector-images.de/clipart/clp217632 ).
normalize.css
Normalize.css was used to reset the wiki style (version used: 2.1.3).
jQuery
jQuery is a powerful JavaScript extension used by many Webdesigners (version used: 1.10.2).
jQuery UI
jQuery UI is a GUI extension of jQuery and was used for the datepicker on the Arduino data page (version used: 1.10.3).
History.js
History.js was used to ensure compatibility with HTML4 browsers, that do not support history.pushState().
Slimbox 2
Slimbox 2 was used as a picture viewer (version used: 2.05). The code had to be adapted to work with the wiki and bxSlider and we added a feature that fits the viewer to the browser size.
bxSlider
bxSlider is a JavaScript content slider and powers the slideshows and picture galleries on our wiki (version used: 4.1.1). The code was modified so all the images are scaled to the same height in gallery mode.
NVD3
NVD3 is a JavaScript chart library and was used for the interactive chart of the Arduino data (version used: 1.1.13).
Software - The AutoAnnotator
The software tool we have written to facilitate and improve the annotation of protein coding BioBricks (the AutoAnnotator ) was developed and programmed by the student member Christopher Wolf . He developed this idea himself to import, translate sequences and to compute important parameters. After this was completed he contacted the bioinformatics group of Prof. Rost and presented his idea and the program in a group seminar. In the seminar, ideas for further improvements were generated. The group advised Chrostopher to implement a bioinformatic module that does alignments to several databases and bioinformatic servers. The research group of Prof. Rost has"

Thus, our idea of transforming aquatic ammonia into uric acid is highly feasible. Time permitted, we would test this hypothesis in field.
Interviews with different professors and experts help us knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution, and gave us inspirations to improve our design; communications with fish farmers make it clear what they need, thus we decide to publicize our article and write a brochure to provide specific help; achievements on social media give us a chance to reach more people, and share our experience with the world!
Our human practice work is integrated to the project from the very beginning to the end. Communications with professors help us to be clear with background situation, talks with technicians provide information on designing improvements, interviews with government staff give advice on application issues, and visits to fish farmers bring about new ideas on hardware design!
In order to get more people know synthetic biology, we joined and organized activities such as video competition and public talks, introducing knowledge and sharing experiences. Also, we used our own WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with the public!
Talks and interviews
In the communication with professors and experts, we knew more about ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water, as well as the current methods to deal with it. How could we make a different on the problem? How could we improve our design to be more helpful? University professors and factory technicians gave us useful inspirations and suggestions.
Outreach for farmers
Our project focused on ammonia pollution, and we also wanted to provide farmers with more specific help. We contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article which gained more than 4000 clicks. Also, a 24-pages brochure was written and delivered to farmers over China, helping with problems in fish-farming and solutions to fish diseases.
Social media
Social media efficiently helped us to reach lots of people at the same time. This year, we used WeChat official account to show descriptions about our project, introduce knowledge about synthetic biology, and update our current activities. We really enjoyed sharing stories with public!
Interviews with experts in aquaculture
To customize our project to the practical conditions, we interviewed some experts in related fields. We explained our aim purpose of promoting the development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them.

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.

CCiC
to learn, to doubt, to change
At the end of August 2018, some of our members participated in the 5th CCiC and shared the CSU_CHINA project at the conference. As a communication platform for Chinese synthetic biology enthusiasts, CCiC is developing in continuous reform and innovation. This year's CCIC added Trouble-Shooting, AfteriGEM Project Show, iGEM Experience Sharing and other special activities on the basis of regular projects. The most fundamental purpose of these activities is to assemble new and old iGEMer, feel iGEM together, and feel the passion and happiness brought by synthetic biology.
In the communication with each team, we realized the gap with other teams. Because it is our first time to participate in iGEM, we still have many defects that do not considered thoughtful. In the questioning session, the opinion provided by the team teacher of NUDT_CHINA to us about the up-regulation threshold of miRNA concentration in liver cancer cells’ determination is very constructive. Then another suggestion came out: we should add experimental steps to verify the specificity of a specific promoter. Besides, we also discussed issues related to targeted drug delivery with XJTU_CHINA. What we can feel at the event is a strong expectation – let everyone see the sustainability, developability and breakthrough of the field, presenting the value of synthetic biology itself.
For us, iGEM is an opportunity to lead us into and participate in the field of synthetic biology. As a result, we fell in love with synthetic biology and began to explore the wider world. Here, we hope to present a state of enthusiasm for iGEMer in China, and let everyone see the creation and development, expansion and change of true synthetic biology enthusiasts in this field.
Working molecule “street”
presenting our project as a one-stop service
As we mentioned in the Sliver/Gold Human Practice part, the “Working Party” flash mob which held in Lunan Youth Street has attracted a lot of attention. To get in touch with people from different backgrounds and expand the impact of the project, we have cooperated with property workers, cleaning staffs and many store owners in Youth Street. We distributed our representative hat, the one printed “蛋白质（related proteins）”, to all the stores and units we worked with. At the same time, we gave our leaflets and tri-fold-pages to them and try best to explain how important it is to know those"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2015,Team:Hong Kong HKU#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", a recent astrobiological research has demonstrated that up to 35% of plasmid DNA remain functional even after expose to high temperature and pressure9. Chances are that recombinant DNA may be taken up by natural occurring bacteria even though escaped synthetic organisms are destroyed. Thus, in order to fully unleash the potential of synthetic biology, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive containment strategies to control the leakage of GMO and recombinant DNA.
Exploring new containment device
In light of the demand of better containment strategies, we would like to explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas system as an intrinsic containment device. In this project, we are going to design two prototype repressible killswitches based on two bacteria immune systems against viral infection – CRISPR/Cas3 (originated from E. coli MG1655) and CRISPR/Cas9 (originated from S. pyogenes SF370). In addition, we would like to compare the killing efficiencies of the devices and test our devices out in a simulated scenario using E. coli BL21 (DE3) as the chassis.
For the detail of our containment device please visit our Design page.

Addressing different goals like education and research at the same point makes a concrete evaluation of these gamification processes difficult and maybe future developments have to be awaited for clearer results about possible effects.
Conclusions
Although our excursion into synthetic biology games is by no means complete, we want to draw some conclusions. When trying to explain synthetic biology, especially to people without a biological background, a lot of the concepts are simplified with comparisons to Lego, not only since the Biobrick Foundation was started in 2006 [15]. The idea of interchangeable parts is crucial to the idea of introducing engineering principles into biology. Lego is nevertheless a game played mostly by children, a fact that could prove disadvantageous for the image of synthetic biology. Genetic engineering is seen as something potentially dangerous by the public, as something that certainly does not belong into the hands of children. On the other hand Lego is well-known and easily understandable. We think with our Colisweeper game we can demonstrate important mechanisms of synthetic biology in a comparably playful way, without too much reducing the complexity or the seriousness of research. We also find these qualities within the new field of citizen science. Games like Foldit and Phylo allow the public to actively take part in science and get a feeling of what the research is actually about. By taking such an explanatory route, the level of complexity as well as effort required by the audience can be adjusted to match tailored profiles.

SAFETY
Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
Project design safety
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. The core of our project is to express human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The whole project has no harm to the human body. In the process of implementation of the project we chose the mRFP as a reporter gene which can be detected directly without adding any harmful reagents.
Lab safety
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli strain DH5α, BL21, Top 10 and S.c strain CEN.PK2-1C are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pRS42K, pESC-Ura, pESC-Trp, pESC-His, pESC-Leu, pSB1C3) are not harmful for humans.
See more in Notebook / Equipment & Material
Because of the nature of our project, contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:
(1) Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
(2) Don’t deal with the wastes at will.
(3) All experimenters must wear protective equipment such as gloves and Lab coats.
(4) All equipments that come into contact with biological material (such as tips and glass glassware) must be autoclaved.
(5) Store quick-burning, flammable materials in designated locations which are away from ignition sources for fire protection. And there is no accumulated clutter in the hallway, for our safety while accident happening.

In the Laboratory
At the beginning of summer everyone on our team took the online UC Fundamentals of Laboratory Safety course. This course described correct use of personal protective equipment and engineering safety controls within the lab to reduce risks associated with each lab space. The course also covered methods involved in chemical safety including the identification of chemical hazards through the use of Material Safety and Data Sheets (MSDS) and pictograms as well as proper chemical storage and disposal. In addition to this general safety course, we were also trained on the laboratory specific hazards by the lab managers of the three spaces that we worked in.
Since our project involved use of some proteins found in known pathogens, we decided to synthesize the genes we were interested in through IDT to express in laboratory E. coli. These safety precautions ensured that we 1. did not culture pathogenic organisms in the laboratory and 2. the proteins we expressed were not toxic or pathogenic. To ensure that our engineered strains did not exit the lab, we killed all of our cultures with 10% (v/v) bleach before disposal. We also did not transport any engineered strains outside of the lab, reducing the risk of release.
Our project involved the use of an array of small molecules. To ensure safety, we followed recommendations in the MSDS for each of the chemicals that we used. When ordering our library of alternate FabI substrates, we made sure not to order chemicals that were acutely toxic. For the chemicals we tested, we followed the MSDS recommendations for proper use of personal protective equipment including, wearing eye protection, lab coats, and wearing rubbing gloves, and engineering controls such as a working in the fume hood to eliminate the risk of chemical exposure.
The inhibitor we are detecting, triclosan, is toxic, so we created a triclosan waste container to avoid dumping triclosan down the drain. The proper way to dispose of this container is to give it to UC Davis’s Environmental Health and Safety Services
In the Real World
The use of laboratory expressed enzymes in the environment is defined in The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology . Our device and its associated biosensor must be approved through this process before use in the real world. Additionally, for application in the real world setting, future screening of alternate substrates would require us to look for substrates that are non hazardous to use outside of the laboratory setting"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Sequencing_-_-_TEXT.html,"6 mutator BBa_K2082117 or the dnaQ926 device BBa_K2082116 were cotransformed with the reporter plasmid pLA230 into E. coli Top10 and plated on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol, kanamycin and glucose.
From a single colony LB media with chloramphenicol and kanamycin was inoculated, grown to mid-log phase, induced or repressed with arabinose or glucose and plated after 24 h. Plasmids for sequencing were isolated 24 h after induction/repression, yielding four libraries for NGS.
The mutation rate and the mutation spectrum was determined as describe above.
Figure 10: Mutation rate after induction/repression of BBa_K2082117 .
The mutation rate increases from the control to the repressed M6 plasmid sample and further to the induced M6 plasmid sample. Using the difference between control and the wild type polymerase sample to measure the inaccuracy of the method. The repressed plasmid sample is 1.8 times and the induced plasmid sample is 7.1 times the measurement inaccuracy above the control. This means that BBa_K2082117 mutates more strongly than the background, thus is a mutator. Furthermore, the induction of BBa_K2082117 works as seen in an increase in mutation rate in comparison to the uninduced sample. Finally, the used promoter is active even in the not-induced state as seen by the increase in mutation rate between the control and the repressed sample. Based on these results we modified our reversion assays in that we kept the repressed control under glucose repression at all times. In contrast: in this experiment we cultivated at first in LB media and added glucose in the repressed sample simultaneous to the addition of arabinose in the induced sample.
Additionally, we wanted to determine the mutagenic spectra of our mutators. This was done as described above.
Figure 11: Mutational spectrum of the M6 and dnaQ926 mutators.
Based on the χ2 test no significant difference between the spectrum of the control and the induced mutators could be observed. (χ2dnaQ926 = 0.85, χ2M6 = 3.78)
Nevertheless, the mutation spectrum is comparable to the published mutation spectrum of the M6 plasmid used by Badran and coworkers (Badran and Liu, 2015).

Abstract
When we talk about internal clock, we actually refer to the circadian rhythm of higher animals and plants. Sensing the cycling environmental factors (light and temperature, etc.), circadian clock allows organism to behave accordingly and reguarly. This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up an internal clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, we could insert this system into dangerous strains and endue life span, they are doomed to die before causing any biohazard. Flip units based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One flip unit is able to calculate a specific period of time, while several flip units form one time cycle. So, when we combine several time cycles together, a timer is constructed. Different flip unit assemblies creat distinctive time cycles, forms different kinds of timers. We believe this system will be of great significance to biological devices with time-related concepts.
Background
It is well known that the internal clock is of great significance to human life. The time rhythm let people work and rest regularly, which keeps us healthy and energetic. However, in microbes, especially prokaryotic organism, we could hardly find a strain with rhythm.
Actually, adding rhythm into microbes is a meaningful thing, by which would provide us a brand new technology platform or control system. This year, we hope to construct a rhythm device with time limit. As follows, we will use 3 simple hypothetical cases to illustrate its future application potentials.

Bioabsorbent Introduction
    As mentioned before, heavy metals including mercury and lead can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobilities and solubilities[1]. Present technology including immobilization and extraction relies upon chemical precipitation or chelating agents[2], both of which are commercially impractical, lack of selectivity or sensitivity and not eco-friendly[3]. High performance and inexpensive methods to decontaminate heavy metals in water body, therefore, are highly desired.
    There are natural proteins, which can immobilize heavy metals to reduce the toxicity, exist in eukaryote and prokaryote. Most of them are metallothioneins[4] with cysteines"
TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", multidrug resistant bacteria have emerged and posed great threat to public health, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so on. To know about the exact situation of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, we visited Doctor Gong Yali, who works at the burn department in the Southwest Hospital. She did a lot of researches related to antibiotic resistance. She introduce that currently antibiotic resistance is a really urgent issue that needed to be treated seriously. For example, one of her researches demonstrated that the Acinetobacter baumannii was resistant to many antibiotics. We introduced our project and explained our goal of establishing a markerless integration visual selection system. She agreed with our idea and praised us for concerning antibiotics resistance. She compared the counter selection with our visual selection system and discussed with us about their value, on the basis of which she gave her advice. Thanks to her guidance, we had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and we were enlightened to do more.
Collaborations
SCU-China:The project of SCU-China focused on the antibacterial deodorant insole. However, they met some trouble in microbes. Therefore, using our advantages, we helped them verify the antimicrobial effect of the insole. At the same time, we found our mathematical modeling unsatisfactory, so we invited their talented group members to provide technical guidance for us.
UESTC-software:UESTC-software encountered problems when synthesizing DNA primers,so we helped them. Additionally, considering that we had several models, we hoped to achieve visualization of the models by using software. UESTC-software kindly helped us, and the result was satisfying and helpful for our further work.
Conferences
Southwest Union:After five months of experiments, our project began to take shape. Meanwhile, we have just received a meet-up invitation from the Southwest Union (iGEM meet-up in southwest China). Simulating the final round, this meeting set up presentation, poster exhibition and free discussion. Together with the SCU-China, UESTC-China, UESTC-software and SICAU-China, we knew much detailed information about the competition, such as the progress and the judging criteria. All the teams exchanged suggestions with each other and build up deep friendship.
CCiC Conference:As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams"
TUST_China,2018,Team:TUST China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," its neighborhood density, and O may be an outlier.
Using the Outlier Detection Toolbox MATLAB toolbox written by Goker Erdogan, we divide all the data into two parts to calculate, because the data is loose when the concentration of tetracycline is above 100 ug/ul. 5% data as validation data, the results are as follows:
1 of the data is normal and 2 indicates that the data is outlier
The abnormal data in ABS and FL are cleaned by LOF. Taking ABS data as an example, the results are as follows:
1.2 BP neutral network：
We construct a three-layer neural network, which is input layer AI (ABS and FL), middle hidden layer Vj and output layer t. Therefore, the input layer node is 2 and the output layer is 1. The number of neurons in the middle hidden layer will greatly affect the accuracy. If it is too large, it may cause slow convergence and over-fitting problems.              If it is too small, the accuracy will be reduced. Therefore, we should refer to the following empirical formula:
Among them,
N - the number of neurons in the hidden layer;
I - the number of neurons in the input layer.
J - the number of neurons in the output layer.
K -- any number between [1,10].
According to this formula, we finally decided to make 4 our last choice.
2. the choice of incentive function:
BP neural network usually uses Sigmoid differentiable function and linear function as the excitation function of the network. In this paper, the S-type tangent function Tansig is chosen as the excitation function of the hidden layer neurons.              It belongs to the sigmoid function and is expressed in the following form:
The output layer excitation function is logsis function, that is:
The grid training function is selected as the gradient descent method with adaptive learning rate and momentum factor -- Traingdx Function.
3. Other Parameters Are As Follows:
After normalizing the training sample data, the network performance function is mse, and the number of hidden layer neurons is calculated by trial and error method. The number of iterations is epochs 500 times, the expected error goal is 1e-5, and the learning rate LR is 0.01.
Enter our data using the MATLAB neural network toolbox:
It can be seen that this is an input dual neuron, output single neuron, and the number of hidden layer nodes             in the middle of the neural network, running time only 2 seconds, convergence faster.
After about 434 repetitions, the minimum error is reached and the learning stops,"
NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," have begun to make our own buffers (or use those leftover from Qiagen kits) to do our purifications. We chose this tack because it is cheaper and easier to do large quantities of minipreps, but instead we could recycle our spin columns to be a bit more environmentally friendly [like Harvard’s team this year].

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," the original ECFP shows a 5.7 folds of intensity compared to original ECFP (BBa_E0020), exceeding the less than 10-fold result reported in literature.
We carry out this experiment with E. coli. Firstly, we transfect E. coli BL21 with plasmids carrying BBa_K2886013 and BBa_K2886012 respectively. Then, when they express enough cECFP and nECFP, we lyse the bacteria with ultrasound and mix them up to emit cECFP and nECFP to a same system. At last, we measure the fluorescence with plate reader compared with negative and positive controls. Figure 1 shows that our attempt does succeed and even is better than the result reported in literature, which make it more reliable for more complicated conditions.
To further demonstrate the reliability of our BiFC system, we also do some similar things in Hela cells. We add outer-membrane and transmembrane domain to it as well as substitute the leucine zipper with GS linker. The result suggests that our BiFC also works. For detailed information concerning this, please click here to visit our Receptor Demonstrate page.
Summary
To sum up, using BBa_K2886013 together with BBa_K2886012, we confirmed the reliability of the BiFC system we designed preliminarily, accumulating experiences and lying down bases for further experiments and demonstrations. If you want to test your own BiFC system in a convenient way, you may try this method to give you help.

Collaborations
To become an outstanding team, cooperation is essential, especially with other teams and social groups. On one hand, we work on improving our own experiments in collaboration. On the other hand, we promote IGEM along with the knowledge about synthetic biology. We did a lot of collaborations with other teams:
1. At the beginning of the experiment, the iGEM team Worldshaper-Wuhan found that the skeleton plasmids in distribution kit were not available. We put plasmids on the filter sheet and sent express packages to them with the necessary plasmids(figure1 to figure3).
2. In the work of Interlab, we also collaborated with other teams. We learned that the iGEM teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing had problems with plasmids transformation, so we provided these two teams with Interlab related plasmids (positive control, negative control and device1~device6, a total of 8 plasmids)(figure4,figure5). Since we didn't have a plate reader, we borrowed it from iGEM teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing. During the experiment, our three teams worked together to solve the technical problems during the experiments(figure6,figure7).
3. In the design and improvement of the experiment, we also have a lot of collaboration with other teams. From July 26 to July 30, 2017, the iGEM team Worldshaper-Wuhan came to visit. Our four teams, ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing and Worldshaper-Wuhan, and us discussed the experimental plan together(figure8). We introduced the experiment to other teams, and we exchanged a lot of ideas(figure9). We also held propaganda activities with other teams(for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/HP/Silver ). The largest one was in Hangzhou Science and Technology Museum on 30 July(figure 10).The cooperation provided guidance and assistance for the reconstruction of their research subjects.

Furthermore, the teeth are cleaned properly before the use. The use of that samples is regulated by the Ministry of Economic affairs, Agriculture and Innovation of the Government of The Netherlands. The waste of all animal byproduct is designated as Specific Animal Waste (following Euralcode 180102). Later on, it is transported to the ZAVIN in Dordrecht for its destruction. For further information, you could contact the Residual Management Department of TU Delft (ReststoffenBeheer@tudelft.nl)
One of the problems to be faced with this project is the production of csgA as biofilm-maker unit. It has been reported previously as a virulence factor from harmful strains of E.coli, because the amyloid make the attachment to surfaces easier. However, we implemented two safety points for minimizing the risk of plasmid transmission to pathogen strains. First of all, the gene which codifies for csgA is preceded by a Rhamnose promoter. That prevents curli (csgA+csgB polymer) to be produces when no inductor is applied to the system. Furthermore, as rhamnose is a metabolizable inductor the gene expression could be avoided just by stopping the rhamnose supply. On the other hand, we aim our project for product testing or industrial production. So, the good laboratory practices and good manufacturing practices in these two fields should avoid any safety issue.
If our project could be fully developed into a real product, it would aim the following fields:
Factories
Lab applications
Consumer products
Test products to be used in the human body
Test products on food
We would like to encourage every interested iGEM team or researcher in general to contact us for further details about the safety in our lab and project!

HOW WE DID IT
Dry Lab This year’s team extended last year’s project to find a higher quantity of DNA sequences and key enzymes within the cellulose and hemicellulose degradation pathway. The team focused on bioinformatics, more specifically a metagenomic pipeline and metagenomic library. The metagenomic library was produced through the collaboration with Dr. Trevor Charles at the University of Waterloo. Along with the production of the metagenomic pipeline and library, the team planned to co-culture cellulose-degrading E. coli and yeast in a bioreactor, in order to produce ethanol from cellulose. For the synthetic metagenomic library, the team used the Illumina MiSeq data from last year’s four fecal samples: Artic Wolf, Coyote, Porcupine, and Beaver. The porcupine Illumina MiSeq data was used to discover enzymes within the cellulose and hemicellulose degradation pathways. The process of shotgun sequencing, as seen in Illumina MiSeq technology, required short inputs of DNA that were ~300 base pairs. The length of base pairs required for a full gene is much longer. Thus, the team used another program, MegaHIT, which allowed them to stitch together sequences to get a fragment yield of 1,000 base pairs. Once the larger fragments were formed the team used the program, Prodigal, to identify the open reading frames (ORFs). Prodigal is responsible for locating ribosome binding sites, through the identification of the start and stop codons. Lastly, jackHMMR was used to find protein domains, with respect to the predicted function.
Wet Lab The team focused on beta-glucosidase, endoglucanase, and beta-xylanase for the cellulose and hemicellulose degradation pathway. The genes were optimized for expression within E. coli, and once all were modified, the team submitted them for synthesis at Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Each were cloned into the pET26b(+) expression vector system. pET26b(+) encodes a pelB sequence at the N-terminus of the protein of interest which is responsible for localization of the protein of interest to the periplasm. From the periplasm, soluble proteins are able to diffuse into the surrounding environment or are secreted. Once successfully cloned, the team aimed to characterize beta-xylanase. Beta-xylanase, is a key enzyme in the hemicellulose degradation pathway that cleaves xylose dimers to usable xylose"

We localized contraceptive production because we were informed that drugstores and hospitals are far away for women in rural areas. We will use discreet packaging for our product because several women are worried about being seen using birth control in stigmatized areas. We are also researching ways to get our product to market in several countries by collaborating with Family Planning 2020 and Population Council. Given that our yeast needs a food source, we collaborated with the ITESG research team and engineered our yeast to survive off upcycled dairy waste. Through our conversations, we determined that women even in rural areas have high accessibility to milk-producing animals, which makes our milk-surviving yeast plausible for most areas worldwide.

Collaborations
We would like to thank our collaborators for their help with various elements of our project.
Manchester iGEM provided us with a version of their model that could be modified and applied to our project. While we decided to use our in-house developed model, we have learnt valuable lessons from analysing their models and discovering how they could be adapted to our needs.
Sheffield iGEM and Cardiff iGEM participated in our efforts to educate and inform sixth formers from around the country in our open day, and invited us to travel to their universities to present our project. This provided us insight into how our presentations could be simplified and gave us valuable practice in presentation skills.

In an attempt to answer this question, we consulted various stakeholders in biosensor development: both in and outside the field of synthetic biology, from the early research stage to end-users.

About the Sensynova Framework
Overview
In this project, it is proposed that modularity, and therefore the ability to use parts “off-the-shelf” without further genetic engineering, could be improved by splitting components of biosensors into different cells which communicate to coordinate responses. The orthogonal quorum sensing systems Rhl and Las will be used as biological “wires”, linking different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together.
Background Information
Multicellular systems
The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. (2011) have previously suggested that the use of synthetic quorum sensing circuits enables each cell to be considered an independent logic gate, which may rectify the “fuzzy logic” seen in some biosensors, where stochastic cellular processes may produce false positive results. Another advantage of splitting biosensors into separate cells is that it reduces the load on any one cell. If one cell is required to express the entire biosensor system on a high copy number plasmid like pSB1C3, then resources in the cell can become limited and cell growth rates can become problematic. By splitting the network into thirds and expressing them in different cells, then no one cell is required to deal with that level of stress.

The concept of biosensors in a multicellular environment was described by  Wang and co-workers in (2013). Wang and co-workers used genetic logic gates in multiple cells to integrate signals from the detection of multiple analytes to one output. They used this concept to design a three-input heavy-metal biosensor, which produced a signal only in the presence of mercury, arsenic,"

Our sensor has the potential to reduce the mortality rates of all kinds of diseases through early diagnosis. We investigated how it would be used effectively in a clinical environment.
In addition, we discussed our design with as many experts and members of the general public as possible - so we could get their opinions and, at the same time, improve public understanding about synthetic biology and its possibilities in the field of diagnostics.
Engagement
Synthetic biology is incredible. We took every opportunity to teach others about it and our project. We have hosted regular events to engage the public in our work, iGEM and synthetic biology. This year we had a stand at a number of open days, gave several talks, held an iGEM open evening and also held numerous workshops for younger boys at our school. Additionally, we created a guide for high schools entering iGEM based off our own experiences and those of other teams who completed our survey.
See our engagement and high schools guide for more details.
Clinical Implementation
Our project is a diagnostic tool. We looked into how our sensor could improve current cancer diagnostics and be applied as a screening tool.
We produced a survey which was filled out by 16 doctors, including oncologists, gastroenterologists and respiratory consultants. You can view a more precise breakdown of the responses here .
Several problems with cancer diagnostics methods were raised by these doctors. In particular, NSCLC was described as difficult to detect. Late presentation of symptoms was identified as the biggest challenge in its diagnosis. This played a role in our decision to choose NSCLC as our tool could"

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

Figure 3: The effect of using an optical spacer - an empty space between the lenses and the solar cell - and using a layer of glass, as we did. The layer of glass disturbs the focal point of the lenses, therefore we are not able to improve the solar cells.
Unfortunately we are not able yet to place our lenses in a structured array that is rigid enough to place it onto a solar cell with an optical spacer in between. This would be an essential future study if we want to further develop a technique where we want to improve solar cells. This is also applicable to our microlenses in optics and microscopy. For now, we have shown that our microlenses do not have any detrimental effects on the efficiency of solar cells. Most likely, this will also be the case for applications of our microlenses in optics. However, when we want to research improving solar cells or microscopy using our biolenses, we should first invest time into developing a technique to make a structured microlens array that is able to be placed onto a solar cell with an optical spacer in between.

Discussion and Conclusions
From the experiments where we transformed E. coli with BolA, we can conclude that we were successfully able to control cell shape and produce spherical biological lenses. Biolenses with a spherical phenotype have an advantage over Biolenses with the rod-shaped E. coli phenotype, as for the round lenses, the orientation of the lens does not matter. The spherical cells we produced had an increased diameter compared to wildtype E. coli. The diameter of 1 µm that we observed matches the size of a photovoltaic cell, the smallest unit of a solar panel. Conventional microlenses are usually bigger. Therefore, our method of producing microlenses has an advantage over the conventional production, since we are able to produce far smaller lenses. Smaller lenses also means we can put more lenses on a surface, which increases the focusing effect.
In high-precision optics, it is important that all microlenses have the same shape and size. Although the size of our lenses was relatively homogeneous, there was still a significant error of 1% between the sizes of the lenses. We could solve this by sorting and selecting cells of various sizes using FACS. This would be a good future study to conduct.
Before we can use our Biolenses in real-world conditions, we need to sterilize them. The lenses contain a core of live bacteria that are carrying antibiotic resistance"

Summary of interview
After some interviews regarding biofilm as a health issue we were curious about how biofilm is a problem in other industries, especially the aquaculture industry. By doing an interview we could discover other pros and cons about biofilm, and which aspects that should be considered for a solution at such production sites.
We had a telephone interview with Hanne Tobiassen, the quality manager in SalMar in Norway. SalMar is one of the world´s largest and most efficient producers of farmed salmon. She works on making sure the product is safe for consumers by monitoring every part of the production chain. She is very familiar with biofilm, and told us that it is a challenge to avoid biofilm formation on equipment in the factory. Cleanliness is a big priority at the facility, and it is something they do on a daily basis. The humidity levels at the facility are relatively high which increases the risk of bacterial growth. SalMar’s measures against biofilms per now are good cleaning and maintenance procedures, quality equipment and communication with distributors. There are many stages in the production, and it is a problem to make sure that they avoid biofilm formation in any of the steps. For a future solution there would probably need to be several biofilm reducing products that can be used for each step, because the production in total is very complex.
Hanne told us that the main enemy is the Listeria bacteria. Listeria bacteria is a bacteria that is almost everywhere in nature. Listeria rarely cause infections, but when the amount of bacteria is significant it can cause illness especially for people with weak immune systems There is some research on this bacteria in particular, to understand if it arrives to the factory with the fish or if it appears under production. Apart from the problems with pathogenic bacteria, Hanne told us that there is some future concerns about the development of resistance against disinfectants used for cleaning. It would be a major issue in the future if the cleaning steps fail to work. Even when the biofilm only consists of non-pathogenic bacteria it can still affect the welfare of the fish and may cause negative changes to the end product. Hanne is sure in her answer when she said that there is a need for more measures and research to avoid the formation of bio"

Synechocystis conjugation BioBricks
Carbon fixation BioBrick
SynECO2
Introduction
CO2 emissions have recieved a lot of attention in modern times, due to concerns that high emission levels are facilitating global warming. Consequently, a lot of research is focused on ways of reducing CO2 emissions from industry, and ways of fixating atmospheric CO2 at a greater than normal rate.
Our project is attempting to produce a plasmid, which when placed inside photosynthetic bacteria, increases their rate of CO2 fixation. In order to achieve this, we first need to construct BioBricks that allow inducible expression of non native genes in our chassis; Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, when assembled.
Making a Synechocystis compatible vector
In order to start working with Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we have to construct a plasmid that will allow insertion of foreign genes into the Synechocystis genome. As Synechocystis does not retain inserted plasmids, transformations must make use of conjugation in order to make the insert part its genome. The flank sequences have been chosen such that they are homologous to a pair of sequences in a neutral site of the Synechocystis genome. When this plasmid is transformed into Synechocystis, the DNA between the two flank sequences is conjugated into its genome.
The first thing we needed to do was to isolate the flanking sequences from Synechocystis. This was accomplished by use of 'colony PCR', where the genome of Synechocystis was used as a template. We designed primers so that we would only amplify our desired flanking sequences.
After verifying that our PCR amplified flanking sequences had the right sequence, we wanted to test them. The flanking sequences were tested by"
Harvard,2008,Team:Harvard#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". oneidensis MR-1 would be alleviated by the addition of IPTG. That is, the addition if IPTG to such a system would induce current production as the bacteria would begin breaking down lactate.
In this experiment, we tested the following combinations:
1. wt S. oneidensis MR-1 + lactate
2. mtrB knock-out S. oneidensis MR-1 with lactate
3. mtrB (with high Lac promoter) with lactate and IPTG
4. mtrB (with high Lac promoter) with lactate
We expected combination 1 to be highest, peaking between 100 to 200 microAmps. Combination 2 would set the baseline for the mtrB knock-out strain, usually peaking at 20 to 25 percent of wt S. oneidensis MR-1’s level. If the introduction of mtrB on a lactose-inducible system was successful, then combination 3 would also be high, roughly around the level of wt S. oneidensis MR-1. Combination 4, however, would be expected to peak around the mtrB knock-out strain’s current level as it did not receive IPTG and would not be induced.
As expected, wt S. oneidensis MR-1 and the mtrB knock-out strain reached their expected levels. Interestingly, combination 4, but not combination 3, reached current levels around 200 microAmps, even greater than wt S. oneidensis MR-1’s level. That is, the engineered mtrB knock-out S. oneidensis MR-1 that did not receive IPTG resulted in elevated current production. The temporal dynamics of the curve was what we would expect from IPTG induction. That is, a delay would be observed as IPTG induction took place turning on the promoter relative to the non-inducible wt S. oneidensis MR-1.
A possible, and exciting, explanation for this observance may stem from the fact that the repressor used in our engineered strain had an LVA tag which marks it for degradation. As the experiment progressed, the repressor proteins in combination 4 may have degraded, which allowed for lactate breakdown and thus current production. The implication is that if the current production observed is due to the degradation of the repressor protein, then we successfully complemented the mtrB knock-out. We must note that if this were the case, then we should have seen an increase in all strains of the engineered mtrB knock-out if the repressor protein"

Health Effects from Water Contaminated with Arsenic and Naphthalene
Our Project and Your Health
Arsenic and naphthalene are known human health and environmental hazards. Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is linked to several types of cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and numerous other health problems worldwide (Abernathy et al., 1999). Naphthalene ingestion is linked to hemolytic anemia, cataracts, and liver and kidney damage (National Pesticide Information Center, 2008). Oil sands production is a rapidly growing enterprise,so monitoring arsenic and naphthalene in affected waterways is increasingly important (Environmental Health Perspectives, 2009).
Health studies have begun on local residents in close proximity to oil sands sites who may be ingesting fresh water, fish, or wildlife with high levels of arsenic or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including naphthalene. In the case of Fort Chipewyan, CA, a small town along the Athabasca River, the local population was shown to have a much higher rate of rare forms of life-threatening cancer than expected. A contributing factor may have been “levels of arsenic, mercury and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are higher than would be considered safe"" according to Kevin Timoney a researcher part of the  study of the Chipewyan First Nation. At the moment there is a clear lack of information, or method to accurately and continuously monitor major water sources for contamination or leaks of potentially harmful toxins. This has serious implications for local populations in affected areas. Such a tool would undoubtedly have uses globally to monitor our water supply and keep populations safe from water poisoned with arsenic or poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Local residents near heavy oil sands extraction are growing increasingly concerned about their water becoming contaminated by heavy metals"
Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#JoannaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," jam-packed day today was! In the morning, Heather and I met our two interns for the next couple of weeks - Artemis and Neoreet. Extra hands on deck are always a cause to celebrate, and we were happy to welcome them on board. After a quick round of introductions, they got straight to work and so did we. Then, in the afternoon, Orit came to visit and we did our first official team stand-up presentation. We determined our timeline and current goals for the week, and discussed our progress and accomplishments thus far. All in all, it was a very successful meeting, and even better, I finally got GAE to work with HTML and javascript! Cue the trumpets for success!
Our new interns hard at work.
Tuesday, 7/2: Today I spent my time working on the pop-up menu for our website. Since I had coded up a test file last week, I was pretty sure implementing the code into our actual html file would be relatively straightforward. However, that did not turn out to be the case. The actual pop-up went in easily enough, but it was coordinating the train of events that proved to be a hassle. While long hours were spent slaving over this problem, I'm glad to say that not soon after work ended, I was able to figure it out!
Wednesday, 7/3: After the success of last night, I was eager to have a repeat experience as I sat down and started working on our code. For today, I was determined to improve the look and feel of our website, and decided to spend some time looking into fade transitions. At first, I thought this was something I could accomplish in javascript, but it turns out that jquery is a much easier and better option. The examples I searched up seemed simple enough, but of course the actual implementation made me want to rip my hair out. Ultimately though, success smiled upon me again, and now the transitions are working as expected!
Thursday. 7/4: Happy July 4th! Today, the HCI lab was given the day off and I spent a wonderful night with my friends over the Charles River watching the Boston fireworks. The city backdrop was gorgeous and the waterfront absolutely beautiful. What a fantastic day to celebrate America's birthday!
Friday, 7/5: Today, the HCI lab was graciously given an extra day off as well. I took advantage of this to ride the commuter rail into Wellesley Hills and their local UPS store. As mentioned last Monday, my laptop met an untimely demise (all right, it wasn't a complete demise,"
Harvard,2017,Team:Harvard#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," selectivity for the substrates that are secreted (Goyal et al., 2014). CsgG and csgE participate in the translocation of csgF into the extracellular matrix, which then folds and binds csgG to the membrane. Meanwhile, csgC interacts with csgA and csgB monomers to prevent the formation of oligomers (Taylor and Matthews 2015). When the monomers interact with csgE, they become trapped in the periplasmic cavity and are transported across the outer membrane. CsgB then interacts with csgF to initiate the nucleation of csgA fibers.

Diffusion
The rate of translocation of proteins from the periplasm to the extracellular matrix will be assumed to follow Fick's first law of diffusion:  $$ J = -D \nabla \phi $$ Here, \(J\) represents the ""diffusion flux"", or diffusion per unit area per unit time, \(D\) is the diffusion coefficient, which we will take from literature, and \(\nabla"

Project Goals
Develop the prototype of an easily an automated liquid handling system that satisfy the following constraints
Low Cost – Cost significantly lower than $10,000.
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible
Hardware Design that is easily replicable  by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM team.
Achievements of Goals
We have developed BioBrick-A-Bot Model C, which satisfy all the goals listed above, as follows
Low Cost – Cost under $700. Require 2 NXT Kit ($278 each), Wooden Frame ($30 materials) and RobotC ($50).
Hardware Platform – We selected Lego Mindstorm NXT Kit which is the industrial standard  and is easily available.
Hardware Design – We provide detail instructions of how BioBrick-A-Bot is built, so that other iGEM team can build it.  We checked in the Hardware Design document into iGEM registry.
Software Design is robust, plug and play. We introduce a new concept called LegoBioBrick which consist of a LegoNXT Brick connected to 1-3 motors, doing a specific  tasks in BioBrick assembly. The software should be flexible enough to plug-and-playmultiple LegoBioBrick instances build by different iGEM teams, with different physical dimensions and geometric dimensions. 2 prototype instances, ALPHA-120 and ALPHA-90 are developed to proof the point.
We implemented BioBrick-A-Bot using 2 LegoBioBrick modules ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a frame BETA which can communicate well with each other using Master Slave Synchornization.  A demonstration of its functionality by transferring colored dyes on a 96-well plate is provided. We made the software open-source, so that other iGEM team can easily replicate BioBrick-A-Bot or extend its functionality by adding additional modules. In the next version of (BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0) we will also add another module called MU, which is a Movement Utility.

COMPOSITE PARTS
Targeting GFP brick
Description: This targeting sequence consist in the large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase enzyme, RuBisCO, ( BBa_K1113701 ) attached with a flexible linker ( BBa_K105012 ) to the superfolder GFP ( BBa_I746916 ) under the regulation of the pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ) and includes a RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The targeting sequence is constructed to deliver the fluorescence to the Carboxysome under the induction with L-arabinose. Since this is a targeting sequence, in order to work it needs to be expressed in the presence of the Carboxysome, ( BBa_K1113100 ).
This part was constructed with a mutation in the Prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”), which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly. This part it’s also constructed on the pSB4K5 standard vector.
The large subunit of RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley).
Carboxysome brick
Description: This Carboxysome operon includes 10 genes necessaries for the expression of the microcompartment: the large and small ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase enzyme"

The Genetic Limiter
To build a genetic limiter, we employ the tools of a synthetic biologist and cybernetician.  Defined by Dr. Norbert Wiener in 1948, cybernetics is the study of systems of regulation and control.  Regulatory elements can be studied and modeled in the abstract, whether their manifestation is mechanical, electrical biological, natural or synthetic.  Our limiter circuit is an example of a complex device built from smaller parts whose internal complexity can be abstracted away in the mode of the synthetic biologist.  We began by devising the logical control network that results in threshold regulation of an element outside of its boundaries.
Leading to the limiter
Consider a gene of interest (G) for which one inducing transcription factor (A) is known (Fig. 1).  In the presence of unnaturally-heightened levels of inducer A, our gene will experience excessive activation.  A logical method for addressing this problem would be to introduce an inhibitor for the gene of interest to attenuate its presence or activity.  Traditional pharmaceutical interventions either block the activity of the protein encoded by gene G, causing interference on the level of protein interactions, or make changes upstream then can arrest expression of gene G.  One concern that arises with the use of a chemical input is that, especially in the case of multi-cellular organisms, this often has diffuse, unspecified, and often undesirable effects.  Drugs that are administered to biological systems in a therapeutic context particularly require an understanding of the intricate balance between efficacy and toxicity.  An alternative may be to directly reduce the expression of gene G with an introduced transcriptional repressor.  Although a genetically-based inhibitor is more difficult to implement, such a genetic tool would afford a great deal of specificity to the system, directly repressing only the gene of interest.
If we were to introduce a repressing transcription factor (R) driven by a constitutive promoter (Fig. 2), we would see a constant amount of repression of G, independent of its level of activation.  We might face the issue that increased expression of inducer A would surpass the repressor's"
UTP-Panama,2011,Team:UTP-Panama#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," make our own project of SynBio as part of the iGEM Competition, work that led us to ask ourselves how to bring it on the best possible way, but it also appear the question of whether we were leaving something behind or if we were not covering all the aspects that we should really worry about. At this moment came the question of safety due, which made us wonder about all the institutions and agencies that should be around a draft synbio.
Then our advisors began the labor of introducing us on the issue of the implications of SynBio in all aspects of society, and they also provided reading materials as the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues Repor (PCSBI) called ""New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies""[1] or the ""Ethical Issues on Synthetic Biology""[2]. In particular, the recommendation on PCSBI left us with a some questions to solve.
From these reflections, readings and the realization of our project was born the ideas to do the outreach on synthetic biology to the inner of our university, but especially it was born from the vision of creating two tools:
a) Introducing into the field of SynBio and its basic subjects to the ones that are not familiar with this science, for which we proposed the creation of the SB UTP 1.0
b) Help people who needs to develop SynBio project at all levels, with a self-assessment tool and guidance on the most relevant aspects that you need to consider for which your project is within the regulatory, ethical, moral or institutional field, but primarily to discover what are the realities that exist around them (environment) for advancing or hindering the development of your project. Our solution for this aspect is the creation of the SB UTP PROJECT 1.0
The Problem
In our role as iGEMers, we faced many issues to develop synthetic biology in our country. Some of them were:
1. Explain and introduce what is synthetic biology at all levels of society, emphasizing the engineers.
2. Planning a synthetic biology project.
3. Be able to find all the availability of institutions and the clear regulatory frame to develop our endevour.
4. Be able to cover all the implications and possibilities that synthetic biology brings to the human civilization, both positive and negative.
Our Project
Our team's goal was to introduce and disseminate the issues and implications related to synthetic biology. To meet these objectives we developed three separate projects:
1. The development of an education campaign about synthetic biology topics inside our team, in order to achieve a campaign at the university level (engineers).
2. The development"
EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," worked well. We now own a computational tool which may assess the functionality of different gate designs (i.e different collections of transistors).
Writing the equations of logic gates starting from the basic equations of the transistor (cf. Equations ) is a long and error prone process. We therefore coded a Python program that automatically generates the set of differential equations needed to model a gate or a circuit composed of multiple gates.
Simulations for S. cerevisiae
For S. cerevisiae, we found all the necessary constants (cf. Constants ) but we didn't obtain the experimental results that are required to perform the initial fine-tuning of the model. However, with the model we set up, there is the possibility of performing the same simulations. In this case we will certainly use the case of independent binding (\(J=0\)).
