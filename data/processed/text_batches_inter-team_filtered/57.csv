St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"-pathogenic, as well as endemic to the human gut, the chances of it replicating uncontrollably outside the lab are slim, but not impossible.  If ingested, the E. coli would not pass through the population due its programmed cell death within the body.  If our bacteria were to find food and multiply, potentially on a foodstuff to be eaten by humans (e.g. German cucumbers), then mass ingestion by an individual could result in endotoxin-induced septic shock.  An important biological function to address in the presence of GEMs is horizontal gene transfer, where one bacteria transfers part of its DNA to another.  E. coli would travel to the gut of an individual, and could potentially transfer the AMP gene to endemic gut flora.  In our specific case, where the only altered gene is one that induces cell death, transfer of that gene to other bacteria would result in reduced fitness for the gene recipient.  Not only that, but AMP production would happen upon entry to the gut, and these proteins act intracellularly not only to disrupt the membrane, but also to bind to important cellular machinery and inhibit the process of cellular growth.  As the chance of horizontal gene transfer is inhibited along with decreased cellular functionality, the odds of in vivo gene transfer occurring are minimal. Released bacteria interacting with the environment is also a cause for concern.  If a GEM is released into an environment that suites colonization, it can potentially out-compete other species into extinction.  GEMs have combinations of genes that do not occur within nature, and this can result in new emergent properties that can complicate quantifying the level of risk from release.  It is also important to note, however, that GEMs are commonly less fit than their wild-type counterparts, reducing the chance of a successful colonization.  Horizontal gene transfer is a concern, but again, the reduced fitness of the gene recipient combined with the decreased functionality of plasmid transfer in the presence of AMPs makes the likelihood of repeated horizontal gene transfer.
Biosecurity
What is even harder to quantify is the security risk posed by our GEM.  Rogue individuals, groups, or states may use synthetic biology to cause harm to others for various personal gains, and its imperative that our project is viewed through the lens of a security risk, in order to better understand exactly how dangerous our project may be.  Our project is essentially creating and mastering a tool: the controlled self-induced lysis of a cell using intracellular AMP production.  Our team is using that tool as a potential method of drug delivery (amongst others discussed"

6th Asia-Pacific Conference
We have taken part in many conferences, gained many experiences and made lots of friends from another team all over the world. The largest scale of conference we have ever participated in is the Asia-Pacific Conference held by National Chungsing University from 30th July to 3th August. There are about 20 teams from China, Taiwan and Japan took part in this magnificent conference.  During this five days' meeting, all teams present their projects by PowerPoint slides and show us their posters. We are deeply impressed by several novel, innovate projects of some teams, such as BioWatcher by NCHU-Formosa, and launched several collaborations with them. We also did our best to present our project to judge, professor Que, and received many sharp but beneficial guidance opinions. Besides projects presentation and collaborations with other teams, hanging out and having fun are also important part of this conference. We had a pleasure night with iGEM Fudan, iGEM XMU-China, NCHU-Formosa and other teams, we shared funny stories and difficulties we faced during the presentation. It was a precious experiment for us to present our project to so many Asia-Pacific iGEM teams. We also learned a lot from their projects and obtained many fresh opinions. So harvesting four days!
Interview Citizens of Nanjing City
At the end of July, several members of us came to the public in Xinjiekou Business District, Xiamafang Park, Nanjing South Railway Station and other places where have high flow of people. We interviewed them about the public's views on cancer and cancer treatment. After many days of interviews, team members who participated in the interview received a lot of information. First, most of the public in the lower ages (under 25 years old) have no clear concept of cancer and cancer treatment. They don't know the difference between cancer and tumors, and they have no acquaintance with the lasted cancer treatment. Second, as people age growing, there will appear people around them who have cancer, and their knowledge about cancer will grow. Finally, as the number of interviews continues to expand, we found that middle-aged and older people have more knowledge in this area. During these days of interviews, we met the public who are curious about the project of our team. They asked the details about the current lasted cancer treatment methods, and asked the tasks and works of our team and gave us affirmation and encouragement. A school teacher who was interviewed said: ""Your project is beneficial to the whole mankind. This society"

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my"

Secondly, since the main body of case is that the two kinds of yeast cultured in the medium ,and the growth of α yeast has some effects on the growth of a yeast should also be taken into account. So the competition model and the gun battle model are established. Finally, they provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that provided information for wet experiments.
Model 1:
According to the case process we guess that : the amount of information stored (a growth time of yeast) is related to the initial inputs of two yeasts, The amount of α-factorsecreteby α yeast, and the promoting efficiency of the promoter. Therefore,  the information storage is set as the output value, and the other parameters are set as the input values.Then the partial correlation coefficient is performed to verify the accuracy of the verification and which input is most relevant to the output.
Model 2:
The relationship between the time of information storage and the amount of α factor, time, promoting efficiency, the amount of yeast, and amount of alpha yeast was determined by model 1. They divided the experiment into two parts. The first part is that:  a yeast and alpha yeast compete for growth without secretion of alpha factor. The second part is that: in the case of α-factor secretion, the two yeast growth for fighting, and the death rate of α yeast is the expression rate of Bax gene, and the expression rate of Bax gene is related to the start efficiency of the Fig2c promoter. In order to measure the efficiency of the start of the Fig2c promoter, the promoter efficiency of the promoter was measured by the amount of fluorescence by inserting the  fluorescent protein gene of EGFP.
Through the above experimental process, we have established two mathematical models:
1)Competition model:
The change trend of OD value of yeast with time was reviewed, taking the maximum value of the slope r1=r2
2) fighting model:
They putted in different proportions of yeast and calculated the information storage time by modeling. At the same time, the ratio of yeast can be predicted by different storage times. NEFU-China provided a web-based, fully interactive modeling platform that not only provided some information for their wet experiments, but also enabled future iGEM teams to build more efficiently based on our work.
In the laboratory,our team has simulated the exhaust gas ratio which can be found in literatures .The corresponding proportion of the gas was mixed manually and the gas was injected into water to prepare an uns"

Experiment 3 (testing of the Sry detector)
The Sry detector was prepared using activation condition 1 as for the HPV detector. To validate our second detector plasmid reactions were prepared as described above.
ssSry target oligos were successfully detected with no colonies obtained in the absences of oligos.  This validates a second detector without any alterations in preparation or reaction conditions, demonstrating the versatility and ease of use of the SeeDNA system.

Specificity of the SeeDNA detector plasmids
Having demonstrated that the detectors work with a pure oligonucleotide target we wanted to evaluate its ability to detect more complex targets. We wanted to examine the detectors ability to detect its target sequence when the target is inserted in a larger piece of DNA, such as a plasmid.  In other words, to test if target sequences could be detected from a mixture of DNA fragments.  This test would reveal the system’s potential ability to pick out its target from a larger DNA sample such as the entire human genome which would be present in a clinical sample.
To examine this issue the HPV target and Sry target sequences with their flanking HaeIII sites were cloned into a plasmid (pBluescript SK II) that was unrelated to the detector plasmid (pSB1-C3) and that had a different antibiotic resistance gene.  These “target plasmids” were then digested with HaeIII to release the 55bp target sequence along with a number of other HaeIII restriction fragments.  The parental empty pBluescript plasmid was also digested in the same manner.  Uncut “target plasmids” were prepared as a an additional  control.

The parental pBluescript plasmid was also digested.  The digest of the target plasmids is expected to yield 14 fragments, one of which is the short 55/62bp target fragment.  However the actual target fragments are too small to see clearly. RIGHT) Undigested HPV and Sry target plasmids.

Ring Cleavage
This week we started a new assay where Pf-5 was incubated with naphthalene.  Since naphthalene is not volatile, GC headspace reading was not an appropriate method of measurement  to indicate decrease of the compound.  Instead we took OD600 readings to measure bacterial growth.  The original cultures were taken from a Pf-5 culture in LB and inoculated into M9-MM without glucose.  After 24 hours of growth these were subculutred into fresh M9-MM without glucose.  This was to avoid carryover of glucose from the LB.   Positive controls were also made that consisted of M9-MM with glucose and Pf-5. OD600 readings of the subcultures were taken over a period of 8 days. GC readings were done on the Pf-5 incubated with butylcyclohexane after 11 days and with toluene after 10 days. The trend remained the same as the measurements done after 5 and 6 days in the previous week.  The amount of compound decreased in the experimental cultures but the amount of compound also decreased in the abiotic standards almost in equal proportions.  With the results after 10 and 11 days we could see that the decrease was not due to the bacteria and we decided that the strain we were using did not contain the genes necessary for butylcyclohexane or toluene degradation. Throughout the week we continued the verification of XylE by performing a second colony PCR from the transformation plate using part J33204. The gel did not contain DNA of the right lengths and only the positive control worked.
Denitrification
The results of our transformation on CarAc and AntB from last week showed mostly red colonies indicating that the ligation was unsuccessful and that the PSB1C3 plasmid simply closed on itself with no insert. However, there were three colonies for CarAc that were white (cut with both X+P and E+P). Colony PCR was performed on these three colonies using biobrick primer sets to verify that the part had been inserted in these colonies, but unfortunately all PCR results were negative indicating an unsuccessful ligation.
We also performed a miniprep on Psudomonas putida strain #28 this week using a home-made protocol rather than the Qiagen kit. Miniprep A had a DNA concentration of 1539.8 ng/uL and Miniprep B had DNA concentration of 1001.2 ng/uL possibly indicating that there may have been a lot of genomic DNA contamination. However min"

We constructed the anti-MinD-24bp to box1.

Measured the β- galactosidase activity.
PROTOCOL
1.Artificial synthesis the genes
Gene synthesis is the step during which oligonucleotides (oligos) are combined into DNA fragments of several hundred bases in length. Numerous protocols have been described and extensively reviewed. In our project, we use the polymerase chain assembly (PCA) to synthetic ipgC, InvF, sicA and mixE.
We finished the gene synthesis of ipgC, mxiE, exsC, sicA* and invF.They have be proved to have the correct sequence.
First, we disassemble target gene into several oligos using GENE DESIGN, and we synthesis these oligos in GENEWIZ.
Then, the oligos that are synthesized to build the target gene. The pool of oligos is assembled in equimolar amounts and allowed to anneal. The annealed oligos are extended in the 3' direction until the end of their partner oligo is reached. The double-stranded DNA is melted and reannealed with extension products and any remaining oligos. Each extension reaction results in progressively longer products and full length products are eventually synthesized. At this step, the terminal oligos are added to the reaction and full length products from the previous reactions are amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned and sequenced.

2.One-step Site-directed Mutagenesis
We insert target sequence into plasmid to construct our desired synthetic small RNAs. Our protocol is rather simple. We just use PCR to perform it, one-step site-directed mutagenesis. In our experiments, we used it many times. For instance, one of steps is that we inserted ipgc sequence into Box2 (blue target in Fig. 2-1).
IPGC sequence is ATGTCTTTAAATATCACCGAAAAT
To construct box2 for testing silencing effect, we should insert the 24-nt-long sequence ATGTCTTTAAATATCACCGAAAAT between the RBS and the lacZ gene. (Fig. 2)

UNAM-CU,2015,Team:UNAM-CU#project_-_-_TEXT.html," puts together the Trg periplasmic domain with the EnvZ citoplasmic domain.
As a consequence, this chimera is able to bind GGBP when the latter is bound to its ligand and this causes a conformational change that activates the EnvZ citoplasmic domain, which in turn activates the transcription factor OmpR activating the expression of any gene under the OmpC promoter sequence.
Insulin
Insulin is a peptidic hormone with many important roles in many organisms’ physiology with short and long term effects. It is produced mainly in the pancreas by beta pancreatic cells, and its active structure is composed of two peptidic chains (A and B) linked by two disulfide bonds; its structure also contains an intrachain disulfide bond within the A chain.
Insulin is began synthesized as preproinsulin, a single peptidic chain with a secretion signal that translocates it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where this signal is proteolyzed before the protein’s translation is finished. Once in the ER, the protein can be folded and the disulfide bonds can be made due to the ER’s oxidative environment. Since the hormone is going to be released to the extracellular matrix, it is involved in a secretion pathway through secretory vesicles, where an intermediate aminoacid sequence is proteolyzed by a carboxypeptidase, giving rise to the final and functional structure of the hormone.
Insulin's MW is about 9kDa when it is still as proinsulin and about 6kDa when it is functional
TAT secretion system
Many secretion systems exist in all organisms, in bacteria, we can find two main pathways by which proteins are secreted to the media.
In the first one (Mediated by TolC transmembrane protein), proteins are translocated to the periplasmic environment as they are being folded; this mechanism is not fully understood, but it has been seen that it can form disulfide bonds within proteins
In the second one (TAT secretion system), proteins are folded in the bacterial cytoplasm and then they are translocated to the periplasm by means of a TatABC transmembrane complex
The model
Due to the complexity of the system we want to develop and test, it is extremely interesting to predict how it will behave in different contexts, and that’s why it is important to involve mathematical modeling in the project.
The modeling can be related to a lot of parts of the system, such as the bacterial populations"

This protocol is based off in-house protocols created by previous Waterloo iGEM members and revised over the years by advisors and experienced users.
Figure 1 shows that both RFP and GFP are fluorescing, though at different intensities. Overall, GFP's intensity data averages at 502 intensity units and RFP's intensity data averages at 139 intensity units. This means that GFP fluoresces approximately 3.5x more intensely than RFP. Figure 2 shows the frequency at which cells fluoresce at a particular intensity for GFP on the right and RFP on the left. In all, further experiments can provide more precise measurements of GFP and RFP fluorescence, but we present here adequate fluorescence data for other teams to understand the behavior of the Dual Colour Plasmid in a DH5α chassis.
Figure 1. A Comparison of GFP and RFP expression from the Dual Colour Plasmid
Figure 2. Frequency of GFP and RFP Intensity Measurements
In other characterization experiments detailed with BBa_K1645999, we realized the RFP's promoter (BBa_R0010) has a LacI binding site meaning that expression of our Dual Colour Plasmid in a chassis that produces the lac repressor will require induction with IPTG or lactose. For induction protocols with the this part, please refer to the details found with BBa_K1645999.
sgRNA-RFP Targeting
This part is an sgRNA from the CRISPRi system and is designed to provide (d)Cas9 the specificity to target the promoter of BBa_I20260. It can be used with Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and related variants. Here, we use it in conjunction with flow cytometry to demonstrate its ability to repress RFP expression. It has been characterized through numerous experiments presented in the next section.
We performed a series of experiments to demonstrate that this sgRNA when used with a dCas9 protein is able to repress RFP fluorescence when compared to controls.
To produce the data, we inoculated the appropriate E. coli strains into LB and grew it for 4hr to an OD600 of 0.4, followed by induction with IPTG at a final concentration of 1mM for 6hr. For negative controls, we did not add IPTG. Next, we diluted the culture four-fold into chilled formalin (1"

What are you doing?
This year the Imperial College London 2016 iGEM team created two original pieces of integrated human practices work. The first is a new approach to employing the sociological process known as “reflexivity” in an iGEM project. The second is a visual strategy for communication about foundational technologies and basic research that, most importantly, impacted two visualisation pieces we presented at the New Scientist Live event.
First of all, pursuing integrated human practices means considering the ethical, social, legal, or environmental dimension of a project and then incorporating such dimensions into the work of the project. Teams participating in the foundational track of the iGEM competition are often limited to talking to other scientists about their work because of the degree of technicality and lack of immediate application to the “real world”. That is not to say that foundational teams do not need to consider wider implications of their work. Decisions made on a day-to-day basis in a project can have significant consequences inside as well as outside the lab and reflecting on those decisions can uncover broader societal concerns which would otherwise go unnoticed.  This process has been termed by social scientists as “reflexivity.” Our team decided to build on our knowledge of reflexivity, formalise our approach and implement a customised version of the Socio-Technical Integration Research protocol (S.T.I.R.) .  We are the first iGEM team to employ the protocol.  We are the first to do it without a sociologist present to employ the protocol.
Making S.T.I.R. Work
Reflexivity is a difficult concept to grasp and even more difficult to employ without a formalised approach.  S.T.I.R. is designed to take the form of a structured, cyclic discussion which takes place with members of a lab about decisions made over the course of a research project.   We made the protocol more useful for iGEM teams to employ themselves with our own, custom approach to the protocol.  The unaltered discussions that result from S.T.I.R. are organized as follows:
One is presented with an opportunity, or something that requires a decision to be made.
Its scope is further considered through background research and the shared experiences of the group’s members.

3. FINE electrode:
The flat-interface nerve electrode (FINE) was designed for selective nerve recording by realigning the fascicles and reshaping the nerve into a more flattened cross section which increases the surface area of the exposed nerve and offers greater access to fascicles. This kind of electrode is particularly interesting as it was possible to achieve more than 90% selectivity [3] (Cf. Figure 2)
Figure 2: Cross section and schematic of a FINE electrode[4]
II. Information extraction:
1. Extraction of the discharge frequency:
The most relevant information to extract is the discharge frequency of active fibers because it represents the means of coding information by the nervous system. Significantly, such processing must be applied to signals representing the activity of a limited number of fibers. In fact, the published examples relate exclusively to intra-neural collection: the only method, today, which allows to observe the activity of fibers alone. However, since we don’t want to use intra-neural electrode in our device we will not detail how to extract the discharge frequency.
2. Envelope extraction [5]:
Rectification and Bin-Integration (RBI) of the nerve raw signal is widely used in rehabilitation application. This point of RBI ENG is found by calculating the average of the absolute value of ENG samples spread over a given period of time. This period is called “bin” and its value depends on the application. It ranges from 10 ms to 200 ms. The smoothed envelope-like signal created by RBI makes it easy to extract information about the innervated organ.
III. Improvement of the electroneurogram records selectivity
1. ENG-EMG selectivity [6]:
The body is made so that a nerve is never very far from a muscle. However, the triggering and control of muscle contractions use a similar mechanism to the propagation of nerve impulses. Thus, the vicinity of a muscle is the seat of important extracellular currents because of the large number of muscle fibers excited simultaneously. The potential differences associated with these currents are called EMG, for electromyogram. Action potentials in muscle have mV amplitude, larger than a neural signal, and their spectra overlap. Minimizing these forms of interference is there for essential.
In order to attenuate the EMG signal, tripolar cuff electrode are used (Cf. Figure 3). For the nerve signal, the main point of the cuff is that it reduces"

In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html,". Also, although Scotland is a small country of 5 million people, we have 14 geographical health boards. So if you were doing multi-centre clinical trials, you would have to go through a separate process for each of the health boards, whereas now there is a single point of entry and approval. So that’s positive.
In Edinburgh, they have their own research and innovation company, which helps to spin out companies from university, which has a very impressive success rate. For example, since 1969 the university has created more than 262 spin out companies. Now that’s an impressive number, but the real test is whether those companies have been able to sustain the business, you can start up a company and then it doesn’t fly, for whatever reason. The success rate has been 81% of those companies. I was surprised when I saw those figures; I thought that there would be a much higher attrition or failure rate. But 81% are still trading. Of that 81%, 89% are still in Scotland.
J: So Scotland is providing quite a good base for setting up business.
A: We heard from academics at the University that there was a feeling that if Scotland became independent people would lose funding which was coming from the UK.
JE: Let me address that point. The issue is that Scotland punches above its weight in terms of scientific research, and citations in scientific papers for a country of our size. At the moment Scotland gets more than our population share from the UK research funding pots. So if we think about the Medical Research Council, the Bio-Technological Council, the suggestion is that if Scotland were independent we would no longer be eligible for those. The response is that the Scottish government is absolutely working on this to make sure that that research funding is sustained after independence. We think that it would still be attractive. People want to collaborate across borders, be that within the UK or within Europe, there are also European funding pots that Scottish institutions are able to access. We will have a more definitive response on that when the government publishes its white paper for the referendum, around November time. We will need to put the reassurances in place, and the government has appointed the former principles of one of the Universities in Scotland to look at that.
A: Scotland has one of the best Universities in the world; do you think that people would still be attracted to come to Scotland if it weren’t part of the UK?
JE: I think that people want to do good, high quality research, and those opportunities exist in Scotland. It is necessary to ensure that the universities are funded properly,"

Overall, while there are very promising projects, it looks like they most of them have been abandoned at early stages, after the initial limited success. The PublicLab spectrometer stands out here, has build instructions, is open-source, and can be purchased as a kit.

Design
DI-lambda is an ​Open Hardware spectrophotometer, designed to be accurate, easy to modify, and extremely cheap. We achieve this by using LEDs instead of an optical refraction system.
This design choice (Fig. 5) means that the device is limited to one or a few pre-selected wavelengths, but most biological applications only use a few. It is also possible to select a different wavelength by populating a spare LED board, but since it's so cheap, it might be easier to just buy one for each task. Another disadvantage is large spectral width of LEDs, typically 15-25nm, compared to 1-5 nm for traditional spectrophotometers.
All this means that DI-lambda is not always able to replace a traditional spectrophotometer, but works great for a majority of biological applications.

Accuracy
We put a lot of time into calibrating our spectrophotometer. After tuning parameters, such as the distance between the LED, the sensor, and the cuvette, and the diameter of the pinhole through which the light has to pass, we achieve results that are virtually identical to our most reliable"

The plate was incubated at 30°C in a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader with 200 rpm shaking in between reads, and OD600 was monitored every 15 minutes. The data obtained from each six-plicate was averaged, and error bars were constructed using the standard deviations at each time point.
Conclusions
- 1% curdlan does not appear to present any additional toxicity over the 0.5M NaOH solvent.
- Curdlan seems to be not toxic for our markers.
Perspectives
This assay is a good news for us but we have to go deeper into our safety tests. A good way to do that is to test the toxicity of our curdlan on Mammal cells and test a bigger quantity of curdlan (up to 10%)

Kilobots
What are Kilobots?
Kilobots are small robots designed by the Self-Organizing Research Group at Harvard University to operate in large groups[ 5 ]. When programmed, the kilobots can cooperate through local interactions to perform collective behaviors such as swarming and self-assembly. They can flash LED lights, transmit and receive electronic signals to and from each other, and move using two vibration modules. For our purposes, we only need to use the LED light to report robot response.
Why model with Kilobots?
With their simple design, we hope to produce complex collective behavioral models that mimic our yeast circuits. By programming Kilobots to behave as our yeast cells, we hope to produce predicted community responses such as converging or diverging behaviors.
In our models, we utilized their ability to sense and secrete signals to produce community responses. A Kilobot can be in one of five states: NONE*, LOW, MED, HIGH, or MAX, which describe how frequently the cell transmits signals. A Kilobot’s state may vary depending on its program and the states of nearby Kilobots.
A Kilobot’s internal state is reported using its LEDs, which correspond to the following key:
None - Blue
Low - Cyan
Medium - White
High - Orange
Maximum - Red
*Kilobots in the NONE state send signals at a very low frequency; this is so that if isolated, the Kilobot will still be able to self-signal.
Circuit Components
i_sense_rand_bar
This code allows Kilobots (yeast cells) to sense and transmit electronic signals (mating factor alpha) that will influence other Kilobots’ states and may influence its own state (self-sensing). The Kilobots are randomized into different initial states, representing different initial constitutive expressions. There are five possible states, which describe the Kilobot’s output: NONE* [blue], LOW [cyan], MED [white], HIGH [orange], and MAX [red]. At each state, the cell lights up in the assigned color and transmits signals [value = 0] at the assigned frequency, NONE being the lowest level of frequency and MAX being highest. If a Kilobot senses enough signals transmitted by other Kilobots, it will go up in stage to the next highest level (so from NONE to LOW to MED to HIGH to MAX), until it reaches the MAX stage, at which point"

Le répresseur LacI réprime le promoteur pLac de l’opéron lactose d’E.coli. Donc le répresseur LacI et cette BioBrick sont très fiables pour le contrôle de l’expression d’un gène en utilisant le promoteur pLac. En fait quand LacI n’est pas exprimé, pLac est activé, et quand LacI est exprimé, pLac est inhibé. Un système induisant la transcription de LacI peut facilement être créé en utilisant un autre opéron comme l’opéron tétracycline et cré  un mécanisme de rétrocontrôle pour l’inhibition de pLac et donc pour l’inhibition de  l’expression d’un gène.

Overview
Microtubule
Flagellar Filament
Overview
Although there has been a lot of previous work focusing on the in vitro assembly of microtubules and flagellar filaments, no attempt has been made to assemble them on a cell’s surface. Therefore, we developed mathematical models to explore the possible dynamics of this process and to guide the experiments in wet lab.
One key problem in both the microtubule part and flagellar filament part of our design is the competition between the assembly of monomers on the yeast surface and that in the solution. How can we adjust our experimental parameters such as initial monomer concentration to promote the polymerization on the yeast surface as much as possible and avoid the same process in the solution? Will we be able to obtain enough polymers on the yeast surface to satisfy our needs? Our models gave a positive answer and also provided guidance to optimize the outcome in experiments.
There are differences between these two kinds of polymers as well. The most significant one is that depolymerization is prominent in the assembly of microtubule, but does not play an important role in the assembly of flagellar filaments. This led us to use different models to describe them. To capture the dynamic instability of microtubules, we used the stochastic chemical reaction model combined with Monte Carlo simulation method. The polymerization of flagellar filaments can be described with the law of mass action and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, so we chose ordinary differential equations to model it.
Another key difference between the two polymers is our purpose. We want to use the displayed microtubules to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents (which inhibit microtubule depolymerization by curbing GTP hydrolysis), so we closely examined the effect of different GTP hydrolysis rate on microtubule assembly. We plan to use flagellar filaments to expand the yeasts’ capacity to display enzymes, so we used our model to predict the possible magnitude of this expansion.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#LargePhage#Springexp#Period2#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," -  We left the plates in the incubator for 48 hours, which caused contamination on many plates to grow.
When checked at 24 hours, the T4 mutagenized stock had a web plate at 10^-3 and less than 5 plaques at 10^-6. This experiment will need to be redone from 10^0 down through 10^-6.  The whole mutagenesis may need to be redone if this only represents a dilution of our titer when we were trying to grow it in liquid culture. (We infected with ___ mL of phage at ___ titer in ____ vol of resuspended bacteria.)
Under UV light, the T4Do stock (diluted to 10^-6) has 19 plaques after being irradiated for six minutes (down from almost cleared at 0 min). Under UV light, the 180 sec UV plate spot (diluted in 1 mL) has a few hundred plaques on it, but the amount dropped significantly at 4 min 30 sec from when it was UV-ed for 0 min.
We will re-titer the T4-Mut stock so we can learn whether it was diluted or whether an infection worked. We will also re-run the UV test comparing the T4-Mut (10^-3) with the T4-Do stock (at 10^-6) for survivability. The mutagenized phage should survive better.
Since the loss of plaques seemed to level off for the T4Do stock at 5:15 (23 plaques) and 6 min (19 plaques), we will test a 7 min and 8 min timepoint to see if it stays level, suggesting these phage have multiple genomes and are severely mutated.

Ionis_Paris,2016,Team:Ionis Paris#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"By modifying the genetic construction, the targeted pollutant can be changed, as well as the sensitivity of the biosensor (the amplitude of its response to a given stimulus). This was demonstrated by the 2009 Cambridge iGEM team in their E. chromi project [14].  The purpose of that project was to create kits of parts that would help the design and construction of future biosensors.
Another major advantage of biosensors is their ability to detect several environmental signals simultaneously and integrate them into different outputs (for example, different bioluminescence colors or fluorescence emissions). This can be achieved by using a single whole cell biosensor consisting of multiple different sensors and reporters or several different whole cell biosensors include in the same device each having a single sensor and reporter system.
Since biosensors use cellular machinery they do not require any other energy input than water, sugar and salt and are more convenient to use compared with conventional chemical methods. This fact presents a major advantage compared to actual pollution detection systems which are energy and water consumers [13]. When deployed in sealed containers biosensors are very suitable for field applications as they are more easily transportable than electronic measurement devices. Thus, accurate and sensitive whole cell biosensors for pollutant detection and quantification provide useful alternatives to direct analytical methods because of their low cost, rapid response, reproducibility, and ease of production. [15]
In addition, living cells give not only analytical information but also functional information on the effect of a stimulus on an organism. Whereas traditional analytical chemistry does not distinguish the different forms (ionic, inert forms) of a pollutant, biosensors make a difference between available and inert, unavailable to biological system forms. Therefore, biosensors can assess the real impact of pollutants on living organisms [16] [17]. This information is important and relevant for environmental measures [18], [19].
To conclude, biosensors supply rapid and specific results at low cost and are able to detect pollutants in a highly specific manner. As they are easily transportable (minimal size, reduced weight) and integrated into other technologies, they are perfectly suitable for field measurements.  Only a few tools using biosensors are currently commercialized. For that purpose, our team had decided to realize one to detect VOCs.
Why choose Bioluminescence?
Bioluminescence has been recognized as an alternative to fluorescence [21] and has become widely preferred for quantitative bioanalysis [22]. It is assumed that the light intensity is proportional to the concentrations of the targeted molecules. [22]
In bio analysis, photon emission chemistries including fluorescence and bioluminescence are popular due to their"

Because there is not constitutive expression of  LacI protein from the plasmid cloned in E. coli carrying the CBD cipA-BMP2 construct and based on our preliminary measurements of total  protein concentration using BCA method, the transcriptional leakage can be  taken to be 0.8 and thus the balance for [CB]mRNA becomes:

2. She once went without sleep for 36 hours while remaining lucid enough to finish a 4000 word paper on the Anglo-Chinese War of 1839. Two days after this experience, she was forced to blow up 200 balloons for the Multicultural Show and then continued to host the three hour show without indicating any panic about the twelve exams that awaited her the following week. True story.

The RGB system
Figure 1. The RGB system composed of four subsystems(sensor array, circuits, resource allocator and actuators) is shown.
In our project we introduced the RGB system[1] to stain and to scent our rose using light. The RGB system mainly consists of four modules: a ‘sensor array’, ‘circuits’, a ‘resource allocator’ and ‘actuators’. The ‘sensor array’ combines 3 light sensors, Cph8*(BBa_K2598006), YF1 (BBa_K2598009) and CcasR (BBa_K2598005), which can respond to lights of different wavelengths. CcaSR can sense and be switched on by green (535nm) light. Cph8* is switched off by red (650nm) light, while YF1 is switched off by blue (470nm) light. Cph8* and CcaSR are based on phytochromes in the phycocyanobilin chromophores, which are produced by pcyA and ho1(BBa_K2598018)[3], while YF1 is based on Flavin mononucleotide(FMN) chronmophore.
To activate gene expression, the signals from the red- and blue- light sensors need to be inverted, which is done by connecting them to NOT gates in ‘circuits’. The repressor CI turns off the promoter(P) of K1F, and red light can release the inhibition effect and induce the P promoter. Respectively, the repressor PhlF turns off the promoter(PPh"

We had wild type Caulobacter CB15N mating with E. coli that has empty pMR10 plasmid in order to get a CB15N strain that has pMR10 empty plasmid in it. This strain is a better control strain compared to just CB15N strain.
Week 15-18 Sep 4-Sep 25
We did a series of biofilm assay and purify protein (esp/dspB) sample from culture supernatant and run it on the protein gel.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#LindaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". So, my strategy for now has always been trial-and-error, which is somewhat time costly, cuase though I can understand the code, I’m still a little iffy whether the program will be able to run smoothly with it. And to my surprise, as I clicked the run button in the microsoft visual studio express 2012, it actually worked! I even jumped up on my seat and put my arms up. hahaha. A couple people around me turned and looked at what I was doing (but quickly fell back to their work).
But man, that felt great. It felt as if a huge stone has been lowered (or whatever that phrase is, you know what i mean).
June 29: BU, MIT iGEM
For research today, we decided to go into Boston and hang out with MIT and BU Igem team (which is perfect b/c I didn’t have to wake up early!).
We went to see Walter Lewin’s physics lecture, and he is a very cool guy indeed. The auditorium quickly filled up and there were camera crews as well. As I listened to the lecture, it was all review for me, but he still made physics very fasinating. One thing that really attracted me the most was the fact that he was very passionate about physics. Everything was “earthshocking”. Everything was “amazing”. And the fact that the demonstrations were all related, really cool, and perfectly done was very fascinating too! He used big metal ladders, polaroid cameras, and the fact that he was so prepared/ organized was just amazing! After listening to his lecture, I really want to attend his other lectures becuase it was just so fun.
For the rest of the day, we hanged out with MIT. Of course, we waitied for a VERY LONG Chipotle line (which was soo worth it), and then visited MIT’s labs and how their iGEM team worked. MIT has a huge team (15 people or so), compared to BU (2 people. hehe). They were interested in what we’re doing and we were also interested in what their doing. And again, their labs are pretty cool. The fact that MIT has so many resources just amazes me all the time!
(ohwell. some labs don’t really like undergraduates.)
As for our group, after this long day, we decided to take a visit into Chinatown and had some bubble tea. I had a watermelon juice with grass jelly. I’ve never had that combination before but I figured that since I like both ingredients individually, they must (probs"
Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," with DLUT_China
On July 14th, we communicated with two iGEM teams from DLUT_China at Peking University. It is our great honor to invite them to come here.
The three teams introduced their projects in turn. We chose the three different tracks foundational advances, hardware and therapeutics, and shared advice from different points of view which benefited us in a major way. We’d like to thank professors Wei Ping and Zi Lihan for their specific instructions and kind help.
We then exchanged our experience in modelling, experiments and human practice and helped each other with troubleshooting. Our friends from DLUT_China then visited our lab and we talked about how to make use of the available space more efficiently.
It was a rather pleasant communication and we looked forward to further collaboration with them. Later on, we provided DLUT_China with plasmid pSB and it is our pleasure to collaborate with them.
International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition Symposium in Beijing
To communicate with the teams from universities in Beijing and seek deeper cooperation, we invited colleagues from BIT-China , BNU-China , OUC-China , Tsinghua , and UCAS-China to Peking University and hosted the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition Symposium in Beijing on August 7th 2018.
Each of the six teams presented their projects and answered questions from the audience, which to a large extent gave them ideas on refining the project both scientifically and from the engineering standpoint.
After the presentations, we had a luncheon and all the students communicated with each other freely. We came up with a number of scientific questions worth exploring. We both accepted and offered several pieces of useful advice on modelling, which helped us and our friends to better explain and predict the systems. We also talked about some particular experimental techniques, which boosted the efficiency of lab work later on.
Conference of the Chinese iGEM Community
We took part in the Conference of the Chinese iGEM Community from August 27th to August 31st 2018 in ShanghaiTech . It was a great opportunity for us to learn from hundreds of iGEMers from across China and professors from different fields.
We made the presentation on the morning of August 28th. We made great progress in various aspects including speech fluency and artistic design of the slides. We were asked several questions about the functions of the phase separation system, which shed light on our experiments and reminded us of some potential new applications.
A total of 63 wonderful presentations and excellent posters in the following days took us on a brilliant tour of synthetic biology. We communicated, we doubted, we thought and"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html," modern technology unavoidably influences our whole life sphere. If we do not succeed in controlling this process, it could pose a grave threat. This controlling process does not only require technological skills, but also an ethics adjusted to this wholly new situation. Jonas distinguishes modern technology from pre-modern technology. The latter is characterized by the invariability of the human condition. The range of human acts is well determined, and human flourishing was well defined. Jonas gives the example of the Greek polis in classical antiquity. The polis has a balance parallel to and in the broader perspective of a balanced cosmos. All human acts that influence nature took place within the polis. The essence of things was not changed. Nature was not opposite to ethics, but intellect and inventiveness were (Jonas, p.21) ( “(…) nicht Ethik, sondern Klugheit und Erfindungsgabe war ihr gegenüber angebracht.“ (PV, p.21) ). All ethics found their basis and stability in the life within the polis, according to Jonas. Ethics in this era of pre-modern technology are characterized by its anthropocentrism and by the fact that the essence of being human was well defined. It is as if human beings act in a world that remains unchanged by their behavior so that ethics can be limited to human affairs only. When it comes to matter and other non-human objects, no ethics concerning right or wrong conduct existed. In addition, the restricted range in space and time is important. In the era of modern technology, next to the range of  the pre-modern technology, a new range with expansion is added. The long-term consequences of human conduct are potentially irreversible. The causal chain of human behavior is enormously extended as far as the eye can reach, and even beyond. When it comes to these consequences, naive optimism is not enough. Therefore, Jonas investigates the possibility of adding extra deontological ethics (figure 1) which cover the “ethical vacuum” caused by modern technology.
Before Jonas develops his categorical imperative and his analysis of responsibility, he introduces the term ‘The Heuristics of Fear’. In this experience-based approach of problem solving, Jonas tries to explain how we can identify what our highest priorities are. For example, the work in the laboratory to create a new E.coli bacterium is of great importance for the iGEM competition. However, when the safety of one’s fellow students is at stake, one will give priority to their safety, even when participation in the iGEM competition is hampered. At such moments, you will recognize the most fundamental value(s"

and
tell the browser that there will be a table, whereas all text between
and
will be in one paragraph. Consequently, a complete webpage is build by just stringing together several tags.
It should be noted that every webpage is to be placed between a  and a  tag. Within this html-tag, there has to be one <head> … </head> that holds some invisible information about the webpage (e.g. the title of the page, the author, fonts and font-sizes, information for search robots such as Google, …). After the head-section, the body-section is declared (<body> … </body>). This is where all visible content of the page is specified (e.g. tables, paragraphs and text, images, flash content, …).
Another important aspect concerning tags are so-called attributes. Attributes represent options that can be applied to certain tags. Attributes are places inside the opening brackets of a tag. For example,
...
set the width of the border of this table to 1 pixel.
In  order to learn more about HTML or to just look up some tags or attributes, many tutorials exist on the web. A small collection is available in the  [ [1] ].

A The top of the page will contain a header showing a banner representing your team. Underneath will be a horizontal navigation area. Below this area on the left, the large content area will be positioned. To the right of the content will be a narrow vertical range, where you can add optional extras, such as a countdown to the jamboree, a visitor counter or some art work etc.
B HTML code for this table
Another important aspect is how to apply this table layout to the wiki page. In general, a wiki software allows the user to create different pages and to add content to these pages. To view such a wiki page using a browser, the MediaWiki software has to generates the corresponding HTML page every time a page is requested. For this purpose, the MediaWiki software is supplied with a HTML framework holding the typical wiki interface and places the content of the requested page into a container within the HTML framework. So when a wiki page is edited, the only part that is actually changed lies within the container of this HTML framework. It is important to note, that in the case of the iGEM wiki this HTML framework cannot be modified. In other words, the layout and design has to be entered into the textbox on every edit page.
But as the layout and navigation bar is identical for every page, it is useful to"

There were 6 clones of each transformants, 42 samples in total.
We selected and suspended one colony from each re-streaked clone in 20-30 µl of PBS. We ran colony PCR from of each suspended colony using taq polymerase using the VF2 and VR primers. We also started overnight cultures in selective medium from the suspensions, 1 ml in each.
As a final attempt to get the cph8 gene from the iGEM kit, we tried running a PCR using the VF2 and VR primers and DNA from the kit as template. To be able to get high quality on the PCR product, we used Phusion DNA polymerase.
Last thing was to run an agarose gel of the PCR products. We also ran the PCR product of the envZ Knockout cassette and cph8 on agarose gel. The envZ Knockout had a clear band (we lowered the annealing temperature from  60°C to 59°C). Last thing we did was doing PCR purification of envZ Knockout (Purification protocol). The cph8 showed no bands on the gel, indicating that there simply is no BioBrick plasmid DNA in the kit well.

Our software platform would not be optimised for use unless we obtained user feedback from iGEM teams. Hence, we collaborated with over 69 iGEM teams, to gather feedback to shape our alpha version for use in their projects.
High school teams
We also helped the CLSB-UK iGEM team characterise one of their parts as they did not have a spectrophotometer at their high school. We measured the optical density of a culture of Synechocystis over the course of 5 days. CLSB-UK needed the optical density readings to check that their method of using a colorimeter with a particular filter was working. We obtained the started culture with the growth medium and obtained the data by incubating the culture at 25C with light with mixing. The Synechocystis we obtained data from was non-transformed with no foreign genes.

Collaboration with Dundee iGEM team
Following our talks with Aubrey de Grey and Filipe , we really wanted to conduct experiments that show that our lycopene probiotic can survive in the gut and acidic conditions of the stomach. We were very lucky to have met with Dundee GEM team at the UK GEM meet up where they told us about a stomach simulating device that they own. The bacteria in a sealed container and reconstructing the conditions found in the stomach. A manual pulley system replicates the churning of the stomach with an acidic environment.
We sent out a slab of bacteria that contained our lycopene biobrick within it, to test whether our bacteria could survive in the stomach, in order to provide proof that our probiotic idea would be functional in the human body. Dundee then measured the growth of our bacteria by taking optical density measurements every 15 minutes for an hour since adding it to their device. The results were extremely promising; our genetically modified bacteria grew successfully in their device. The full discussion and our results can be seen on the demonstrate page.

The R6K ori is a medium copy plasmid in pir+ / pir116 E. coli strains like EC100D but it does not replicate in pir- strains like E. coli TOP10. So it is easy to separate a ColE1 ori plasmid from another with R6K ori by simply transforming both to e.g. E. coli TOP10.  The R6K ori was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid. Subsequently, the plasmid containing the R6K ori was digested with Hin6I. The largest fragment was extracted from an agarose gel and ligated with T4 DNA Polymerase. Thereby the ColE1 ori was removed, leaving a small fragment of about 30 bp.

Collaboration with team Aachen
While we were working on our project, we had connected with several other iGEM teams. We  worked really well with a student team from Aachen, Germany. They had a similar topic as us, so  collaboration was easier due to common ground. Firstly, we had a few conference calls with them  and after exchanging our experience with already conducted research and preparations for iGEM, we  worked on possible ways to solve the problems we all pointed out. Furthermore we discussed other  ways of collaboration.  We helped them with their Human Practises by filling out their questionnaire  on lab organisation and also conducted several tests for them.
They were investigating the degree of GMO pollution in the laboratories we worked in, which is  indeed a valuable problem to explore. When dealing with something with such power to transform  the world as synthetic biology has, safety is very important, both in the outside world when we try to  apply our ideas to everyday lives and in the lab as well. GMO pollution in the lab is an important  question because it concerns our safety and the safety of other people we interact with, so we were  glad to be able to participate in their study.
We conducted several swab tests on different surfaces with agar chips by placing 3 on each selected  surface for 5 seconds and then placed them in petri dishes.  They were incubated at 37°C and after  24 hours we received the following results:
The agar chips were maid according to the protocol they have sent us:
•prepare 250 ml of LB medium with 2% Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast  extract, 5 g Agar),
•sterilize the black chip-mould by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol,
•fill the mould with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes,
•use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings,
•move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula,
•store at 4 °C.

Safety
As learners in biology, we not only focus on the research of synthetic biology, but also take active responsibility for the safety of oneself, the public and the environment. This summer, TUST-China team worked on environmental pollution by constructing a “D&D system” to detect the presence of tetracycline in water samples and further utilize peroxidase to degrade it. We strictly adhere to the safety code, comprehensive consideration, and commit to making our project free of any safety hazards
This year our team focuse on environmental issues because concerns about safe living and environmental protection has caused many eyes. And as biological learners, we are concerned about the ethical issues that are brought about by synthetic biology. For the success of the project and its practical application, we have received good training and supervision in the field of laboratory safety. We have paid much attention to design the experimental safety, the selection of parts and experimental safety operation.
Laboratory safety
Before entering the laboratory, our PI professor Zhong Cheng strictly required us to study the laboratory rules and receive laboratory safety training, including waste disposal, safety protection, emergency handling and other methods to deal issues. We prepared and wore a full range of protective equipment before doing each experiment and fully understand the experimental procedures and precautions. Before entering the laboratory, all members of the team had have a an examination on laboratory safety and the use of large instruments. Only iGEMers whose score is more than 95 can be allowed to enter the laboratory .
During the experiment, our Instructors guided our daily experiments, iGEMers supervised each other, strictly abided by the experimental requirements when operating various instruments and conducted all kinds of aseptic experiments, and inspected the laboratory every night. The day's experiment didn’t end until it was assured that the laboratory was no safety risks. We have never conducted any dangerous experiments in our daily work or encountered any unusual safety problems throughout the competation.

We wanted to understand what goes on during a surgical procedure, what types of precautions were taken and what were the impacts of an infection for the patient.  Thus, we began contacting surgeons and associations to learn more.
European Hospital Georges-Pompidou (HEGP) in Paris
The European Hospital Georges-Pompidou is the newest and biggest Parisian hospital. It opened in 2001, receiving the name of one of the French Presidents, Georges Pompidou. It’s one of the most efficient hospitals in Europe, illustrating itself by being the first cardiac transplant facility on the continent.
At the HEGP, we learned about the methods used to minimize the risks of infection, as well as how the surgeon was approaching those risks for the patients. With authorization from Dr. Benjamin Bouyer, we also had the chance to observe a team of surgeons during a spine implant operation. It became clear to us that even though every step was taken to eliminate the risk of infection, it could be useful to develop a system to minimize one step further this risk in the case of an implant.
Interview with Dr. Benjamin Bouyer
Dr. Benjamin Bouyer’s main concern with our project was how we would be incorporating the biofilm inside the patient. Indeed, every implant is given to the surgeon in a sterile way, inside a bag the doctor would not open until the very last moment. He also brought up the issue of our system being 3 in 1. Indeed, our biofilm would be capable of reducing the risk of infection by Staphylococcus aureus but would also be modified to induce the growth of nerves when needed, all this while conducting a signal. Indeed, our project is focusing on amputated patients, meaning only they would need all the three branches of our system. We reassured him by explaining that our system could also be used only for its inhibition of virulence properties and that it could be open to every type of patient. He did, however, believe that our project could be useful to many branches of medicine. We also asked him if he would, as a surgeon, use our device if the laws changed about the use of GMOs, and his response was very positive. Indeed, in his opinion, no doctor would reject a system proven to reduce infections.
Dr. Benjamin Bouyer is a surgeon at the HEGP specialized in lumbar rachis surgeries. He is currently clinical assistant head at the hospital"

This document helped us to design our project based around persons of interest and the market that you might want to end up in. We also received some very useful workshops, which varied from designing a business model to a pitch training. With help from the coaches, the feedback from the speeddates and the information from the workshops, we were able to finalize our Golden Egg Check and we made it to the final 20 participants for the final event!
During the final event, we had to give a 1 minute pitch to convince everyone that our idea was the best. We put a lot of effort into turning our difficult idea into something easy to understand to a general public because most of the people present in the audience did not have biological knowledge or backgrounds. We did this so well, that we were able to collect the audience price of €1000!
In the end, we are very happy that we participated in the TU/e Contest! The value that this contest added to how we look at our project has been very great and we can look back on a fun and useful contest!

The Dutch Technology Week (DTW) is all about promoting Dutch high-tech to the public. During this week, many high-tech companies opened their doors. This was a good opportunity to raise awareness about synthetic biology! We arranged a stand during the High-Tech Discovery Route. In order to make it more approachable to the general public, we had a stand to make hair gel and slime with kids. While some of us entertained the children, others got the opportunity to discuss our applications with the parents. Finally, we were allowed to give a pitch in order to promote iGEM during the business event.

IIT Kanpur 2018:
We were mentored by iGEM Team IIT Kanpur 2018 in troubleshooting few issues we faced while working on our project. Team IIT Kanpur is working on degrading SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulphate) in water, which is in principle similar to our project of degrading paan stains. So we approached them for a few brainstorming sessions via emails and Skype calls. We discussed various aspects of our projects right from project design, modelling to interlab and human practices.   Team IIT Kanpur also helped us in troubleshooting issues we faced while cloning by suggesting some changes in our cloning protocols. We were keen to do modelling with their help but could not do it because of time constraints. We are glad to have an enriching and holistic collaboration with this fellow iGEM team and look forward to meet them at the Giant Jamboree.
 
 
IIT Madras 2018:
We were delighted to collaborate with iGEM Team IIT Madras 2018 for their Language Project. It was quite fun translating science into local Indian languages thus helping it to transcend language barriers. We translated their video :- Introduction to Synthetic Biology into Indian regional languages of Assamese, Bhojpuri, Tulu and Sanskrit.  One of the team members of IIT Madras generously participated in our social media challenge #PaanSePareshaan and posted pictures of paan stains from Jaipur. In the course of time we developed cordial relations with Team Madras and are excited to meet them at the Giant Jamboree!

After presenting him the project, that he was very fond of, he helped us with the modeling of the growth of the neurons when we faced problems. His dynamism and interest for our project really helped us to finish our modeling, and in consequence, our in vitro primary culture.
ADEPA
ADEPA stands for “Association de Défense et d’Etude des Personnes Amputées », which translates to « Association for the Defense and Study of Amputated Persons ». This national association was created in 1996 and aims to unite forces between disabled persons. They represent the community during ministerial commissions and try to help people in their daily lives with their handicap by giving support and finding solutions.
Jean-Pascal Hons-Olivier is a country security Manager and member of the board of directors of ADEPA. As a leg amputee who underwent multiple corrective surgeries on his leg, Mr. Hons-Olivier is very involved in ADEPA.
Interview with Jean-Pascal Hons-Olivier
Mr. Jean-Pascal Hons-Olivier gave us great input on the different causes of amputation and the relationship between a patient and his prosthetist. He also allowed us to understand what was the process of getting an implant in France, how someone is living with an amputated limb and also gave his opinion on the different type of prosthesis on the market. He also talked about the type of prosthesis our system would integrate into: osseointegrated prostheses. The type of surgery is currently not taken in charge by the French health care system due to the high risk of"

She told us that there are often sudden explosions in the number of infected people, that may be caused by mosquitoes that get resistant against pesticides.
The control of, for example, malaria is challenging because of the political status of Congo: setting up and maintaining a functional health system is very difficult. This was also emphasized earlier during our talk with prof. Joseph Ndung'u. MSF negotiates with both the governmental military and rebel groups. They achieved building a hospital that acts as a base camp to prepare for fieldwork. It attracts the local population that now goes to this hospital instead of local government health centers. This hospital employs both foreign specialists and locals, in which the former educate the latter. The goal is to create an independent health system, run by experienced locals, without the interference of MSF. Furthermore, MSF also has to rely on the help of locals for the delivery of medicine and equipment in case their shipments cannot be delivered to the hospital due to dangerous situations caused by the country’s conflicts.
MSF outreach teams are active in screening for malaria in mosquitoes as well as in the population, but also by educating locals about the work they do. The latter is very important to gain the trust of the population and prevent miscommunications. The current rapid malaria diagnostics give a readout in 15 minutes. If positive, the patient will be taken along to the MSF hospital. Introduction of a new diagnostic in countries such as Congo requires trust by the government, as they always need to give permission. Therefore, it is best to do this via established NGOs such as MSF. On the topic of diagnostics for diseases without a cure or treatment, Jeanine mentioned that these are still very important, as they give information about the diseases present in the area, as well as their role in preventing epidemics"",,Met with Jeanine Loonen from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF),,, 1691,Wageningen_UR,Overgraduate,2017, https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR,Nominated for Best Integrated Human Practices,Integrated Human Practices,""Meeting with Prof. dr.

Surprisingly, the blue chromoprotein in group 1mM IPTG without SNP was also be activated with undetermined mechanisms. We speculated that it may be caused by leakage expression of promoter PnorV when the NorR is overexpressed. Due to this reason, we would use a weak promoter to express NorR in further engineered bacteria.
Figure 2. Pellets of bacteria transformed with constructed NO sensor plasmid after 6hr induction at 37 ℃. From left to right: control, 0.5mM IPTG without SNP, 1mM IPTG without SNP, 0.5mM IPTG with 100μM SNP, 1mM IPTG with 100μM SNP.
Besides, during our participation in the 5th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Community), we communicated with the iGEM team of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and learnd that they detected colorectal cancer through the nitric oxide inducible promoter PyeaR, they used NO as their input signal. And at that time which happened to be difficult for us to detect the expression of the reporter gene GFP after using nitric oxide to drive PnorV. So, we also tested the effect of PyeaR (BBa_K381001) in the Distribution Kit (Figure 3).
We transformed the plasmid containing BBa_K381001 into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight and then diluted to OD600 = 0.4. Then we took half of the bacteria as control and the rest was added SNP aqueous solution, and induced at 37 ℃ for 6 h. Then the fluorescence intensity of cells was observed under microplate reader and fluorescence inverted microscope (Figure 4). The histogram of GFP fluorescent density and microscope images indicated that PyeaR could be effectively activated by NO and there was almost no leakage expression. In the future, we will use PyeaR promoter based plasmid as the NO sensor.

A possible explanation for these results is that we didn't completely get rid of the arabinose, which acts as a chemoattractant. Moreover, CheY and CheZ being endogenously expressed in bacteria, there could be interferences with our fusion proteins and weakening of our signal. This should be tested again with CheY/CheZ knock out strains.
We also could determine which of the luciferases would best suit our following experiments. As shown in fig. 2, for the same concentration of substrate, we see that firefly luciferase has a more stable and higher signal.  Moreover, the difference between the background noise (negative control, non fused split luciferase) and the full luciferase is bigger for Firefly luciferase, which is also preferable.
The PBS2-HOG1 split-GFP & split Renilla Luciferase stress response
Confirmation of successful transformation via the R. Luciferase tag
Since we had never transformed S. cerevisiae, we first needed to confirm our protein tag transformations as a positive control for subsequent experiments.   We cultured the two strains we got from the transformation, the HOG1-rLuc  ( BBa_K1486033 ) and PBS2-rLuc ( BBa_K1486027 ), put them in a 96 well plate and tested their luminescence using a plate reader.
The test was performed using two different concentrations of the substrate, coelenterazine-h(benzyl coelenterazine): 1μM and 5μM so that we could determine the optimal concentration we would use for the next assays. The plate started to be read directly after addition of the substrate in the dark and measures were taken every 56 seconds thereafter. Three wells for each sample were measured and below are shown the graphs of their average luminescence plotted over time. We observed a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 at 1μM of substrate and 10 at 5μM for the PBS2-rLuc strain. The HOG1-rLuc strain seemed problematic and died within the plate. Unable to verify the correct transformation, we reproduced the strain but were unable to confirm its validity before the wiki deadline.
There is a clear luminescence generated by the cells, providing us with confirmation that our designs are correct and we determined which concentration of substrate to use to have a decent signal-to-background ratio.

Introduction
The principles of universality and indivisibility under which human rights are grounded, establish that protection and fundamental rights must be guaranteed for all human beings regardless of ethnicity, age, gender, or income. Today the rights to life and health of agricultural communities, children, farmworkers, animals, and many other vulnerable groups are abused by our excessive reliance on pesticides. There is overwhelming evidence that the use of pesticides in agricultural production and industrial waste have major impact on water quality due to its runoff towards canals, streams, rivers, and lakes. Protection from the exposure to dangerous substances is neither a privilege, nor charity, this is why we emphasize transition to safer and healthier models of agricultural production and waste treatment. This requires adequate approaching to the problem.
Monitoring data from pesticides and heavy metals can represent a big problem especially in developing countries, due to the cost of analysis"

Week 19
This week was a lot of general brainstorming on the project topic and doing research on the feasibility of the idea. Wednesday I had my first meeting with Simon Goede, board member of Biotechnology. We talked about what we expected from each other. A good fundament for a long term collaboration. Friday we had a meeting with all Dutch teams (Gronigen, Wageningen and Amsterdam) in Amsterdam for an update on what everybody was doing, a topic presentation and exchanging valuable information.
Week 18
Sunday I returned from a ten-day trip to the UK. When I entered the iGEM room on Monday I was a bit disappointed that there was still no real topic choice. We wanted to do something with Mfp-5, but we still didn't know exactly what. A week of brainstorming and research followed.
Week 17
I spent the whole week in the UK. I walked past Imperial College for a meeting with their iGEM team, but unfortunately the building was closed because of Bank Holidays. Later that week I had a tour at Cambrigde University and I totally forgot to ask about their iGEM team. Shame on me!
Week 16
This week was filled with brainstorm sessions and discussions. The goal was to make a top 10 out of the 150 ideas we generated during the brainstorm sessions. Thursday morning I left for the UK.

Biological Safety and Containment
Through conversations with industry in both 2012 and 2013, we’ve realized that safety and biological containment for our product will be a big priority if we want to see it adopted. Many investors and potential end-users had significant concerns about how we would ensure that our organism does not enter the environment. Although our final product makes use of a closed chamber where samples are injected, preventing our organism from entering the environment, there were still concerns that we would need to implement additional layers of security.  As such, we have designed several different components of containment in order to minimize any chance that our organism could ever escape. Through our work in 2012 , we have developed multiple ‘killswitch’ mechanisms. These include restriction enzyme based mechanisms as well as auxotrophy-based systems. As well as these measures, our system is designed such that there is only an applicator to the system, making use of a one-way valve. This makes the organism inside inaccessible to both the user and the environment. This"

Building on the work of iGEM Uppsala
During our project, we aimed to characterise a previous BioBrick part in the lactic acid bacteria we were working with, Streptococcus thermophilus. As we aimed to improve the understanding of this organism as part of the project, we decided to focus on reporter constructs in order to test whether these were viable in S. thermophilus. We looked into the work of the Uppsala teams between 2011 and 2013, who BioBricked various chromoproteins originating from sea anenomes and corals and expressed them in E. coli. We selected a single chromoprotein for our experiments: this was the blue chromoprotein amilCP. When transformed into E. coli, amilCP produces a vibrant dark blue pigment within 24 hours of incubation. We wanted to test whether amilCP was a useful reporter construct in our lactic acid bacteria.
Experimental Design
We ligated the BioBrick BBa_K592025 (strong RBS B0034 and blue chromoprotein amilCP ) to a native S. thermophilus promoter, P25. We then inserted the BioBrick construct into pSB1C3 and transformed it into TOP10 E. coli in order to check that the gene functioned as expected. Once this was confirmed, the construct was then inserted into the shuttle vector pMG36ET for transforming both TOP10 E. coli and S. thermophilus. This plasmid also contained an erythromycin resistance cassette in order to select for transformant colonies.

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

Since we were investigating bacillus as a chassis and developing  the quick-germination biobrick, we decided to design our construct such that it should function in both e.coli and bacillus.
The actual biobricks used for this assembly are (1) eCYP, (2) B0015, the double terminator which consists of B0010 and B0012, (3) K143053, which is a composite biobrick of Pveg and SpoVG, and (4) eYFP. The Pspac promoter used for testing, GsiB and last B0010 has come from the shuttle vector pJS130.
The final design consisted of 4 biobricks ligated into a bacillus shuttle vector, as shown. The promoters pSpac and pVeg, the RBS GsiB and SpoVG are both functional in e.coli and bacillus, giving the construct potential to be tested in both species. pVeg is active constitutively, and pSpac is lacI - induced. For pSpac testing, the shuttle vector includes a constitutively expressed LacI ORF, as bacillus does not naturally express lacI. We intended to assemble in e.coli, characterise and then transform bacillus and further characterise the behaviour of the construct. However, technical difficulties significantly delayed assembly, but we did manage to do some characterisation in E.coli.
For further information, please refer to our Results page.
The second reporter construct was designed with our instrumentation in mind. We decided that a luciferase-based output would be the most readily quantifiable with inexpensive components. This left us with the choice of what luciferase(s) to use. Firefly luciferase has been mutagenised into a wide range of colours and would seem the obvious choice. However, it has the flaw of requiring the addition of exogenous luciferin in order to function. Luciferin is expensive, and not stable at room temperature for extended periods of time. Therefore using it would clash with our intentions to take steps towards cheaper and more practical biosensing. Additionally, the brightness would be susceptible to variations in the availability of luciferin to cells, which might"

This is the result of an assessment about different ways of propaganda. We can see that online video is the most effective way. This is because of the wide coverage of the internet and the viv-idness of video materials. Compare several ways with high points, we can find the advantages shared by effective ways.
Using attractive methods, such as internet, video, lecture etc.
Changing from passive reception to positive participation, such as lecture and oral communication. When people participate positively, they have more sound impression, thus resulting in effective propaganda.
Novelty and attractiveness. People are more easily attracted by vivid and interesting information.
There are also some common characters marking a humdrum propaganda, such as small coverage, hackneyed design etc.

Universal Risk evaluation model of Environmental problem
Background and Problem
Nowadays, a variety of environmental concerns such as air and water pollution have surfaced as a result of progress in technology. The diversity of pollution makes it difficult to judge the seriousness of the many problems. A universal evaluation system of “valid eve-rywhere” risk analysis model is called for by the public. Through risk evaluation of this systematic model, we can know the hazard potential of any environmental problem in all aspects. With this system, we can also compare unfamiliar problems with the well-known ones to understand the different performance of these problems in various perspectives.
Our evaluation system
In assessing the various problems in divergent fields, a comprehensive evaluation contains all related specific and measurable indexes. We have done quite a lot of literature work to make sure that our evaluation system contains all related and useful perspectives. Finally, an overall and systematic evaluation system is established. The frame diagram of this system is shown in the Figure 14. The shape of the system seems like a tree, so it is also called evaluation tree.

Growing cultures for Acetylene Reduction Assay:
After deciding to culture the strains in an M9 medium before performing the assay, the experimenters encountered a few setbacks in the preparation of that medium. After a couple of days of trial and error, a protocol was established that produced a viable M9 medium. To create the 100 mL of 10X M9 stock solution, 0.026 g CaCl2·H2O, 0.030 g MgSO4,10.4 g Na2HPO4, 3.4 g KH2PO4, and 4 g glucose were dissolved in the appropriate volume of water. The resulting solution was then filtered for sterility. 100 mL of a 1000X supplemental stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0.3 g MnSO4, 7.6 g Na2MoO4*2H2O, 0.010 g p-aminobenzoic acid, and 0.005 g biotin in the appropriate volume of water. A 100X ferric citrate solution was also prepared by dissolving 0.36 g Ferric citrate in water to create 100 mL of solution. The viable M9 medium was prepared by mixing the appropriate volumes of these solutions together along with a glutamine solution for all cultures as a nitrogen source and kanamycin for the experimental tubes and bottles. After observing their growth, DH5α and Top 10 were eliminated due to their inability to grow well in the medium, and all experiments proceeded with the JM109, BL21, and WM1788 wild types and mutants.
Results:
1) Of the five E. coli strains tested, JM109 and WM1788 showed strongest nitrogenase activity.
 
2) The linear relationship between nitrogen fixation activity and time matches that seen in nature.
3) Optimal conditions determined:
glucose as carbon-source
glutamate as nitrogen-source
LB as inoculating media
minimal M9 as testing media for GC assay
anaerobic environment
30 °C during the overnight preparation

British_Columbia,2018,Team:British Columbia#Kaempferol_-_-_TEXT.html,"deR biosensor, the growth rate and activity of strain 1 will decrease as naringenin builds up6.  By using the pt181 transcript-dependant transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanism, GP2 expression can be inversely coupled to the presence of naringenin, increasing the growth rate and activity of strain 27.  This results in a system where an increase in naringenin concentration leads to a decrease in the growth rate and activity of the producing strain and an increase in the growth rate and activity of the consuming strain.  An absence of the intermediate naringenin would lead to an increase in naringenin production and a decrease in naringenin consumption activity.  Co-cultures will then reach a steady state, where there is neither excess naringenin production nor excess energy and resource consumption by the strain catalyzing naringenin conversion into kaempferol, when there is not sufficient naringenin present in the system.

4.5 Data Analysis Software
Aim: Verify gene doping DNA sequences by classifying sequenced DNA as natural EPO genes, artificial EPO genes or other DNA.
Approach: We created a software tool to perform this task based on comparison of the input sequence to a custom database. Our database contains natural sequences with variations corresponding to misreads, and artificial sequences with codon mutations around exon-exon junctions. Natural genes do not have exon-exon junctions, which allows their distinction from artificial DNA.
Our tool calculates local and global alignment scores based on the Smith-Waterman and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithms respectively. Based on a combined alignment score, an input sequence is then classified using the k-nearest neighbour machine learning algorithm.
The database includes every new artificial EPO DNA that is analysed. In this way, evolved EPO gene doping sequences update the database resulting in ever-increasing accuracy.
