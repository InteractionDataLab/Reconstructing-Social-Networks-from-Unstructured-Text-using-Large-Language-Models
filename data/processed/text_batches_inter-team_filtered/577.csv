Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," were too many colonies to count and this suggested that we should dilute the colonies further in the future.
When discussing the results with Dr. Schryvers, he recommended some changes to our protocol. One major change we considered was using a stock solution of 10% xylose to dilute our cells since previously we were unaware of the final concentration of xylose that was added to the cells. We will apply these changes to our future transformations.
Week 15: August 5 - August 8
We instituted the changes suggested by Dr. Schryvers to our existing protocol. However, cells did not seem to transform, as plenty of growth was observed on the plain agar plates, but nothing grew on the spectinomycin plates, suggesting that DNA was not uptaken by the cells. Similarly, none of the colonies expressed RFP. Thus, transformation continues to be a work in progress.
We borrowed a small amount of calcium nitrate from Dr. Wong, as it was the only reagent we were missing for making 2x SG media for sporulation of B. subtilis. We obtained the sporulation protocol and media recipe from OpenNetWire . We put the spores into the shaker for incubation over the weekend for the sporulation process to take place.
Week 16: August 11 - 15
We harvested the spores that grew over the weekend by spinning down small volumes in the benchtop centrifuge. They were then washed with cold nanopure water. Once we obtained these spores in 2mL tubes, half were designated for storage in the fridge (short-term, require weekly changes of water), and the other half were designated for long-term storage in the -20°C freezer.
We then researched different ways we could verify the presence of spores. These primarily compose of:  Researched ways to verify their presence Gram stain! But no reagents
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
Naturally competent bacteria take up foreign DNA when exposed to conditions of energy starvation (Hamoen, Venema, Kuipers & 2003) . Once taken up, foreign DNA is generally degraded into nucleotide constituents and used as an energy source (Hamoen, Venema, Kuipers & 2003) .  Because B. subtilis has an aggressive mechanism for doing so, we are interested in determining how much “buffering” DNA is required to protect the sequence we wish to recombine into the B. subtilis genome. (Khasanov et al) . determined that a minimal of 70 bp is required for"

Our testing would dramatically reduce    the amount of time needed to detect the virus and would also be more reliable,    as we are directly targeting the viral genome instead of HCV antibodies secreted    by the human immune system (which only get produced after several months of exposure    to the antigen).
Summer School : Shaping the Future of Bioengineering,   Davos
The summer school's program
Poster Session
In September, two of our team members went to Davos, Switzerland, to attend    the Summer School on Shaping the Future of Bioengineering. There we presented    our project as well as a first poster at a poster session and got feedback from    professionals in academia and industry on key experiments and how to present    our data in a more scientific manner.
At the same time we learned about and discussed related applications and expansions   to our project (like what a 3D dignostics kit could look like, how to test for several   diseases at the same time, who would be interested in this kits, and much more),   which decidedly had a big impact on our ideas and is further explained in the   Outlook section.

Computational Biology Symposium, EPFL
We also took part in the Computational Biology Symposium 2017 hosted at EPFL    in October to present the software part of our project during a poster session.    Three team members were present to explain what our iGEM project was about and    exchange ideas on how to make our code public in the best way. At the end of the    day we were happy to have found the most suitable solution to this problem and    having gained absolutely inspiring insights into the world of computational    biology.
Reaching out to industry
Our project was confined in the EPFL and we wanted to reach more people outside    the academic world. To figure out how we could improve our project further and    whether our concept would be interesting to labs from the industry, we contacted    Medisupport, a laboratory group that performs a broad range of medical analyses    for hospitals and doctor’s offices, servicing whole Switzerland. As they are    in touch with the industry, they have a quite new opinion and they would know    exactly the implementability of aptasense and what where the advantages or   weaknesses. They turned out to be quite interested in our project and our    detection scheme of proteins, so that in October one of their representatives    came to"

Stochastic Switch model
Our heads or tails stochastic switch is used in our system to a give a decision to be a metal container and sequester cadmium, or continue to normal vegetative life. This cell fate decision is given based on a number of parameters stochastically. Hin invertase which inverts a promoter is also included in the same region. Its expression is controlled by LacI controlled pspac promoter (inducable by IPTG) on the left site and XlyR controlled xylA promoter (Inducable by Xylose) on the right side. The promoter inside the invertible region is used to express downstream genes either on the left side or rigth side depending on its position.
LacI binds to Pspac promoter and represses its expression whereas XylR binds to xylA promoter and represses the expression from xylA promoter. When induced with IPTG, LacI falls off from the Pspac promoter and when induced with Xylose, XylR falls off from xylA promoter and does not repress it any more. The differences between LacI's and XylR's binding affinities to promoters and to their inducers affect the expression of Hin, hence the direction of the invertible region. When this region is oriented from left to right and Pspac promoter is not repressed by LacI, sigA promoter in the invertible region expresses Rfp. When the region is oriented from right to the left, 'sigA promoter in the invertible region is also turned to right and expresses Gfp"

Abstract
Dual light controlled arabinose biosensor
Integrating the work of many other previous iGEM teams (Tokyo NoKoGen 2010, Chiba 2009, 2010, British Columbia 2009, Cambridge 2010, UNAM-Genomics México 2010, ITESM Monterrey 2010), the aim of this project is to develop a way of giving a cell the command to perform a function at user’s will, improving current lock-and-key designs.   A novel mechanism based on an E.coli chassis, was designed with two main objectives:  to sense arabinose reporting its concentration and to use light receptors to trigger the expression of the required pathways. The first receptor enables E.coli to activate (express), the arabinose sensing mechanism; whereas the second receptor activates a quick deactivation(degradation), of the sensing mechanism depriving the cell of that capability.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#cn_-_-_TEXT.html," research centers about synthetic biology were established with the financial support of central government, including the Systems and Synthetic Biology Research Center in Tianjin University, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology of CAS and the Synthetic Biology and Bioinformatics Center in the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Zhang et al., 2011). Currently there are more than 15 institutes that have projects focused in this field (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). They play a big role in the development of synthetic biology in China.  The Chinese government also focuses on this emerging discipline. The Ministry of Science and Technology had enlisted it as a major research area in its R&D plans in 2010. Also, there was an increasing number of projects related to synthetic biology in the two most important technology development programs, National High-tech Research and Development Project (863 program) and National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 program) (Pei et al., 2011).
When it comes to the general public, they are not aware of synthetic biology.  As a new developing scientific field, synthetic biology is largely known only within academia. Except for a few media exposure to the public, not many information of synthetic biology is available for the general public. The general public is therefore, not familiar with the pros and cons of potentials in synthetic biology, issues in biosafety, biosecurity, and ethics. To avoid doubt and panic among the public, it is necessary to conduct synthetic biology research in collaboration with social scientists to promote the awareness (Pei et al., 2011).
Research, People and Organizations
Synthetic biology has received a lot of attention from academia and many researchers have devoted into this field. Below are some of the leading researchers in this field:
Most institutes are founded and supported by the government. The Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Chinese Academy in Science (CAS) in Shanghai is an example of institutes that first established to use synthetic biology to address issues related to energy, human health and the environment (Zhang et al., 2011). Besides government supported laboratories, individual studies on synthetic biology are carried out in universities throughout China as well.

Week 1: May 2-8
Secretion
We designed gBlocks for our gene (coding for the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) enzyme): one for the original sequence and one Bacillus-optimized.
Active team members this week: Liron, Tal, and Ruth
Expression
Planned the Gibson reaction for our gBlock of the gene for 3α-HSD and the plasmid N155 (from our mentors) containing pT7, RBS and the gene for mCherry.
Ordered the gBlock of 3α-HSD, from IDT, which was optimized for E. coli codon usage.  We also ordered primers for the Gibson reaction for the gBlock.
Performed reverse PCR to the N155 plasmid and carried out a DPN1 reaction on the product.
Active team members this week: Adi and Alexey
Cofactor
This week we did a lot of research.  We found that the 3α-HSD enzyme can use both NADH and NADPH as cofactors for the reduction reaction in order which inactivates dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to 3α-diol.
NADPH has been found to not only enable the reaction in the direction we want, but also to inhibit the reverse reaction of DHT (Rizner, et al) synthesis.  Therefore, we have decided to try to overproduce NADPH in a host organism, in order to support the activity of the enzyme.
Active team members this week: Yael and Roni
Comb
A mechanical engineering student, Michael Yannai, helped us design the first prototype of the comb.  We designed it to look like a lice comb with internal channels and thick teeth.  The main entrance to the channels is located at the side of the comb.
Active team members this week: Maayan

Esterases EstCS2 and LipB
EstCS2 from the iGEM Imperial College 2013 was proved to be active.        In their project the cells expressing this construct were grown and lysed by sonication and were utilized in a colourimetric assay with the substrate analog para-Nitrophenyl butyrate.        In our project we didn’t purify the esterases but used the supernatant for the enzyme activity assay.        Furthermore, we investigated the enzyme activity of LipB.        We performed the enzyme assay from the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt that we also used for EstCS2.        Afterwards we attached the PelB signal sequence for the extracellular secretion of the enzyme.
General properties of EstCS2: (Kang et al. 2011)
serine esterase with 45 % similarity with the carboxylesterase from Haliangium ochraceum DSM 14365
temperature optimum: 55 °C; at 37°C: ca. 50 % of maximal activity
pH optimum: 9; at pH 7: ca. 30 % of maximal activity
Family VII esterase with the Ser residue in the catalytic triad of EstCS2 that is loacated in the consensus active site motif GXSXG

General properties of LipB: (Eggert et al. 2000)
organism: Bacillus subtilis 168
temperature optimum:
pH optimum: 6 - 8
substrate specifity: preferentially hydrolysed esters of fatty acids with short chain lengths with less than 10 carbon atoms

The TliA lipase was synthesized from IDT.          Eom et al. have already shown extracellular activity of TliA when secreted with the ABC export system.          So, if the TliA lipase is expressed, it is exported out of the cell and degrades the greasy layer surrounding the hair, which makes the keratin accessible for the keratin"

Comparison of the fluorescence adjusted for OD of I20260, B0015 and the double plasmid system K1319014 + K1319008
After induction with IPTG after 2 h the double plasmid system produced a fast fluorescence response with an over 10-fold increase compared to the non induced state. I20260 served as positive control and B0015 as negative control.
The increase in fluorescence after induction with IPTG is clear sign of funtional expression of the TEV protease. The difference between not induced and induced plasmid is proof that the increase in fluorescence is only attributed to the successful cleavage of the linker. Therefore this is proof of a functional expression of the TEV protease after induction with IPTG.
Furthermore we validated the used plasmid with a Check PCR with one primer binding upstream on the plasmid backbone and one specifically in the insert.
Check PCR for K1319008
The length of the PCR product matches the length of the control plasmid.
This validates that the construct is indeed the TEV protease and thereby the functionality of the TEV protease is established. The construct K1319008 was also sequenced. The sequencing data can be seen in the parts registry here .

Drugs aside, there are currently exciting ongoing research involving the food industry. Biotransformation is a multidisciplinary platform within A*STAR focused on developing microbial fermentation processes to produce high value ingredients more sustainably [10]. By using microbial and synthetic biology methods of producing ingredients, food production becomes less land and weather dependent and in higher quantity. A similar case in chemical manufacturing is the story of truffle oil. Truffle oil was previously available only through foraging of truffles, which are also seasonal. However, with artificial truffle oil in production since 1980s, constraints on quantity and seasonality have been greatly removed or eliminated [11].  Synthetic biology is also actively applied to other fields, leading to the development of potentially transformative applications, such as in therapeutics and biomaterial production. For example, in California, at the startup Bolt Threads, spider silk is produced using genetically engineered yeast [12].
A major obstacle preventing widespread adoption of these novel synthetic biology-based technologies is economic feasibility. Yield is a common problem affecting many new bioreactor fermentation and bio-manufacturing processes. As engineered cells are not naturally inclined to produce the intended products, doing so induce metabolic burden. increasing yield must therefore be achieved by balancing against cell metabolic stress due to production. Furthermore, semi-biologically produced drugs and compounds are larger than chemically produced ones, presenting production challenges and keeping costs high. In large-scale bioreactors, due to the time taken for the diffusion of substrates, heterogeneous conditions between different parts of the bioreactor can create different kinds of reaction conditions and different stresses for different cells. This variability makes bio-manufacturing more expensive and unpredictable. Lastly, for drug production and quality control, the conditions for protein 3D-folding also makes it susceptible for viral contamination [13].
Nonetheless, the global bio-based market remains a growing market with high potential, driven by synthetic biology [14]. It is anticipated to reach US$38.7 billion by 2020, based on predictions by market research company Allied Market Research [15]. Governments all around the world, from the United States to China, are increasingly acknowledging the immense potential of biotechnology, and are increasing investments in an effort to develop biotechnology and its related fields. China, for example, has identified synthetic biology as one of the priority research areas of the country, and its Ministry of Sciences and Technology has invested heavily in funding schemes and initiatives concerning synthetic biology. Perhaps more convincingly the importance the Chinese government"

2.Biosafety Project
Because the track of our project is Foundational Advance, the downstream products have nothing but fluorescent proteins which act as a reporter to characterize our experimental results. What's more, nonpathogenic bacteria E.coli DH5 Alpha is employed as the main chassis for our prior design on the DNA sequence, stem-loop and enzyme. As a matter of fact, when using hairpin and Csy4 enzyme to tune the expression of genes, it is relatively safe for industrialized applications and scientific research. In our project, all parts we have utilized are selected from Risk Group 1, none of which are with a Red Flag. As for microbial organisms, the microbial organisms have no chances to escape from our laboratory because we use ultraviolet sterilization after experiments. Furthermore, all equipment used for recombination strains will be sterilized by High-Pressure Steam Sterilization Pot.
3.Biosafety lab work
Our cautiousness about experiments makes it even impossible for classis to escape. Every week, we do a thorough laboratory cleaning, including spraying alcohol and disinfectant to sterilize. Every day we check all the instruments and strains in our lab. For the lack of nutrition, recombinant strains cannot survive outside the lab. What's more, the teacher responsible for laboratory safety checks our safety work every week. And we are certain that everything we did is under our control.
Fig.1 We have strict safety regulations and safe operation.
4. Biosafety education
We organized a summer camp to popularize life science with middle school students, and teach them basic microbial experimental operations such as butterfly specimens, microbial painting and plasmid extraction. More importantly, we explained the safety of laboratories to them before entering the laboratory in order to raise their biosafety awareness. No experiment carries zero risk to the experimenters, so we must learn how to protect ourselves. Before each experiment, they were educated to be equipped with some necessary facilities, such as latex gloves, nitrile gloves, goggles and lab coats to protect them from biotic and abiotic hazards. Undoubtedly, safety is always in the first place for us.

Perspectives
Our project is entirely dedicated to improving biosafety in iGEM and synthetic biology projects. First, we chose to focus on designing biosafety systems for E. coli chassis according to the results of the survey that we engaged. As some iGEMers seemed to consider that releasing E. coli in the environment was not a problem in this survey , as bacteria will die, we decided to investigate whether this was indeed the case. The contamination experiments we conducted showed that during at least 9 days, laboratory E. coli bacteria can survive in environments as varied as the soil, the water of a pond or ocean water. To complete this experiment, it could be interesting to work with other E. coli strain (K12, DH5α) and moreover than made triplicates for each strain, follow during a larger scale than 9 days.
Unfortunately, this experiment confirmed the necessity of elaborating biological and physical containments for GEO that could be released in the environment, either accidentally or for a specific application.
We conceived a biosafety system based on thermal control adaptable to the user’s needs by using variants of the two key molecules of our system. However, one biological containment system is likely to be insufficient for some particular applications justifying the conception of a second containment level, which is a physical protection.
We have succeeded in creating a physical containment for bacteria which is cheap, fast to build and should prevent unintended contacts between GEOs and the environment. Further experiments are required in order to test such system. The modeling of this aspect that we maid confirm the fact that this physical containment is not universal and that depending of the application different parameters have to be adjusted, as beads size for instance.
Finally, we wanted the future iGEM teams to consider biosafety as an integral part of their projects. We therefore wrote a biosafety guide , which aims at helping iGEM teams to take into account potential biosafety issues at the beginning of the design of their project, rather than after the conception of their system(s).

Fig. 1. Consulting with Dr. Zong-Hong Lin.
To enhance a project, opinions and insight from professions are profoundly meaningful. On August 13th, we consulted with Dr. Zong-Hong Lin, a professor in Institute of Biomedical Engineering, NTHU, who is dedicated to the research of nanosensors and nanosystem, to further improve BioWatcher.
Examining our system for countless times, our system faced a huge challenge, the difficulty of capturing bioluminescence from circulating reporter cells in the blood stream regarding the relatively low amount and mild intensity of reporter cells. Approaches such as improving the resolution of CCD camera and Increasing the amount of reporter cells introduced into the circulating system of the users are so far unfeasible. The former is only possible when technology catches up while the latter is impartical considering the balance of blood composition need to be maintained.
Dr. Lin enlightened us with the idea of pre-concentration, inspiring by a project conducted by Google X related to cancer and diseases detection using iron-oxide nanoparticles. To increase the sensitivity of BioWatcher, the idea of recalling all the nanoparticles to a single location can be applied in our project, meaning incorporating magnetic nanoparticles on the reporter cells so that the concentration of reporter cells can be temporarily increased"

Vilnius
The Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team are creating a therapeutic probiotic for the treatment of phenylketonuria, similar to our therapeutic for Wilson's disease. We have maintained contact with the team for much of the duration of our project, through Skype and email. The main part of our collaboration with them has been to sort out the modelling for the team.
We agreed to have the modelling of the Vilnius team outsourced to our dry lab team. We created models to simulate their team project, which is to convert phenylalanine into trans-cinnamic acid (TCA) using a recombinant enzyme PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase) in vivo. The purpose of the model is to define the efficiency of the system and the limits of its performance in order to show the liability of the approach.
The phenylalanine ammonia lyase reaction
In the initial modelling before the experiment, our model simulated the transport of phenylalanine into the cell and the conversion rate into TCA. Under lack of information on the concentration function of PAL and the transporter protein PheP, we provided simulations for a range of concentration conditions for the two proteins. In later models, we incorporated the PAL expression function gained from experimental data to create a more accurate version of the model. From experimental data of the production of TCA, we were able to predict the concentration of PheP in the cell membrane.
Using MATLAB for simulation, we have provided the Vilnius team with graphs, equations, and information of the model to help them create their dry lab wiki page. Below are some examples of the graphs we have provided:

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NicoleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the morning, Casey and Consuelo held a tiny boot camp to make sure we were on the same page with coding and the Windows Application. Finished debugging crawlers and ensured that the output .txt file that the C# program creates is in the format Linda is able to work with. Created an executable file. Had to transfer it onto a new Console Application project so that Linda can access the code using a command line argument and through it populate her online data sheets. Have to read up on cgi-bins and how to create them for my code. Better commenting the code for Nahum and Kara to be able to use through getters.
Day 27: July 5, 2012
Was able to finish creating an executable/console application for the PartsRegBrowse code. Will continue work on coding up a CGI once Linda finishes the user interface for the front end. Debugged a bit more—modified for cases that had previously not been taken into account. Switched onto the Sifteo project so I talking with Kim about what she had currently coded up for the cubes and started learning about Sifteo API. We were able to make progress with a problem in the program. The colored cube can now drip into a neighboring plasmid cube! The next step is to be able to do that with whatever color the user decides on (i.e. red, yellow, or blue). Unfortunately, as we were trying to solve this next step to the problem and decided to restart from our last big progress (i.e. the dripping), we had found that that last update had not been saved onto the repository, so altering the code took longer than expected.
Day 28: July 6, 2012
Was able to get the animation to work with the other colors (blue and yellow). Met with Orit today to figure out the next step for Sifteo cubes so that we can have a demonstration by the end of the upcoming week. Have to include the E. Coli cube and code up how it appears alone and how it interacts with the others
Day 29: July 9, 2012
Started coding up the third (E. Coli) cube and trying to figure out how to continuously run the animation with the least amount, ideally without any, prompts. Currently having trouble with using the actual pictures for the dripping animation. There is more than twice the amount of frames for the finalized animation than there was for the animation created to test out the code. Not sure if it's because of the code (which should work regardless of the number of frames) or if it's"

15 is , on average, the number of treatments that had to make a winemaker in 2012 to fight against mildew.
11 ° C is the minimum temperature required for initiation of primary infections in the spring.
€ 246 per ha is the average investment of a winemaker in France in 2012 for his fight against mildew.
4 days this is the optimal time necessary to complete mildew its entire cycle from contamination by spore until the following sporulation.
1878 is the year when the mildew , Plasmopara viticola , was observed for the first time in France.
Treatments against mildew have a cost that varies between € 50,000 and € 164,000 per year.Over the last 20 years, no less than 3 mildew epidemics were recorded in France . These outbreaks have a direct impact on the production of wine. As shown in the graph below, represents the number of hL (millions) produced over time , production in 1998 , 2001 and 2006 dropped by over 50 % compared to previous years.  You can find on the vinopôle website the evolution of mildiou risk every week !
In 2010, each hectar or grapevine had received around 16 chemical treatments (this number was 15 in 2006) and varies greatly between regions. Amongst the biological threats on grapevine, mushroom parasites are far ahead of insects and fungi (12 fungicides are used against 2 insecticides and 2 weedkillers). Over 95% of the fongicide treatments in 2010 were due to mildew and oidium, sicknesses that are favorized by rain, humidity and heat. They bring the global quality of the wine down by reducing it's composition in phenols and sugars. The risc of contamination on the leaves begin during the period where the floral buds and futur grapes are growing and lasts until the moment when the grapes touch each other. The sensibility period between oidium and mildew have common momments and vinyards don't heasitate to mix anti-mildew and anti-oidium solutions making the concentrations of these"

MMOC transfers the two electrons from NADH to the diiron site in MMOH2. It is in this diiron center of MMOH where the actual conversion of methane to methanol takes place. The two iron ions, the electrons (which change the iron ions), and the oxygen together with methane in the center of MMOH (bound to MMOB) make the magic happen to break one C-H bond in methane to a C-OH. Afterward helps MMOC to release methanol and resets MMOH by providing new electrons1,3.
Figure 2: Overview of the sMMO protein with subunits α,β, and γ of MMOH, and MMOB, MMOD, and MMOR.
MMOD
There is not much known about the function of the 12 kDa protein MMOD, formerly known as orfY. The first group showing that MMOD is expressed in M. capsulatus (Bath), also has evidence that MMOD can bind to the hydroxylase MMOH7. It seems that MMOD binds to MMOH in competition with the regulatory protein MMOB, which hints to an inhibitory function of MMOD7. They also showed a possible involvement of MMOD in the assembly of the metal center in MMOH7–9. But all their data is based on heterogeneously expressed MMO parts and purified from E. coli and used in in vitro studies. Further studies are needed to resolve the functionality of MMOD both in vitro and in vivo.
MMOG
The mmoG gene is suggested to encode a GroEL-like chaperone that contributes to the correct folding of the other sMMO proteins5,6, but this is so far not proven. They did show that MMOG (and 'MMOR') are required for protein binding to the promoter region of the sMMO operon in the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b5. In another iron monooxygenase, Bacterial binuclear iron monooxygenases, a similar protein as MMOG called mimG was needed for proper folding of one of the other monooxygenase proteins6.

The entire summer, the UIUC software team and wetlab, worked in conjunction as we met every week to update each other on our progress and to collaborate on many issues. Collaboration included administrative tasks, recruitment for the next year, and community outreach.
Modeling for UIUC Bioware
The Illinois Bioware team’s project was to develop bacteria able to facilitate the removal of heavy metals, a process known as bioremediation. The metal that was focused on was Arsenic. To test the program as well as to aid the Illinois Software team in their experimental procedure, we utilized the Constraint-based reconstruction analysis software1 through MATLAB to provide a prediction of growth for the Escherichia coli cells with the proteins implemented. In this modeling, we made the assumptions that the primary protein additions are the Arsenite/antimonite transporter (ArsB), DNA-binding transcriptional repressor (ArsR) and maltose outer membrane porin (LamB) proteins are the most influential components of the team’s Escherichia coli strain when in a medium containing the heavy metal, arsenic. The ArsB protein functions as a membrane transporting pump of arsenate, arsenite and antimonite outside of the cell while utilizing ATP4. The ArsR transcriptional repressor functions within a cell by regulating the expression of the arsRBC that is directly involved in creating resistance to arsenic4. Finally, the LamB protein functions as a maltoporin-like protein by transporting maltodextrins across the membrane2.
The uptake rate of arsenic by ArsB was determined by Meng, et al. (2004). The dynamic flux balance analysis result (Figure 1) was determined with a initial concentration of 10-3 micromoles and a initial biomass of 0.1 milligrams of Dry Weight"

Monday: The whole Wellesley iGem team went to Boston University to meet with the BU iGem team and learn more about the biology behind synthetic biology. As a biological sciences major, it was a bit of a relief to listen to some biology concepts that were easy to understand compared to the computer science ones that I was learning very slowly as I went along. We learned about Eugene, the coding language that the BU iGem team currently uses to find the possible permutations for their synthetic biology circuits. The Wellesley and BU iGem teams split up into mixed teams to try and code some example circuits into Eugene ourselves.

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," coli being present in several nature systems, such as water, soil, sand, sediments, and algae, we didn’t find any evidence that free rhamnose is present in considerable concentrations on these environments. Therefore, the developed bacteria wouldn’t be producing neither Lcp nor roxA, presenting no threats to usable rubber or to the environment. Furthermore, Lcp and roxA enzymes are naturally produced by strains of Streptomyces and Xantomonas, respectively. Therefore, no relevant risks to the environment were detected. On our first project design, however, we still depend on antibiotic resistance for maintenance of the desired plasmid. Although this part is not present on our main circuit, it is on the plasmid where we assembled our developed DNA design. This could be an issue as, by horizontal gene transfer, other - possibly dangerous - bacteria could get resistant to antibiotics. In order to eliminate this issue, our team proposed inserting our circuit and the antibiotic resistance into the genome of the developed bacteria - avoiding horizontal gene transfer and the creation of potentially dangerous organisms.
Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries
     We did not identify any major risks in our project for malicious misuse. None of the used DNA parts in the main circuit has any direct relation with virulence and the organism presents low pathogenicity, besides being a commonly found bacteria. Besides the plasmid having an antibiotic resistance related part- on our first project design -, it is a known and common sequence, which can be easily obtained by DNA synthesis or acquiring the plasmid commercially, for example. Therefore, no major risks were identified on this subject.
Institutional Biosafety Committee
    At IFSC we have an Institutional Biosafety Committee named CIBio IFSC . All the procedures applied in our team’s project have been discussed with the members and no safety concerns were raised.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," gRNA entry vector assembled in one LVL2 plasmid.
Assembly of LVL2 plasmid
We realized that cotransformation of three components into V. natriegens might be challenging and therefore, we designed a plasmid that is a combination of the previously designed LVL1-pTet-Cas9 and the gRNA entry vector BBa_K2560305 . Using our toolbox, we converted the LVL1 construct into a LVL2 plasmid to remove the BsmBI recognition sites that are present in the LVL1 plasmid. Subsequently, we integrated the gRNA transcription unit including the sfGFP dropout into the 5’ Connector via Gibson assembly. Finally, we created a plasmid that possesses a Cas9 CDS with pTet and the gRNA entry sequence to facilitate easy cloning (figure 3).
In most bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, a two plasmid system is used separating Cas9 and gRNA on two different plasmids (Wasels et al. 2017). The reason is that during the process of gRNA cloning, a functional Cas9 transcription unit is present in the same cell with the correctly cloned gRNA, resulting in double strand breaks (DSB) leading to the death of the cells.
Our approach to overcome this challenge is to use E. coli as cloning chassis for the construction of the Cas9-gRNA plasmid which is then transformed in V. natriegens together with a donor template to perform genome engineering. This is possible because the spacer sequence targeting the genome of V. natriegens should not match any sequence in the genome of E. coli and therefore we do not expect creation of DSB.
Designing of donor templates
Different approaches for the design of donor templates are described in literature. The mutation can be introduced either as dsDNA in a linear form or integrated into a plasmid or as ssDNA (Jiang et al. 2015).
We decided to use ssDNA because they can be easily ordered from companies offering synthesis. As a prove of concept we decided to tackle the dns gene on chromosome 1 of V. natriegens, as this mutation has already been shown not to be lethal and to significantly increase DNA yields of plasmid preparations (Lee et al. 2017). We used two ssDNA oligos each targeting the leading or lagging strand. The oligos consists of the desired mutation flanked by 50 bp long homolougous sequences flanking the position of the introduced DSB. The last"

Model
General model
We decided to describe our system with deterministic modeling of ordinary differential equations that describe the molecular biology’s central dogma of gene expression inside the cell.
Reactions
Here we considered transcription, translation and mRNA and protein degradation rates.
Equations
We used the law of mass action to describe the reactants equilibrium. Here we also considered that DNA concentration doesn’t change with time.
Reaction rate description
Translation regulation by sRNA - mRNA interactions
Here, we take the same assumptions as Kelly et al., 2018 (Supplementary Data), considering that bound sRNA-mRNA species have the shorter lifetime than unbound sRNA or mRNA (meaning that the complex degrades before having any chance to unbound), representing then, a first-order reaction.
Circuit modeling
Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a regulatory mechanism by which bacteria regulate the expression of functions for the use of secondary carbon sources in the presence of a preferred carbon source. In gram-positive bacteria, the CCR is mediated by the carbon catabolite control protein A (CcpA) that regulates genes of carbon metabolism when glucose is present in the system.
Our system is based on an anti-leakage orthogonal double repression framework, in which the insulin production is controlled by the expression of an orthogonal T7 polymerase, which is under Ptet control, a promoter repressed by TetR repressor protein. Our designed sRNA prevents leaked Insulin mRNA translation from happening. Finally, both TetR and sRNA’s gene expression are under glucose activated CcpA control, possessing CcpA binding sequence ‘cre’.
1. Induction of carbon catabolite system
We simplified CcpA activation by glucose presence by a simple Hill’s equation, in order to avoid large quantities of complex equations involving metabolic processes. ‘Glu’ represents glucose concentration in the cell, n is Hill constant, ‘Kglu’ is glucose-CcpA affinity constant and CCpA total amount is determined by the sum of initial unbound fraction (CcpA0) and glucose activated fraction (CcpA*).
2. Repression module
This module is composed of two genetic circuits that ensure that our system won’t produce any insulin when glucose is absent. TetR is a repressor protein responsible for blocking T7 polymerase expression, which is the only enzyme responsible for insulin gene transcription, under"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"acto-Aid. At OUH, they have encountered resistant bacterial infections, which required special care and extra awareness. This confirms the problem of resistance and proving how current it is.
One of the main issues with our product, according to Laura Jakobsen, was the absorption capacity of the silk. Burn wounds have a tendency to leak a lot the first few days after the incident. This is an important aspect we should look into if our Bacto-Aid should be used for treating burn wounds. Despite this current limitation of our product, she did see a potential for it as a bandage applied after lymph node removal surgery in the inguinal region. It is a particularly problematic healing region due to the constant pressure it is undergoing (a patient has to sit) and due to the serum accumulation. Serum tapping is an important aftercare that has to be done regularly. It consists of removing the serum produced in the limb, which lymph nodes typically would transport away. It is therefore a highway to infections in this region due to the missing lymph nodes (which also is a center for the immune system), regularly breaching of the skin (barrier to foreign bacteria), and it is a moist area where many types of bacteria from the normal flora of the skin are resident. Bacto-Aid could create a barrier that has antimicrobial effect and thus protecting vulnerable patients from any further complications.
Interviewing Hans Jørn Kolmos
Hans Jørn Kolmos is a professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark. He is an expert in the history of antibiotics and he is familiar with the status of the resistance problem. We had a great talk , where he told us that the media have a tendency to worsen the situation. The Danish documentary “Når penicillin ikke virker"" translated to: “When penicillin does not work” shows the problem in a realistic perspective. We talked about how to tackle the problem and he said: “Nature is smart. Humans have only been here for a few millenniums and microorganisms have been here for billions of years. It would be foolish to believe that we could outsmart nature in a 100 years”. He also said: “we could limit the distribution of antibiotics by following these three steps 1) isolate the potential bacteria 2) ask the question: is the isolated bacteria the reason to the infection or is it something else? 3)  evaluate whether antibiotics can be used against the infection”. As a future plan, or a perspective for our project, he said that the bacteriocins could be used as a local treatment."

IPN-UNAM-Mexico Team Colaboration
Our team has closely collaborated with IPN-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team since the early stages of both projects by the exchange of ideas and discussions about experimental and theoretical issues of both projects.
Throughout the evolution of both projects, complications and doubts became more specific and the collaboration became closer. They helped us with relevant aspects of our project model. In particular, when we were building the model for the diffusion component of our system, we found it quite hard because it incorporated considerable diffusion elements. So, we were assessed by IPN-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team on what finally would be our cellular automaton with discrete diffusion model as the best approach for this section of the project.
Since we had some troubles with a continuous model, they proposed us to use a discrete version of what we were trying to do: the discrete Laplace operator or a"

SAFE PROJECT DESIGN
Biological safety is our priority, especially when our focus are related to the agricultural business. Our team does not want to release and genetically engineered organism into the field, nor to contaminate crop by directly applying the bacteria into the field.
Two Approaches Ensuring Biosafety
Keeping a biological sample quarantined is the key to maintaining biological safety. As a responsible iGEM team, we will not release any of our genetically modified organism outside the laboratory. In our design, we emphasize keeping the biosensors in the laboratory and bringing a soil sample to the laboratory, instead of putting the biosensors to the field for in situ detection of NPK levels.
Using a non-living biosensor is another approach that came to mind. This way"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"
Northwestern,2010,Team:Northwestern#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," damage to the chitin layer, the signalling pathway can be reinitiated to regenerate chitin in the damaged location.
Strategy
Obtaining Chitin Synthase 3 Gene
First, the Chitin Synthase 3 (CHS3) gene is subcloned out of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Baker’s Yeast) cDNA (complementary DNA – contains no introns, thus can be used in prokaryotes) with biobrick restriction sites (EcoR1, Xbal1 on one end, and Spe1, Pst1 on the other). CHS3 was chosen as it was found to be the major enzyme (knockouts had 80% reduced Chitin) in its family and requires no co-enzyme or activating compounds. Upon running CHS3 through NEB Cutter V2.0, we found a PST1 restriction site which is incompatible with the biobrick standard (EcoR1, Xbal, Spe1, Pst1). To remove this Pst1 site, we insert CHS3 into a biobrick vector plasmid, and performed site-directed mutagenesis (SDM).
pMAL Vector
Research revealed that chitin synthase is a transmembrane enzyme, and in order to simulate similar conditions, we decided to use the pMAL vector by NEB which contains a periplasmic membrane signal sequence. CHS3 is subcloned in to the pMAL-p5x NEB vector by first PCR’ing it out of the biobrick vector plasmid - on which it must undergo SDM - with pMAL restriction sites (Nde1 and EcoR1) and ligated into the pMAL-p5x vector. Then, the CHS3 is again amplified with biobrick sites, but this time, with the periplasmic signal sequence native to the pMAL-p5x plasmid, and inserted into a standard biobrick vector. The entire part is then sequenced and submitted to the registry of standard parts. A bacterial apoptosis cassette made by the Brown iGEM team in ‘08 is taken from the iGEM 2010 distribution kit and colony amplified.
Constitutive Promoters & Lac Operon
3 constitutive promoters and 2 lac-inhibitor/lac-operon combination parts are taken from the registry and ligated in all 6 combinations through 3A Assembly. These combinations express different levels of lacI, thus exhibiting variable inductivity. These 6 constructs are then ligated with"

Each vector has its own benefits and drawbacks. Plasmid vectors, such as non-viral DNA vectors, have several advantages over viral vectors. Virus production is expensive ( Templeton et al. 2002 , Nagasaki and Shinkai, 2007 ) and safety of viral transfection remains a concern after several deaths ( McCormack et al. 2004 , Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008 ). However, plasmid vectors have a very low transfection efficiency ( Murakami et al. 2011 ), especially compared to adenoviruses that have been shown to have a 95% transfection efficiency in hepatocytes ( Huard et al. 1995 , Sullivan et al 1997 ). Transfection efficiency of plasmids can be improved through methods such as in vivo electroporation ( Ataka et al. 2003 ). However, this method requires the insertion of electrode needles into the athlete to increase transfection efficiency. This is more invasive to the athlete than a single injection of vector particles.  Therefore, adenoviruses are seen as the most likely transfection method for gene doping at this stage and even more so in the near future. Hence, most of the numerical values were based on this type of vector.

In fact, Sugarfilm system has the potential to apply to any phase-related synthesizing pathway, as long as the intermediate and final products would not have strong interactions with the biofilm structure (either causing damage to biofilm or be damaged by the extracellular materials within biofilm). Second, to better fit the synthesizing procedure, tweaks about the bacterium strain could be done. Better secretion efficiency and preservation of enzyme function are all vital for whole process. Also, with improvement of the basic Rainbofilm model, especially in accelerating biofilm formation, controlling of biofilm thickness and density, and choosing promoters of higher efficiency in each device (anaerobic promoters particularly), Sugarfilm would benefit a lot.
Improvements listed above may be subtle, yet they all mean a lot to the whole system. Sugarfilm, with its versatility and feasibility, has great vista in application in synthesizing work flow. By every small step towards the perfect, we believe Sugarfilm would outstand in the end, as a truly beneficial and powerful method in industry.

NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". Hence, we dichotomized the concentration of nitrate into binary data (the outcomes of Bernoulli trials). Then, in order to fit a general linear model           we use the concentration of nitrate, time as explain variables, and the electrical signals collected from our device as response variables.
Here is the regression equation:
Yij
Electrical signals collected from i th time series data with jth second.
Tij
Time of ith time series data with jth second.
Xi = 1
When the concentration of nitrate above 15 ppm.
Xi = 0
When the concentration of nitrate below 15 ppm.
εij
Random error term of ith time series data with jth second.
After that, we use calibration to forecast the concentration of nitrate within the time series data with our model by minimizing the sum of square of time series data from 1st second to 1800th second. The training sensitivity           and specificity are shown in the table below.
Empirical Model
In order to build an empirical model for our sensing boat, we had done more than 150 experiments to set up our database.
We chose 5 intervals:
0 – 4 ppm
4 – 10 ppm
10 – 20 ppm
20 – 60 ppm
Over 60 ppm
And our sensing device only need to detect the Optical signal on 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min. By using this method, we can easily, quickly and precisely distinguish the concentration into this 5 intervals.
Conclusion
Not only to build a more complete model, according to species and application in the reality, we can also set different intervals by empirical method and any separating level by statistical method. With this advance, we are able to get the results within           20 to 30 minutes, which is quicker and more precise as well.

Meet the team
The 2014 DTU iGEM team is an ambitious team consisting of eight graduate students, four advisors and three main supervisors with a total of five different nationalities. We share a deep interest in chemistry, biotechnology and synthetic biology and work dedicatedly in the cross-disciplinary environment of iGEM. Our group possesses a useful combination of valuable competences, comprising skills in molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling, scientific programming, project management, entrepreneurship as well as scientific and non-scientific communication. Combined our team has a keen interest in state-of-the-art biotechnology and is eager to contribute to the field of synthetic biology.
Fun is fundamental. There is no way around it. You absolutely must have fun. Without fun, there is no enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, there is no energy. Without energy, there are only shades of gray.
- Doug Hall
To create and maintain a dynamic group and enjoyable working atmosphere as well as to keep up our enthusiasm when sitting inside a laboratory while getting snap-chatted by friends on the beach. We of course also went out sunbathing and swimming, enjoyed some cold beers, traditional Danish dinners, and delicious ice creams during the summer.

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," similar DIY bio-survey again. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, the result was quite shocking that we can buy almost everything for the molecular experiment, from the internet. Then, we went through relevant laws and regulations throughout the world, which we found out that there are no laws related to the credit certification and the address certification about the people who book the biology reagent. Most of the laws are about the quality certification and how they would serve the user after they bought this. We interviewed the Director of the center for disease control and prevention. He said that within his experiment with the disease caused by the Bacteria leak, environmental pollution, the vast impact had been caused. Our country has been making all effort which is the highest effort that we have made in the history. He said it is not easy to solve the problem with hard work, it needs the cooperation between all the countries. He made an example of 731 army during the second world war two, the outbreak of pathogens can cause significant social harm. We are still on our way to win the battle, but the effort still needs to be put in.
Community and Future
Also, we hosted two major meeting in Beijing, a Biosafety Forum in October, we invited team leader who runs his high school lab, lab teacher from a university lab, and a former team member from Peking iGEM2009, who participated in that DIY bio investigation ten years ago.
We concluded that the development of DIY bio should be taken seriously, and the permanent way to solve it is through implanting Biosafety awareness into our academic culture. Also, as iGEMer, we should strive to be the considerable and responsible leaders in our community, to ensure the biosafety issue has been taken properly. Another meeting was with biology Olympians all around China, we discussed the future of biology community during the meeting, especially with more and more high school iGEM teams coming up in China, but lack of relevant instruction and education to the students. We came up with the idea of setting up a collaboration between school to share and overcome difficulties hand in hand. This kind of meeting will be continued after iGEM2018, since the community usually grows fast after every iGEM season.
Hopefully, years later, biosafety awareness and considerations can be seriously taken in communities, laboratory studies, and real-world applications.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," with 0.2% glycerol and 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol, to avoid catabolite repression from glucose residues present in LB medium. Two cultures were incubated, of which one was induced with 0.2 % arabinose from the beginning. At OD600=0.1, designated time 0, the cultures were split in two and 0.2 % glucose was added to one of each pair. Samples were obtained at time 0, before division of the cultures, and at 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min.   The resulting images revealed, that the inducer arabinose was required to stimulate expression of YFP, and that the addition of the repressor glucose to a uninduced culture had no effect. Furthermore, it was evident that addition of arabinose induced expression of YFP, and that subsequent addition of glucose terminated the pBAD regulated gene expression on a low copy vector, resulting in a reduced fluorescence level. 30 minutes after inhibition this reduction was already evident, and after 120 minutes the gene expression controlled by pBAD was even further decreased, as seen in Figure 19.
Figure 19. YFP fluorescence levels in E. coli MG1655 transformed with the pBAD-YFP reporter system on pSB3K3. Left: Cultures with the inducer arabinose added. Right: Cultures not induced with arabinose. Both cultures were split up at OD600=0.1, designated time 0, and the inhibitor glucose was added to one half of each culture. Images were obtained at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes.
This experiment made it clear, that gene expression controlled by the pBAD promoter is both inducible and repressible as required when cloned into the low copy vector pSB3K3. Consequently, the pBAD promoter was found to be suitable for controlling gene expression of the antitoxin RelB in the implemented dormancy system.

For these experiments, the promoters controlling an RFP reporter system were cloned into E. coli strain MG1655 on pSB1A2. The cultures were grown in LB medium containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin and examined by fluorescence microscopy. For this purpose an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used, set to an excitation at 550 nm, emission at 573-613 nm, and exposure time at 200 ms, and cultures were taken at OD600=0.3-0.5"

Team Accomplishments
iGEM provided the entire team with learning curves and opportunities that they would otherwise not have had access to. After 5 months of planning, producing and working, it would be a fair assumption to say everybody has worked hard. Our team consisted of four biologists, three physicists, two biochemists and a computer scientist. We feel that this variety in team specialities was especially important in the success of the project.
The beginning of the project can be traced back to a 'bootcamp' week during April, where we were introduced to iGEM, and non-biologists were brought up-to"

Mingdao,2016,Team:Mingdao#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"OX enzyme on bacterial surface by fusing with Lpp-OmpA and apply to the electrochemical analyzer by depositing on the test strip.
DEVELOPING IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter)
In order to replace GOX with bacteria displaying AOX on the cell surface to the sample test strips and apply it to the electrochemical analyzer, we’ve conducted the following experiments to demonstrate it works.
GENE CLONING
AOX genes synthesized by IDT and Lpp-OmpA got from NCTU-Formosa were amplified by PCR followed by restriction enzyme (RE) digestion, and finally cloned onto pSB1C3 based on the biobrick standard assembly rule. The recombinant vectors carrying the AOX genes were checked by colony PCR and RE, and further confirmed by sequencing.
PROTEIN EXPRESSION
GFP reporter gene was expressed and the fluorescence level was assayed to test our gene expression system.
PROTEIN ANALYSIS
Coomassie blue staining was performed on SDS-PAGE to check the expression of AOX gene.
ENZYME ACTIVITY ASSAY
H2O2 production assay was conducted as AOX enzyme activity assay, demonstrating that AOX catalyzed the oxidation of alcohol and generated a product of hydrogen peroxide.
MODELING
An electrochemical simulator was utilized to study the electrochemical properties of AOX enzyme. The experiment was performed by a collaboration with the biotech company, BIONIME CORP. who is a worldwide leader in blood glucose meter innovation.
This year, we’ve done all the experiment to prove the function of AOX and demonstrated the electrochemical activity of AOX with alcohol. Now we’re going to develop IGEM BLOOD ALCOHOL METER (iMeter) by creating an alcohol test strip to apply in an electrochemical analyzer (i.e., blood glucose meter).
There are two Alcohol oxidase (AOX) genes, AOX1 ( CAY72092.1 ) and AOX2 ( CAY71377.1 ), on chromosome 4 in Pichia pastoris . AOX was utilized to provide carbon source and energy for the methylotrophic yeast by metabolizing primary alcohol like methanol. We’d like to apply AOX to alcohol meter in an electrochemical analyzer by catalyzing the oxidation of alcohol and producing hydrogen peroxide (C2H5OH + O2 → CH3CHO + H2O2). AOX1 and AOX2 genes were synthesized by IDT and cloned onto pSB1C3 as BioBrick parts. The"

Promoting healthy ageing and treating age related diseases with synthetic biology.
Slide Number 2
Slide Number 3
Brainstorming sessions
Due to the enthusiasm of the team members, we came up with a variety of interesting ideas during our brainstorming sessions. A few of our discontinued favourites included: a how to survive on mars concept and a means to control the weather (in true British style). At first we found it challenging to narrow our ideas down to one project idea. However, once we explored the potential of each topic in context of the BioBrick components and how we could integrate Human Practices within the idea it became easier. This enabled us to focus upon feasible ideas, with room for creativity, whilst eliminating those which were not suitable.
Next, we looked at existing BioBricks created previously by iGEM teams, and consequently how we could contribute to enlarging the registry and broadening the application of synthetic biology. We found that the whole team really felt that ageing was a great topic to explore within iGEM and has a huge potential to make both social, cultural and economic impact.
BioSynthAge: Do not go gentle into that good night
We envision a time in which the human population lives a healthier life, for longer. We will use synthetic biology to ensure the ageing world population can both maintain their quality of life and extend their lifespan - increasing their ‘healthspan’. The health challenges currently posed by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions to tackle these challenges. Our synthetic biology solutions will include, but not be limited to, the following:
Oxidative stress – the root of the problem
Oxidative stress underlies many of the health problems of ageing so we will develop a number of free radical mopping devices. These devices will include therapeutic bacterial chassis triggered by oxidative-stress to deliver free-radical mopping compounds. To lay a conceptual foundation for genetic tools that address ageing within human cells, we will also use gene"

3. Open day of laboratory
As many freshmen in our college are eager to learn more about biological researchs in labs, we held this open day activity for freshmen in our lab. We led those freshmen students to visit our lab, introduced the function of different equipments and showed them our team video and posters. For many among them, it was first time to visit an advanced biological lab so that many students were strongly impressed by our well-managed lab.
Several months later, a group of high school students from many famous middle schools in Guangzhou came to visit our university. Our college decided to open our lab for visiting and we took charge of this open day again. We tried our best to make this open day a success, for the reason that many of those young high school students might be impressed by this experience, and thus, because of our efforts, they might make their decision to work in science and engineering in the future.
4. Guideposts Making
Our university is quite large and contains several districts, so it is common that visitors get lost in our campus. To help new students in finding their directions, we made many ""iGEM guideposts"" and placed them in different corners of our campus. We wanted to provide convenience for others. Meanwhile, we could also popularize scientific knowledge.
5. Biological graffiti painting
Many students of our university reside in dormitory area which is far away from the main campus. If we want to go to our lab or library, we have to cross a boring as well as dark culvert. In this year, College of Art of SCAU ( South China Agricultural University ) sponsored a beautification of this culvert. We participated in this activity and painted a part of this culvert. Our graffiti showed out a large plant cell and its ultra-structure.
6. Video making
For most college students, science is not always so attractive as sports or computer games, but why can't we show science in a cheerful and colorful way? For this reason, we made this video to introduce our team and synthetic biology in a simple way.

7. Risk assessment
As our project is using rice as a bioreactor to produce astaxanthin, and we also hope that aSTARice can serve as a kind of food in human's daily life, so we are very concerned about the safety of aSTARice.
We believe that risks are mainly embodied in the following two aspects: one is that the encoding products of marker genes might be potentially toxic and allergenic for human or livestock. Antibiotic"

Our biosynthetic device demanded transformation of three deferent plasmids to E. coli cells. This is only possible, if these plasmids carry different antibiotic resistence. So cloning and biobrick assembly required careful planning of cloning strategy. Altogether we made more than four hundred parts. For the purpose of Registry deposition we choose most important 135 parts and inserted them in pSB1C3 backbone.

Terre Haute Children's Museum Synthetic Biology Exhibit
Origins of the Project
The Terre Haute Children's Museum , founded in 1988, features many exhibits on topics ranging from archaeology to architecture. However, the Rose-Hulman team noticed that there are no exhibits on small-scale biology, specifically synthetic biology. Devon and Kristen then took on the project of creating an exhibit to introduce children to the concepts and methods of synthetic biology. The team felt that one of the best ways to get kids interested in synthetic biology was to show them lab equipment that they could touch and play with. The exhibit also gives kids a chance to explore designing DNA sequences. In this way, they can experience a process that synthetic biologists go through.
Exhibit Components
The Design Table, pictured below, introduces children to the idea of putting together DNA sequences.
The instructions on the table ask them to think of ways they would use synthetic biology if they could make cells ""do anything."" The team hopes that this will inspire them to use creativity to explore the possibilities of synthetic biology. Colored magnetic shapes are used to represent DNA. Children can select from different colors, each with a different purpose - the four DNA nucleotide bases, A, T, G, and C, as well as Promoters and Terminators - and align them on the board to create their sequence. They also have the option of putting together various sequences found on cards on the table or create the matching sequence to given DNA sequences. This gives more uncertain children the chance to understand the process. Examples of these cards are seen below.
After creating their sequence, the children move on to the Lab Bench, where they explore four different pieces of lab equipment.
The four stations are:
Microscope
Centrifuge
Pipetting
Media Plates
Each station provides a description of the equipment as well as a procedure for the children to follow in order to gain experience with and understanding of the technology. Questions guide the children along the way and encourage them to think about the purpose or design of each piece of equipment.

To better understand our market, we proceeded in three steps.
1) Surveys and investigations
How is the air pollution issue perceived by citizens, and what potential solutions could be considered? We conceived a survey about the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, for which we received more than 2 300 responses worldwide. We obtained 1 874 answers from Europe, 213 from Asia, 97 from North America, 71 from Africa, 24 from South America and 9 from Oceania. The aim was to better understand the expectations of people concerning air pollution, and if the idea of using Synthetic Biology as a solution was well perceived and accepted. If some people are reluctant to let Synthetic Biology enter their everyday life, most consider that air pollution is a big enough issue to use new tools to fight it.
You may click on the questions to get a better look at the maps
Do you believe you are exposed to air pollution at home?
Do you use any protection against air pollution at home?
How do you feel with the use of synthetic biology to adress a pollution issue?
Would you be interested in an affordable, biodegradable filter to eliminate particulate matters?
2) Meetings with professionals
When sharing our vision and project goals with professionals, we realized the high demand for such a tool and so we became even more confident that it would be a good business opportunity. We discussed several situations and contexts our device could be used in. We benefited from their expertise to further develop our project. We were even told that if our system were to be fully functional, they would be willing to pilot it in the field and seriously consider a future collaboration.
Medicen Summer School on Business Creation in Life Science:
The Institut Pasteur, in partnership with the Medicen Paris Region competitiveness cluster, organized on July 6-7, the second edition of a summer university course, devoted to the creation of a life sciences business. This event aimed to give participants the essential skills needed when launching a business in life sciences (biotech, medtech, e-health, etc.). The Summer School explained the first stages of the creation of a start-up, dealt with the search for initial and secondary financing as well as the essential role of the team in the business creation process.

Considering that the communication and collaboration is a truly important part of doing research of synthetic biology, we promised that we would help them. So, then, they sent us their documents about their circuit and the function they wanted to realize. Our team had a discussion and found something we didn’t understand, so we had a video conference with them to know more about their circuits and confirm those details that we need to build this model. When we had finished a half of the formulation work, they came to our school to had a discussion with us. We showed them our work and asked for their suggestion and after that we confirmed more details and adjust a few equation. After we listed all the equations, we tried to simplify them. And then we begin to bury ourselves in coding, using the Matlab tool. We set a map with some parameters and some cells, with the map and cells’ state we can get new data of each cell and with the new state and the old map we got a new map"

Team:Imperial College London
From 2009.igem.org
For iGEM 2009 the Imperial College London team present you with The E.ncapsulator; a versatile manufacturing and delivery platform by which therapeutics can be reliably targeted to the intestine.
Our E.coli chassis progresses through a series of defined stages culminating in the production of a safe, inanimate pill. This sequential process involves drug production, protective encapsulation and genome deletion. The temporal transition between each of these stages is controlled by physical and chemical methods, showing a clear engineering approach to tackle this problem.
The E.ncapsulator provides an innovative method to deliver any biologically synthesisable compound and bypasses the need for expensive storage, packaging and purification processes. The E.ncapsulator is an attractive candidate for commercial pill development and demonstrates the massive manufacturing potential in Synthetic Biology.
Growth
Growth
The cells are grown to a critical cell density, before the system is started. It allows the culture to reach a sufficient cell number before the the cells are triggered to begin protein production. This is because protein production can slow cell growth.
Module 1: Protein Production
Module 1: Protein Production
The first module is induced with IPTG, which triggers the production of the protein of interest. As part of this project we have looked into two proteins and a peptide of interest.
Module 2: Encapsulation
Module 2: Encapsulation
The second module is where the cell, after having produced the peptide of interest, produces colanic acid. This creates a protecting layer around teh bacterium to shelter it from the acidity of the stomach.
Module 3: Genome deletion
Module 3: Genome deletion
Module 3 occurs after encapsulation of the cell containing the produced peptide of interest. This module makes the bacterium non-viable. It does so by over-expressing restriction enzymes which subsequently cleave the genomic DNA into small fragments. The cell is thus unable to produce any proteins and therefore unable to survive.
Secondary Encapsulation
Secondary Encapsulation
Several manufacturing considerations regarding the post-processing of the culture have been investigated. Post-processing of the culture allows the polypeptide filled cells to be converted into a pharmaceutical tablet, that can be taken orally.
Chemoinduction
Module Integration: Chemoinduction
Module 1 is induced by the addition of a compound, IPTG. This allows the user to 'kickstart' the system once the culture has reached a sufficiently high cell density.
Autoinduction
Module Integration: Auto"

Force 3) Added Mass Force
Added mass or virtual mass is the inertia added to a system because an accelerating or decelerating body must move (or deflect) some volume of surrounding fluid as it moves through it. Added mass is a common issue because the object and surrounding fluid cannot occupy the same physical space simultaneously.
Force 4) Basset/History Force (Due to viscosity)
The basset term accounts for viscous effects and addresses the temporal delay in boundary layer development as the relative velocity changes with time.
Force 5) Surface Forces
Surface forces accounts for short-ranged interactions between E. coli bacteria and surface, electrical double layer interactions, van der Waals forces between surface and the bacteria and the surface tensions between bacteria and its surroundings.
Net Force
Finding Acceleration
Solving for acceleration using Force equals mass times acceleration; mass of E. coli bacteria is used.
Terminal Velocity
The above equation representing the acceleration via net force is still limited as it does not allow us to solve for velocity of the E. coli bacteria containing the gas vesicles at different time scales. This is because due to Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion, the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. If the acceleration is constant, then by first-principle kinematics, the velocity must also be constant. To model this relationship, we used G. Stokes Law, where he derives the basic formula for the drag of a sphere in a remarkable 1851 scientific paper. In this paper, he makes an assumption that the Reynold number is less than unity and is thus mainly concerned with spheres of very small diameter when surrounding a liquid fluid. Likewise, we assumed that E. coli bacteria containing the GVP’s are spherical, small and slow moving, in a laminar flow of homogenous LB, have smooth surfaces and do not interact with one another.

Afin d'etre sur que la g3p soit bien localiser à la surface de la membrane externe, nous avons décidé de fusionner la g3p (délété de son peptide signal) à une biobrique (BBa_K103006), crée par l'équipe de Varsovie 2008, qui contient un complexe OmpA-Linker
La biobrique BBa_K103006 n'etant pas compatible avec le standard que nous avons choisis, nous avons désigner des oligo ajoutant les sufixes et prefixes standard.
Afin de pouvoir garder le systeme de fusion initial grace à SacI, un site SacI à été rajouté en N-ter de la G3P suivant le schéma suivant:
Prefixe-OmpA-Linker-SacI-Suffixe et Prefixe-SacI-(Δ18aa)G3P-Suffixe. Ces deux biobrick peuvent etre inserer dans un vecteur standard.
Le produit de ligation apres digestion par SacI est le suivant Prefixe-OmpA-Linker-SacI-(Δ18aa)G3P-Suffixe, qui est lui même une biobrick, ce qui va nous permetre de l'incorporer à la construction finale"

They gave a basic overview of our scaffold’s use and the underlying science, but then focused on the ethical, legal and commercial implications of our system. The team also presented to academics from the UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular sciences at a staff meeting. This discussion was focused on the science that formed the basis of our scaffold, and was a platform from which academics could later engage with us – by establishing in which parts of our project they were interested.
Outcomes and Analysis
Presenting to the Arts and Social Sciences class was an opportunity to expose the students to synthetic biology, whilst giving us the chance to answer questions from a ‘human practices’ perspective. The presentation was a great way for us to experiment with how people from a non-science background would respond to our project. We were able to fine tune our presenting skills to inspire audiences across a spectrum of possible scientific backgrounds (none, in this case). The presentation itself focused on the open-source nature of the iGEM competition, and compared this with the usual secrecy associated with scientific research and the protective legal frameworks which require secrecy. The questions asked by students were generally more focused around safety concerns.
The feedback received from both groups was positive, and led us to opening up further avenues for future discussion and research. We also managed to shed new light on the challenges surrounding the future of synthetic biology from both a biological and social perspective and how overcoming these challenges will change how we practice medicine, produce food and energy, and manage the environment."

Promoter Assay
Title: Promoter assay for Timp1 and Steap4 promoters in reactive astrocytes.
Conducted by: Nitzan Keidar and Mor Sela
Date: 24.9.18-28.9.18
Aim: Our goal in this experiment is to assess the strength and the specificity of the promoters Timp1 and Steap4 by quantifying the amount of luminescence produced by the Luciferase enzyme cloned downstream of these promoters, under our experimental conditions.
Importance: Our project is based on the assumption that reactive astrocytes can be targeted based on specific genetic markers (e.g Timp1 and Steap4). Non-specific expression can lead to off target activity such as healthy resting astrocytes, microglia or other neighboring brain cells.

Collaboration
The Imperial College London team collaborated with the WITS-CSIR_SA iGEM team. Aspects that were similar in both projects included rewiring of chemotaxis in E. coli. However, the design was different for both projects. We have tried to rewire the chemotaxis of E. coli using structurally similar chemoreceptors that use the endogenous molecular mechanism of chemotaxis, whereas the WITS-CSIR_SA team used the novel concept of riboswitches to rewire the chemotaxis pathway in E. coli. We collaborated in both wetlab and modelling aspects.
1. Wet lab collaboration
Chemotaxis assays are quite difficult to perform correctly and therefore know-how, tips and tricks are essential to know in order to get chemotaxis assays working. In sight of this, a number of skype conversations occurred and a number of relevant scientific papers were exchanged that have given important clues for both teams on how to proceed with the testing for chemotaxis. Due to the distance, short time frame and different BioBricks used to rewire chemotaxis, we did not characterise a BioBrick of WITS-CSIR_SA, nor did they characterise one of our BioBricks. Our dry lab team however, have modelled part of their design.
Figure 1. The members of the WITS-CSIR_SA team (picture courtesy of the WITS-CSIR team).
1.1 Know-how exchange
Both teams have used qualitative assays to analyse chemotactic movement. Even though the setup of the assays used by each team were slightly different, the basic principles remained the same. Both teams have discussed the type of media that should be used to grow cells. Some sources claim that it is necessary for chemotaxis to have overnight cultures grown in Tryptone broth, whereas other sources state that overnight growth in LB broth is sufficient. Both teams have agreed that growing overnight cultures in LB does not affect the ability of the bacteria"

We had prepared our own poster and had a chance to present it to the other teams and get their input to our project while practicing presenting a scientific poster. We had a chance to listen to presentations by Cees Dekker, Denis Murphy and Dirk Stemerding, who surely gave us a lot to think about, regarding the current state of the art and ethical questions. Nevertheless, the most important outcome from both of these conferences were the people we met and befriended with while discussing synthetic biology, iGEM and saving the world in general.

On the other hand, Figure 8 clearly shows a clustering of chains after the same amount of iterations, which would be expected if all chain interactions are favourable. As the energy input in both cases yields the expected results, we can conclude that the lattice model can be used to simulate the phase separation of polymers in solution and that it can be used to model the interactions between Cas13a and TDPs.
Figure 7: Two states of a simulation without favourable protein interactions. To the left, the initial state of the simulation is shown immediately after it is generated, to the right, the environment is shown after 50 000 iterations.
Figure 8: Two states of a simulation with exclusively favourable protein interactions. To the left, the initial state of the simulation is shown immediately after it is generated, to the right, the environment is shown after 50 000 iterations. Clusters of TDPs can be recognized, confirming the hypothesized protein-protein interactions.
Preservation of Cas13a activity by different types of TDPs
To determine which TDP preserves Cas13a activity upon drying best, we investigated the behaviour of CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 330 20 and SAHS 68234 with Cas13a at a concentration of 1 g/L and a volume fraction of 0.1, since Boothby et al. 2017 showed that LDH activity was already well preserved at a TDP concentration of ~ 1 g/L. The simulations were run over 300000 iterations. One of these simulations (SAHS 33020, 1 g/L, volume fraction 0.1) is shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9: Simulation of Cas13a with SAHS 33020 at a concentration of 1 g/L and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
Both the migration of proteins towards Cas13a and formation of protein clusters is visible. However, protein clusters that form further away from Cas13a tend to remain in place and attract other chains. This is also visible in Figure 10, which plots the number of SAHS 33020 proteins at different distances from Cas13a over the number of iterations. During the simulation the area close to Cas13a clearly attracts other proteins as visible in the lower bottom part of the figure. However, while there is a general movement towards Cas13a, tend to stay in clusters for an extended amount of time, as is for example visible at around 150000 iterations. To observe migration of more TDP"

Biocircuit:
Biocircuit is an adaption of team USTC-Software-2015's project. It is an integrated system based on Espresso, designed to construct and evaluate biological circuit. The project is also available on GitHub, which means one can download all the source code and test it. Members of team USTC-Software-2015 use TravisCI for continuous integration and coverall for coverage test at the backend, while Chai, Mocha and phantomJs assure the website is displayed as expected."

UESTC-software,2016,Team:UESTC-software#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," AHTU_China
In the dry-lab testing of our project, we invited team AHUT_China to help us accomplish the task together. As the developer, we tested our project to prove it had the intended function. Further, we needed someone who knew little about the development of Bio101 to do a more objective testing. Team AHUT_China tested the fault tolerance and randomness of Bio101 as our first user and offered us with a software testing report. Besides, they analyzed bzip2 compression algorithm we used in Bio101 through building mathematical model.

We also kept in touch to get timely feedback on the problems arising from the operation of Bio101. On September 16th, 2016, we had a video conference with AHUT_China. We both introduced our projects to increase interaction and understanding. Their project for this year is about BIO-COMPASS2.0, which is used to get optimal solution of path planning through bio navigation. Before putting into practice, extracting and storing information of a region in the map are needed, and our Bio101 can bring about convenience to their database storage and ensure their applications into reality, which is an exploration during our cooperation. Most importantly, we feel very grateful for what they have done for us.
iGEM Southwest China Union Meetup
We are developing and growing
Last year, UESTC iGEMers led the establishment of iGEM SouthWest Union of China (iSWU), which is a sustained platform for all the iGEMers in the southwest region of China. Nowadays, iSWU has a markedly increase in the number as well as the kind of teams.
This year, there were four universities and one organization interested in synthetic biology participated in the iSWU communication held in Sichuan University. The meetup focused on the theme, “To promote the communication and cooperation among iGEM teams in the southwest region of China” and the main activity forms were to discuss teams’ projects and to share experience. It gave all teams an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding and exchanging.

We are recognized and encouraged
In communication meeting, professors impressed the innovation awareness and excellent iGEM quality on us. Yun Zhao, the vice-president of SCU college of life sciences, stressed that there is no need to mention first time in science, all science to do is the first time. Nianhui Zhang, the coach of SCU, shared the experience of his iGEM team leading trip"
