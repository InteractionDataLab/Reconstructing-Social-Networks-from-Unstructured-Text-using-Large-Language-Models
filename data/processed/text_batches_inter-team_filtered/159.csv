BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," infused to our modified pUC19, just after lac promoter and RBS B0034. New plasmid is transformed into strain E. coli BL21-Stbl3. We also design another Stbl3 with plasmid contains VHb but without TorA signal peptide as contrast.
Fig.1
We select single colony from each plate culture medium then inoculate them into 20 ml LB fluid medium containing 0.1% antibiotics (except for wild type). Culture them in a shaking table at 37℃ overnight, then use M9 fluid medium to dilute them to OD600 reach 0.01. Here, each strain is separated into two kinds of growth.
Aerobic growth was conducted using 50 ml flasks containing 10 ml of culture medium under rotary shaking at 200 rpm; microaerophilic growth was conducted using a 50 ml flask containing 100 mL of culture medium under rotary shaking at 100 rpm. Collect 200 μl bacteria solution to 96well plate each 4 hours use microplate reader to monitor its OD600.
Fig.2 Growth Curve for VHB and Tor-VHB
Fig 3. SDS-Page gel result of periplasm protein.
Under aerobic condition, bacteria grow faster after adding TorA signal peptide, and the K value has improved. As for microaerophilic environment, bacteria can maintain stable growth trend for a long time after adding TorA signal peptide.
All these results suggest that our new part can make VHb work better than before and give bacteria growth advance.

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2011,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," infection of a bean root with our strain would kill or exclude other strains from the root and deprive the bean from the nitrogen fixation process. The free life viability would allow our strain to remain in the soil and infect more plants in its surroundings. The constant competition for roots would always exclude nitrogen fixating bacteria, stopping the fixation process at all in the release environment, affecting all life forms given that nitrogen is required by all organisms.
We believe this scenario to be completely out of the question for the following reasons:
The strain that we are working on (CFN42) presents a naturally very low fitness when competing with other Rhizobium etli strains.
The hydrogen production system consumes reductive metabolites, which carry energy. This consumption is expected to reduce the modified strain fitness compared to its unmodified counterpart.
None of the hydrogen pathway components are expected to interfere with the bacterium-plant communication, or the infection system. So our strain is not expected to increase its infection efficiency.
It is possible that hydrogen production interferes with nitrogen fixation, either reducing its efficiency or inhibiting it at all. Yet, Phaseolus vulgaris has a system that senses nitrogen fixation and has the ability to kill bacteria lacking the system. If nitrogen fixation is lost the strain infection efficiency is expected to be diminished by this system.

Overview
In this country profile, information of synthetic biology in South Korea is compiled from different on-line sources such as government website, official government annual reports, news articles, and reviews. Searches were conducted in both English and Korean media. This country profile contains information about different aspects of synthetic biology in Korea, including regulation, research, people, perception, and organization. However as specific classification of work under the moniker of ‘synthetic biology’ is still uncommon in South Korea, wherever a specific aspect of information cannot be found described under synthetic biology, we have obtained the same information under the wider field of ‘biotechnology’. Information about biotechnology may be inferred to see the general growth trend of synthetic biology and its future development. In fact, biotechnology research institutes and companies are the ones that are most likely to adopt the synthetic biology approach (Hranueli, 2013).
In general, synthetic biology is a small but rapidly growing field in Korea. This trend is guided by a comprehensive plan called the Bio-Vision 2016. In 2006, the Korean government announced the Bio-Vision 2016 as a 10 year plan aimed at developing Korea’s biotechnology capabilities into making the nation a leader in the field. Needless to say, this has also allowed synthetic biology to gain a foothold in Korea (Cho, 2006)
Synbio Map
The SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ). It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology all round the world. This map was created at the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and the application and commercialisation of scientific concepts. I am excited to be involved with Darwin's toolbox as it is a chance to expand the use of synthetic biology into new areas and gives me an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to bringing a technology to market.

BioBrick Workshop
We planned and hosted a three-days BioBrick Workshop to introduce to ourselves and to students from the University of Southern Denmark and University of Copenhagen teams all the tools necessary to complete our projects. The workshop consisted of a mix of lectures, lab work and social events.
Full sequencing of BioBricks
We have verified the sequence of our submitted biobricks by sequencing them on the Ion Torrent that we are lucky to have on the institute. Depart from our own biobrick we saw the opportunity to fully sequence other already existing biobricks. 7 samples were picked which contain very useful backbones that every team get with the DNA samples from iGEM HQ. These 7 backbone bricks are the following:

Guelph,2008,Team:Guelph#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"iotic for intestinal health. We will then test these microbes for beta carotene production (which ever we end up being able to get to work) in conditions simulating those we are interested in, such as human intestines. Take a look at our strategy :
Our strategy :
2) RNAi inducing corn endophytes (BIGS)
Functional genomics is the study of gene function in an organism through (genomics) informed study of transcription, translation, interactions, and phenotype. A common way to do this is by making mutants and assaying for different phenotypes; a very convenient way to accomplish this is by using RNA interferance (RNAi). Usually this is done by making transgenic plants expressing RNAi constructs, and is stable but limited by the difficulty and length of time it takes to produce the transgenic plant. In the case of corn, this means almost a full year before you can test your gene function.
An alternative is called viral induced gene silencing (VIGS) which can uses a plant specific virus to deliver and transiently silence the gene. An obvious limitation here is that it is a transient process even if it has been developed for a particular plant, which it has not been for corn.
We propose a happy medium which would be relatively easy and cheap, stable during the whole lifecycle of the plant, Biobrick compatible (allowing RNAi constructs to be made from any biobrick compatible fragment) and importantly, quick and effective. Bacterial Induced Gene Silencing (BIGS) will employ an endophytic microbe (lives mutualistically inside a plant) to deliver an RNAi signal against a plant gene in order to study that gene's function. We are hoping that as these microbes die, they will release these molecules into the medium, and since plants are very sensitive to these double stranded RNA molecules, they will sense AND systemically amplify the signal across the entire plant body.
There are relevant precedants for this area of research, but it has never before been done using endophytes in plants which could theorhetically produce this signal during the entire life cycle of the host. Here are some relevant publications supporting the potential of our work which we will not further discuss:
Spraying RNAi E. Coli onto plants to protect against viruses - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=153545

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Cooperation with other teams
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are some cases they ignored. And also, we help them optimize the process of their experiment and gave them a hand on the analyzing of their result. At the same time, we invited them to our laboratory, showed them how our experiment goes on and also, gave them some advice on the operations they should take care of when they did their experiment. And they also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and all of us had a great and meaningful day!

-A 10% denaturing acrylamide gel was cast in preparation for the endonuclease assay. Due to literature referencing PIN working best with Mn2+ ions, different ion concentrations were prepared (3mM concentrations of MnO2, MnCl2*4H20, and MgCl2 were made). While the gel was casting, the reactions were prepared.
-There were 12 reactions, with three sets of 4 different conditions (RNA control, RNA+WT PUF-PIN, RNA+6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN, and RNA+WT PUF-PIN+6-2/7-2 PUF-PIN) with the three sets comprised of the three different ions used. The amounts of each reagent include 5 uL of each protein (or H20 when not included), 2 uL of RNA, 2 uL of loading dye, and 1 uL of ions ~ 15 uL reaction. The reactions were incubated in 37oC for 30 minutes and then loaded into the gel once the gel was pre-ran. The gel was ran for 40 min. at 240V with 1X TBE buffer.
-Once the gel was done, it was stained in 10 ug/mL EtBr for 20 min. and destained in H20 for 20 min. whereupon it was imaged with GelDoc XR. The gel image showed no signs of RNA so new a new 10 ug/mL EtBr stain was prepared and the gel was stained again for 20 min. followed by a 20 min. destain with H20. The gel was imaged again and there was were no signs of RNA.

Discussion:
Compare new and old plate, it comes out that some is wrong with the plate for its antibiotic function.
We thinks there may be two reason for this:
1.the antibiotics is inactived.
2.there is some distribution problem in the production of plate.
3.there is some concentration issue with the antibiotic.
There is also some problem with the ligation of TPRC6 and PBX133 backbone.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2017,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Bioproduction_-_-_TEXT.html,"uctose which has a delayed growth. The HPLC analysis showed us that BL21-AI-Dpe is able to produce up to 9 g/L of psicose from 50 g/L and 80 g/L of fructose in the medium and that there is a proportional relationship between the fructose concentration and the psicose measured. No psicose was produced with our negative control which was expressing RFP.
In these results we did not reach saturation of the enzyme with 80 g/L of fructose. Therefore, we wanted to test the highest concentration of fructose and see if the yield could be enhanced. So, we used higher concentrations of fructose and we observed that only the cultures with 50 g/L of fructose showed a high growth rate.
Figure 6. Growth curves of BL21-AI-Dpe for higher fructose concentrations in a MS medium. The concentrations used are 50 g/L, 100 g/L, 150 g/L or 300 g/L.
As we can see in figure 6, the increase in the fructose concentration is inversely proportional to the growth of this strain. The high concentrations might create an osmotic stress on the cultures. We decided to use a concentration of 50 g/L of fructose to ensure high levels of growth and psicose production.
Impact of the Induction Intensity on Psicose Production
Finally, we wanted to investigate if we could enhance the yield of the bioproduction by increasing the IPTG induction, thus increasing the quantity of Dpe in the cells.
Figure 7. Growth curves and psicose production of BL21-AI-Dpe in a MS medium, depending on the induction intensity. The induction is made at a OD600 with 0,1 mM, 0,5 mM, 1 mM or 5 mM of IPTG. A) Growth curves. B) Psicose production.
As we can observe from the results presented in figure 7, we have the same growth rate regardless of the amount of inducer (IPTG) added to the media and also the production of psicose is similar, around 8 g/L. The intensity of the induction of our Dpe did not optimize our bioproduction.
Conclusion
We achieved the bioproduction of D-Psicose using recombinant E. coli cells expressing the D-Psicose 3-Epimerase from Clostridium cellulolyticum (UniProt ID B8I944). The strain was capable of producing 9 g/L of psicose for 50 g"
Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," we produce would significantly reduce the wastage of fresh produce.
Oz Harvest held the Sydney version of their annual Think.Eat.Save.event at Martin Place on Monday July 25th. Across the country, more than 22,000 meals made from “waste” food were given away in a bid to raise awareness. The event involved multiple guest speakers, including representatives from sponsors including Woolworths and from top chefs including Neil Perry and Matt Moran, and there was encouragement to fundraise and support the food saving movement.
We were able to engage with a wide range of people, especially from the corporate world, to chat about how our project was also going to play a crucial role in minimising specifically produce wastage. We even spoke to OzHarvest volunteers about how we could further become involved, which led to Claudia attending a volunteer induction day to become a fully fledged OzHarvest volunteer!
This was a chance to engage with the community in a very different way. We were able to give our time to promote their message, whilst spreading our message about the potential benefits of synthetic biology too. Discussions that were had with OzHarvest volunteers were also very influential on the design of the final biosensor. To find out more, and read how we used this information, click here .
USYD article
One of our team members, Liam, was featured in an article published by the Faculty of Science at The University of Sydney, which gave us the opportunity to spread the iGEM message on another platform. This article was published on the Faculty’s website.
Social Media
Sydney iGEM 2016 engaged with people all over the world, and particularly with other iGEM teams, through our multiple social media channels. We had an Instagram account with 97 followers (at time of writing), and a Facebook page with a following of 112 people (at time of writing) where we regularly posted pictures and updates of our project, as well as the occasional blooper when an experiment didn’t quite go to plan! Social media was a valuable outreach tool as it allowed us to share more specific details of experiments we conducted and of upcoming outreach events at which we would be presenting, such that those who were interested in our project were more informed. It also allowed us to reach a much wider audience.

UNDERGRADUATES
Camille Bernard
Camille has begun her cursus by studying chemistry, physics and mathematics in Classe Prépa. Then she decided to enter in a biotechnology school (ESBS) in Strasbourg because she was keen to learn how the living works. She was interested in taking part of this experience insofar as it is a chance to lead a project since the beginning, from the idea to the culmination. Furthermore it was the opportunity to work with a motivated team and to test our limits. Besides, Camille loves Morgane’s cake; it is the best ATP source in the world!!
Fabian Stiefel
Fabian is now in the ninth semester and so at his last year as student at the Ecole supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS). Before he entered the ESBS he studied two years of chemistry at the University of Freiburg, Germany. The idea of trilingual courses in four Universities in three different countries was and is very thrilling to him. He is very fond of synthetic biology and he wants to continue in this domain"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," we identified which one was causing the problem.
Western blots of the DSF system showed successful expression of all three proteins; RpfC, RpfG and Clp.  We then set up for an inducible GFP production assay, by spiking overnight cultures of transformed E. coli MC1061 with a range of concentrations of synthetic DSF.  Similar to our BDSF system, GFP appeared to be expressed at all concentrations, including 0 µM! We need to come up with a plan, quick!! Sequencing of the PAI-1 system showed that the nanoluc sequence was missing, hmm…..
Week 15
Repeated ligations of PAI-1 system with nanoluc luciferase. The final sequencing results from the BioBricked rpfc was celebrated with party hats...no more BioBricks for Dimitrios, woohooo!!
We received our 3D printed L.A.S.S.O., it looked great but didn’t fit together as planned… out with the Stanley knife! No problem.  The GFP assay of the DSF system showed similar results to that of the BDSF system; surely not?! The experiment was repeated and the same results obtained. Oh, dear!
The final L.A.S.S.O. design was almost complete, with only some means of safe disposal for our engineered bacteria to be factored in. We settled on a design that would involve sealed petri-dishes containing freeze-dried E. coli with a one-way valve on the lid, through which a sample of sputum and water would be passed. The plate would then be inserted into the L.A.S.S.O. and all sources of external light eliminated by sliding flaps. The photodiode would pick up luminescence from the luciferase, expressed in response to the bacterial signaling molecule of interest, and send a voltage to the Arduino. This would pass this signal via a µUSB cable to a computer, where an application would interpret the signal into an email containing information about the bacterial species present, which would be sent to a clinician. The plate would then be transferred mechanically into an isolated waste compartment which can be removed and emptied into a biological waste container when full.
Week 16
Why are our sensors constantly producing GFP?? Instead of painstakingly removing each gene, we decided (on the advice of the University’s top microbiologist Prof. Tracy Palmer) to blot the DSF and BDSF systems for GFP when only the promoter/reporter fusions were present. This was a breakthrough as the PmanA-gfp fusion still showed GFP expression while the Pc"
Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#Coil system_-_-_TEXT.html," mentioned above, we made a variant of GFP + E-coil without a histidine-tag by using the sequencing reverse primer (which anneals to the backbone) instead of the self-designed backward primer.   To produce and test our fusion protein, the constructs were both ligated behind an IPTG inducable promoter. The presence of fluorescence was tested by inducing the transformants with IPTG and exposing them with UV light.  In order to make more sensitive measurements fluorescence microscopy was used.
Results
After some trouble with the PCR reactions at the beginning, the correct construct was obtained and ligated into BBa_J04500 (behind an IPTG induced promoter) and sequenced. To make this part available for the Registry of Standard Biological Parts this construct was also ligated into a pSB1C3 plasmid backbone resulting in the biobricks BBa_K883704 and BBa_K883705 )  After IPTG induction fluorescence could be seen for both transformants containing the biobricks BBa_K883704 (IPTG induced promoter + GFP fused to a coiled coil) and BBa_K883705 (IPTG induced promoter + GFP with a His-tag fused to a coiled coil) (Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11). This proves that the GFP is still functioning after the addition of a coil as well as a coil and a Histidine tag.   The functionality of GFP in the fusion protein was also tested and confirmed for the construct in the pSB1AK3 backbone (Figure 8, Figure 11).

Using fluorescence microscopy, the intensity of the fluorescence could be measured observed more accurately.  Pictures where taken of each of the tranformants prior IPTG induction (in a liquid culture) as well as after growing on a IPTG containing plate overnight (Figure 11).

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#People1_-_-_TEXT.html," PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer , who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten , helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
Jussi Jäntti (VTT) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of yeast strain and provided us with protocols for some of the yeast lab work.
Pezhman Mohammadi (Aalto University) was the go-to person whenever we faced problems with protein work, be it in the practical work or designing the experiment. He gave us useful advice on protein purification and helped choose parameters for FPLC. He advised us on homology modeling, codon optimization for the enzyme production, and also helped order the enzyme constructs.
Dominik Mojzita (VTT) gave us advice related to stress reactions and yeast strain choices. He provided valuable input on yeast stress response, choice of linkers, enzyme activity controls, and also suggested the use of FACS.
Mari Piirainen (Aalto University) helped us with practical problems related to yeast, and also taught us how to use FACS.

REACTIVITY OF SERUM ANTIBODIES WITH H. pylori
 
In our experiment we used fluorescently labeled antibody fragment goat F(ab)2 anti-mouse IgG-PE to detect IgG reaction with H. pylori. Collected H. pylori cells were washed with FACS (10x PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Azide) buffer and incubated  for 30 min on ice  in 100 µl FACS buffer containing  8 µl serum. After that bacteria were washed again and incubated for 30 min on ice in FACS buffer containing F(ab)2 goat anti-mouse IgG fragment, conjugated to phycoerythrin (Beckman Coulter), to a final concentration 0.01 mg/ml. After another washing and resuspension step, samples were placed in reaction tubes and analyzed with flow cytometry.

It also regulates both the survival and differentiation of melanocytes, and enzymes which are necessary for melanin production. (Levy et al., 2006; T.J. Hemesath et al., 1994; N.J. Bentley et al., 1994;  K. Yasumoto et al., 1994; C. Bertolotto et al., 1998). So, the regulation of multiple pigmentation and differentiation related genes by MITF (Levy et al., 2006) convinced us that MITF is a central regulator of melanogenesis.
There are evidences for the accumulation of H2O2 in vitiliginous skin  (K. U. Schallreuter et al., 1999, 2001, 2006) and low levels of SOD and CAT (A. Jalel et. al., 2008; Koca R et. al., 2004; K. U. Schallreuter et al. 1991; Maresca V et. al. , 1997; ). It was also shown that calcium uptake is defective in vitiliginous skin in keratocytes (K. U. Schallreuter et al. 1988) as well as Melanocytes(K.U. Schallreuter et al., 1996), later the effect of accumulation of H2O2 in the epidermis of patients with vitiligo which leads to disruption calcium homeostasis in the skin was observed (K. U. Schallreuter et al. ,2007). This suggests that an oxidative stress is a pathogenic event in the degeneration of melanocytes (Strömberg S et al. ,2008).
We hypothesized that extra levels of SOD could improve the Melanocytes survivability and help re-pigmentation.
When thinking about re-pigmentation in vitiliginous skin, the first thing comes to mind is lack of melanin. There are evidences that melanocytes are still available in depigmented epidermis of patients with vitiligo even after 25 years (Tobin DJ et. al., 2000). So if melanocytes can't deliver melanin to keratinocytes or they are producing very low amount, it is possible to produce melanin using synthetic biology and deliver it to help re-pigmentation.

3.3 Analyses
Chart 3-1: Relationship of the major and the knowledge about iGEM
From this chart, we can see that people who major in Biology, Science and Engineering know iGEM better.
Chart 3-2: the opinions people hold about synthetic biology of different ages
Through this chart, we find that the youth always hold more possitive opinions to Synthetic biology comparing to the elders.
3.4 Conclusion
From these results, we come to a conclusion that the popularity of iGEM has been larger day by day. But it’s still necessary for us to introduce iGEM and Synthetic biology to the public who know nothing about it, and that is what we are doing now.
What make us excited is that almost everyone have a strong awareness of Biology safety, thus we will pay more attention to safety in our future experiments.
What is particularly worth mentioning is most of them hold positive attitudes to Synthetic biology, which encourages us a lot.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"SELF Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

USTC,2017,Team:USTC-Software#implementation_-_-_TEXT.html," The initial data is actually a snapshot of iGEM, containing most information of the bricks. However certain fields, such as group name or parameters, are missing in it, so we complement it by crawling iGEM's web pages. Such behaviour is ""lazy"", which means it will not be invoked before deploying, but before a specific brick's data is accessed for the first time. Fetched data will be cached in the database, and be updated per 10 days to keep updated.
About Data Organizing
The initial data will be imported into a separate database (by default it is named igem). Biohub will link to it by creating virtual tables using MySQL's database view technology. Using database views may lower the speed of querying, but it provides more flexibility for data upgrading. If newer initial is available, we can upgrade the database simply by reloading igem database, rather than dropping and recreating the tables in production environment. Also it can prevent data redundancy. If multiple instances with different database configuration are deployed on the same machine, only one copy of initial data needs to exist in the database, saving the space of disks.
About Bricks Ranking
Before ranking, we have to filter the initial data, since there exists many apparently useless bricks on iGEM. Such process will occur before deploying. We simply drop those bricks without DNA sequence, and dumped the filtered data into a new table (by default it is named igem.parts_filtered). At the same time we will pre-process some fields, such as extracting subparts information from edit cache, and pre-calculating some components of the ranking weight. You may refer to updateparts.py to see this process.
Then we will rank the bricks for the first time, using multiple statistical methods. You may refer to refreshweight.py to see such process. At this stage, the bricks are completely ranked by initial data, without any factors from Forum.
After the server starts up, we will recalculate the ranking weights every 30 minutes. The reason for not evaluating them in real time is that the task may update the whole table and become time-consuming. From now on, Biohub will gradually correct the deviation in bricks ranking.
About Optimizing ABACUS
ABACUS is a plugin inherited from last year's project. It consumes great amount of memory during executing, and causes the prossibility to break down the main server. Such accident did happen in testing phase of USTC-Software 2016. To avoid it, we improved ABACUS and enable it to run in two ways: locally or distributedly.

Introduction
IGEM encourages participants to conduct human practice, to see the world, and to exchange experience with other people. We love this idea because it offers us a chance to get inspired by the society, allows us to better understand the meaning of our scientific research, and constantly reminds us how and why we should contribute back to the society. Therefore, we strived to integrate human practice activity closely into our project advancement.
We began by surveying the public knowledge of intestinal diseases and by interviewing three leading professionals (doctors and researcher) to get a vivid understanding of the severity and incidence of intestinal diseases. We realized intestinal diseases including IBD, are big threats to human health, yet without a cure and without sufficient public acquaintance. We therefore decided to tangle IBD by engineered bacteria and succeeded in proof-of-concept experiment in using bacteria produced therapeutic agent (EGF) to alleviate IBD symptoms. During the communications with other teams , we received concerns on safety issues that we must deal with. So we upgraded our biosafety strategies by not only using two types of kill switches, but also using a 'warship' (which limits bacteria spreading and still allows nutrient and chemical exchanging). In addition, in the spirit of raising public interests, we established an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI) to advertise the beauty of synthetic biology to the community. Meanwhile, we used posters and popular social media to introduce intestinal bowel disease and our work to the society.
Interviews
At the beginning of our project design, we thought of many possible treatments but during the process of reasoning we encountered some difficulties. In the spring of 2016, at National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, we interviewed Professor Pengfei Lu who was a researcher at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester. He specializes in development and proliferation.
When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD,"

We explored the idea of using magnetic bead pulldown assays as a simpler and more universally applicable testing method in comparison to microfluidic assays. We began by performing a sandwich assay using biotinylated thrombin aptamer 1 and Cy3 labeled thrombin aptamer 2. Unfortunately, the experiment did not provide good results.
Elia, Lena, Lisa, Malek:
The team tried to do a titration of the EGFP toehold in PURE and following negative results we found a mutation in the sequence.
We attempted to incubate LacZ and LacZ-α toeholds with all the trigger variants and the results obtained did not provide useful information.
The final and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to activate EGFP toehold was performed.
On the other hand, we finally managed to successfully titrate trigger RNA, from 1.1 uM to 240 nM, in PURE.
Moreover, the successful triggering the EGFP toehold in M15T7 lysate, and comparing the effects of adding pure GamS vs TOP10 lysate containing GamS, was achieved.

CLES-Con 2017
During the early stages of our project when we were generating our initial ideas in which to base our project on we were also given the     opportunity to present what we felt were are most promising project proposals at the Exeter University College of Life and Environmental Sciences    conference (CLES-Con). At the end of our presentation there was time given for a Q&A with the audience, comprised of both academic staff and PhD     students from a range of disciplines. This helped us to both gage the audience’s response to our ideas and allow them to express any concerns with    the proposed projects.
Additionally this was an opportunity for us to network postgraduate students and academics at our university and raise the profile    of iGEM throughout the University's departments . Most significantly CLES-Con enabled us to develop relationships with those attending the     conference which has proved to be very beneficial during the course of our project.
Continued Outreach
[image reference: http://www.exeterphoenix.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cafe_scientifique.jpg]
As a team we are very proud of the work we have accomplished over the last few months. Additionally, we feel like the work we have conducted seeks to solve an important local problem, one which we would like to raise the profile of in our local community. As a result we have organised a Café Scientific for February 2018. This will be a great opportunity to show case our work, create awareness about mine water pollutants, generate some interest in the iGEM competition and introduce more people to synthetic biology. Click here to see the upcoming events at Exeter Café Scientifique .
We are continuing our work to bridge the gap between the social and natural science by delivering a presentation about responsible research and innovation by presenting to social scientists from ‘BEM3009 – Ethics and Organisations’, a third year module taken by third year students in the University of Exeter’s Business School. This final presentation completes our series of presentations, where we have engaged with natural and social science undergraduate students as well as students from a college level. We would not like to limit ourselves to this and would like to further spread the importance of responsible research and innovation, targeting students and academics from other areas of the natural sciences."

Aitor worked in the DryLab to assess the reproducibility of the                                     PCR for all the celiac-associated alleles and to characterize the molecular                                     interactions of the HLA-DQ-gliadin complex. He also occasionally helped in WetLab                                     tasks and in the collection and documentation of celiac disease information. As                                     other team members, he lent a hand during the last stages of Wiki implementation.
Marta Clariana
Marta contributed spreading the fundraising by different                                     channels, promoting the project to as many people as possible with the help of the                                     crowdfunding platform, in order to make our project visible to the public. She also                                     collaborated in some aspects related to marketing, such as instagram, scientific                                     divulgation, divulgation of celiac disease in bars and the DNA workshop.
Tatiana Carol
Tatiana was our web developer. She conducted all the tasks                                     related to the design of the wiki. She is such a great artist. Besides, she                                     invested much of her time to give us tips to boost our communication skills.                                     Working hand in hand with her was priceless; thanks to her, we took our programming                                     skills to a whole new level.

Background:
I studied  biology 4 years in Abant İzzet Baysal University in Turkey. I started my first abroad  experience with Sweden three years ago as an exchange student at Halmstad University where I studied renewable energies. After my graduation,I came back to Sweden for my master studies. Now, I think that studing biology in engineering perspective is very exciting,creative and more interesting to me.
Why I chose to participate in iGEM:
I am very happy I could take part in this team.It is very fun to work with a team.I feel that I am learning a lot from my team-mates not only how to collaborate and manage a Project but also I improve my communication skills and prova min Svenska :) I define synthetic biology as a fascinating world of science where you can apply your imaginations  and create your fascinating designs. I believe that ‘iGEM’ competition is a really good start to get in this fascinating world. ‘Thanks to iGEM providing this  great oppurtunity to us’.

Background:
Having discovered that I had profound interest in biology at an early age, I decided to take on natural science in high school. This later evolved into a deeper interest in the field of biotechnology; so naturally I thought this was the route to take on the road towards higher education.
Consequently I applied to Uppsala University for the programme in Molecular Biotechnology and am now in my fifth and final year.
Why I chose to participate in iGEM:
Synthetic biology is a field with a bright (no pun intended) future. As such, I felt compelled to partake in such an intriguing project where the building blocks of nature were to be understood and utilised for somewhat unnatural purposes.
Interests:
Football, music and The IT Crowd.
Role:
Involved with the the web site group as well as the biosafety group.

At the same time, we hope that every team in this competition may focus on the precaution of the nematode attack, and disseminate the harms of the nematode attack to the public together.
Dear iGEM Foundation & all iGEM teams:
We are team BNU-CHINA. After our three-month investigation in the rural area, we discovered that there were many omissions in prevention and treatment of the nematode outbreak. The local government failed to take the correct methodology to preclude and deal with the attack and there was also a short in agro-technician in the countryside as well. As a result, whenever there is an outbreak, the local farmers will suffer a heavy loss in crop yield. So we hope that we could share the knowledge of the nematode attack with more people, which may be helpful to improve the situation. At the same time, we also wrote a proposal to attract government’s attention to help the villagers. Here is the letter:
Honorable officials of agricultural department:
We are an iGEM team from Bejing Normal University, BNU-CHINA. iGEM is the highest-level competition in synthetic biology. The purpose of this competition is to build a biological model through the technology of synthetic biology based on relevant issues. The ultimate goal for us is to solve the practical and momentous problems in agriculture, environment protection, human health and so forth. This year our topic is the prevention of the agricultural nematodes. Plant parasitic nematode is a common kind of agricultural pests. There are many kinds of nematodes including Meloidogyne spp., Heterodera spp., Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and so on. These nematodes jeopardize the crops and woods. In the process of our project, we step out of the campus and to the countryside to do a practical investigation in our leisure time.
During our investigation, we found the following problems:
The strength of supervision of the agricultural comprehensive serving center in county is very weak， and whose connection with the local habitants is not close enough. The staff doesn’t communicate with the residents in time and the feedback is not very prompt. They can’t play a good role in service.
We are lack of professional agricultural guidance staff. And the farmers use the pesticide blindly without the proper technical guidance. And we don’t have an effective emergency plan when the plague outbreaks. Furthermore, we can’t ensure the yield of the farmers through economic crops.

Mid-Atlantic Meet-Up
William and Mary: Circuit Control Toolbox
The William & Mary team is developing a toolbox of parts that can be easily integrated into genetic circuits to tune the resulting levels of protein expression. They characterize their parts exclusively in E. coli. We tested eight of their toolbox parts in Promega's S30 Extract System for Circular DNA to compare the behavior of the parts in cells versus in vitro. The eight plasmids had different RBS strengths, which are reflected in our data shown below. Learn more about the experiments we performed and the results by reading our report .

University of Georgia: Archaeal InterLab
The UGA team is developing an mCherry library for Methanococcus maripaludis, an archaeal organism. Their library currently contains over 30 mutations in the RBS, which cause different levels of protein expression. We took fluorescence readings for several of these mutations as part of the ""Archaeal InterLab."" Like iGEM's InterLab Study, which aims to standardize fluorescence readings across all machines, the Archaeal InterLab recognizes that fluorescence lacks an absolute unit. Thus, participating teams record the relative fluorescence of the cells containing various RBS mutations for UGA.
We were given five samples: three mutants (A, B, and C), a wild type (WT), and suspension buffer (S). Each of the samples was read in triplicate. Here are our average fluorescence readings for each sample. Error bars represent standard deviation. For more detailed protocols, notes, and data, visit our Week 11 Lab Notebook .

Would the relationship of the initial cell sample to the finished product be viewed in a way that resembles
the relationship of animal rennet to the cheese it produces?
If the product is considered meat, can kosher meat ever be produced from an animal without ritual slaughter?
Such exceptions are extremely rare; the only case to date is that of a late-term fetus discovered in the uterus of its slaughtered mother -
Is that case a relevant precedent?
Does circumventing the ritual slaughter mean losing an important moral lesson or lessons
that the halakha teaches through demanding that we slaughter our meat under carefully regulated conditions?

Requirement for Additional Personnel
With a core group of individuals identified to lead the company through it's early development, it was additionally important to determine what positions our company would need in order to have success.  While our present group has a detailed technical background, we lacked the business and legal framework required to achieve success within the company.  We identified the most critical components of our business could be grouped into four key divisions listed below:
While many of these positions are not of critical importance within an early start-up framework, our group aims to bring on players with key skill sets in all four of these major divisions of our company. Achieving an advisory board (detailed below) of strong players with technical, business, and legal expertise has been our first step in bringing the right people into our company. The evolution of our team will occur as skill sets are needed, identifying business and technical experts to aid in engineering and prototype development of our system and in financial recording and accounting.

7.  Explain the aims of synthetic biology and compare synthetic biology to familiar concepts, like a circuit.
8.  Introduce iGEM, the aims behind the foundation, and the different levels of competition. Present exciting examples of iGEM projects from other high school or collegiate teams.
Be sure to keep you presentations exciting and stimulating to keep students interesting!
Outreach
The GT iGEM team has developed a collaboration with a local high school that is in the process of forming their own iGEM team. The GT iGEM team will provide the high school with technical assistance throughout their own competition. To begin the collaboration , the GT iGEM team took a trip to Lambert High School at the request of teacher Janet Standeven to visit the Biotechnology Class and newly forming iGEM club team. Lambert High School is currently the only high school in Georgia to begin forming an iGEM team, and we were excited to assist in this process. The students were mainly Juniors and Seniors who have taken biology courses before. We spent an hour and forty minutes with each class discussing synthetic biology and quorum sensing to give them perspective on opportunities in synthetic biology and iGEM.
Quorum Sensing Activity
We started with a simple quorum sensing activity designed by Dr. Mark Styczynski to get the students up and moving. We gave each person a card with a shape and two colors, and asked them not to share their card with anyone else.
There were six cards of each shape, each with varying colors. In the first round, students could pick one person to ask what their card had on it. If the two cards had the same shape and one color matching, they became a pair. If not, they returned to their seats with no pair. In the next round, each student could ask one person about his or her card.   The pair could only ask one person as a team, but the color could match any of the colors in the group (the shapes would have to all the same). After asking their one person, they had to sit down again. Rounds repeated like this until the whole group of six was found. Prior to the start of a round, if there was a group of three, they could announce one of their colors. If there was a group of four, they could announce their shape. The numbers of singles, pairs, threes, etc. were counted after each round.
The point of this activity was to show the students that bacteria communicate with certain types of molecules, ones only certain bacteria can receive"
Washington-Software,2009,Team:Washington-Software#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," collaborations.
Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility. This would mean adding new functionalities to BioBrick-A-Bot, by developing new Modules. Currently, we have developed only 2 Modules, called ALPHA and PHI. We planned to build a third Module called MU as described in V2.0 of the specification. Other teams are also encouraged to build and share additional BioBrick-a-Bot Modules as well. In the next version of BioBrick-A-Bot, we will implement Single-Master-Multiple-Slaves Synchronization, to support three or more Modules, with ALPHA as the master.
Collaboration with other iGEM Team
Raik's Barcelona Team
One of our external team advisors, Raik Gruenberg , is interested to start a new team in Barcelona next year and replicate the existing ‘bot’ that we have. This is a good first step. Raik has also written some procedures for performing fusion assemblies . We will attempt to collaborate with his team and get our ‘bot’ to automate the procedure above too.
University of Washington Wet-Lab Team
We have also presented BioBrick-A-Bot to the University of Washington Wet-Lab Team (See Picture Gallery ).  Next year we could look into using one of our ‘bots’ to automate some of the mundane tasks in BioBrick assemblies.
The Vision of Future Collaboration
We built BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 as a prototype and provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that it worked. V1.0 will however, not have the full range of functionalities of a commercial liquid handling robot. V1.0 will be made up of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a chassis called BETA. We will provide construction details and software so that other iGEM team can replicate and customize their own 'bot's.
In our next version, BioBrick-A-Bot V2.0, we will provide 3 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA, PHI and MU. We will also support user-defined LegoRoboBrick modules too. We provide the mechanism where other iGEM teams can collaborate together to replicate, interchange and extend LegoRoboBricks. Many iGEM teams can contribute and share both Hardware Construction and Software Programs for LegoRoboBrick modules in a Registry, much like the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"". Our vision will be to make the technologies of creating and sharing 'bots' easily available, replacing labour intensive manual work, and cost intensive machines.

Alberta Genetic Engineered Machines:
A Geekstarter Workshop
""This was a miniature iGEM competition held in Calgary that my supervisor and I attended and it was hosted by Alberta’s Geekstarter. I was really glad that I could attend such an event because I was eager to show others what Concordia’s 2014 iGEM team has been tinkering with for the past four months. Although we focused on a microorganism, we seek to address macro-scale problems in our current society. These little organisms helped maintain life on this earth for so many years, so this year Concordia is colliding synthetic biology and microalgae to engineer a more sustainable future. Although we are still in the mist for attaining our ultimate goal, we hope to at least show how much untapped potential there is in microalgae.""

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," WB800 Colony 1 culture was diluted with 18.8 mL of M9 liquid media. These two liquid cultures were chosen due to its proximity to having a cell density of 106cells/mL but having a density high enough to allow for enough left-over culture for back-up use. 30 μL of the E. coli DH5α Colony 1 and B. subtilis WB800 Colony 1 overnight cultures were then plated in their respective quadrants on one set of plates. After the 36 hours in the incubator, no growth was found on the two plates. As such, two E. coli DH5α Colony 1 plates and two B. subtilis WB800 Colony 1 were re-made. However, there was still no growth was found on both sets of plates the following day.
Our TA, David Feehan, suggested to us that the agar plates may have been too thin to allow for proper bacterial growth. Thus, a new set of overnight cultures of E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 were made and was plated on a thicker agar plate (~5mL agar). To further encourage bacterial growth, the overnights were not diluted to a cell density of 106cells/mL prior to plating. The OD600 measurements of the new overnight cultures are as follows:
Overnight Culture
Absorbance at 600 nm
Cell Density (cells/mL)
E. coli DH5α Colony 3
0.821
6.57 x 108
B. subtilis WB800 Colony 3
0.419
3.35 x 108
After incubating the plates for 24 hours, scattered colonies could be seen in both the E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis WB800 quadrants. However, the plates were allowed to incubate for another 24 hours to encourage the formation of more colonies and growth lawns.

Then, 5 μL of the diluted 8 μM DNAzyme was pipetted onto the E. coli DH5α and B. subtitles WB800 quadrants. 1 μL of DNAzyme was also pipetted onto the quadrants labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and were viewed using UV light.

ABSTRACT
Promoters are the key regulators of gene expression. Possessing promoters which are active under a desired condition, at a desired strength and in a specified tissue is of great value for Plant Biotechnology, Gene Therapy and fundamental research in Bioscience. Therefore, it has become a desire to synthetically construct promoters responsive to a variety of pathways. We explore two ways to the synthesis of promoters: On one hand, we have developed a bioinformatical model and database (HEARTBEAT) describing the structure of promoters responsive to user-defined inputs. On the other hand, we have developed a biochemical method for the synthesis of randomized promoter libraries. Using this method, we have created a library of constitutive promoters of varying strength. Also, we have created libraries of promoters putatively responsive to a variety of pathways. We have screened these libraries for functional, pathway responsive promoters and present a detailed characterization of a NF-κB responsive promoter of our making. We finally discuss ways to combine randomized biochemical synthesis and bioinformatical modeling to propose a method towards the generation of promoters of complex regulation (i.e. by multiple pathways).

As shown in the Fig.4-3, this time, RNA samples were degradated.
To add to this, the waveforms of them had a law peak at 260nm(Fig.4-4.)
Establishing an effective way of RNA purification
We found that RNA purification method needed to be improved in ordrer to perform RT-PCR successfully .
We improved following things;
1. Total leaf volume was increased.
2. Samples ware freezed with liquid nitrogen and suspended in ISOGEN more rapidly.
3. We centrifuged samples and collected supernatant twice after adding ISOGEN.
After the improvement, 260nm peak became higher and the degradation is minimized(Fig.4-4A.)
Then we used better quality of RNA for reverse transcription and retried RT-PCR. Fig.4-4C shows the result of this RT-PCR.

After we purified RT-PCR via the new method, we performed RT-PCR again for SEP3 and FUL. The result is shown in fig. We were able to get sufficiently purified RNA, and amplify each gene.
To confirm the exact differnece between experimental group(FT+) and negative control(FT-), we conducted qPCR and compared the relative RNA expression of each gene. However, there was not significant difference between experimental group and negative control.

Because the efficiency of Fha1 hasn't been completly demonstrated, we keep on cloning with the standard RBS. So, RBS and Fha1 constructions are made in parallel.
RESULTS :
Every constructions gave colonies on Petri Dishes.
But PCR cheking showed that nothing were amplified on every Fha1 constructions with VF2 and VR primers. Thus, Fha1 was provided in a PCR blent plasmid instead of an iGEM's plasmid.
The insert of the test construction is having the right size.
2 out of 3 2nd step constructions had the right size.
We still have issues to clone the 1st step construction: RBS-CinI.

Cloning of every first steps of our construction: (Standard Assembly Method)
-> 11 clonings
We changed our strategy: clonings were performed with enzymes recommended by iGEM (New England Biolabs).
One Petri Dish was free of colony. We performed PCRs on 5 colonies from each Petri Dish. According to PCR results, 5 constructions out of 11 seem to have the right size.
Cloning session :
-> every 1st-step constructions that failed last time, so 6 constructions.
-> 2 2nd-step constructions:
MerR-LuxR
TetR-LuxR
Only digestions were performed because of a lack of equipments.
We decided to use the Standard Protocol for the first step constructions because the assembly combinates a short and a long gene. The long gene is inserted in the plasmid of the small gene.
But the Second step constructions were performed with the 3A Assembly Protocol.

Undergraduates from Tsinghua University have great enthusiasm for laboratory researches. However, such opportunities are limited.  Taking part in the iGEM competition is a great chance for undergraduates to experience laboratory research.  iGEM Tsinghua-D Team wishes such benefit could be shared by more undergraduates.  Inspired by this idea, iGEM Tsinghua-D Team came up with a new way of conducting human practice.  Freshmen workshop and iGEM Tsinghua-D open house were held to give undergraduates opportunity to experience laboratory research.
 
Freshmen workshop
Four freshmen were accepted as temporary members of our team.  Trainings on basic experimental specifications and lectures on fundamental experimental principle were given during the first couples of weeks.  Then, tasks related to our project were distributed and the freshmen completed their assignment independently.
iGEM Tsinghua-D open house
During the open house, lecture was given to undergraduates from various departments to take a snapshot of synthetic biology.  Members of iGEM Tsinghua-D Team gave a brief introduction of epoch-making events of synthetic biology.  A visit to laboratories where we conduct our project was than arranged for undergraduates.  iGEM Tsinghua-D Team hope undergraduates could  have some knowledge of synthetic biology and experience laboratory research.

NanoDrop after PCR amplification of LF, RF and Kan showed concentration of 54.4, 113 and 69.6 ng/mL respectively. NanoDrop measurements after the digest showed concentrations reaching zero for all samples. It was later realised that wrong combination of enzymes had been used, which neatly explains the puzzling results. The amounts of enzyme and DNA was determined according to enzymatic activity in relation to weight of DNA present.
BBa_K576005 was found in plate 1, well 10A. BBa_K576005 equals J and B BioBrick ligated together. We decided to use this BioBrick instead of J and B separately because of all the trouble we were having.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Experiments#Anti Cancer Toxin_-_-_TEXT.html,", cell samples were also incubated with 1 mM of 5-fluouracil allowing us to test the functionality of our staining assay. After 24 hours the cells, apart from the HeLa CCL-2 lc, were incubated with calcein AM solution. The viability of the cells was assessed via citrine fluorescence for the HeLa CCL-2 lc cells and calcein fluorescence for the HT-29 cells in a spectrophotometer. A detailed protocol is available in Protocols.
RESULTS The cytotoxic effect of our azurin-rich lysate was verified by the decrease in the citrine fluorescence, following an increase in the azurin content. From the following graph (Figure 14) even 3.2% of azurin lysate (~2 nM) is enough to detect a cytotoxic effect.
Figure 14. Fluorescence data from HeLa CCL-2 lc cell cultures incubated with different amount of azurin-rich lysate. Decrease in citrine fluorescence is only detected in samples were cells were incubated with bacterial lysate containing azurin, while in ony other case (azurin free lysate and PBS) no cytotoxicity was detectable. The functionality of the viability assay was successfully evaluated by the detection of cytotoxicity on cells incubated with a lethal concnentration of 5-fluoruracil (1 mM).
Azurin's cytotoxic effect cannot be detected against HT-29 cells according to the results of the calcein AM viability assay (Figure 15).
Figure 15. Fluorescence data from HT-29 cell cultures incubated with different amount of azurin-rich lysate. No obvious decrease in fluorescence is detecteed in samples incubated with bacterial lysates. A small fluorescence decrease is detected in the sample incubated with a lethal concnentration of 5-fluoruracil (1 mM).
CONCLUSION
The cytotoxic effect of azurin on the p53 + HeLa CCL-2 lc cancer cell line was detected. An effective azurin concentration of 1.8 nM could be deduced from this experiment and it was used as an input for the estimation of the killing area our system could achieve.

It offers many applications that would benefit humanity, such as synthetic organisms that can fight disease or create compounds that are costly or environmentally harmful to produce currently (König et al., 2013). One particular technology enabled by synthetic biology, the gene drive, is being considered as a tool to stop Zika and other diseases (Min and Church, 2015). However, in order to realize these benefits, society needs skilled synthetic biologists.
Born as an internal competition at MIT in 2003 and growing rapidly since then, iGEM is a mainly undergraduate synthetic biology competition. Teams receive sequences of DNA from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to help with their project, and submit the parts they have created or modified at the end. Submissions must follow the ‘BioBrick’ standard for ease of modularization, which was invented in 2003 by a professor at MIT affiliated with iGEM and has grown in popularity in tandem with iGEM since then. Each competition culminates in a Jamboree, where teams are judged on a variety of factors and assigned a gold, silver, bronze, or no medal. There is also an overall winner, several finalists, and numerous special awards.
Section Two
iGEM has a strong impact on the education and career preparation of its participants. This is the result of the nature of iGEM itself- a problem-based, socially aware undergraduate research project competition. It is also a result of growing awareness of employers of the skills that iGEM imparts to its participants. In the paragraphs below, we will review evidence from academic literature, media, and interviews that there are significant personal benefits to participation flowing from exposure to undergraduate research, competition, problem-based learning (PBL), and project-based service learning (PBSL). This is borne out by the results of a survey of 2007 and 2008 iGEM participants. We will also expound on the role of participation in iGEM in signalling skills to employers. Thus, iGEM promotes the acquisition of skills, as well as providing a means to capitalize on these gains.
As an engineering competition, iGEM poses iterative problems that are open-ended and poorly-defined; evidence from experiments in public schools shows that problem-based learning (PBL) provides problem-solving skills that are more applicable to the professional world than traditional pedagogy and that it instills superior knowledge of subject matter.

We have considered using toxic chemicals as inputs to our program to suggest a pathway that would convert harmful pollutants into valuable chemicals. I wrote a script that scans a list of harmful chemicals from the EPA and then forms a dictionary pairing the chemical name to its KEGG_ID. The script doesn't quite work perfectly and not all chemicals are found on Kegg. This will be improved throughout the week. Also, I am looking into the possibility of using django to host our application on the web.
I was finally able to figure out who that girl is that I saw in the gatehouse and at work. Potential suspects were Lucy from the other team or Jacinda the secretary. After extensive facebook searches, the unlikely candidate of Julie Richards turned out to be the culprit. I look forward to meeting her or something so I feel less strange about all the stalking
Riyad Read articles related to metabolic pathways and biological networks to better understand how fluxes work. Also messed around with the Flux Balance Analysis in the COBRA toolbox.
Kanishka Worked on learning the python language through tutorials and textbooks.
Nate Explored the world that is wiki.  I learned some useful things about wikis(such as templates), and investigated ways to create and edit our wiki page.  Looked into some programs, such as dreamweaver, but I am not sure if that will really be of any help with the wiki.  I also learned some fun stuff about Linux, and learned some linux commands via Cygwin, a linux emulator for windows.  Lots of fun indeed!  Towards the end of the week, I learned a great deal about Python programming.  In particular, I learned about for and while statements, classes, def statements, regular and global variables, lists and strings.  This will be very useful in the future.  I was also able to write some small programs.  These included a number guesser program(user gives input of what to add and subtract to get to the goal) and a prime number generator.  These very basic programs are not very useful of course, but they allowed me to better understand the programming language.  Can't wait to start writing some useful code.  Also, watching Donny stalk people on facebook has been very entertaining.

The first one, named “Synthetic Biology: Challenges & Risks” was dedicated to the academic world. How the synthetic biology environment is ruled in France, but also in Europe or Worldwide. The goal of this roundtable was to identify the purpose of synthetic biology regarding our own development as scientists.  We had 5 different speakers that have shared their opinions and experiences with us. It was really an enriching experience for every igemers all over Europe, especially because of the background of the speakers.  Indeed, all of them were well known scientist coming from famous French entities and companies all over the world such as CNRS, Pasteur Institute, CEA, and even from the French Government, with the Secretariat of State for Defense and National Security.
The feedback that we had from the first roundtable was really great, the audience had a lot of questions about the development of synthetic biology and how it would be related in their carriers.
After all this work, the teams organized a short coffee break

Find out the career opportunities that offers the present us their success stories, and explain why & how Synthetic Biology is essential these days.
The second roundtable, named “Synthetic Biology: A New Economic World” was dedicated to the professional world and to better know what place exactly takes synthetic biology in the biotechnology environment. The goal of this roundtable was to valorize the iGEM experience and to deal with the place of synthetic biology in the professional world through different companies & industries (Environment, Healthcare).
We had 4 different speakers that have shared their professional lives with the audience, some of them had already participated or was fully aware about the iGEM competition.

I am also thrilled that there is a kosher Dunkin' Donuts two buildings away. If you need a pick-me-up, I'm your person. As the first member of the Cooper Union iGEM team, I hold the final authoritarian say on who gets to perform which biological dance.

I am a Junior Chemical Engineering at The Cooper Union minoring in Biomedical Engineering. Every evening before I go home I clean and organize the lab, but somehow every morning when I come back it has reverted back into a state of chaos. I do copious amounts of reading while I am waiting for my experiments to complete. I miss playing on the volleyball team at Cooper, but am excited to get a chance to lead the team as the coach! I am the best in lab - don't let Joe or Shoshana tell you otherwise.

I am a Sophomore Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union. When I heard they were going to film scenes from ""Elementary"" at Cooper, I was definitely a little more than excited. I'm ecstatic about trying the more exotic dishes at dim sum, and no, I am not talking about Pteri dishes. I'm the best breakdancer in the school, and yoooo, sup? I can even do Chinese yo-yo. Thankfully, I'm not the shortest member of the group (when I'm wearing heels) nor am I the biggest bully, phew.

Athens,2018,Team:Athens#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," are planning to keep on working on their projects after the course of the competition, we decided to set a common timetable on realizing our kits. To this end, we will evaluate if parts of our kit could be 3D printed and put together to a final product.
iGEM Community encounters
During the summer months, many team members from other iGEM Teams visited our city, Athens in the frame of their summer vacation. When they contacted us, we were quick to set up a meeting in order to know each other and talk all things iGEM. We had the pleasure of meeting with Nicholas Kakaroubas from the UNSW 2018 iGEM Team. We presented each other with our projects and gave feedback on the enzymatic issues we shared. We also gave Nick a tour of one of the labs were we work and spend a day doing lab work together, while we exchanged many wet lab tips. Our team also met Alexis Casas from the iGEM Paris - Bettencourt Team with whom we had a very interesting conversation about our projects!
Surveys
Throughout the iGEM year, we completed as many surveys provided by other teams as we could, in order to help them form their project or gain an understanding about the way their peers view certain subjects. Specifically we completed surveys from the teams:
iGEM Bulgaria Questionnaire: Survey concerning CRISPR, GMOs and our view about them.
iGEM Dusseldorf: Survey about probiotics.
iGEM Montpellier 2018: Survey concerning contraceptive methods and the possible use of engineering bacteria for this purpose.
UNAMBG iGEM 2018: Survey about antibiotic resistance.

Collaborations
Our team was fortunate to have multiple productive collaborations with other iGEM teams from around the world. In addition to discussing details of our projects with members of other iGEM teams including William & Mary, Helsinki, and NYU Abu-Dhabi, we offered our support to four teams from around the world.
University College of London
We volunteered to test software developed by the University College of London’s iGEM team for designing gene circuits. We shared our experience using their software and suggested several changes to improve its versatility.
Rice University
We were also proud to help mentor a new iGEM team. Rice University’s iGEM team was interested in incorporating software into their project, but to do so they needed a stronger background in coding. Since our team has a history of integrating complex software with our projects, notably for this year’s project and last year’s, we asked our experienced members to lend their expertise. We were in contact with their team and gave advice on software.
University of Virginia
Because the University of Virginia’s project was centered on the idea of biocontainment which is one of the applications that prompted our own project, we engaged with their team to look at current attitudes and policies toward biocontainment. Our team discussed a series of survey responses and provided the University of Virginia’ team with examples of applying biocontainment in systems that use parts from our two projects.
University of Paris-Saclay
Lastly, we gave feedback to Paris-Saclay’s iGEM team for their human practices work on Responsible Research and Innovation through a series of responses that we wrote about our own interpretation of those principles and their role in our project work."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

28th Sept,  we have had candid and in-depth dialogues of our model.
Figure1: we were discussing projects.
Central South University (CSU-CHINA)
Both of ours projects need to construct stable cell line to verify our target particles’ function.With the same purpose, we sincerely invited them come to our university to have a seminar. We introduced the main experimental methods, experimental procedures, data measurement, and the issues need to pay attention to in cell operation to them.At the same time ,we gave tips on how to optimized their biobrick and successfully amplify target gene fragments.
Figure2: we showed CSU-CHINA around our microscopy center and have a talk about ours design
CCIC(Conference of Chinese iGEM community)
The fifth Conference of Chinese iGEM Community was held in Shanghai Tech University. CCIC is a platform for Chinese igem teams to share experience and receive suggestions from judges and all the Chinese igemers before the competition. CCiC Ambassador Haotian Guo queried and gave directions to ours consideration about cell’s target problems and how can we precisely control the functional particle’s expression in a complicated individual environment, which perfected our project and improved the project’s scientific rigor, becoming more convincing.
Figure3: we showed our project to all the Chinese iGEMers and obtained some feedback
Xuzhou Workshop
8th Aug, we meet Nankai University, Xiamen University, Dalian University of Technology, Jiangnan University, Zhejiang University of Technology igem teams in the final round of The third National College Students Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. Five groups came together and had a seminar, sharing participation experience. In the light of the difficult position faced by each team, participates put forward some paths for solving these problems. Besides, our seminar drew in several dozen students and teachers from different universities, which promoted the spread of iGEM and synthesis biology in China.
Figure4: six teams came together and sparked inspirations.

Plan: Finish EPF-Lausanne database, finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Settle the DB format for good(hopefully).
Summary: As our simulation program becomes more and more mature, we encounter more problems in consistency of our database. We all want to make major changes and make it right this time, but sadly we don’t have the time. So we make minor changes, add patches to fix the bugs, but we have to let go of the unconsistency in substituent, compartment and other places. Now the DB looks not beautiful or elegant, but usable. This is good enough since our first goal now is to make our software work, and a DB that can properly describe simple reaction networks should be enough. We plan to leave major changes to further development.
Most of our team members work intensively during the 7 days off, and the achievement of their work is rich. DB of both EFP-Lausanne and Synchronized Ecoli are basically finished. Tables and graphs on DB structure has been published. Our software core seems finally begin to function right. UI is under constructing. All the codes are now on github.
We schedule our trip and book plane tickets to Beijing, Chicago and Boston. Jue Wang is now in charge of money and team wear.
We dined together on Oct 1, but without a relaxed mind, it was not fun for me. What actually thrills me up is to explore my potential and to find how much can be done in the 7 days. I do have fun working beyond my limit.

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"Additionally, we submitted the biobricked pRS vectors as well as the pETue vector.
Yeast shuttle vectors with Biobrick MCS
These parts are biobricked shuttle vectors for yeast. The vectors were made compatible with the RFC10 standard and also contain an RFC10 cloning site. They all encode an ampicillin resistance gene and replicate to high-copy numbers in E.Coli. Furthermore, the CEN6/ARS4 (Chromosome VI centromere/Autonomously Replicating Sequence 4) cassette ensures that the plasmid stays at a low copy number in yeast, because they are treated as pseudo chromosomes. Each vector contains a different auxotrophy marker:
pRS313 - HIS3
pRS315 - LEU2
pRS316 - URA3
BBa_K1680014 : pRS313-MCS
BBa_K1680015 : pRS315-MCS
BBa_K1680016 : pRS316-MCS
pETue
This part is a E. coli expression plasmid that is compatible with RFC10. The vector can be linearized with PstI/XmaI, so that parts cut with PstI/NgoMIV can be cloned into it. Overexpression of genes cloned into this site is IPTG inducible. It also encodes for a 6xHis-tag with a Thrombin cleavage site between coding region and 6xHis-tag, so that the His-tag can easily be cleaved off. The vector replicates with a high copy number in E. coli, and has an ampicillin resistance.
BBa_K1680026: pETue
Cre-Dronpa Fusions
These parts contain the protein coding region for the fusion constructs of Cre Recombinase (BBa_K1680007) and 145N Dronpa ( BBa_K1680006 ) with intermediate linkers (BBa_K1680000 - BBa_K1680003). Oligomerisation of Dronpa should stop Cre from accessing DNA in the nucleus thereby inhibiting it until light deactivation of Dronpa.
These parts are

You know what we did from last winter to autumn! In this Notebook you’ll be able to follow what and when we did it. We documented the experiment protocols and chronological important events, including how we started, how we determined our project, weekly meeting, experiment development, human practice project and many more! Thanks to this Notebook you can travel back in time and see how we managed to get big things done in such a small time frame. Once you get to know the past, you learn to appreciate the present day and the hard work done by CSU_CHINA team.
Recruiting team member(January-Feburary)
This is the first time for our school to participate in IGEM competition. Since we were financed and sponsored by our school, we had begun to recruit our team member using various ways. We spread out the message on the Internet and made a detailed self-reporting questionnaire, including major, personal strength and so on.
Brain storm and discussing(March-April)
Then we welcomed all primary participaters coming together to think of an available project, which begins with the innovation ideas, gene circuit design and applications.
Preparing preliminary experiment and make final project design (May-June)
After several meetings and preliminary lab experiment, we determined an available and innovative project targeted therapeutics of HCC using a way of synthetic biology.
Lab Experiment(June-October)
Seeing those plates for Interlab study and tubes for luciferase assay, you can imagine how much time and energy our IGEMers have spent. During the hot summer vacation, our lab members in turns came to the lab to finish the huge task.
Human practice(August-Sepetember)
Working molecule iGEM. The inspiration for ""Working molecule"" comes from a Japanese anime called ""はたらく細胞"". The difference is that this animation anthropomorphizes all kinds of cells, but we regard people as molecules instead. Because everyone is similar to a molecule, which has its own use and value, even if this value has not been discovered. Everybody has his or her own duties and steps, and there will be a “mutation” and create many beautiful accidents and progress. Since liver cancer is caused by a variety of molecular combination mutations, we do can use this method to"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," won’t get a high-quality, inexpensive test’ (Rimmer, 2008).  Aside from pointing out the work of world renowned institutes like the Sanger Institute or Medical Research Council in the UK, or the National Institutes for Health in the US, who in fact did a large proportion of the work on BRCA1 with Myriad, raising the issue of genetic work and to whom gets the patent when so much work is collaborative and developed on top of earlier research, ‘If every time a researcher had an idea, he ran down to the patent office, he would spend more time there – or with his lawyers – than in the lab’ (Stiglitz, 2006), aside from those institutions or the state funded Human Genome Project (HGP) which led to its own patent problems when private enterprises tried to patent genes, 7,500 applications from Human Genome Sciences, 6,500 from Dr Venter’s Celera Genomics and a staggering 36,000 applications from a French firm Genset, all no doubt necessary spurs to invention despite the fact the HGP had already decoded the entire genome.  Aside from these doubts that could be cast on such claims from Myriad, the renowned research centre, the Institut Curie also called such commercial testing a barrier to patient care, noting ‘the initial family mutation searches performed by Myriad are billed at 2400 United States dollars (18000 francs – 2744 Euros), as against an estimated cost of 5000 francs (762 Euros) for testing in French laboratories’ (Rimmer, 2008). The Institut filed an opposition to Myriads patent on BRCA1 on grounds of lack of novelty, lack of inventive step and insufficient description.  They successfully challenged the patent, which was rescinded.  However the patent would then be subsequently upheld in a case for University of Utah Research Foundation (to whom Myriad relinquished patent ownership to), an interesting note on this case is from the response from the European Patent Office to the Opposition’s argument that the patent offends public morality and human rights, ‘None of the objections of the [Opposition] demonstrated that the publication and exploitation of the invention in suit is contrary to the ‘ordre public’ or morality.  The objections were aiming at the negative effects of the patenting itself of the invention, at the financial and economic drawbacks and at the dependencies and negative consequences for the national health systems.’ (Rimmer, 2008), Rimmer observes ‘The reasoning here is somewhat odd - the Opposition Division dismisses the ethical and human rights objections of"
