Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," silica-coated cells shown here were relatively few in the overall population of experimental (Device 2-containing) cells, with large number of experimental cells uncoated. However, no cells in the control were found to be similarly coated by silica. Collectively, these data suggest that Si4 is effectively surface-displayed in a small fraction of Device 2-containing cells.
Flow Cytometry
Device 2 contains our INP+Si4 construct, along with the pCpxR-controlled GFP gene. Cells expressing this device were grown overnight, incubated with 5 micron diameter silica beads for two hours, and then analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Fortessa instrument (at the Leeds Flow Cytometry Facility). The light scattering flow cytometry data shown here provides a map (a 2-dimensional histogram) of light scattering intensities caused by each bead or cell particle flowing past the cytometer's interrogating laser, with scattering from 10,000 particles mapped in each plot shown. Side scattering and forward scattering properties are related to the size and density of the scattering particles. Boxes (“gates”) drawn in the scattering plots highlight certain sub-populations of the cells and cells+bead samples. Overall, the scattering distributions are very similar, suggesting that the beads and cells mainly reside in the same area of the plot (“P2”, green). However, in the cells+beads sample a small sub-population (2.2%) exhibits increased side-scattering (“P3”), likely stemming cell-bead complexes and thus indicating bead binding by the cell. (Gate P4 may be due to impurities or salt precipitates in the growth media.)
Thus, overall, a small population of the cells seems to display function Si4 binding peptides, agreeing with the relatively few number of silica-coated cells found in our mineralization assay, and the relatively frequency of highly fluorescing, silica-binding (Device 2-expressing) cells observed via confocal fluorescence imaging.
The fluorescence data is presented as a one-dimensional histogram and shows the same population as that plotted in the corresponding light-scattering maps. This data shows a very slight increase in the fraction of highly fluorescent particles, which could possibly correspond to the P3 gated population.
Overall, these data indicate that in future work may want to focus on cell surface display binders that are either more readily expressed or exhibit better target-binding properties versus the Si4 silica-bindin peptide explored here. While a relatively small fraction of cells binds to target beads, this still us allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of our detection approach, which is a significant result (see confocal data).

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Secret3_-_-_TEXT.html," the 20th of May. Here we introduced ourselves and our topic to the broad public, advisors and potential sponsors.
June
In June, the second exam period required our full attention. Nevertheless, some team members with few exams already explored literature and started looking for sponsors.
July
In July, the 'real' work began and the whole team reviewed literature. We theoretically constructed the plasmids and searched quantification methods for specific proteins. The wet lab team started generating double knockout strains and the first mathematical models were made. By developing the wiki and using social media, we kept everybody updated about our latest progress. The Education and outreach team started planning possible collaborations with other teams and was sitting on a bigger plan. On the 21st of July, we met the iGEM-team of Toulouse to discuss our projects. Also practical arrangements for the stay during the Giant Jamboree were made.

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#HP#MOOC_-_-_TEXT.html," combine both benefits of the modern and conventional teaching methods.
We decided to renew the experiment during a presentation of our project for students of the Master in Systems and Synthetic biology from the University of Paris Saclay. Once again interactions were made through online video calls.
After the presentation, feedbacks were also quite positive. As they were university students, they felt more responsible about their studies and most of them were willing to follow a MOOC by themselves until the end. All in all, they viewed MOOCs as an evolution that would eventually need to be incorporated into teaching methods as it already happened before for other tools.
Internet digital divide & learning digital divide
The OECD defines the term ""digital divide"" as the “gaps in access to information and communication technology (ICT) - threatening the ICT ""have-nots"", whether individuals, groups or entire countries. Education and learning lie at the heart of these issues and their solutions. The gaps that define the ""learning digital divide"" are thus as important as the more obvious gaps in access to the technology itself [2]”
A good illustration of this concept is made on the figure 3 and reducing this gap has been set as an objective at an international level. In 2015, President Barack Obama considered in a speech given in Iowa that “Today high speed broadband is not a luxury, it’s a necessity”[3]. More recently, the President of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker stated in his Speech on the European Union of September 2016 that “every european village and every city with free wireless [should have an] internet access around the main centres of public life by 2020”.[4]

According to the figure 3, 74,9% of the African population is not using internet, which is really high compared with other geographical areas. Besides, we noticed in the figure 4 that only 1% of teams who took part in the 2015 iGEM competition came from Africa.
Starting from those data, we wanted to go beyond those figures and have a look at initiatives related with our project that are being carried out in Africa.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html," a more fundamental level (van den Berg & Keymolen, 2013). Nowadays, technology is not external to us, but interwoven with our life.
Back to synthetic biology. If we would try to extend the thinking of Jonas to synthetic biology, one would not be surprised that Jonas would be very careful. In his section on genetic engineering, in which he speaks about genetic engineering of human beings, he warns us, human beings, not to be reckless in trying to rule the evolution. Humans should maintain evolution, but should not try to change and improve it, according to one’s own judgment. In synthetic biology, science brings a bacterium (at this moment) into existence that, because of its being alive, counts as valuable from the point of view of human beings. For Jonas, it is clear that we first have to think of ethics which are adjusted to the current situation of science.
To what extent Jonas has succeeded in providing an answer to this call for a new ethical framework is still a question for debate. The foundation of his ethics seems sometimes problematic, because he tries to ground his ethics on ontology. We have seen the problems that arose with this position. Concluding, we can say that aspects of Jonas work are still relevant nowadays, e.g. responsibility in science and the concept of precaution. His attempt to raise ethics above a merely anthropocentric and here-and-now level can be important for the future of our planet. However, Jonas promised us a compelling ethical framework, in terms of a categorical imperative, which he intended to be universal. In my view we have to satisfy ourselves with an ethical framework which can be applied by well willing people, but lacks the universal compelling force.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Australia: Protein Expression + His-Tag and GMO Legalities Collaboration
We traded expertise in protein work with the UNSW team. We attempted to express two of their proteins (G3P and PP3) using our pET28c plasmid in BL21 (DE3, pGro7) E. coli. given our success in expressing our two mycobacterial proteins EtnR1 and EtnR2 using this system. We also gave them strains of E. coli. that overexpress membrane proteins for their work on outer membrane vesicles. The UNSW team performed a Western Blot for us using anti-His antibody conjugated to HRP to verify our proteins were expressed with a His6-Tag.  Additionally we both looked at the laws surrounding the use of GMOs in Australia and in other countries such as the contrast between developed countries and developing countries.
We also shared progress and experiences through an informal meet-up overflowing with laughs and pizza!
Michigan, USA: Misconceptions of SynBio Articles
We contributed two articles to the Michigan iGEM team’s website about common misconceptions in the synthetic biology world. We wrote about the misconception that antibiotics can treat all infections, like the common cold or the flu, and the misconception that all E. coli are dangerous.
Instagram
Instagram was a super platform for communication of scientific ideas and procedures, not only to the general public, but also with other iGEM teams. Through Instagram we participated in Rice iGEM's Humans of SynBio project, as well as making suggestions and providing virtual support to other teams. Overall we connected with over 46 iGEM teams worldwide!
Skype meetings with iGEM Toronto, Auckland and NCKU-Tainan
Despite being from the land down under, we conducted Skype meetings with a variety of other iGEM teams to discuss our projects so far, and to share any advice and learning experiences that we’ve had. It was great to learn so much about the brilliant work going on in other labs and super-exciting to see all the potential improvements synbio can bring to the world!
Toronto
With iGEM Toronto, we shared ideas and codes for phone apps for readout of reporter protein biosensing systems. We also exchanged thoughts about biosensor design, particularly on having cell-free extracts on paper. We love your project on gold – in this case, all that glitters is definitely gold!

MSU-Michigan,2017,Team:MSU-Michigan#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," then inserted into this strain with the mtrB gene under control of a promoter that activates transcription of the protein when induced by compounds such as pesticides and metals in the water. Some of the various strains were ΔmtrB, ΔmtrB prL814, and ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB. These three strains were induced by IPTG which is an analog to allolactose that induces the lac operon in the respective plasmids which were under control of the T7A1 promoter. Later, additional strains were created by cutting out the T7A1 promoter out of the ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB strain and inserting Cu, NO 3 , K, Zn, Mo, Biotin, Blue Light, and Paraquat promoters. These different strains were inoculated into the newly designed single-chambered BES made from Mason glass jars and induced to then test for electricity production using cyclic voltammetry techniques with a potentiostat.
The advantages of using this method to create a biosensor over others, such as an optical biosensor using fluorescence (8) or a nucleic acid biosensor (9) , are not having to utilize expensive enzymes as in the optical biosensor or expensive equipment and the low demand of nucleic acids biosensors. These single-chambered BES made out of common household glass jars are a more cost-effective way to create a biosensor that can be utilized in a laboratory setting, industry, or in the field.
Mtr Pathway
The mtrB pathway harnesses electrons through metabolized lactate and transports the energy from mtrA to mtrC which is then capable of donating the electron to an external acceptor molecule. MtrB is the bridge between mtrA and mtrC, allowing the contact necessary for electron transport. In the absence of mtrB, it is predicted that mtrA will no longer associate with mtrC and therefore will hinder the external electron transport pathway.
Mtr External Electron Transportation pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 Lactate dehydrogenase metabolizes lactate to pyruvate, transferring the released electrons to a quinone cycle in the membrane. CymA, coordinated the transfer of electrons from the quinone pool to mtrA. MtrB facilitates the interaction between mtrA and mtrC as the electrons flow to mtrC where they are accepted by an external molecule.

DNA Selection
Introduction
To round out the experiments for DNA recovery, it is essential that we show that the recovered DNA is in fact plasmid DNA from the relevant lysed cells. This is important because in our selection scheme we are only interested in the plasmids from cells expressing the lysis cassettes, and not the DNA from their neighbors (probably the majority of cells in a real selection).
Experimental Setup
To that end, we again set up an experiment involving two flasks but this time each flask contains two types of cells. For one flask, one cell type is a co-transformation of a lysis plasmid (C2) and a RFP-containing plasmid and the other is a co-transformation of a negative control plasmid (C11) with a GFP-containing plasmid. In the other flask, the reverse is true: lysis (C2) is with GFP and negative control (C11) is with RFP. This co-culture experiment was prepared by mixing equal amounts of cells from an overnight culture in one big flask. After a 1h culture, we induced lysis with 500 µM IPTG. If you would like to find out more about how IPTG induction tests work, please click here .
We measured optical density and took two supernatant samples every hour. One supernatant sample was centrifuged and sterile filtered to remove cell debris. It would be used for qPCR and transformation -- our two methods for quantifying the amount of recovered plasmid DNA. The other sample was used to keep track of fluorescence in the cells over the course of the experiment: the non-lysed cells were expected to fluoresce according to"

PCR to check for omega+zif268
All colonies that grew on the plates we left overnight should have spec-resistance, but they may not have the omega and zif268 unit that we inserted yesterday with isothermal assembly. We performed a PCR on 13 colonies picked from the 50 ul plate to find a colony that contains the w+zif268 insertion. We used the same recipe at our PCR reaction [[#PCR of omega+zif268 with overhangs on Friday. If the insert is present, then we should see a band at 709 bp. We also included 2 positive controls: our isothermal assembly product and our selection strain from which the w+zif268 was originally copied.
We ran an agarose gel to check the bands:
Lanes 1-8
Lanes 9-16
None of the colonies displayed any bands, except for primer residues. Lane 16 contained the selection plasmid, on which we performed a successful PCR on Friday, so we definitely expected a band at 709 bp. Because the positive controls did not have a band at 709 bp, we suspect that something went wrong with the PCR. We plan on re-running the PCR tomorrow.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," interactions in a higher-order structure direct lambda site-specific recombination. Journal of molecular biology. 1987;195(3):481-93. , which mediated the recombination. The fundamental concept of this approach is illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3. The principle behind the recombination. By PCR, the two flanking sequences are assembled with the fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene (camR), the OmpR-regulated promoter, and the relE gene. The flanking sequences are homologous to part of the chromosome around the bacterial attachment site (attB), enabling the homologous recombination.
Using this approach, it was attempted to assemble the OmpR-regulated promoter controlling RelE with the flanking regions by PCR. The assembly of the fragment derived from the plasmid with either one of the flanking fragments was achieved. However, the assembly of the complete chromosomal insertion fragment containing all three segments emerged problematic. Several attempts with numerous process optimisations were performed, but unfortunately without success. To circumvent this, another attachment site was chosen. The assembly of the complete fragment by PCR was achieved and chromosomal insertion by electroporation was attempted several times, but in vain. In consideration of the fact that RelE is a bacterial toxin, the cloning of this gene was inconvenient. The model indicated, that overexpression of the antitoxin RelB would bypass this difficulty. As the homologous recombination of this fragment emerged such a challenging task, it was decided to focus on the conduct of the OmpR-regulated promoter on different plasmids, as this was evidently the more convenient approach of the general implementation of the OmpR-regulated promoter.
An Inducible Promoter was Chosen to Regulate the Gene Expression of the Antitoxin RelB
Originally, it was thought to place the antitoxin RelB under a constitutive promoter of appropriate strength. However, as the modelling revealed, strict regulation of RelB is essential to counteract the toxic effect of RelE and enable a functional dormancy system. Thus, it was deduced that it would be more suitable to utilise an inducible promoter for this purpose and it was decided to put RelB under control of the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 . The William and Mary team found that the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter had a low level of noise,  a measure of the variability in gene expression between cells in the population, when cloned into a low copy vector. Therefore, this"

Over the summer, our team lead Jack was able to attend the Cornell SILS (Summer Institute of Life Sciences) symposium and meet members of the Cornell iGEM Team. He was able to speak with some of their members, particularly their team lead Rahul and tour their lab spaces. We greatly appreciate the openness and collaborations of the Cornell iGEM Team and Jack enjoyed seeing what it would be like to have an entire lab space dedicated to iGEM research!
Spoke with Experts to Analyze our System
September 2018
In September we began communicating with experts in environmental testing and the water safety industry. Due to their feedback we modified our initial project design to make it more user friendly, and altered the intended scope of our project application after re-analyzing the testing systems in place within the large scale water management industry.
Tested HRP and Substrates based on new system goals
September 2018
After re-examining our system impact and applicability we also needed to change the substrates and ratio of HRP-Substrate we had been intending on using with our test kit to better suit the niche our kit best fills. Based on these changes we began testing new combinations and concentrations of our substrates and HRP to optimize our kit in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
Obtained clones in pSB1C3
October 2018
After much frustration we finally succeeded in obtaining successful clones of our parts both with and without the trc-promoter (also known as Ptac) in pSB1C3!
Visited MMSD treatment plant
October 2018
As another layer to our system design investigations we visited and toured the Milwaukee Municipal Sewer District (MMSD) wastewater treatment plant to learn whether or not our project would be viable on the large scale of Municipal Sewer Effluent management. Additionally, we sought to compare how our project could be used at small scale wastewater treatment facilities versus massive facilities such as the MMSD facilities in the Milwaukee area.
System Prototyping and Continued Testing
October 2018
After analyzing substrate-HRP ratios and which methods would suit our test kit system, we began a system prototype, conjugated HRP to our proteins, and performed some testing to optimize system operation both in controlled ideal lab circumstances and in more realistic circumstances to determine the viability of our product.

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#Biobrick_-_-_TEXT.html,", generously sent us a plate of both S. pasteurii and HB101/pBU11 E.coli, and provided us with wonderful advice and information throughout the entire summer.  The E. coli strain we were sent had been transformed with a plasmid containing the urease cassette of S. pasteurii and standard backbone pBR322. The sequence of pBR322 is freely available in many online databases, but the exact sequence of the urease cassette was unknown. As previously stated, we were unable to find or access the scientific literature that detailed the sequence or genes within the cassette. The only information we were able to obtain from inquires and research was that the cassette itself was approximately 10.7 kb long, and was inserted into the HindIII restriction site of plasmid backbone pBR322.
Sequencing
We put considerable energy into searching for the sequence in online databases; our search on NCBI yielded 3 distinct urease operons, none of which were the size of our cassette. Furthermore, we found few possible patterns of overlap among those NCBI results to predict a construct of 10.7 kb.   In the end we decided to pursue sequencing the construct sent to us. We were lucky enough to have met members of the Mason Lab of the Weill-Cornell Medical College earlier who generously offered to sequence the urease construct with their PacBio high-throughput sequencing platform. We graciously accepted and sent off copies of the original pBU11 plasmid for sequencing, but due to unforseen circumstances and poor luck with the platform and reagents we have not yet been able to obtain the sequence. We are now pursuing the sequence of the entire operon through more traditional primer walking, and we hope to have the entire data set available by MIT.
Biobricking of Urease Cassette
Primer Design - To clone the urease cassette out of pBR322 and modify it into a biobrick part, we designed sequence primers that would anneal to the template DNA but maintain an unbound DNA “tail” containing the appropriate restriction site sequences (E, X, S, P) for that end of the operon. EcoRI and XbaI were built into the forward primer, SpeI, PstI into the reverse. Because we did not know the sequence of the urease cassette, designing primers for the sequence would have been guesswork. Instead, we deigned the primers to anneal to the sequences of pBR322 that flanked both sides of the pBR322 HindIII cut site, into which the"

The beginning of our project
During a regular seminar of virology, we discussed about different possibilities to engage into scientific research as soon as possible. Annabel and Nicole came up with the idea to participate in the iGEM competition. We were motivated by the outlook to conduct our own research project with all tasks and responsibilities but with close supervision by experienced researchers. Mostly we were eager to gain experience working in the lab.
After collecting more information about the competition online and from other participants, we decided to bring iGEM to Wuerzburg and founded the first team of our university. Together with two additional bachelor students we motivated Prof. Jochen Bodem to become our PI. He also provided us with lab space to get started with the lab work. By advertising our project among friends, we soon got more and more students, until we were a huge group of 50 participants.
After various brainstorming sessions we decided to start exploring new methods in the detection of infectious diseases.  This led us to our project, designing a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish different types of Plasmodium, the pathogen which causes Malaria.
Organizing the team in different subgroups meant that every student could contribute to the topic they liked the most. Unfortunately, many students did not spend as much time and passion on our project as necessary, so our team shrank to the final number of eleven student members and three advisors. Our final team consists of an interdisciplinary synergy of bachelor students from biology, biomedicine, medicine and mathematics.
German Meetup in Marburg
As a newly established team we were excited to get in contact with the other teams at the German meetup in Marburg. Especially, we exchanged some ideas about the different projects and talked about problems we had to face in the wet lab. This exchange of experience resulted in a huge benefit for our project in the following weeks.
We were introduced to team Marburg’s project for the first time. Later we established a collaboration with team Marburg by participating in their Vibrio natriegens InterLab Study. Moreover, we learned much more about the iGEM competition itself and got contacts to students more familiar to the iGEM competition"

Overview
Plastiback is a synthetic-biology powered system to combat the global problem of plastic pollution. Plastiback sustainably breaks down and gives feedback on where PET, a type of plastic, is located. PET is a popular plastic with many uses, including making most disposable plastic bottles. Because of its popularity, PET is also one of the predominant sources of plastic pollution.
While PET pollutes both the land and sea, the majority of PET litter ends up in the ocean. When plastic like PET enters the ocean, it has detrimental effects on ocean ecosystems and can travel up the food chain even to the seafood on our plates. Once in the ocean, PET becomes difficult to clean up and even more difficult to study. Without good information about the distribution of ocean plastic, ocean plastic researchers are hindered from understanding the negative effects on ocean ecology and human health. For researchers like these who are investigating the scope and distribution of PET in the ocean, Plastiback presents a novel and sustainable way to track ocean PET, while also using non-toxic methods to degrade PET!
Background
The main problem: plastic in the ocean and why it matters “... More than 5 trillion plastic pieces, weighing more than 250,000 tonnes float on the surface of the world’s oceans…” 1.
Plastic in the ocean has long been a problem for the environment. It is estimated that 80% of plastic debris in the ocean are from a land-based source, such as landfills, wastewater, coastal recreational activities, and littering2. The other 20% is ocean-based debris, mostly from the commercial fishing industry discarding fishing gear into the ocean 2. When plastic litters the ocean, it can be ingested by numerous marine organisms from whales to plankton, causing health complications to individuals, and possibly affecting the ecosystem overall. Plastic also poses a threat to marine organisms that get entangled and die, either to suffocation, injury caused by entanglement, or reduced fitness. Ocean plastic is not only hazardous to marine life though - plastics have potential consequences for humans too! Rochman et al. (2015)3 studied fish from public"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test - Eighth Protocol
This is our eighth round of mutagenesis. In some respect, this is the most successful of our mutagenesis yet, because we were able to to get a high titer of phage in each aliquot collected after CsCl purification (with an estimated average of 10E7 pfu/mL). However, because phages are spread out throughout the gradient and did not band, we cannot identify which ones are wild type and which ones are mutant.

SF_Bay_Area_DIYbio,2014,Team:SF Bay Area DIYbio#ELSEI_-_-_TEXT.html," because they want to learn more about biology. Instead, we believe that the best and most respectful response to public ambivalence is to develop and use biotechnologies in a radically open and transparent manner, with a continual solicitation of input and participation from the public.
Safety
Adopt safe practices. Comply with FDA guidelines; Biosafety level 1.
Environment
Respect the environment. We believe that using animals as large-scale food production machines is ethically and environmentally irresponsible. The Real Vegan Cheese project was motivated by a desire to find more sustainable and humane alternatives to the model of industrial agriculture. While using yeast seems clearly preferable from an animal welfare perspective, assessing the environmental impact of shifting production to yeast is more complicated. To understand whether large-scale cheese production using yeast would be more environmentally friendly than the current mammal-based model, our team is working on comparing the efficiency of each method: how much biomass is required to produce a given amount of cheese through each method? How much energy input is required for both? Finally, the dairy industry is known to be a significant contributor of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet (producing 4% of the total human-caused greenhouse gases, according to a 2010 UN report). Could our method of cheese production help reduce this number?
Peaceful Purposes
Biotechnology should only be used for peaceful purposes. We are currently living the consequences of science used in the name of creating power and profit for people (environmental degradation, poor access to meds). If humanity wants to grow and evolve into the future, we must harness the power of biology for the betterment of the planet and its inhabitants. Real Vegan Cheese has committed itself to producing a sustainable and renewable food source that is not only good for human consumption, but also good for the planet. We recognize the potential of open-access projects to contribute to resource equality and peace around the globe and are committed to playing our part in moving humanity forward.
Tinkering
Tinkering with biology leads to insight; insight leads to innovation.
In our work, we are not only tinkering with biology; we are also tinkering with the kinds of social forms that support scientific innovation. Our diverse, open, and decentralized group is practicing science in a new way, with different constraints and motivations than teams in the academic or corporate world. We are consensus based, rather than having a PI or a CEO. Inevitably, our organization will inflect the work we do and the direction we take the project.
It takes continued reflection, and occasional readjustments, to the organizational aspects of the project (for example, how team"

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html," for a public model of research for bio-bricks or whether it goes for the private patent type approach. At the moment BioBricks are a relatively small but rapidly evolving field, compared to all the private investments that are being made on GMOs. Therefore it is very difficult to extrapolate whether the open-source model would succeed in a ten to twenty years time frame.
7. Europe vs. US
The K.U.Leuven iGEM had a question addressing the BioBricks standard. “The BioBricks originally evolved from the MIT in the USA, is the European Union helping scientists to come up with a different competing standard? As BioBricks are just a standard that everyone is following willingly as there is no alternative. Moreover a lot of universities take part in the iGEM competition and use BioBricks to increase their visibility, as it is prestigious to be associated with the MIT. But is there a possibility that European Universities come up with a different standard? Is it possible that the European Union will miss the train again, like they did with the GMOs?”
The EC is certainly trying and that's their sole motive in funding research on synthetic biology and biotechnology in general. A lot of activity is currently ongoing at the EC on talking with the US on standards. It is not a feeling that the EU is missing the boat but obviously it is clear that the US is the most important player and leading the way. So it is important for the EU also to have an initiative not competing with the US but having, an agreement with the US in terms of a common standard.
The K.U.Leuven iGEM team commented that the European groups fiercely compete score generally really high and thought that right now Europeans are the ones creating it for America. This led to another interesting discussion that this is indeed a pity for Europe as Europeans have an excellent basic knowledge, but, like in many fields, often the final products that make the money are made in the US. The students again wondered, “Why is it like that?” The explanations that were given are that the Americans have more access to venture capital. The Europeans are really good at having this research infrastructure but we are not so good in bringing the idea into a product. It is also more expensive to get a patent in Europe. Also the US has one language and in Europe although there is a European patent office, the patent application has to be translated into all the different languages of the European Union so the system is slower and more expensive to go through.
Indeed the private funding for research in Europe is much smaller than it is in the US and this private funding"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

WLC-Milwaukee,2018,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," practice is education. People need to aware that unseen dangers reside in the waters they drink and use every day. Accepting the existence and understanding the dangers of microscopic organisms is difficult without prior education on the subject. Visual readout water testing can be an effective way to teach people about the contents of their drinking water.
We believe that our project will safely and effectively fill a variety of the gaps in current water testing and management practices that are globally significant. To confirm this belief and receive feedback that would help improve our project, we turned to a variety of experts in the water industry for help.
Over the course of our project, members of our team spoke with experts from The Water Council- an international non-profit organization dedicated to improving water stewardship and management.
In particular, we spoke with Dr. Barry Liner a technical advisor with The Water Council in a phone interview. We asked Dr. Liner questions regarding his opinion on the availability of water testing for consumers in developed and developing areas and what he sees as the primary current issues in water stewardship. It was indicated that water usage practices (including over-usage) in certain regions of the world, contamination of freshwater by poor usage in industry, and a lack of access to safe drinking water and water education were primary areas of concern to which solutions are desperately needed. While this information did not directly change the implementation of our project or its scope, it did reinforce our understanding of global needs for improved water management and testing practices.
Members of our team were also able to visit and tour the Milwaukee Municipal Sewer District wastewater treatment facility at Jones' Island, Milwaukee. This tour including the water effluent testing information, and first hand experience with the methods employed at large, successful, and developed wastewater treatment facilities allowed us to limit the scope of our project and strategies.
Throughout this experience, it was made very clear that the regulations, including those at the federal, state, and city level, for wastewater treatment facilities of this size (the MMSD Wastewater treatment facility at Jones' Island serves roughly 1.2 million people) very thoroughly cover nearly every imaginable form of water contamination. It was, however, noted that every year, this facility- with some of the best treatment practices in the country- still experiences overages wherein the facility cannot handle the incoming wastewater and dumps untreated waste into Lake Michigan, one of the largest usable bodies of freshwater in the world.
This type of contamination of Lake Michigan can negatively impact the millions of people that use its water for recreation in and around Milwaukee Wisconsin.
This interview and tour helped us better analyze the possible applications of our kit and although our test kit"

-We presented our project today.  -There were a few things that we needed to do better.
For one, we need to present better background and show how it ties into our research, specifically the need for a capsid library.
I feel like we could have been a bit more engaging and better rehearsed as well.
We will need to find a way to test the capsids for viability, and somehow characterize them.

TUST_China,2018,Team:TUST China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," We have never conducted any dangerous experiments in our daily work or encountered any unusual safety problems throughout the competation.
Furthermore, our laboratories are equipped with first-aid cabinet. Once an emergency occurs, it will be handled correctly in time.
Design safety
Out of Safety considerations, we added the φX174E gene to prevent the strain from leaking antibiotics into the environment during testing when we were designing the chassis. The φX174E gene is initiated by pLac and regulated by LacI and IPTG. Adding a certain concentration of IPTG to our trophic bacteria liquid will make φX174E express strongly and achieve the purpose of lysis cells, thus preventing the leakage of engineering strain.
Strain safety
We strictly abide by the iGEM Safety principles and stop the spawn leakage. Not only that, we sterilize the used Petri Dishes and the used seed liquid in the triangle bottles, which are toxic, irritating, volatile, strong acid and strong alkali waste liquor to carry on the standard procedure recovery treatment.
Safe transportation
According to the official website requirements of ""parts registration"", we safely transfer some of the DNA to the next 96 hole plate, submitting after freeze-drying. In this way, these DNA are absolutely safe and will not leak into the environment.

Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," acid, which can react with primary amino groups to form orange-colored products whose absorbance is at 335-345nm2.
The nylC Biobrick (BBa_K1357007) is introduced into E. coli BL-21 and the bacteria are cultured for approximately 20 hours. After centrifugation, the cell pellets are lysed by lysozyme and the resultant lysate which contains nylC enzyme is used to degrade nylon 6 samples3. Mass difference of nylon samples before and after experiment are determined and the nylon is imaged using scanning electron microscope (SEM). In addition, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid is used to test the production of primary amino groups in solution.
The actual nylon we tested on in lab!
Buffer Preparation:
Since nylC has its optimal activity at pH between 7.2-7.3, both the monobasic and dibasic of potassium phosphate (KH2PO4 and K2HPO4) are used to prepare buffer A1. The concentration of stock solution of buffer A is made to be 100mM potassium phosphate (KH2PO4 and K2HPO4) and 10% glycerol. The pH used in experiment was 7.23.
Lysis buffer is required to disrupt bacterial cells. 1M Tris-HCl (pH=7.5), 1M DTT, 100mM PMSF are prepared as stock solution beforehand. The DTT and PMSF are aliquoted and stored in -20 degree freezer. The working solution of lysis buffer contains 50mM PMSF, 5% glycerol and 1mM DTT.
Procedure:
Culture BL-21 (DE3) E. coli containing nylC Biobrick in 200-300mL liquid LB (with 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol) for 20 hours in 37 degree incubator.
After centrifugation, resuspend every 1 gram of cell pellet with 1 mL of chilled lysis buffer. Then add 10μL PMSF (100mM) for every 1 mL of cell suspension.
Add lysosyme into the suspension to reach the final concentration 1mg/mL and incubate the cell suspension at 4 degrees Celsius for 4 hours.
Add 5 μL MgCl2 (1M) and 1μL DNase (1mg/1mL) for every 1mL of cell suspension and incubate the solution at 4 degrees Celsius for"

Previously with 2D induction modeling only coarse grain measurements and rough/inaccurate induction distance could be obtained. Use of the 3D analysis allowed for X,Y & Z coordinates to be obtained which provided quantitative data to be obtained for the actual strength of induction. This was analyzed against a known positive GFP+ control. These measurements allowed for further contextualization of the various side quests which reﬁned our ability to analyze the differences between different sender/receiver combos.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," Next week in addition to sending the remaining 6 samples for sequencing, we will be trying the process all over again to get as many more synthesized genes BioBricked as possible.
Week 19: Sept 29 - Oct 3
This week when we got the sequencing results back we discovered that the parts we thought had successfully been BioBricked were actually CjBlue , a chromoprotein, and not our synthesized constructs in the iGEM plasmid. We went back and realigned the sequences from other repressor ligations last week and it turns out that those samples were also CjBlue. We then went back and re-aligned the lacZ sequences that had been previously sent for sequencing and found that they too contained CjBlue. Thus, the mystery of the CjBlue began…
We started the process again by transforming more of our synthesized constructs into E. coli and mini-prepped those samples. To try to narrow down where CjBlue contamination was coming from we sent in all undigested mini-prepped samples of our synthesized constructs from this week and last week for sequencing. We also sent in our stock of mini-prepped vectors (used for plasmid switch our synthesized parts into) for sequencing to verify that these are RFP. and not the source of cj blue contamination. Once these results are back we will be one step closer to figuring out where the cj blue entered the picture. Our summer iGEM project was also presented at the University of Calgary BHSc research symposium. Finally, on Saturday, we went back to the cPCR agarose gels we ran last week, in which we chose colonies that we thought contained the correct construct in the iGEM plasmid. Looking back now it appears that these bands are a bit higher than they should be (~700bp). We decided to use the samples that were around ~500bp instead, even though we were expecting a bit higher than that. We made overnights of these samples and mini-prepped them and will be sending them in for sequencing to find out if we have successfully transformed the ligated product.
Week 20: Oct 6 - 10
We sent in the 43 samples for sequencing that we thought contained our BioBricks. The results indicated that the promoter, Pveg, was present in the plasmid, but the rest of the construct was not there. Unlike last time, these samples did not contain CjBlue. This week we made it through two cycles of digestion, ligation, and transformation of our parts.  The first round of digestion/ligation/transformation"

We selected two proteins SAHS1 and CAHS1, which have been shown with excellent effects by a Japanese team in 2012. SAHS1 could be used to preserve proteins and CAHS1 could be used to preserve bacteria.
Our genetic circuits are shown below:

CAHS protein is a cytoplasmic-abundant protein which can strengthen the stress tolerance of bacteria. Taking biosafety into account, we added constant promoter J23100 into the CAHS circuit to express lacI in order to inhibit lac O promoter. Once IPTG is added, the inhibition of lacI will be removed. Then CAHS and mRFP will be expressed, in which mRFP was used for screening. We intended to adopt the Red recombination method to transform the circuit into the genome of DH5α. Hence, DH5α would be improved and preserved easily.

Clearly the Low copy vector has much higher transcriptional efficiency of [GFP] than the High copy vector.
So we selected a Low copy vector (pSB6A1) to produce fluorescent proteins.
3. Constructing an expression system
We constructed an expression system in which the active oxygen response promoter controls the transcription of fluorescent protein genes on pSB6, and transformed this vector into DH5 Alpha competent cells. Here we show an expressing system by using ahpC promoter and sufA promoter among 7 promoters which we constructed. We then examined the fluorescent intensity using the cells treated with H2O2 as follows:
<Experiment method>
E.coli cells in the log-phase were treated with H2O2 at 37℃. The fluorescent intensity was measured every 10 minutes until 80minutes. After the treatment with H2O2, cells were suspended in PBS to obtain the initial OD600 = 0.5 because the LB medium has auto fluorescence, then the fluorescent intensity was measured using Thermo Labosystems Floreskan Ascent CF.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," when the RelE production is lowered. Out of the established configurations, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration showed promising results. Compared to the RelB2:35-RelE:35 configuration, where only few bacteria reenter an active state within the modelled time set to 2.5 hours, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration revealed a high sensitivity to the expression level of RelB. This indicated a need for the expression of RelB to be higher than RelE, but as the best results were achieved at low production rates of RelE, it is important to stringently control the expression of RelB to ensure that the bacteria are able to enter dormancy.
Figure 3. The variation in time required for the bacteria to enter an active state for different expression levels of RelB is dependent on the level of RelE expression. All configurations achieve dormancy within the modelled time.
Figure 4. RelB2:50-RelE:35 induces an active state within minutes, whereas RelB:35-RelE:35 only causes few of the bacteria to enter an active state. In the remaining configurations all bacteria remained dormant.
Discussion of Model Regarding the Artificial Dormancy System
Model Limitations
As the model only simulates the dormancy for 2 hours, not all configurations have reached equilibrium, therefore these configurations might attain a higher concentration of free RelE than modelled. This could result in a prolonged phase reentering an active state. The activation model has a rather weak predictability, as the half-life of RelE is quite high. This essentially means, that the model is unable to reduce the total amount of RelE, given by RelEtot=RelEfree+RelEbound, because of the short simulated timespan. Thus, in activation runs, where the number of free RelE molecules reaches a high level, the amount of RelEbound is equally high. The problem arises, since the model works under the assumption that bound RelB is not completely stable, causing RelE-RelB complexes to dissociate, whereby RelE is freed. This causes the induced RelB expression to approach equilibrium, implying that the decrease in free RelE is rather slow. It is therefore not only the amount of free RelE that determines the activation time, but also whether the amount of dissociating complexes is high enough to counter the RelB production. Hence, it has no relevance to further test high RelE production in this model, as a high number of complexes will easily be achieved.

Developing our idea
In the first week, several potential projects for iGEM were discussed and researched thoroughly by our team, ranging from hemoglobin, telomere to bionic technology and acceleration of banana’s ripening. But concerning the practicality and safety of our project, we ultimately decided to conduct a research on mosquito repellents. Before we started, it was essential for us to be acquainted with ecophysiology of mosquitoes and public expectations of current mosquito repellents, so we distributed a questionnaire both online and offline. Moreover, we also went to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and visited several experts there to know about the latest development on repelling mosquitoes.
Public engagement
Questionnaire
In order to know the expectations of current mosquito repellent products in the market, we designed a questionnaire, and put it online and offline. Our questionnaire covered task-oriented questions from the often-used mosquito treatment methods, the subjective evaluation of the effectiveness, the concern about toxic substances, to the acceptance level of biosynthesized products. More aspects were considered through the design of our questionnaire. A questionnaire must cooperate with people. In the real-life scenario, we shortened the question down to 10 to ensure the effectiveness of the research. In China and oversea*, 807* peoples have answered the questionnaire. This questionnaire served as a lighthouse, providing information to potentially improve our overall as well as guiding us to shape our project well. The results showed that most of the people are annoyed with the disgusting mosquitoes. From people’s feedback of our questionnaire, we also knew that non-toxin and high effectiveness are considered as the most significant features of mosquito repellents by the public.
Field Trip to CDC
In order to get some professional knowledge about taxonomy and ecophysiology of mosquitoes, the disease they transfers,  and the specialized method people use to prevent mosquito-caused diseases, we went to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and consulted  with the experts on July the 28th. The staff showed us the specimens of various kinds of mosquitoes and the mosquito capturing devices. From the conversation, we realized that the mainstream way of mosquito treatment"

Removal of Bacterial Endotoxin from T7 Phage Nanoparticles
The bacterial endotoxin (LPS) concentration in all T7 nanoparticle preparations was determined in triplicate using a sensitive colorimetric Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) QCL-1000® kit (Lonza, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LPS was removed from T7 phage nanoparticles based on a method for removal of endotoxin from protein solutions by phase separation using Triton X-114 as described by Aida et al.

While talking on the webinars we got plenty of tips on how other teams handle social media, IPR and social responsibility. We also talked to the general public about their concerns and opinions when it comes to technological advances. From there we learned how to adjust our marketing strategy of the project and work with the end user to gain insight on how to increase trust and reduce fear.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Implementation#syntf_-_-_TEXT.html," act as spacers to protect the part from enzyme cleavage.  When two Biobrick parts are ligated together according to the Standard Assembly, exactly one spacer nucleotide from each Biobrick is maintained in the composite part.  The result is a total of eight nucleotides that lie between the two parts, comprised of these two spacers plus the hybrid XbaI/SpeI site.
Biobrick standard
However, Biofusion parts lack these additional nucleotides.  Thus, when two Biofusion parts are fused together in the same manner, the parts are separated by only six nucleotides.
Biofusion standard
The difference in separation length between two DNA parts is significant with respect to translation.  During protein synthesis, ribosomes recognize groups of three consecutive nucleotides known as codons and translate each codon into a particular amino acid.  Should an additional nucleotide appear in the mRNA sequence, the the grouping of nucleotides into threes will be shifted, resulting in an entirely new and undesired sequence of amino acids.
Therefore, since the length of the sequence separating two Biobrick parts is not divisible by three, a frame shift occurs.  If the second Biobrick happens to be a protein-coding sequence of DNA, it will not be translated correctly. Biofusion improves upon these constraints, enabling a synthetic biologist to append numerous protein-coding regions to one another.
By nature of their design, both Biobrick and Biofusion parts can be utilized in the design of modular devices. However, the Biofusion standard provides for even greater customization by allowing for the creation of fusion proteins, hybrid proteins formed by the fusion of protein domains to one another to generate a single functional protein with characteristics from its constitutive parts.
This modular scheme for protein design lies at the heart of our limiter device.
Synthetic transcription factors
Excluding the case of our proof-of-principle design, our limiter device is composed entirely of synthetic transcription factors created according to the Biofusion standard.
As described in Ajo-Franklin et al. (2007), the laboratory of Dr. Pamela Silver at Harvard developed these synthetic transcription factors for the construction of a novel “memory device” in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.   While the details of this device are not essential to understanding our own gene network, it is important to discuss the significance of these transcription factors to our design.

Content: eight gene circuits’ construction
1.Construction of gene circuit four: we used standard method of biobrick connection to put the coding sequence of mCherry protein behind Pλ promoter. And when we planned to construct the part CFP expression controlled by PLlacI promoter, we didn’t find CFP with LVA tag in the Plate Kits, so we decided to get this part through PCR which means that we added a LVA tag behind the coding sequence of CFP. And then, we used standard method of biobrick to connect PLlacI promoter with the coding sequence of CFP to finish the whole circuit. Figure 5 will show the visual effects of mCherry protein expression and CFP expression under the fluorescent microscope.
Figure 5. a was without any excitation light; b and c were mCherry protein expression and CFP expression under the fluorescent microscope
2.Construction of gene circuit five: Because of the complex stem-loop structure of RNA aptamer, it was very hard to get this part by overlapping PCR. So, we found a company to help us to synthetize the sequence of RNA aptamer, and we standardized RNA aptamer and also we connected it with the promoter (lambda cI regulated). To test whether it works or not, we synthetized corresponding fluorophore called DHMBI, and saw the figure under the fluorescent microscope as shown in the output module .
3.Construction of gene circuit six and eight: Construction of gene circuit six and eight: These two gene circuits are familiar in their structure and then, we constructed them simultaneously. Firstly, we divided the circuit into two parts: riboregulator and Cre protein with double terminators. When it came to the synthesis of riboregulator, we designed four specific primers which had almost 20 overlapping sequence and conducted twice PCR to get our riboregulator (more details are shown in our protocol and the input module ). Then, we connected both of them by the standard method of biobrick connection.

Project research in the early period:
During the investigation of the previous project, we consulted Dr. Jiang about the most                         important                         research topic of                         synthetic biology in “Simplified Design and Synthesis of Life”. Dr. Jiang first briefed for us                         on                         the                         Syn1.0-Syn3.0                         project that top scientists such as Craig Venter and Gibson have been devoted into, which                         centers                         around                         simplifying                         the design and de novo synthesis of the mycoplasma genome and achieving the breakthrough of                         artificially creating                         the simplest living body. We also learned the rapid development of genome synthesis technology                         in                         recent years,                         including the synthesis of artificial genome synthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli.

On the one hand, there                         is no                         precedent for                         simplifying the design of mitochondrial genome and synthesizing it from the beginning. Such                         research                         bears a                         positive scientific exploration significance and can also provide some reference for the                         research                         of                         the simplest life design, mitochondrial research and etc. On the other hand, the mitochondrial genome scale                         is                         relatively small,                         with only several Ks. Compared with other living organism genomes, the synthesis cost and cycle                         are                         more                         advantageous, making the project more tangible. Dr. Jiang expressed his willingness to help us                         in                         genome design and                         synthesis. Additionally, Dr. Jiang also assisted us in contacting Professor Gu Zhenglong of                         Cornell                         University, who                         has long been committed to the study of the relationship between mitochondrial gene and                         function                         and                         basic                         researches on mitochondrial diseases.
After the exchange, we also had some exchanges with Nankai University, where we discussed the                         projects                         with each                         other this year. Our advisers gave them some suggestions for the competition.
What is more, we also consulted Dr. Jiang about the safety of artificially designed life. The                         ""Pandora                         Box"" effect                         that synthetic biotechnology may bring is a constant concern of the scientific community as                         well as                         the                         society.                         Dr. Jiang first affirmed our concern about this issue. He believes that this is a problem that all                         researchers need to                         consider. After all, our understanding of nature is still not comprehensive.

Radiation-resistance? There's a Gene for That.
Our iGEM squadron consists of students from the Dalton School, Hunter College, Columbia University, Yeshiva University, NYU-Poly, and Cornell University. Our advisors (and donated workspace) reside at Weill Cornell Medical College on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Briefly, over the summer we will be investigating the genetic mechanisms for ionizing radiation resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans through genome sequencing, RNA-sequencing experiments, and high throughput cloning.
Our Project
We're placing genes from Deinococcus radiodurans into E. coli and upregulating some of E. coli's own genes. We targeted genes associated with radioresistance in the hopes of conferring radioresistance upon radiovulnerable E. coli. Future applications for the control of cellular resistance to radiation include bioremediation of radioactive waste, highly effective stem cell transplants, and terraforming Mars.
Our Approach
We've been examining the literature on different approaches to explaining Deinococcus radiodurans' radioresistance:
1. DNA Repair - Dr. John Battista's work has focused on the rapid DNA repair mechanisms of D. rad and their attendant proteins as the responsible parties for its extraordinary radioresistance.
2. Cellular Metabolome - Dr. Michael Daly's research suggests that the higher Manganese to Iron Ratio in D. rad increases antioxidant properties in the cells and reduces damage from radiative events.
3. Neutralization of superoxide radicals - the Superoxide Dismutase / Catalase system has been shown to neutralize damaging oxygen radicals in a variety of species from Humans to Wheat.
Our Considerations

William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," orthogonal to the endogenous protein degradation systems in E. coli. Using this orthogonal degradation system helps eliminate cross-talk between our system and endogenous E. coli proteins. Further, since there are pdts with a wide range of different affinities, we are able to tune degradation rate, and thus gene expression speed to a wide variety of values. This represents not only a practical advancement in the tuning of circuits, but also an important contribution in our theoretical understanding of biological processes, as to our knowledge there has so far been no direct experimental measurement in the literature of the predicted 1/γ scaling of a gene's speed with its degradation rate. See our results page for more details.
Modeling
Finally, by constructing a mechanistic model of our degradation system, we were able to rigorously analyze our timeseries datasets using Bayesian Parameter Inference and obtain parameter distributions (Figure 4). We then used this analysis to feed back into our predictive saturation model, which we used to develop the beginnings of a theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between protease-driven speed control and saturation effects on the protease. By combining our characterization measurements with our conceptual insights, future iGEM teams are now enabled to use the pdt system to predictably control the temporal dynamics of their genetic circuits. See our modeling page for details
Figure 4: MCMC parameter estimation for a simple protein production model correctly estimates the simulated values for both beta and gamma (15 and .03 respectively). In addition, the MCMC identifies a strong positive correlation between beta and gamma. This makes sense as steady-state levels of protein are set by the ratio Beta/Gamma. Therefore as beta goes up we should see a corresponding increase in gamma to best fit the model.

The collaboration with TJU
We started our contact with team TJU from the very beginning of the summer. Since both teams are working on the MFC system, we have shared a lot of experience on it, including the MFC device setup, medium condition control and part characterization. Additionally, we had lots of online and offline discussion with them.
In the middle of the project, we came to Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Tianjin University) to have a project seminar with them. During the discussion, we knew that they have constructed a lactate producing part named ldhE. However, their characterization of this part was faced with some problem. To be specific, engineered E.coli strain bearing the ldhE part showed little difference with the wild type. (shown as follows)
Fig.1 The production of lactate in MG1665-WT. The cells were cultured in 37C for 15h and the lactate concentration was measured by HPLC.
For the lactate producing system, we have helped team TJU to optimize and characterize the ldhE part. From their introduction, we know that LDH is an enzyme catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate with NADH serving as the coenzyme. Initially, they intended to introduce high-yield u L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) from Lactobacillus, which could produce a relatively larger amount of L-lactate for Shewanella. Consequently, we decided to focus on the assistant method to help them resolve the problem.
After some consultant, we noticed that the wild type E. coli's LDH reaction is not as competitive as the reaction through PFL, which might result in the ineffectiveness of ldhE.[1] Therefore, knockout of the PFL related genes will contribute to redistribute the metabolic flux. In addition, we searched in the part registry of IGEM and found the part BBa_K341458 and part BBa_K341002, which revealed a more effective and easy-to-use method for gene knockout.
In the system we searched, the cell is ﬁrst transformed with a helper plasmid harboring genes encoding the λ-Red enzymes, I-SceI endonuclease, and RecA."

This could perhaps explain the similarity between the TaqI sequences, as these could be the fragments corresponding to cuts where there was no overlap in methylation.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," allow proteins to diffuse through. Since the size of E. coli is 0.5µm x 2µm, we used a mixed cellulose ester membrane with pore sizes of 0.2µm. Bacteria can be grown on a thin LB agar contained between our semi-permeable membrane and an outer hydrocolloid covering (to keep bacteria from escaping on the other side). We have successfully built a functional prototype, and used different methods to test the effectiveness of both the semi-permeable membrane's ability to contain bacteria and allow proteins through.
Testing the Semi-Permeable Membrane
Prototype testing allows us to determine the viability of our theoretical drug delivery construct. First, we tested the ability of the semi-permeable membrane to sustain bacteria growth on LB agar, but prevent the bacteria from moving to the other side. We streaked out bacteria onto LB agar on one side of the membrane, and placed a clean LB agar on the other side (set up shown in Figure 15). After allowing growth overnight, we checked for the presence of bacteria on the clean LB agar. Two trials were done, and our results show no growth on the clean LB agar (one trial shown in Figure 16). This demonstrates that the 0.2µm cellulose ester membrane can be used to keep bacteria inside the bandage, so there is no direct contact with the skin.
A second test was carried out to independently test the semi-permeable membrane (Figure 17). Again, we found that the membrane was successful in preventing bacteria from moving across.
Figure 15: Experimental set-up to test the effectiveness of the semi-permeable membrane. To test if the membrane can keep bacteria on the inside of the bandage, we sandwiched the membrane between two LB agar layers. Bacteria was streaked onto the top LB layer, and the bottom layer was checked to see if any bacteria traveled through the membrane.
Figure 16: Semi-Permeable Membrane Test Results. The experiment described in Figure 15 was set up, and plates were incubated at 37⁰C to allow the bacteria to grow. In the positive control, bacteria passed through medical gauze and grew on the bottom LB layer. However, when the semi-permeable was tested, no bacteria growth was found on the bottom layer.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,", the most common use of phosphorus, are given an exception for use, the danger still remains that the collected phosphate may be a target for those seeking to do harm.
Munitions aren’t the only dangerous use of this collected phosphorus. The collected phosphorus could be used for the result it was built to avoid. Accidental (or intentional) release of concentrated phosphorus could spur algae blooms in the region our system is in place to protect, as phosphorus is generally the limiting resource, this creates a vulnerability in our system as any puncture of the storage container could result in contamination of the body of water.
Our system was designed to collect phosphorus, however we acknowledge that this system can be applied to collect other chemicals or nutrients of interest. Our model could be used to collect herbicides, harmful chemicals, and could be used in consort with other iGEM projects such as the 2013 project of Nanjing or Dundee. As we expand this model to collect other resources the risks will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and modifications to our system should be undertaken to mitigate as many risks as possible.
“Playing God”: As with most iGEM projects, we will surely be accused of “playing God” in our desire to implement a system and assuming we have foreseen and planned for all the outcomes. Obviously this isn’t true, there are serious concerns with a project of this scale, and therefore we propose several questions to further critical examination of our system.
There is the concern that our system will work too well. That it could possibly strip the ecosystem of phosphorus. We apply phosphorus in the form of fertilizer because it can be the limiting nutrient for crop growth. However, if our system overperforms, we may strip enough from the aqueous environment that it may cause detrimental effects to the plants that rely on that environment.
Patent & Business Plan
The patents we would issue on our system would be two fold. The first would be patents concerning the genetic pathways to induce luxury phosphorus uptake, store that phosphorus and release it on command. This would allow us to benefit from the retail value of our organism. We would couch this within the unique ability to capture, store, and release compounds from the environment in a more concentrated form allowing the patent to potentially cover more than just phosphorus. The second level of our patents would concern the way these engineered bacteria are housed within the xerogel beads, and the larger phosphorus reclamation module that allows them to uptake luxury amounts of not just phosphorus but other compounds that have increased value when concentrated from the environment.

William_and_Mary,2015,Team:William and Mary#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"rius Lab. There, we will be sharing doing four synthetic biology activities with the public.
The Activities Booklet
After hosting our workshops, we compiled 24 of the activities we ran with participants into a single Synthetic Biology educational booklet. Each activity lists the procedure, background information, materials and cost for the activity, critical learning questions, and learning goals. We made an effort to keep the activities low-cost and used materials easily accessible to teachers. We included background information so that teachers with limited Biology background could easily run the activities. The booklet includes worksheets, labs, and activities that can be completed by first graders to AP Biology students, and any age in between.
We worked with Bonnie Ellis, the Science Curriculum Coordinator of Williamsburg James City County Public Schools to ensure that our booklet is usable and convenient for teachers.
Who we shared our booklet with:
We have already shared our booklet with teachers all over the state, the country, and the world! Here in Williamsburg, we attended the Williamsburg James City County Teacher Training days to present our booklet to all the science teachers in the county. In addition, we have given our booklet to teachers all over the state. We now have teachers in five states who plan on running our booklet. We also provided our booklet upon request to teachers in China and, through the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program, Malaysia.
We are still working on responding to all the requests for our booklet! Currently, we are working on providing the Virginia state learning standards that each activity fulfills so that local teachers can seamlessly integrate our activities into their year-long schedules. We are also providing local teachers with kits that include materials for our activities up until the date of the 2015 iGEM Jamboree.
Our educational synthetic biology activities booklet is available online for anyone to use for free. This includes future iGEM teams looking to hold Synthetic Biology workshops and camps, as well as educators worldwide. Additionally, teachers in the Williamsburg area can request in-class assistance or tutoring for the booklet from volunteers of College Partnership for Kids. CPK is a group of William & Mary students who tutor at local schools. CPK volunteers will receive special training in order to use the activities in our Synthetic Biology booklet.
Knowledge of Synthetic Biology: The information we provided and taught to students and adults in our workshops will inspire them to look into Synthetic Biology and see scientific research as a more tangible career option. We have already received emails from parents whose kids couldn't stop talking about our workshops, and we feel certain that this enthusiasm for Synthetic Biology will carry them into the future.

Gas Vesicle Structure: A physical analysis
Our Systems
In our lab, we have access to purified gas vesicles from Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 and an agar slant of Anabaena flos-aquae. Our models will use typical values of physical parameters available in literature for gas vesicles from these species.
Gas vesicle proteins
GvpA
GvpA is a short (72 aa, 8 kDa) protein that polymerizes to form the main ""ribbed"" structure of the gas vesicle. The abundance of hydrophobic beta chains (45 residues) in GvpA makes the protein extremely averse to water; indeed, this hydrophobicity prevents water molecules from entering the interior of the gas vesicle during its formation, allowing it to fill with gas instead. Note that two lysine residues in the smaller α-helix are solvent-accessible.
3D structure of GvpA (Adapted from [2])
Stacking of GvpA monomers
Strunk et al.[2] proposed a plausible stacking pattern for the GvpA monomers that leads to the formation of the whole vesicle. According to their analysis, the best stacking pattern was obtained by the mutual docking of two molecules of the monomer followed by the stacking of these in three dimensions to form the vesicle (See figure).
Stacking of GvpA monomers to form the docked dimer (Adapted from [2])
GvpC
GvpC is the second-most abundant protein found in gas vesicles but it is still far rarer than GvpA (1:25 molar ratio[3]) and does not contribute to the structure but rather to the integrity of the gas vesicle! Gas vesicles stripped of GvpC have a drastically-lower critical pressure than wild-type gas vesicles and are much more sensitive to mechanical collapse.
Effective buoyant density
The average buoyant density of a gas vesicle is reported to be around 120 kgm-3. While this density is much lower than"

But if we want to have fruitful links with other partners, we have to put in place an efficient and understandable communication system for both parts. And the BSS was mainly designed for this.
Other teams opinion about BSS
As we wanted the BSS structure to be clear and concise, we early contacted as many iGEM teams as possible. For this purpose we used the NTNU Trondheim matchmaker by posting a request. We have also sent an e-mail to all the European teams. You can find below the list of the teams that gave answers.
We have already had answers about the BSS from Virginia, Edinburgh, Groningen and Paris iGEM Teams
We gratefully thank these teams. According to Edinburgh, what appears for them and probably also for other teams is that the Registry of Standard Biological Parts gives already much information that the BSS also stored. Thus it could be considered as another way to store biological information. What was blamed is that there is no link between what already exists and this new sheet. Moreover it was said that this BioBrick Safety Sheet could be seen as a competitor to the preexisting Registry, even it is not the purpose.
A project linked with other iGEM Teams: collaboration
As far as the two last teams are concerned, we made a videoconferencing with iGEM Paris Bettencourt team. Thanks to the partnership with them, we had more information about the point of view of another iGEM Team. Moreover we discovered that our idea is complementary to their work.  While they are trying to design tools to improve the safety and work on a way to quantify the biological risk, we are dealing with the information required to assess the risk. Our project is the base of the risk analysis. The structuring of the information would be great for their project because by designing tools, it is also important to know if they would be relevant. Thus our project is in accordance with what is currently done. Their feedbacks finally lead to a whole collaboration with Paris Bettencourt. Indeed, once the first skype session organized, we kept contact and could give them feedbacks about their own project. We also had the opportunity to move to Paris on Sunday the 16th and participate to the debate they organized about a possible regulation of GMOs use. You can find here more details about the event. But they advised us the same thing as the Edinburgh team, that is to say that we should put a link with what already exists. Because of these feedbacks"

Project Description
Project Abstract
Managing cultures is a vital task in synthetic biology, but constantly measuring and adjusting culture conditions is both tedious and labor intensive. Our project aims to reduce the amount of time and effort needed to maintain cultures through the creation of an affordable image analysis system that autonomously reads visual data to measure the current state of a culture and then determines whether to release inducer chemicals based on user input. Our project utilizes the violacein pathway to simulate other metabolic pathways with colored signals. By regulating gene expression in this gene set with two different inducible promoters, we are able to yield up to four different color outputs. These outputs are then measured by an open-sourced Raspberry Pi setup, which captures visual data via camera, measures the culture’s RGB value, and then directs the gradual release of inducer chemicals to maintain or change the culture’s color over time.
Motivations
Adaptive and active manipulation of bacteria is important for maintaining homeostasis of cultures. Biotechnology companies use bacteria to produce important drugs, industrial chemicals, and other products; a prime example of this is the antimalarial drug artemisinin. Chemicals like these are produced through a series of enzymatic reactions within the cell, and are becoming more widespread as synthetic biology is applied to problems in a wide range of areas.
From previous projects, it is clear that detecting the level of metabolites in different cultures, including yeast cultures, is inconvenient. Traditional methods of analysing chemical compounds are expensive and labour intensive. For example, an HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) instrument can be tens of thousands of dollars to buy, and runs from ranges from 35.00–90.00 dollars per hour to use. For labs and industries that require this service to be run frequently, this is a significant financial burden.
In order to achieve the highest rate of production of the desired metabolites, steps along the pathway should be monitored in order to"
ZJU-China,2015,Team:ZJU-China#Practices#Cooperate#Senergene#third_-_-_TEXT.html," The plan is based on the project of iGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015. ZJU iGEMers coated adapted soil bacterium Streptomyces, which secreted Abamectin to kill termites. In order to attract termites and to deliver Abamectin successfully only into intestine, they assembled cellulose nanocrystals as capsule shells. What is terrific is that termites love cellulose and workers will regard the cellulose as food and bring them to the queen and larvae in a non-defensive way. In this way, we could root out the whole nest gradually.
P: The plan sounds good perhaps, but I cannot let my people risk.
M: All right, I’ll show you a round our secret base：TERMITES’ TERMINATOR LAB.
Section 2:
The president follows into the lab.
M: The core technology of our factory could be dated to 2015. Five years later, in 2020 iGEMers successfully expressed the Avemectin in B. subtils, with modern gene editing and synthesis technology. This new breakthrough is essential to its future industrialization. After years of tests and verifications, TERMITES’ TERMINATOR shows its tremendous potential to control the termite and its eco-friendliness in the lab and semi-wild situation. In the summer of 2027, to achieve the factorization, we designed the equipment, installed and modified a series of new automated assembly lines to implement the mass production and cut down the cost for wider-spread use. Finally in 2029, we successfully applied the patent for the technology. During the following four years, making full use of the economic benefit, we made numerous experiments both in factory and field. Thus the team acquired first-handed data to modify the product and achieved technical improvement and innovation. And now, the core technology has been totally open to benefit our society.
These days, we have a large range of products killing locus, flies, mosquitoes, etc. Based on the invention, we enable the openness of synthetic biology. 2035, give synthetic biology a chance to save the world!
P: I promise that people will remember you brilliant guys for ages! But I’m considering that large dose use might ravage the ecosystem.
M: The Abamectin is a safe anti-insect product, so it does little harm to people and nature. Furthermore, the cellulose shell prevents Abamectin from directly releasing to environment. Double insurance guarantees that the product is eco-friendly. Even more, a standard gene transfer prevention mechanism was utilized."

Safety
Overview
This summer, TUST_China is trying to create a better biomaterial ( bacterial cellulose ) to use for medical purpose（wound accessories），under the framework of synthetic biology.Therefore, the safety of our project is vital and it's our duty to explain clearly about any potential problems concerning safety.This requires us to pay more attention of safety issues.
In the Lab
First of all,every team members received safety training before being permitted to start working in the lab（The appropriate personal protective equipment was used which included lab coats gloves and where necessary safety spectacles）.  In addition to that we never performed any dangerous experiments in daily bench work or faced any unusual safety issues.
The bench work follows some basic regulations below:
Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission was strictly prohibited.
All involved participants needed to understand the experiment completely before commencing work.
All experimenters had to wear rubber gloves.
Any steps involving potential release of living microorganisms were performed in a bio-safety cabinet.
Appliances such as Bunsen burners, electric heaters and microwave ovens would not be left unattended when they are on.
All liquid and solid waste potentially containing living organism would be sterilized.
The entire lab was sterilized under UV-light every week.
The last person leaving the lab should always make sure to shut down water, electricity, gas, and the air conditioner and to lock doors and windows before leaving.
Public and Environment
G.xylinus：
The Gluconacetobacter strains used are not thought to pose any risks to the safety and health of the general public. Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be uncompetitive compared to wild bacteria in the outside environment.
E. coli：
For the acid and alkali producing genes, we have built suicide gene to avoid potential harm to the environment. The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells will only produce bacterial cellulose inside the lab.They would not be able to compete outside the lab.

Detection of corresponding fluorescence signals with the more sensitive laser scanning microscope could not be reproduced.
7.3 Checking the expression of the GFP tagged Has2 protein by SDS-Page and Western Blot analysis
Recombinant protein expression of Has2 and UDP-GlcDH in B. megaterium cultures could not be proven by SDS-PAGE and following Coomassie Blue staining. At least the expression of the GFP tagged Has2 protein in B. megaterium cultures could be analysed by Western Blot with an appropriate GFP antibody. Soluble protein fraction of cell lysates didn`t show GFP tagged Has2 protein expression. Insoluble protein fraction of cell lysates including integral membrane proteins showed several unspecific protein bands but also a distinct protein band with a molecular weight of 90 kDa that likely derived from binding of the antibody to the GFP tagged Has2 protein. Cell lysates of non-induced B. megaterium culture served as a negative control and didn´t show GFP tagged Has2 protein expression neither in the soluble protein fraction nor in the insoluble fraction including integral membrane proteins.

For cloning of the genes that may optimise the hyaluronic acid production not only the corresponding PCR products, but also the BioBrick plasmid pSB1C3 was restricted with the respective restriction enzymes (table 1). Next step was the ligation of the restricted pSB1C3 plasmid (2070 bp) with each amplified and digested gene. Controls of ligation reactions are not shown. After transformation of the ligation products into competent E. coli cells and selection on ampicillin agar plates, the plasmid DNA of resulting transformants was checked by control digestion. Figure 12 shows the result for one representative E. coli transformant of each ligation.

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#pttest_-_-_TEXT.html,"14 interviews conducted George drew these particular conclusions from his conversations with Hornsey’s patients:
That comfort levels with catheterisation are reliant on previous experience with catheterisation.
That antibiotic use often has side effects that significantly decrease the quality of life of patients often through nausea but also induced faecal incontinence.
Most patients are comfortable with the idea of GM solutions to infection given the backing of the practitioners in the clinic.
Delivery
“Is there a material for the catheter or its coating that is suitably permeable to this mystery molecule(s) yet entirely able to contain the source of microbes without any leaks?”
Professor Jef D. Boeke
Director, Institute for Systems Genetics
NYU Langone Medical Center
Asked by others and by ourselves, our thoughts on how to practically implement Solution has shaped the project and forced us to tackle the problem from many angles. We needed a method by which we could expose the catheter, and bladder, to our anti-microbial proteins, and in a safe manner. Safety was a key consideration when designing delivery methods. We looked at a range of different approaches, including a variety of different catheter coatings, a semi-permeable membrane inside the catheter and encasing our bacteria within sodium alginate beads. For more information, check out our safety and design pages.
Commensal Bacteria
We thought further about the discussions we had had at Hornsey UTI clinic and were inspired by what Prof. Malone-Lee said to us:
“Biofilms have a profound effect on antibiotic resistance … bacteria that can penetrate through biofilms strikes me as a very sensible project direction.”
At the clinic they talked to us out using competing species of bacteria to replace the common uropathogens.
“Patients keep taking probiotics while being treated with antibiotics in our unit and they don't seem to mind ingesting 20-40 billion acidophilus bacteria without a second thought.”
Dr. Sheela Swamy
With these conversations in mind, we went back to the drawing board. Our data showed us that we needed a high local concentration of anti-biofilm and antimicrobial agents to be able to break down a biofilm. We thought about how we could create these high local concentrations and came up with a new solution: to introduce free living bacteria into the urinary tract. Whilst we are aware that current GMO regulations would not permit this, we have explored the possibility of it becoming an option in the future.
Many people perceive the use of GMOs to be unethical and this has far-reaching impacts on society, such as the enaction of anti-GMO legislation. To explore these ethical"

3. The third thing we want to focus on is developing a society with qualified scientific workforce in synthetic biology. We are eager to encourage students to turn to life sciences and especially to synthetic biology. We need to ensure that next generation of scientists are well equipped with wide range of opportunities so more people would be encouraged to seek career related to synthetic biology. To achieve this goal, we not only have to fulfill the first part of our vision - to raise interest of synthetic biology in the society - but also to show specific ways in pursuing such a career. We believe that the collaborative spirit between academia and industry could help us. That said, in addition to previous actions we are planning to:
Establish a stakeholder map for students who are interested in synthetic biology but are not familiar with career options in the field.
Establish a mentoring programme for students in life sciences, wherein the academia and industry professionals would share their experience and guide students as well as their future.
The first steps
Soon after the establishment of the new strategy and goals, we have started to accomplish our short-term goals which include educating general public on synthetic biology topics. First, we have discussed the field of synthetic biology on the national radio. We talked about what the synthetic biology is, what can it bring and what are the biological and ethical concerns that people should discuss and be aware of.
Together with Microbiology Society we have hosted the first International Microorganism Day (IMD) in Lithuania. We shed some light on how we work with bacteria in the laboratory and how synthetic biology comes in the picture. Participants of the event had a chance to engage in the practical activities and lectures on how we can use microorganisms to get new biological parts and use those parts to create new complex systems. This first international Microorganism Day event in Lithuania was a lot different than the events happening all over the world as it contained a separate Synthetic Biology section.
However, educating the general public is not enough. We believe that synthetic biology introduction to Life and physical science students is an even more important thing to do, in order to spark their interest in biological engineering.
To achieve that we have established an ongoing cycle of lectures on various synthetic biology topics. The goal of this cycle was to familiarize students with the engineering concepts and how to apply them for biological design. Students have a chance to get to know successful examples of biological design and how to integrate fundamental knowledge in various areas into designing a biological system. We have already held the first 2 lectures in which many Life and Physical science have actively participated.
During the first lecture we have"

As this was something new to us, we again consulted literature to help guide our teaching style. It was decided that to maximize the students learning experience, we would utilize an instructional scaffolding model. In this model, responsibility is slowly transferred to the student with time and they are allowed to explore and investigate within the confines of a structured plan.
In order to achieve this, we began by dividing the students into smaller groups and set them the task of looking at examples of ethical issues linked to genetic engineering. Each team was instructed to put together an argument either FOR or AGAINST the topic in question, and they were given some time to rehearse their debating strategy. It took a little while for the groups to warm up, but once they did the students made some really interesting and thought-provoking points.
Their next task was to build their own biomechanical arm. This part of the day was run by Zahid and Shafi, our Systems Engineers. They spoke to the students about how engineering plays a vital role in the field of synthetic biology, and how it doesn’t just involve traditional lab- based work. Afterwards, Callum Thornton, a recently-graduated engineer from Warwick University gave a fascinating talk on robotics and the role that they play in biomedical engineering. When we caught up with him afterwards, he said “It was good to see so many students interested in the work that I am involved in. Biomedical Engineering has so many applications and it isn’t as well-known as other engineering disciplines. It applies engineering principles and technology to medical and biological problems and has really developed as a subject over the past five years.”
After Callum’s session, we paused to discuss how his robotic arm worked and how their own biomechanical arms could be improved upon if the same workshop were to be repeated. Once several ideas of potential improvements had been discussed, the students were then set specific challenges, requiring them to adapt what they had already learnt to further improve their design. As the day progressed, the students were allowed progressively more control over the projects they were performing, all whilst still under the guidance and supervision of the iGEM team.
In the afternoon, Elsa, Jack and Amy gave the students a taste of what microbiology lab work is like. The students eagerly grabbed their lab coats and we gave them a brief lab induction, including the basics of good aseptic techniques, which have discovered are absolutely critical over the summer! We were obviously limited in what the students could physically do, and so we prepared 9 different Gram-stained samples, including Pseudomonas stutzeri and Serrat"
BostonU,2012,Team:BostonU#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," 
Made glycerol stocks of 1AT3, 1A3, 1C3, 1K3 both for -20 and -80 celsius
We prepared plate media of Kan, Amp and CAM

Week 4
We designed primers and gene synthesis template.
We worked on Safety Answers for our Wiki.
We attended an Eugene Tutorial given by Ernst, the Pos-Doc responsible for Eugene in CIDAR Lab.
We worked on Human Practices project.
We met the Wellesley and MIT iGEM teams for a Physics lecture in MIT given by Walter Levine, had lunch together and visited the MIT iGEM team lab :)

Week 1 - Happy July 4th!
We transformed plasmids containing the genes, promoters and terminator to be used as templates for the primers that we had designed. The plasmids come from the iGEM kit plates.
we used bioline cells but didn’t follow the protocols because the cells were more competent so didn’t need to go through heat shock.
cells sat on bench over the weekend. Colonies will be picked next week!
We also autoclaved Broth, Media and DI water to have enough plates for our next round of transformations.
We used to Clotho to input the primers that we had designed into a database.
in doing so, we learned how to use Spreadit Features, Spreadit Oligos, Registry Importer, Collection Viewer and Sequence Viewer.
We are still waiting for our primers to continue wet lab work.

Week 2
We transformed the following parts from the iGEM plates into bioline cells : E1010, C0051, C0040, B0015, I13458, E0030, E0040, C0012, C0071, R0010, R0063, R0079, I13453, C0079, C0080, R0040, R0051, R0062, R0071, C0062.  Cultures from transformation were made and then a miniprep was performed on all of them. We ran a gel to confirm the plasmid presence and performed nanodrop to measure DNA concentration. After that, glycerol stocks were made for all of them.
 
 
We created working and stock solutions for the new primers that arrived to use at PCR. We performed PCR using the transformed parts as templates and the primers we designed in order to add moclo fusion sites to them. The PCR conditions were set according to the table below.
