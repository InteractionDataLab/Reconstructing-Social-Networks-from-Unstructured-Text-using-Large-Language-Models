Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," in the loss of binding capacity of the aminoglycoside to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, which would lead to inhibition of protein synthesis without the presence of the APH ( Begg EJ and Barclay ML, 1995 ).
As indicated by the first results, the reporter genes under control of the virB promoter showed a slight but measureable expression without any induction of VirA with acetosyringone. This basal transcription resulted in the growth of bacteria without induction of VirA at normal working concentrations of kanamycin of 25 to 50 µg mL-1 ( Sambrook J and Russell DW, 2001 ).
Concludingly, prior to the screening experiments it was necessary to adjust the concentration of kanamycin, which inhibits the growth of uninduced bacteria, while allowing bacteria to grow when an appropriate inductor was present and able to activate VirA. This analysis was performed using the method of determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) as described below.
Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of kanamycin
There are several ways to investigate the susceptibility of bacteria to inhibiting drugs like antibiotics. Nevertheless, the result of all these tests is the amount of an assayed substance that inhibits visible growth of the bacteria, called the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The most common way of determination is to grow bacteria in liquids with several concentrations of the inhibiting drug. This procedure is chosen mostly, since many different conditions can be measured at the same time by using microtiterplates ( Wiegand I et al., 2008 ).
As we planned not to use the kanamycin in liquid culture but in LB-Agar, we chose to determine the MIC at the same conditions as the desired experiment. Therefore, we planned to construct E. coli inhabiting the native VirA/G signaling system and a kanamycin resistance read out and plated a small volume in different dilutions on LB-Agar without kanamycin. The grown colonies could then be transferred to agar plates with rising concentrations of kanamycin using replica plating. By counting the colonies it should be possible to calculate the percentage of colonies that could withstand each kanamycin concentration. This experiment should be carried out with and without acetosyringone to determine a kanamycin concentration induced E. coli could withstand, while the same population of bacteria dies without the presence of acetosyringone.
Primary selection of virA variants with novel binding properties
After the determination of the MIC the screening for virA variants with new binding properties could be"

    ②We voted on the wiki design.
Through the discussion in this meeting, we asked the modeling group to model the reaction of carbon dioxide airflow with saturated carbonic anhydrase solution after the investigation is made clear. The work of each group will set the Deadline mechanism and strictly stipulate the completion time.
Conclusion: Our IGEM team of Anhui University of Technology discussed and solved various problems in the progress of our project through conferences.And our final project has been improved;the members have more and more trust in each other.The conference is still going on, and our story is still going on.I believe that  IGEM team will be able to achieve success in this year's competition!
    5.  Meeting of four schools
September 9, 2018, We arranged a video conference with members from northeastern university, Shandong University and northwestern University. During this time, we briefly introduced our project background and project ideas and planned the agenda of the meeting. As the greenhouse effect has become a common concern in recent years, how to effectively capture carbon dioxide has become a worldwide problem. At present, carbon dioxide capture mainly includes absorption, adsorption and membrane method,which are renewable energy consumption of high cost and have twice as many pollution problems. The use of CO2 to capture the high catalytic efficiency and environmental friendliness of the carbon anhydride has aroused wide concern.
Fig.8 Meeting with three other universities
So our Anhui University of Technology team put forward a project on the generation of carbon anhydride through E. coli to absorb carbon dioxide. First of all, our project successfully expressed the Wide-type carbonic anhydride enzyme in Escherichia coli, however, due to its poor stability and ease of deactivation, its industrial applications were limited. Therefore, based on the molecular simulation technique, the effect of mutation of amino acid residues on the conformation and activity of enzymes was studied, and the mutant carbonic anhydride with high thermal stability was obtained. The experimental results show that the purified mutant carbonic anhydride has higher stability and activity than the wild type of carbonic anhydride enzyme, which realizes the effective capture of CO2. Northeastern university, Shandong university, and the members of Northwestern University have expressed their strong interest in the project of Anhui University of technology, so we have the highlights of our project and other members of the school exchange. Highlights: 1, Instead of the high cost, high efficiency and poor circulation of traditional methods"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," complex formation brings vesicle membrane and cell membrane into close proximity, which leads to merging of both membranes. In neuronal cells, synaptic vesicles store neurotransmitters that are released upon stimulation of the cell. This exocytosis process is, among other things, is regulated by Syntaxin1a. Syntaxin-1A is a known substrate of botulinum neurotoxin C, a protein with metalloprotease activity which prevents the exocytosis of neurotransmitters into the neuromuscular junction. Consequently, this leads to flaccid paralysis symptoms of the illness botulism.
SNAP25
BBa_K2689002
Synaptosomal-associated Protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a t-SNARE protein involved in the regulation of membrane and vesical fusion. It is integrated into the membrane via palmityl side chains and faces the cytosolic side. Together with Syntaxin-1A and Synaptobrevin-2, it forms the SNARE complex, in which it contributes 2 a-helices. This complex brings together vesicle membrane and cell membrane, which leads to the fusion of both. In neuronal cells, this leads to the exocytosis of neurotransmitters into the interneuronal junction. SNAP-25 is a known substrate of botulinum neurotoxin A, C and E, a protein with metalloprotease activity which prevents the exocytosis of neurotransmitters into the neuromuscular junction. Consequently, this leads to flaccid paralysis symptoms of the illness botulism.
Omomyc
BBa_K2689003
Omomyc is a dominant-negative mutant of Myc, a family of proto-oncogenes encoding for transcription factors which regulate growth, proliferation, tumorgenesis, and apoptosis. Myc dimerizes with Max over its basic helix-loop-helix zipper domain. This heterodimer then binds to the DNA enhancer box (E-Box) sequence and thus regulates the expression of corresponding genes. In cancer Myc often is constitutively expressed, leading to increased proliferation signals and thus to excessive tumor growth. Omomyc possesses a mutated basic helix-loop-helix zipper domain, in which 4 amino acids were exchanged: S57T, E64I, R70Q and R71N. These mutations lead to an altered dimerization behavior of the protein. Omomyc efficiently forms homodimers and furthermore also forms heterodimers with wild-type Myc, leading to a decreased formation of Myc/Max dimers. Accordingly,"

Global Perspectives Outreach Overview
Many iGEM teams seek to contextualize their work by getting input from professionals who have been working in the field for years or even decades. However, once teams gather this information, they put it in their Jamboree presentation and on their wiki, but after that, the information sits unused. The goal of this effort was to collect information about the future of the biomanufacturing industry and research from major stakeholders in science and beyond. To do this, we recruited other iGEM teams from around the world in order to establish a common set of questions to ask people from several fields that are essential to the proliferation of biomanufacturing (e.g. academia, business, public policy,), and recorded the answers we got from experts around the world. We wanted to understand how people in different parts of the world feel about the promise, feasibility, and drawbacks of biomanufacturing, so the we needed to have as many teams from as many places as possible participate in this effort. The questions we compiled were general enough that any biomanufacturing-related project could make use of them. We hope that future teams will continue and expand this effort, building off of the questions and answers we have assembled here. Eventually, we would like to see a massive effort to standardize the way iGEM teams get input from expert sources, almost like a survey version of the Interlab Study!
Thank you to all the iGEM teams who participated in our global effort!

Findings
This survey was a first attempt at starting something that will hopefully grow and become more rigorous over time. The results that we collecter are not “statistically significant” and we cannot make any sweeping generalizations about the future of the field based on this survey, but there were a few prevalent trends among the answers that we received to the survey. In general, the respondents felt that the major barriers to progress for biomanufacturing are cost and efficiency. Furthermore, there is a generally positive outlook on the future of biomanufacturing. 80% of survey members who identified themselves as academics felt that biomanufacturing will eventually outperform traditional"

The Furthest Distance in Biology
These days, it is the confusing and turbulent media such as TV and Internet news, rather than the scientific details that researches are working on, that put sands in the wheels of the general crowds’ understanding of biological concepts. Although the development of the scientific studies in increasing at a tremendous speed and the investment into these researches have reached astronomical figures, the public (someone like your parents and friends) remain in a state where they don’t understand or don’t have any reliable methods to know more about biological concepts that are related to their own life. What’s worse, things can get increasingly harsh when you realize that the gaps between you and your friends or your families are something as simple as what they eat, how they live and they drugs they take. This year our team have put huge efforts into this problem and tried to reveal, investigate and analyze the distance with extensions through which we appeal efforts from the scientific field, the government and the public to work together and minimize the gap. We paid our attention to the C ognitive gap of syn-bio C oncepts in C hina named as CCC project.
CCC Project
Huh
Our team have found out this cognition gap that existed for so long in China. Through the daily discussions we have with our parents, friends and even peers from the same university, we have realized how serious this problem is.

On realizing the problem, we decided that we literally had no handful tools to help us on these concerns. After"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Stirling University, at the VvBN (Dutch Society for Movement Science) conference in Utrecht on May 17. We stayed in touch and received great input from him on social aspects of doping as athlete privacy, behavior, regulation and education. This resulted in mutual interest in each other’s research activities upon which we were invited to give a seminar on our project for experts in the field of doping and genetics at the University of Stirling on August 30th 2018. After this seminar we organized a discussion on how gene doping is different from currently more conventional types of doping and on how to best react to these differences, through regulation and/or education. In the drop-down below the case studies we prepared for the discussion can be found.
Very interesting presentation. Really impressed about the openness of @TUDelft_iGEM in presenting a model for testing #genedoping . Definitely a turning point to something new on this topic... @wada_ama
— Nicola Busca (@Bogpolis) August 31, 2018
Figure 4. Twitter comments on our seminar and expert discussion in Stirling, showing the impact and some new questions that arose.
Case 1: Intergenerational Responsibility
Many vectors could be used for transfecting people with gene doping. Some of them might be able to (accidentally) infect peoples’ germ line cells, thereby affecting their offspring. And there is the concept of designer babies where parents can decide on their children’s characteristics? In some countries this is more under debate than in others.
Questions:
With whom resides the responsibility if this child becomes an athlete and how could we solve this problem?
During illegal doping, vectors might also be released into the environment, affecting other organisms. How big would this problem be and how could we map and control it?
How can we learn from other examples of intergenerational responsibility?
How can we control gene doping throughout society in a world where bioethical views differ over cultures?
Case 2: Where do we take it?
Suppose, at some point gene doping detection works about as well as the detection of the doping methods that are more conventional now. Gene therapy however, has come to be extremely safe. The border between medical and performance enhancing treatments is fading away and it has become extremely cheap and accessible to everyone.
Questions:
Do we still want to combat gene doping in this case?
The objective of sports as was set out by Ancient Greek tradition was the creation of the perfect human. With a case like this, are we bypassing this objective or enabling it?
Would human characteristics converge or rather diverge"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," development of fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

(Modular and Plastic Looping E.coli) with a range of appliances that transform domestic rubbish into new 3D printed bioplastic objects. In picturing this we were influenced by the 'DIY biology' culture, the 'maker' culture and the homebrew industry . We were intrigued by the prospect of coupling local bioplastic recycling with 3D printing and how people could start to see their waste as something valuable, something which could become beautiful and useful. You can find out more here about MAPLE's different incarnations.
Communicating our Project
We have communicated our project at several events and across social media. As apart of our outreach, we have founded an art movement BioNouveau . Once we had produced a palette of different colours from various bacterial pigments, we set about recreating painting masterpieces using the humble media of E.coli on agar petri dishes. People loved these and it brought many visitors to our pages. They became so popular that people started putting in requests, with Calgary iGEM team giving us the inspiration for our bacterial 'The Jack Pine'. We were delighted to have are BioNouveau artwork featured in ATOMS Turkiye's SynArt show at the European Jamboree.
The Celebration of Science was a week's long spread of science events covering all sorts of topics. We presented our project as part of a series of lectures. Our talk was very well received as something of a contrast to the classical study of biology which had preceded us. The people we spoke to afterwards were particularly interested in the difficulties of engineering biology and also the capabilities of the technology.
We also featured on Dr. Adam Rutherford's Inside Science show on BBC Radio 4. We were delighted to have Adam visit us at Imperial College and it was great to talk to him about our project.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html," primers I performed a gradient PCR in a Taq polymerase catalyzed reaction. This time I got the expected PCR product independently of the annealing temperature; and I isolated bands from gel. This was possible due to improved primer design, and by switching from Pfu to Taq polymerase. Finally, after innumerable problems with the template, dNTPs, enzymes, primers… I got the pUC18R6KT vector.
Amplifying resistance cassettes. I tried to amplify the kanamicin and chloramphenicol resistance cassettes in a Pfu-polymerase catalyzed PCR reaction without positive results. Again, I obtained the expected results when I switched to Taq polymerase. I isolated and purified these PCR products from an agarose gel.
Preparing BioBricks to insert them into mini-Tn7. I digested the desired BioBricks with EcoRI and PstI trying to use the highest amount of DNA possible, but the mini-preps were not concentrated enough and I could only isolate from gel a couple of BioBricks properly digested. I used the traditional alkaline lysis-ethanol precipitation plasmid DNA purification method instead of using a commercial column kit and this time I obtained really high concentration mini-preps, although they were probably less clean. I repeated the digestions with the new samples, but gel electrophoresis revealed that, even though the DNA concentration was good, a large amount of RNA was also present. I isolated and purified the BioBrick fragments that there were not masked by the RNA smear at the bottom part of the lanes.
Synthetizing a portable attTn7. I purified genomic DNA from the MC4100 E. coli strain to use it as a template to amplify attTn7, the insertion site of Tn7 transposons. The PCR reaction resulted in a PCR product of the expected size, which was isolated and purified from an agarose gel. Because the primers added the standard prefix and suffix, the attTn7 could be digested with EcoRI and PstI. This fragment was ligated with EcoRI- and PstI-digested pSB1C3 and pSB4K5, and transformed into DH5α competent cells.

Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#log_-_-_TEXT.html," wire stuff, human practices strategies were discussed (the festivals are coming up...), and we received word that the deadline for submission of movies to the film festival has been extended, so we can redo ours if need be. In the lab, we made some more cells competent, and ran yesterday’s minipreps on a gel, with mixed results.
Wednesday 2nd July
Today we had a meeting with some artists who are keen to be involved with the project. After a pizza and beer fuelled discussion, we met with Fraiser, who is keen to produce a piece of art that would tie in with our project. The idea of an actual exhibit event sounds fantastic, and everyone seemed enthusiastic. This sounds promising!
Otherwise things continued in a similar vein as previous days – transformations were carried out and paperclip primers were designed.
Thursday 3rd July
A new aspect of the project entered the lab stage today, as Mg1665 cells were made competent ready for the actual metabolic wire mining to begin – very exciting times.
Friday 4th July
The population control system moved closer to reality today, with the discovery of the Rcd short RNA mediated division checkpoint, which looks like it can induce exactly the kind of quiescence we want. A minor setback appeared in that it’s pretty heavily patented, but a very recently discovered possible mechanism of action for it involving DNA gyrase is not (yet) patented and so might provide a potential avenue. Still looks like very hard work however.
Some genomic extraction was done in the lab today also, ready for gene harvesting – soon our metabolic wires will be forged from the resultant gloop.
Weekend 5th-6th
A sunny weekend this time, which Anna nonetheless spent reading up on degron testing and part characterisation entries. What a hero.
Week 7 (7th June – 13th July)
Monday 7th
Another new week, another week closer to the end. Today was spent largely on paperclip primer design, circuit diagram creation for population control, and degron characterisation.
Tuesday 8th
We started to try and get some Human Practices balls rolling today, with the ‘Big List’ of ideas transformed into a rudimentary action plan, and more research into previous projects’ endeavours.
Meanwhile various lab tasks were got on with – the sugar logic components were miniprep’d out, primers were designed for the aromatic wires, and some sequencing was ordered.
Wednesday 9th
We finally got some plasmids designed for the population control circuits – all being well we will inactivate certain host genes"

Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Modelling Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," where mRNA equilibrium occurs. bamA mRNA degredation rate is considerably faster than BamA degredation rate - with mRNA halflife of the order of minutes and protein halflife the order of hours - hence the greater FAST index.
Conclusion
Whilst the addition of bamA mRNA does increase the rate of protein expression this effect is proportional to the mass of initial DNA. Initial mass of BamA DNA determines at how high an expression level the equilibrium for BamA expression is reached. In order for addition of mRNA to give the most benefits it should be used where the mass of expressed protein does not need to be particularly high but where the protein needs to quickly present. Due to the shorter size of proteins lgA and OmpA compared to BamA it is not necessary to have maximal expression of these proteins to attain them in an equivalent quantity to BamA. In cases where maximal expression level of BamA is desired (by using 1000 nanograms DNA) the addition of mRNA in the quantities supported by the PURE system produces little change to BamA expression and hence may not be justified given the extra wet lab work incurred.

JMU_Wuerzburg,2018,Team:JMU Wuerzburg#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," with OligoArchitectTM 3 .                  Afterwards, we calculated the secondary structure of the primers and the probe with RNAstructure 4 .                  Therefore we used the following parameters:
Temperature [K]: 310.15
Maximum Loop Size: 30
Maximum % Energy Difference (MFE, MEA): 10
Maximum Number of Structures (MFE, MEA): 20
Window Size (MFE, MEA): 3
Gamma (MEA): 1
Iterations (Pseudoknot Prediction): 1
Minimum Helix Length (Pseudoknot Prediction): 3
If the calculated secondary structure is moderate or low, we started testing the primers and the probe in the wet lab.
Our primer/probe pair for P. falciparum was designed as written below.                 We created five alignments with ClustalO 1 .                  One alignment is for P. falciparum with 1012                  mitochondrial sequences of P. falciparum from NCBI                  and four alignments are for P. malariae, P. knowlesi,                      P. ovale and P. vivax 5 .                  These four alignments were calculated with mitochondrial nucleotide                  sequences from NCBI of each Plasmodium species 5 .                  The alignments were calculated with ClustalO with the following bash command:
nohup clustalo --outfmt=msf -o outputname.msf -i inputname.fasta & > nohup.log
We used the resulting consensus sequences and aligned these                  five sequences with ClustalO.                  Subsequently, we searched in the resulting MSF                  file after differences between the consensus sequence of P. falciparum and the other four consensus sequences.                  Afterwards, we created a frequency matrix as described                  in the part for Plasmodium in general and checked if our regions                 of interest are highly conserved as described in the part of Plasmodium in general.                  The primer and probe design were also carried out as described                  in the upper part for Plasmodium.
Furthermore, we aligned over 40 000 nucleotide sequences from                  NCBI 5 , DDBJ 6 and Embl 7 of Norovirus with ClustalO.                  We searched in the resulting alignment for highly conserved                  regions, as described in the part for Plasmodium in general                  and designed a primer/probe pair for Norovirus.

Transforming HBsu-(x)fp BioBrick
The synthesised construct arrived fully cloned into the pMutin4 plasmid from DNA2.0 and we rehydrated the DNA by adding 10ul of elution buffer. We transformed the plasmid into competent E.coli DH5-alpha and plated it out on LB + Amp plate.
BioGame
Work recommenced on the BioGame with the beginning of the User Interface creation for the main game screen. This began by simply designing some basic sprite sheets for the button states, and then moved on to creating the button class. The button class started off by extending my own Sprite class, choosing to not use LibGDX's built in sprite or button class. I feel this would give me more control over the functionality of the objects, also as some of the documentation on the built in button class is a little light, it means I know exactly what it is doing.

Validating stress in mammalian and bacterial cells with iGEM UC Davis
We contacted iGEM team UC Davis via twitter after we found out that our projects were both involving similar ideas. While our project focuses on finding           bacterial cell           stress, iGEM UC Davis is focusing on detecting mammalian cell stress.           To discuss our approaches, problems within the lab, human practices and other aspects of our projects we set up several skype meetings and maintained extensive email contact. While keeping in touch during the summer, we eventually agreed           on a collaboration:           Leiden would test the toxicity of H2O2 on bacterial cells and UC Davis would test the toxicity of nalidixic acid on mammalian cells. To ensure our exchanged results would be beneficial for each other, we discussed the           exact protocols           beforehand and fine tuned them to each others wishes.
We first proved the potential of our system using a pSoxS-GFP construct, containing a promoter of the E. coli DNA-damage pathway, and nalidixic acid, a known DNA damaging antibiotic. Therefore, we requested UC Davis to test multiple           concentrations of nalidixic acid on their mammalian cell lines. With these experiments it would be possible to determine whether this antibiotic only stresses the bacterial cells, or also the mammalian cells. In the future this could be a           very important follow up test of the screening method developed by us. This way, potential antibiotic candidates can quickly be tested to ensure they do not stress mammalian cells.
The results of UC Davis’ experiment are shown in figure 2. Unfortunately, no dose-dependency was observed and from this data alone we cannot conclude that nalidixic acid induces a stress response in mammalian cells For more information view UC Davis' wiki under these conditions.
Figure 2. Induction of mammalian stress responses as measured by UC Davis. A slight increase in signal is observed, but the error bars are too high to draw meaningful conclusions from this data. For more information about             the experiment and relevant protocols, visit the wiki of UC Davis.
In return, iGEM UC Davis requested us to test the effects of hydrogen peroxide on bacterial cells to allow iGEM UC Davis"

In this Spatial Oscillator, we are trying to combine chemotaxis and motility with our randomizer.
The optimal situation is that, our cells can stably maintain at one state during movement, unitl reaching to the end point, and they stop, when 1 specific AHL concentration is high enough, they regain motility and switch to another state. So the switch needs to have either bistable or automatic reversion characteristics at different stages.
References:
UCSF 2006 : a chemotaxis receptor switch constructed
Penn State 2006: use quorum sensing to induce motility
Cambridge 2006: two Quorum sensing systems constructed allowing bi-directional communication
Step 1
change the original chemotaxis receptor promoter to a bistable switch, by adding inducers, oscillation can be achieved primarily
While in order for autonomous oscillation, more elements need to be added.
Step 2
autonomous-oscillation model
Although it seems that bistable switch here becomes an oscillator, what we are worried about is the bistable switch is no longer bistable. Receptor/moving direction may be uncoupled with the oscillation pattern, which means that the period for cell to move one round may not be the same length as the period for cell to oscillate 1 circle.
From Cambridge 2006, we could apply 2 AHL systems to generate a bistable switch with/without autonomous oscillation.
Whether the model can oscillate needs further simulation and testing.
Since both LasR and LuxR repression are leaky, so that additional repression may be needed as was indicated in Penn state 2006 and Cambridge bistable switch

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," effect of Pgt by increasing pathogen survival. The fungus is unable to survive winter climates characteristic of the locations it infects; however, milder winters are able to extend the prevalence of the disease.
By targeting many of staple foods of the world population, Pgt heavily contributes to food insecurity and causes disastrous monetary losses. Wheat rust fungus accounts for 30% of food insecurity in Ethiopia alone. In 2014, over 600,000 hectares of wheat were destroyed by wheat rust fungus in Ethiopia. This measured around one third of the wheat crop that year and a monetary value of over $375 million. In a recent report by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, they estimate that even with a ten percent loss in crops due to TTKSK, the monetary value of these losses could exceed $7.5 billion.
How can we help?
The conventional method of detection involves farmers examining their fields in a W pattern,
checking for physical symptoms. The most prevalent symptom is the formation of pustules, and it takes approximately one to two weeks for physical symptoms to be expressed by the plants. Therefore, by the time the farmer is alerted of the presence of Pgt, the disease has progressed rapidly and is in its final stages and ready to infect neighboring crops. In addition,  after the formation of pustules, farmers only have a couple days to spray their crops. Given that farmers in remote areas must travel to obtain suitable fungicides, early detection also gives them enough time to gather their materials.
Visit our project description page to learn more about what our team is doing to fight the threat of Pgt."

Trying again the experiment from September 7th.
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
At  first, heat-shock transformation to chemically competent BH5? bacteria with the following  DNA parts (separately):
pUC 57 Adiponectin
pUC 57 HSP70
pUC 57 HSP70 modified
pUC 57 DsbA-L
pcDNA3.1 UCP1
The  transformed bacteria were incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
After  24 hr incubation, colonies from each plate were transferred to liquid medium  and incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
Plasmid  DNA was extracted using a miniprep kit and concentrations were measured using  nanodrop.
The  plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes Pst1 and EcoR1, following general  restriction protocol .
The  digested DNA parts were tested by gel electroporation, following general  gel electrophoresis protocol .
Ligation  products were transformed by heat-shock to chemically competent DH5? bacteria, plated on cmp LB  agar plates and incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
Results:
All parts were successfully restricted (unfortunately  the picture taken was not in good quality).
No  colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  no colonies grew on the plates, but restriction went well, the problem might  lie either in the ligation process or the competent cells. For the next try, a  new competent cells stock was used.
Biobricking  third try:
Details:
DNA  parts and pSB1C3 backbone (from pSB1C3 RFP and pSB1C3 amilcp) were digested  with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  ligation and transformation was done according to the previous protocols.
Results:
All parts were successfully restricted but  again, no colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  no colonies grew on the plates even though different competent cells stock was  used, and restriction went well, we assume that the competent cells are not the  problem and for the next try, we would use a new DNA ligase.

The Resulting Estimated Kinetic Parameters
So, the kinetic parameters for CsADH2946 were estimated using this probabilistic method where the experimental data was fitted to the model. As you can see in Figure 8, we could compute a curve (blue) with the estimated parameters that fit the experimental data. This means that our parameters are good approximations that can be used to describe the actual data. We obtained KM = 20.7842 µM ± 3.5264 with standard diviation.
Figure 8. Plot of experimental product concentration Ĉ against time (red) and a modelled curve using estimated Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters to best fit the experimental data (blue). The values of the estimated kinetic parameters obtained by the algorithm are also displayed in the plot. KM = 20.7842 µM ± 3.5264 with standard diviation.
To evaluate our estimated parameters, we first compared the values obtained by our algorithm with values of the parameters calculated with maximum likelihood. These were similar, which shows that our values are reasonable. To further analyse and validate our algorithm, we ran our algorithm on a simulated a progress curve based on the estimated parameters but with added normally distributed noise. The fitting of the simulated noisy data using our algorithm should return similar parameter values as the initial experimental data generated. As can be seen in figure 9, the parameters from the fitting of the simulated noisy data did return similar parameter values. We also tried to compare our results with parameters estimated from fitting the experimental data in DynaFit. However, DynaFit was unable to return a good model fit, possibly because of our unknown substrate concentration in the beginning of the experiment.

Biofilms: Degradation of July 9 Biofilms and Reculturing of July 9 Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Tiffany Dang, Dinula De Silva, Ronja Kothe, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: Continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and to see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms.
Procedure: Degrading the July 8 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, Fantastic and Lysol solutions were used that had previously been created. Water was used as a control. 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. 30 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 9 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well for one of microtiter plate that had been degraded with cleaner. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C"

After my Bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Basel (CH), I was looking for a new challenge which I found in the Life Science & Technology Master and the iGEM competition. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to drive innovation towards greater sustainability in the chemical industry. My role is the scientific specification of our construct and hardware requirements for it to be put into practice. During my free time I fence saber on national level and I recently participated as a dancer in a theater production.

With a prior background in chemical modeling, the position of modeling manager was the best fit for me! Besides my studies, I enjoy painting, swimming and travelling.

I am an enthusiastic student from Morella, Spain, who is working hard for the Master program in Life Sciences and Technology. After some years studying my Bachelor’s degree in Barcelona, I moved to Delft looking for new experiences in biotechnology. Here I had the great opportunity to join the iGem team, where I am responsible of safety issues and lab management. In my free time, I enjoy doing sport and reading;  I could say I enjoy playing football as much as I enjoy science.
Michelle Post
Ciao, I am an ambitious, motivated and open-minded student with interest in both the biotechnology and science communication. Being the policy and practice manager gave me the excellent opportunity to explore both sides; a perfect combination between science and communication. Besides iGEM I really enjoy singing in my jazz band ‘The Bowties’, cooking delicious dinners for my friends and drinking wine or Belgian beers.

International public engagement
Due to the high population, East and South East Asia is the global source of influenza. In addition, rapid spread of Influenza is more serious in undeveloped country due to less developed system. Therefore, our project and the idea of synthetic biology should also be introduced to the publics in those countries. However, most underdeveloped countries don’t have the concept of synthetic biology. Among the region, Bangladesh is country affected by influenza and without the concept of synbio. Therefore, we first choose Bangladesh as the first targeted country.

Discussion and Conclusion
The optimized promoter for expression control in Bacillus subtilis did not have the proposed function in E. coli. Whether this is the same in Bacillus subtilis was not tested in this experiment, but according to previous findings, the promoter is optimized for control in B. subtilis [?,?]. While we set out to improve a BioBrick function, we were only able to improve the description of the existing BioBrick by providing more detailed data for induction GFP synthesis from BBa_K7330018 in a 1% xylose solution.

Human Body Model
To be able to determine what the VLPs and the medicine do in the human body we have constructed a human body model that is inspired by the model of the Slovenia 2012 team. With this model we are able to compare the traditional use of medicine with the use of our VLPs. If successful it will open up a whole new era for the use of medicine.
Explanation of the model
Our model is constructed in such a way that each compartment of the model represents an organ or multiple organs with the same physical properties. We decided to have separate compartments for the kidneys, liver, lungs and the intestine. All other organs are grouped in the rapid or slowly perfused tissue. In the case study we made a new compartment between the intestine and the liver to represent the intestine tumor (figure 1).

Xavier MONTOY
He is studying industrial design at ENSCI-Les Ateliers in Paris. 5 things to love about Xavier: He is an awesome designer (he likes to make smelly wallets out of kombucha). He works out and is very athletic (but would definitely skip a session to go on a Pokemon hunt). He is a great artist and plays the piano (he also listens to PNL, so...). He is very careful about his diet and likes to eat healthy food (but will wash it down with 5 beers!). And finally, he is an amazing person, and a great asset to have in an iGEM team (indeed, his spirit animal is the penguin...)
Mehdi MOREL
He has a bachelor in Cellular Biology and physiology, and he’s currently in his last year of Master degree in Biochemistry of therapeutic and toxic molecules. The best way to describe Mehdi is to use one of his quote: ""Mehdi is our god"" Mehdi Morel, August 25, 2016! We really appreciate his humility. Beware, he also has a really mysterious sense of humor (try to not be offended!) and he is a master of language accents. He has also many skills in biology, some may say that he's a genius (his mother and him!). So it's making him a really good asset in the laboratory! Big player of golf on his Wii console, he plays also soccer ""sometimes"". His favorite animal is the albinos dolphin!
Thomas VIALON
He did his high school in Saint-Céré, a small village in the French countryside, in the middle of fields and cows. Then, he studied physics, chemistry and mathematics at a university-level during two years of preparatory classes, in Toulouse, the birthplace of aviation. He is now in second year of ESPCI Paris, an engineering school and a research center in physics, chemistry and biology. Thomas is essential to the iGEM Pasteur team. He can solve a chemistry problem while flying an aircraft. If you meet him, you will probably hear his accent which comes from Toulouse in the south of France

Pittsburgh,2016,Team:Pittsburgh#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," lead to high blood pressure and kidney problems ( EPA ). In children and adults, even a trace amount of lead can cause problems, but the maximum contaminant level (MCL) in drinking water set by the EPA is 15 parts per billion (ppb). In 2015, a year after Flint changed its water source to the Flint River, the a resident's water was found to contain over 13,000 ppb of lead. In the same time period, an increased percentage of children in Flint had elevated blood lead levels ( NPR ).
The Flint water crisis has sparked national concern about lead contamination in water. Cities are scrambling to test their water lest they become the ""next Flint."" In the past few months, the city of Pittsburgh has found lead levels that are dangerously close to the EPA's MCL or higher. This awareness is beneficial for the residents, but the power still lies within city officials. Residents need a device to test for lead in their own homes. Current lead sensors for home use exist, but they cost about twenty to thirty US dollars (USD)--inaccessible for over 40 percent of Flint's population and over 14 percent of the US population, which lives under the poverty line ( NPR ; US Census Bureau ). Thus, we are developing Hot Metal Switch, a sensor that could cost mere cents, for residents to test their own water whenever they wish.

Hot Metal Switch
Hot Metal Switch is based on a paper-based sensor developed by the Collins group. In 2014, Pardee and colleagues developed a paper-based detection system that was cheap, easy to use, and efficient, producing results in less than an hour. Their system relied on RNA-based sensors to sense small molecules. These sensors were freeze-dried onto paper with cell extract, which contains the translational and transcriptional machinery a cell uses to express proteins. We are adapting their system to sense metals by using a DNAzyme-based sensor as part of the detection circuit. In the presence of lead, the circuit will express LacZ, producing a visible color change. .
""Thallium"" by La Tabla Periódica / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0
The design of our circuit makes it easily adaptable to other metals. To demostrate this, we used a thallium DNAzyme to sense thallium. Thallium is the element between lead and mercury on the periodic table. It is a byproduct of glassmaking, electronics factories, drug production, and the extraction of metals from ore ( EPA ).

Glyoxylate Shunt
Overview
Our artificial futile cycle is driven by the expression of two key enzymes in glyoxylate cycle. Since mammalian cells lack genes expressing glyoxylate shunt, we introduce these genes from E. coli and assemble them in a constitutive construct that will allow the expression of prokaryotic gene in eukaryotic cell. In addition to the constitutive system, we will also assemble an inducible construct which will allow tunable gene expression according to the concentration of fatty acid in the medium. We decided to introduce inducible system to prevent fatty acid deficiency in low concentration of plasma fatty acid and facilitate greater fatty acid uptake at a high circulating fatty acid levels. The inducible and constitutive system will be compared in terms of fatty acid uptake rate in a range concentration of fatty acid.
Construct
The two key enzymes of glyoxylate system are isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. These two enzymes are encoded by aceA and aceB genes, respectively. We planned to assemble aceA and aceB construct in one vector plasmid to minimize the possibility of mosaic expression of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase throughout the cell line. The mosaic expression can be caused by cell transfection with only either aceA-containing plasmid or aceB-containing plasmid. The constitutive system will be fused with a mammalian constitutive promoter, a mitochondrial leader sequence, a tagging protein and a polyadenylation sequence. Mitochondrial leader sequence is needed for protein translocation to the mitochondria. Tagging protein is essential for detecting the protein expression by means of western blot. Polyadenylation site enhances the gene expression as it is transfected into a mammalian where post-transcription modification exists. aceA and aceB construct will be assembled separately in different plasmid before being combined into one"

Polysialic Acid
The K1 strain of E. coli produces and encapsulates itself in alpha-2,8-linked  polysialic acid (PSA), a polysaccharide that biochemically mimics the human glycoprotein Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM). This similarity renders virulent K1 E. coli poorly immunogenic in humans because they aren’t seen as foreign and are therefore cloaked from antibody opsonization and complement-mediated killing. Clearly, equipping our minicells with such protection would be highly advantageous for improving their successful delivery rate and reducing harmful immune responses.
A significant amount of machinery (14 genes in total) is required to generate the PSA capsule in K1 E. coli and transferring this ability over to the comparatively docile K12 E. coli is quite the feat. Thankfully, we were able to find previous work by Dr. Eric Vimr that accomplished just that and obtained a single pSR23 plasmid that contains all the required genes. We are currently in the process of confirming the presence of PSA on our K12 E. coli via antibody-labeled fluorescence microscopy.

Western blot of colicin Ia and E3 immunities with bile salt sensitive pacrRA: The col Ia and E3 immunities were amplified with a HA tag to detect expression via a western blot. Empty pSB1C3 and acrRA promoter was blotted alongside as a control. The constructs with ramA were also blotted to see if this has any effect on acrRA function. No expression of acrRA col Ia immunity was detected however we were able to see expression of the E3 immunity in the acrRA col E3 immunity with and without ramA.
We then attempted to clone in the full length colicin Ia and E3 in front of its immunity in the asr and acrRA immunity, but we were unsuccessful. This could be because the immunity was not being expressed, since we never managed to show its expression via a western blot.
In the future, we would like to clone the colicin Ia immunity in front of the gadA pH promoter, followed by the full length colicin Ia. We then moved onto working with our colicin chimeras.

Basic Circuits
○ Resistance subsystem
In this circuits, three functional genes, NhaA, NhaB and glsA, are employed for resisting both acidic and alkaline environment. NhaA and NhaB can encode two kinds of Na+/H+ antiporter, ensuring the survival of bacteria under alkaline circumstances. Under acidic condition, bacteria can maintain homeostasis due to the function of glsA ( details in project ). Since all these proteins of functional genes can be regulated by pH ( details in project ), the strong constitutive promoter J23119 is applied to guarantee the steady transcription of three functional genes. Thus, our resistance subsystem can make E.coli survive in an expanded pH range.
○ Regulation subsystem
In this subsystem, two pH-responsive promoters, P-asr and P-atp2, are employed. P-asr induces transcription in acidic environment from pH 4.0 ~ 5.0, and shows low activity at neutral pH. P-atp2 can respond at pH 7.0 ~ 9.0, especially at alkaline pH. These two pH-responsive promoters are applied to open the synthesis of acid and alkali. ldhA encodes an lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) which converts pyruvate to lactate. gadA, one of a functional genes for producing alkali, is used in our circuit to convert glutamate to GABA(γ-amino butyric acid), a certain kind of alkaline substance. This subsystem is used to regulate the external environment pH.
Fine-regulation circuits
○ Cre-LoxP & Flp-FRT circuits
In fermentation process, the environment usually turn acidic, so we produce alkali (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) in the primary state. And alkali-induced promoter P-atp2 and acid-induced promoter P-asr are employed to produce the recombinase Cre and Flp respectively. When the pH of environment reaches the P-atp2’s responsive range, Cre would express and recognize the LoxP"

NYMU-Taipei,2017,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Pigments_-_-_TEXT.html,"Z transformant at 400 to 500 nm is higher than wild type. The result verified our first prediction, a change of wavelength absorbance. Not only this, the change of wavelength absorbance is at 400 to 500 nm, which is blue light. This indicated CrtZ transformant can absorb blue light and reflects yellow light, so CrtZ transformant is more yellow than wild type. The measurement matches what we saw intuitively.
Photosynthetic Efficiency
To test whether the photosynthetic efficiency of CrtZ transformant is better than wild type, we used iodine to measure starch concentration. First, the initial concentration of microalgae of CrtZ transformants and wild type should be the same, so that the measurement could be fair. We measured the OD value at 730 nm, which represented the concentration of microalgae. Then we calculated how much microalgae and BG11 (the medium) we should added to make the same amount of microalgae in each plate. Second, we started to measure starch concentration. We measured the OD value of each plate at 730 nm, which represented the cell number. Then we added 50 μl iodine into each cuvette, waited for five minutes, and measured the OD value at 620 nm, which represented the starch content. We repeated this step consequently for seven days. Here are our results.
Then we divided the starch content by cell number, and we knew there were how much starch in every unit cell.
Then we calculated the variation of starch content per cell per day.
The first day, wild type (WT) had more starch than CrtZ transformants. However, the increase of starch per day of CrtZ transformants is more than wild type. The results imply that CrtZ transformants can produce more starch per day than the wild type. Moreover, the results correspond to our hypothesis -- CrtZ transformants actually have better photosynthetic efficiency!
Survival Ability
We also are considering about the survival ability of CrtZ transformants. Therefore, we conducted a competitive experiment of CrtZ transformants to wild type. We co-cultured CrtZ transformant and wild type together, and then observed the color after seven days. Similarly, the initial concentration of microalgae of CrtZ transformant and wild type should be the same, and we used the same method we used in photosynthetic efficiency experiments.
After seven days, CrtZ transformant and wild type both survived. The result indicates that CrtZ transformant is strong and had great survival ability"

Introduction
Gene expression controlled by external induction has been widely studied in synthetic biology. In recent years, expression control without an induction, enabling cells to spontaneously change their gene expression, has also been investigated. For example,  iGEM SYSU 2015 designed a system allowing a specific gene to be expressed after a certain time using recombinase. However, in this system, it is difficult to estimate when the gene expression will change. Moreover, since the DNA sequence itself is changed, the genes expressed is irreversible.
We thus decided to this year, design a genetic circuit which enables E. coli to change its gene expression every cell division and make the gene expression state loop within a certain number of divisions.
Basic biology would tell us that if an E. coli expressing GFP divides, the next generation would also express GFP (not suddenly RFP or CFP!). Therefore, the idea of making use of the system to create cells which will be expressing only GFP in the first, only RFP in the second, only CFP in the third generation and loop back to expressing only GFP in the fourth sounded very exciting. We first modelled the system and our results demonostrated that the gentic circuit can function as we designed. We chose the main genetic components to be used in our system (a Toehold switch, sigma factors, a cell cycle dependent promotor Pnrd, and inducible promoter PBAD) based on our modelling results and experimentally characterised the parts.
Since it is possible to make E. coli express a specific gene only after a definite number of divisions,  the system can be further applied in synthetic biology and in field. For instance, a kill switch programmed to make E. coli die after a certain number of divisions can be constructed.  Furthermore, by utilizing the loops enabled in our system, even for commands requesting a certain output after a large number of cell division, not"

Efficiency of the Database Entries
86% of participants would like to see a ranking/rating      system for the parts by the other iGEM users which will be one indication      of if a part is working and how well in different laboratories. Few had concerns about how well the rating system will work for      rarely used parts while the widely used parts would even more popular      due the the rating system. Still many believes this would be one      futher towards a peer-reviewed quality control system for the parts.
61% of participants agreed that parts should be updated      regularly by the designers, where most agreed at least when there      is new information on the parts. It has also been suggested      to give permission to all the users of that part for updating information.
73% of participants have been agree with us that excluding      the low ranking parts or the parts with negative feedback from the      future plates will increase efficiency of the system. The      major concern about excluding any part is losing the variety of      parts in the database. Few recommends excluding only the parts that      are not working.
“Efficiency shouldn't be top priority in a database. First and foremost,     data is the top priority. Excluding those parts would make the system     more efficient”
“Some parts may be rare or new and have low efficiency, but can be     very important! Getting rid of them would eliminate any chance of improvement     to these parts, which not only a qualifier for an iGEM gold medal, but     also one of the focuses of biobricks.”
We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or with     negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still archive     them and make their data available through the parts registry.

Synthetic Biology Presentation
After their experiment, we had the students watch a short, fun video on the basics of synthetic biology, which can be found below. Then, we further explained the field and its potential applications for the future. The students were greatly interested in the ethics of synthetic biology, especially issues of intellectual property and bio-security leading to discussions about issues of ownership of biological parts and processes as well as techniques for improving security of the parts.
Having explained the importance of synthetic biology and its potential problems, we next introduced the students to iGEM. We went through the aims of the foundation, the different levels of competition, and what our particular team is working on. We paid special attention to explaining BioBricks and the potential they serve in the biological community. See our presentation slides here: File:HSiGEMPresentation.pdf
Future Outreach
As previously mentioned, Janet Standeven is forming a high school iGEM team at Lambert High School. We expect to work closely with Mrs. Standeven in the future to establish her team and their project.
Potential activities include bringing them to the Georgia Institute of Technology to see the iGEM lab space and discuss both general and specific scientific practice for the students. It is expected that we will keep close contact with Janet and Lambert High School in the future to further the benefit to both of our groups of students.
Our workshop at Lambert High School was also featured in the Forsyth County News, a local newspaper. See the article here: http://www.forsythnews.com/m/section/3/article/14721/ .
Safety
Safety Rules and Regulations are an important component of working in a laboratory setting, especially in a synthetic biology lab. That is why, at Georgia Institute of Technology, safety procedures are in place to minimize the risk of mishaps in a laboratory and utmost care is taken such that any accidental or experimental mistakes do not harm the welfare of staff as well as the community.
General Lab Safety
The Georgia Tech iGEM 2012 team follows the guidelines as implemented by the university and all of its members have been trained in Lab Safety Protocols for this purpose. All the team members have attended a presentation on general safety in the lab, understanding material safety data sheets, the meaning of various warning labels, such as those on refrigerators, waste disposal, and autoclaving techniques conducted by the lab safety officer in School of Biology, Marc Pline.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"ymA from S. oneidensis (9) thus allowing transfer of electrons from cytosol to MtrA protein through the inner membrane. MtrA then acts as linker between MtrBC complex and NapC and transfers electrons further on. The MtrBC is then responsible for pumping electrons through the outer membrane. For the right folding of Mtr proteins cytochrome c maturation (ccm) (7) genes should be additionally expressed in E. coli, because under aerobic conditions the genes are not expressed (8) and usually during the introduction of mtr genes into E. coli additional copy of ccm is transferred too (5). This can be added on the additional plasmid (Fig 1). Another good reason for expression of mtr in E. coli K-12 is that it has ability to generate small amounts of current when grown on electrodes (6).
Fig 1. The representation of plasmids on the left required for mtr protein activity testing. The pictures on the right indicate the position of mtr proteins in the cell membrane.
Additionally, Dr. James Moir offered us the plasmid containing ccm, so we decided to amplify and clone mtrBC with unchanged RBS originally from S. oneidensis genome and synthesize mtrA gene containing Plux-lac promoter and crr12 – RBS with complementary sequence for mRNA secondary structure formation. This is a double control mechanism for mtrA and single control mechanism for the mtrBC protein expression. However, due to non-sense mutations occurring during the PCR reaction with Phusion polymerase, we managed to clone only mtrABC construct, which contains no promoter and RBS for MtrA and MtrBC with RBS.

The hybrid bistable switch
Biological systems usually exist in one of multiple states that are mutually exclusive. The switch for sporulation is a well known example. In Bacillus subtilis, this process is controlled by a complex network that involves more than 125 genes and interactions between proteins and other metabolites (1). Induced by starvation, feedback loops within the circuit compete for dictatorship to determine cell fate (2). Vibrio fischeri has a mutual relationship with the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) . It lives in the squid's mantle cavity and produces luminous light to deter hosts from being eaten (3). Underlying process of the light production is quorum sensing"

Our team consists of 11 students and two instructors. We are from Ocean University of China (OUC) which is a comprehensive university with particular strengths in oceanography and fisheries science. We come from 5 different colleges, majoring in biology, biotechnology, ecology, bioengineering, aquiculture, mathematics and industrial design.
In the processing of iGEM, we are trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. And we will never forget the time we fight together. Because, it was the best of times, it was the hardest of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of busyness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of disappointment, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of attraction, it was the summer of fever, we had nothing before iGEM, we had everything after iGEM.

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#Project#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," this sketch we constructed a causality diagram which is shown below.
In this diagram we postulate that SST and FFT work in cooperation, that is, they are not independent of each other. In the diagram sucrose enters the system from an infinite pool visualized as a cloud. The reason for this is that we assume that for each individual bacteria the amount of sucrose available seems infinite, but in reality this would not be the case. Sucrose is then cleaved into its two constituent parts; sucrose and glucose which both SST and FFT are capable of. In our model system this is represented by XXT which is the combined catalytic cleavage of sucrose by both enzymes. The reason for this approach is because the amount of fructose inside the cell is the major rate limiting factor for inulin production so we chose this way of modelling it due to it being easier to work with even though this is not what happens in real life. Because the inulin is primarily made up of fructose this creates a large excess of glucose. The way we handled this is to assume the bacteria is able to use the glucose in its own metabolism, which in the model is called Bak. SST catalyzes the formation of the trisaccahride 1-kestose from a sucrose and a fructose unit. FFT catalyses the addition of several more fructose units in an iterative loop that terminates when the chain has reached an adequate length. In our model we chose a chain length of 5 as the end product, this is modelled as a loop function in our model.
Promoters
For our desired construct we wanted to be able to control transcription of our SST and FFT genes by both having a sucrose sensitive promoter and a heat sensitive promoter.  For the model we have made three different types of promoters to simulate our desired final construct. In our model the promoters activate the SST and FFT activities. The first promoter is a simple constitutive promoter that is always active and thereby always activates transcription. The reason for this promoter was to simply show that the system could work. The second promoter is a heat shock promoter that only activates transcription when the heat of the system is sufficiently high. The thought behind this approach is if we wanted to have our bacteria in a yogurt that is to be stored in a refrigerator and then when it enters the stomach of the host it heats up and activates transcription of our genes. In the simulation we have simply modelled the heat shock promoter after a delay function, so that after five seconds we go from cold to hot and transcription proceeds. The last promoter is a sucrose sensitive promoter that is"

Sensitivity Tuners
Previous Work
Part of the iGEM mission is to build on previous projects.  The Cambridge 2007 iGEM team developed a PoPS amplifier system using phage activators and promoters.  The system works by using a PoPS input to make an activator protein, as shown in the diagram from their wiki below, which then binds to a promoter and generates a PoPS output.
In order to quantify the ratio between PoPS in and PoPS out, the team built the following construction on the high copy plasmid pSB1A2, with mRFP and GFP as PoPS reporter.  They genenerated 15 total combinations of different activators and promoters.
In addition to analysing the characteristics of the Cambridge 2007 constructs, we looked at models of alternatives ways to alter the sensitivity of a promoter
They successfully quantified the PoPS amplification factors for each activator/promoter combination after arabinose induction.
Kit of Parts
The Cambridge 2009 team analyzed the properties of these constructs, paying particular attention to how adding phage activator and promoter combinations downstream of pBad altered the behaviour of pBad.  In particular, it caught our attention that the phage activator and promoter combinations changed the sensitivity of pBad.  We sought to thoroughly characterise each combination to generate a useful description of each so that future iGEM teams seeking to build biosensors can easily identify which combination is appropriate, depending on how they desire to manipulate their chosen promoter.  Further, we redesigned the 2007 team's constructs, removing the fluorescent reporter genes used for characterisation, as follows:

AmilCP (BBa_K592009)
AmilGFP is a yellow chromoprotein biobrick part (BBa_K592010), created by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011, and was used     as one of the reporter genes in our volatile detection device. Details concerning this part can be found in Team Uppsala     Sweden 2011 page. BBa_K592010 .     This chromoprotein is part of the green chromoprotein with maximum absorbtion at 503 nm.
Our team has coupled this biobrick part with our promoters:  alsT, fnr, and sboA. The cloning was done in BBa_K818000     (plasmid backbone for B. subtilis, engineered by team Groningen 2012), to allow color expression in B. subtilis.    We utilized a strong RBS BBa_B0034 for pigment expression in both E. coli and B. subtilis. This reporter coding     gene was strongly expressed in E. coli due to the leakiness of the promoters, while the expression in B. subtilis without     induction was considerably low. This low expression in B. subtilis was due to the promoter strength and the RBS that was     used in this construct. The promoters are considered weak, therefore visible expression requires induction by volatiles produced    by the rotten meat.
The volatile detection device containing sboA promoter and amilGFP has been tested in the presence of the rotten and fresh meat.     We found that under the presence of rotten meat our volatile detection device produced bright yellow color. On the other hand, when    our device that was exposed to the volatiles produced by the fresh meat it produced a small amount of yellow color. The     comparison between B. subtilis containing sboA + amilGFP to B. subtilis 168 wildtype under the presence of rotten    meat volatiles resulted in yellow pigment production by our device while no yellow pigment was produced in the wildtype strain.     The yellow color produced by our device was strong enough to be observed by the human naked eye.
E. coli DH5a containing sboA promoter + amilGFP. Yellow color was highly expressed due to the leakiness of the    promoter and a strong RBS for E. coli.

Learned how to perform luciferase assays
Week 8 (June 18-22):
Started the week with InterLab Measurement study:
Made standard curves for fluorescein, microsphere particles, and LUDOX CL-X using a plate reader
Attempted the cell measurement protocol:
Started by making 40 chloramphenicol plates. Then heat-shock-transformed DH5-alpha with the plasmid, then plated
Transformed nanoluc containing pNL1.1 plasmid into DH5-alpha using chemical transformation
Grew a liquid culture Thursday night of DH5-alpha housing pNL1.1, and another liquid culture of DH5a with pET16b
Performed plasmid mini-prep (extracted the plasmid DNA) and did a double digest of each KpnI and EcoRI for pNL1.1, XhoI and HindIII for pET16b
Performed Gibson Assembly to insert an Anderson Promoter into pNL1.1 for the luciferase assays
Performed another Gibson assembly to insert 2 overlapping fragments into pET16b:
N-terminal of KanR
N-intein-LBD (GR)-C-intein-KanR
Did electroporation to transform E. coli and plated
The Gibson Assembly for pNL1.1 didn’t work (currently still promoterless)
Nothing grew (including on the positive control) → therefore, could be a plasmid, transformation, or Gibson assembly                          problem
Week 9 (June 25-29):
Gibson was redone with a HiFi Gibson Assembly on pNL 1.1 and the Anderson promoter, as well as pET16b and intein with three different          linkers (GPGGSG, GPGGSGS, GGGGSGGGGS), and a positive control
Did chemical transformation using New England Biolabs supplies and plated on ampicillin plates
Colonies were recovered on every plate (including the positive control)
Now have colonies for pNL1.1 +Anderson promoter and for the three different sequences with KanR+intein+linkers+GR domain
Made liquid cultures
Performed a diagnostic digest on three linkers using BsaI
One of three pET16b digestions was as expected with linker 1 came out perfectly as expected on the gel
Performed a luciferase assay on pNL1.1:
Pelleted 1-2 mL of liquid culture bacteria (pNL1.1). Repeated (four different liquid cultures).

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," reactions involving many kinds of reactant molecules. If we treat transcription from plasmids as one reaction, assuming the copy number of plasmids as 200, then the propensity function a equals to the stochastic rate constant multiplied by 200 (200× c). So it will take about one of a two hundred times of an average transcription time to finish one transcription. Of course, in the time scale of average transcription time it is not a big problem, but this may not be good for simulating, like in our project, the system that uses the time for transcriptions and translations cannot be shortened. We introduce time-delay into the Gillespie algorithm based on [12]~[14]. The mathematical correctness of this algorithm is proved in [14]. Time-delay means treating reactions as following:
<img src = ""
"" height=""48px"" class = ""math"" />
Furthermore, transcriptions and translations are too complex to list up all of the reactions step by step. Therefore it is better to treat them as time-delay than reaction formulas.
Now we begin to model our project, sigma Re-counter. In our model, there are five types of reactions: transcription, translation, an association and disassociation of crRNA and taRNA, an association and disassociation of sigma and anti-sigma, and degradation. We introduce time-delay into only transcription and translation. Then, we explain how we treat these three reactions in general.
We explain transcription's model of mRNA[11]. When RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region, first they take the RNAP・promoter close complex. At this state, the complex can dissociate. But with a certain probability, the close complex turn to the open complex which doesn't dissociate. After the RNA polymerase and the promoter region take the open complex, the elongation of mRNA starts. In this state, the promoter region is cleared and RBS(Ribosome binding site) is synthesized, so we model as reaction3'. It is difficult to model the elongation of mRNA by elementary reaction formula because it is a complex reaction, so we model by time-delay. Then the reaction formula of transcription can be described as following's reactions:
<img src = ""
"" height=""137px"" class = ""math"" />
combining reaction3' and reaction3, we get:
<img src = ""
"" height=""20px"" class = ""math"" />
In the above reaction formula, DNA denotes the promoter region, and mRNA denotes RBS.
In our project, we have to model transcription of taRNA. Because taRNA functions only when it is completely transcribed, we model as"

Professor Masafumi Yohda
Biotechnology and Life Science
Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan
YOHDA sensei is a biotechnology and life science professor, and he’s also a lecturer in Engineering in Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT). He came to Indonesia as a guest lecture in Society of Biological Engineering Universitas Indonesia Student Chapter (SBE-UISC) featuring UI Synbio Club Seminar entitled “Application of Biotechnology in Industry.” He has come to several Nobel Prize Meetings and very famous, yet he still gave us many advices on our Lab Work. Luckily, he’s here with us to provide some information regarding synthetic biology application projection in Asia, also problems involving application of Synbio in Japan. Check it out!
Synthetic biology really has big prospects in the world. We need ideas––yet we need breakthroughs if we want to achieve more from it. Asia is being forward in many aspects over the past several years. However, Major findings from the Wilson Center on “Tracking the Growth of Synthetic Biology” in 2013 shows that the number of entities conducting research and commercial applications in Synthetic Biology in Europe and US is very high, but Asia has been left behind. Japan––as the most developed country in Asia––is known of its high technology development. Depart from this statement; Professor Yohda from TUAT (Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) stated that there are restrictions in Japan towards GMO application. This condition biased the usual fact and in real life, a part of Japanese people are intolerant of science implementation, so the government of Japan protect all of the people including the conventionalist by restricting synthetic biology and especially GMO. Safety module might works, but back to reality. Every machine that works can’t be 100% effective, and so is safety module. There’s always a chance of failure of microorganism to escape and contaminate environment, especially because the size of microorganism and bacteria is"

This composite part is for the expression of the fusion protein we designed, csgA-CBD. Expression requires a T7 RNA polymerase because of the T7 constitutive promoter. It is a csgA curlin precursor of E.Coli coding region linked to a Bacillus circulans chitin binding domain with a 6x polyhistidine tag.
CsgA has well documented amyloid formation behavior and is a main component of E.Coli biofilms, so we theorized that if it were fused to a chitin binding domain the resulting fusion protein would exhibit exceptional adhesive properties to chitin while also remaining cohesive with other csgA-CBD proteins. These traits are extremely attractive for use as a biological adhesive on mycelium substrates, as the fungal cell wall is largely composed of chitin.

Lethbridge_HS,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," time depend on the point during a bacteria lifecycle when inoculation begins. One research study conducted by Zachary Storms and Tobin Brown shows how the burst size—the squares, and the lysis time—the circles, vary with when the infection starts. Storms and Brown suggest that the burst size is the highest and the lysis time is the shortest if the infection starts when the bacteria cell enters the division stage, because at that point the cell has the richest intracellular resources.
Figure 1. Graph showing experimental evidence of correlation between phage burst size and lysis time and the time during a bacterial cell lifecycle at which inoculation begins.
4. Bacteria doubling time: the time it takes a bacteria population to double in size.
Equations:
Results and Interpretation:
The following graphs are constructed with an initial bacteria population of 1,000 and an initial phage population calculated according to the MOI used. However, the actual numbers of bacteria and phages do not influence the trends observed in the graph, as it is the ratio between these numbers (the MOI), not the actual numbers, that matters.
Figure 2a. MOI = 1. Bacteria population is quickly overwhelmed and exterminated around 60 minutes after inoculation. Without viable hosts, the phage population dies shortly afterwards.
Figure 2b. MOI = 0.01. Bacteria population first increases in number, but then, with an abundance of susceptible bacteria, the number of phages increase drastically and eventually overwhelms the bacteria population. Both populations reach zero within 160 minutes.
Figure 2c. MOI = 0.0001. With a small MOI, the bacteria population is still eventually exterminated, just over a longer period. As usual, the phage population dies shortly after all bacterial host disappears.
Discussion:
Although this model clearly shows the influence of the initial MOI on the bacteria/phage dynamics, it suggests that even with a very small MOI, the bacteria and phage populations always become extinct. This is not realistic because in many real-world instances, bacteria and phages co-exist. We realized that the problem with this model is that it treats time as a discrete variable. In discrete time, phages reproduce much faster than bacteria so that the bacteria population is wiped out regardless of the initial values. Hence, we proceeded with a different approach, treating time as continuous.
CONTINUOUS TIME MODEL
Purpose: Given initial populations of bacteria and phages (and hence an MOI), understand how the populations interact and change over continuous time.

Take out the heated aluminum plate and chip, and apply a small amount of water to the outside of the aluminum plate with a test tube brush to slowly cool it to a free evaporation state.
Place the cooled aluminum plate and chip in a ventilated place, and then take out the chip after natural air cooling to check whether the bonding is successful. If successful, the chip is completed.
Precautions:
When cutting the chip, complete it as much as possible, and repeating the cutting multiple times may cause the chip cavity error to become larger;
Check whether the layers of the chip are aligned before bonding. Use a small amount of tape when fixing to avoid the indentation on the surface of the chip.
When bonding, pay attention to the stability of the bonding temperature. If the temperature is too low, the bonding may fail. If the temperature is too high, the chip may melt.
