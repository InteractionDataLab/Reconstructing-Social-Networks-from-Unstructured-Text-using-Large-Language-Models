Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Mutation#Global_-_-_TEXT.html," further decreases the efficiency of DNA mismatch repair (Yang et al. 2004).
Combined overexpression of dam and seqA strongly shifts the methylation state of the DNA. Methylation of the parental strand by SeqA     is reduced while the methylation of the daughter strand via Dam is increased. Both effects abrogate the methylation difference between     parental and daughter strand and prevent effective mismatch repair.
EmrR
As mentioned before, the main factor of replication fidelity is the correct base incorporation during replication.     This is mainly dependent on the α-subunit of DNA polymerase III, but the intracellular concentrations of the     single nucleotidetriphosphates are important too (ref?). A strong imbalance between the single nucleotide-triphosphates or     a high concentration of base analogs can increase the rate of erroneous base incorporation (Gon et al. 2011).
This metabolic imbalance is achieved by the overexpression of emrR. The transcription repressor EmrR reduces the     expression of the repressor of the emrAB operon. This operon encodes an efflux pump, which is linked to multidrug resistance (Lomovskaya et al. 1995).     However, the native function of EmrAB is the export of intermediates of the purine and pyrimidine metabolism.     An overexpression of emrR reduces the concentration of EmrA and EmrB leading to increased concentration of nucleotide     precursors inside the cell. At high concentrations, these nucleotide precursors can act as base analogs. Mutations are     caused either incorporation of the nucleotide precursor or by failure during the repair attempt of an erroneous base incorporation(Gabrovsky et al. 2005).
Uracil glycosylase inhibitor and Pteromyzon marinus cytidin deaminase 1
Cytidin deaminases (cda) are DNA editing enzymes in eukaryotes, which have multiple functions like the generation of antibody diversity,     defence against retroviruses and demethylation during development (Lada et al. 2011).
The main activity of CDAs is the deamination from cytidin to uracil in CG base pairs. The resulting UG base pairs split in replication     in one CG and one UA basepair. Therefore, the main mutations created by CDAs are C → T transitions.

This device consists of a box in which a system for temperature control is implemented also a mechanism in which not to do many things manually is implemented; only you need to move a knob to the figure you want to project in the Petri dish is changed.
The mechanism is commonly known as Geneva mechanism, it is a mechanism steps. The original mechanism consists of a rotary movement in which every time the circular piece rotates one revolution the other piece is moved one step. You can design the mechanism so that it has three or more steps:
The Geneva mechanism that was designed consists of four steps in which each step an image that will not let light pass through it will. In each quarter revolution will move one step design that was given. A knob to make the move from outside the box, if you move the knob one full turn will become the first step and therefore the first figure is attached. This knob is manually moved to allow time for the bacteria to receive wavelengths.

BactaSun
Overview
the issue
Although sunburns seem  quite ordinary to get tanned, it’s a real disaster for our skin… Indeed, for several years, our exposure  to UV rays has increased and scientists have noticed an upward trend in the risk of developing skin cancers.
Every year in Belgium we count approximately 2.000 new cases of melanoma [1].
Between 2005 and 2015 in Belgium, there has been a 77% increase of new cases of melanoma [2].
According to WHO, there are  globally around 2 to 3 million skin cancers each year, and around 132.000 melanoma [3].
One American out of  five will develop a skin cancer in his lifetime. We are all affected by this dangerous problem, but some people with specific characteristics are much more concerned.
Our solution :
BactaSun
That’s the reason why we, the 2017 UCLouvain iGEM Team, are participating in the international competition of synthetic biology, iGEM.
Our innovative solution is BactaSun, a bio-badge changing color when exposed to UV rays. Its color gradually switches from white to red. In a nutshell, you are quickly warned when you have to protect your skin.
Actually, we have developed two ways to achieve our goal. Both are using a photocaged amino acid, the ONB-Tyrosine. The cage, the ONB group, is cleaved when exposed to UV rays, which releases the tyrosine amino acid, making it available for protein synthesis (see on the figure below).
The photo-uncaging of the ONB-Tyr (https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/2/24/T--Aachen--onbtyrosincleavagereaction.png-modified)

Abstract
Thiosulfate and tetrathionate are two kinds of chemical compound which can be produced in the gut while gut inflammation. Nowadays, people are able to detect gut inflammation using utilized two-system detector gained from marine Shewanella species and at the same time present the result by producing GFP (expressing the gene sfGFP) which would produce green light if exposed to ultraviolet light. Considering this method can be further improved, SHSBNU_China team contributed to change some parts of the two-system detector in order to let the results to be presented more clearly and visibly in normal condition (without specially-produced ultraviolet light). Furthermore, based on the idea of making the detecting system more practical and usable, we focused on developing a kind of pill with a similar thinking of molecule-targeted drugs, where the whole system is stored in a container which can be easily collect and analyzed when it has finished the trip in the digestive system. One more thing is that this system also has a great potential for future research that it could be further modified to do some treatment to the inflammation (once it’s detected).

We thought it was interesting to compare the results of these two diagrams, as they seem to reflect the misconception people have about the word GMO. We discussed these results with the experts we interviewed: you can read about it in our main article.
The next thing we wanted to know was whether or not the subject felt that the interaction between the scientific world and the general public was satisfactory. The answers we obtained clearly show that people believe is not the case.
We then asked passerbys whom they believed should take responsibility for the outcomes of scientific research, and control the use of derived technology. The subject could choose several answers.
We were quite surprised by these results, as in Switzerland, direct democracy and referendums allow the entire population to vote on very specific questions, scientific topics included. Research in synthetic biology could have come to an abrupt end had the 1998 had the federal popular initiative - “for the protection of life and the environment against genetic manipulation (initiative for genetic protection)” - been accepted. Indeed, the production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited. From our perspective, seeing the people delegate all responsibilities to researchers is the consequence of a lack of interaction. This subject is further explored in our main article.
In the next part of our survey, we quickly described the purpose of the iGEM competition, and presented the main idea behind our project (building independent transistors in cells). We then introduced examples of organisms that could be designed using our project and other synthetic biology applications. Some were past iGEM projects, some we imagined ourselves. Our examples covered a variety of different domains such as energy, agriculture, medicine and information processing (see list below).
Algae that produce biofuel
Bacteria producing electricity
Wheat strain able to easily adapt to climatic conditions
Bacterium able to detect and degrade pollutants in a lake
Modified human cell able to detect and terminate a cancerous cell
Bacterium able to diagnose (in general)
Modified embryonic cell in order to cure a genetic disease
Bacterium that produces plastic
A minesweeper game made with bacteria
Piece of art made with multicolored bacteria
The only organism that gathered a vast majority of negative answers was the “Wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions”. This result further underlines the broad misconception surrounding the acronym GMO.
We also tried to pinpoint which applications of synthetic biology worry the general public. We asked the subject to pick his/her main"

○ Introduction
Recombinase, most of which come from bacteria and fungus, is a kind of enzyme that can make gene recombine [27][28]. It’s usually used to change the structure of genome, regulate the expression of gene and so on. A special sign site in genome (30-40bp) can be recognized by DNA recombinase, and the DNA recombinase will catalyze the recombination of the gene between two sign sites [29]. This ability allows the recombinase four basic functions: gene excision and insert, inversion, translocation and cassette exchange. These functions can be applied to edit the structure of genome, and also to regulate the expression of gene directly [30][31]. There are many kinds of recombinase, such as Cre, Flp, RecA/RAD51, Tre, Hin and others. Different kinds recombinase have different recognized site, so they wouldn’t interfere with other recombinases’ function.
○ Design
In order to fine regulate the pH of environment, we introduce the recombinase system here. We have two libraries of acid and alkali, when the different assembles of acid and alkali is used in our whole system, we need to use different methods to regulate it. So we designed three gene circuits using different kinds of recombinase to achieve the fine-regulation function.
1)Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT circuits
Cre is a kind of Tyrosine recombinase (YR) from P1 bacteriophage. It can catalyze the recombination of the gene between the two specific DNA sign sites (LoxP site). The Cre-LoxP system consists of recombinase Cre and LoxP. When the two LoxP sites are in the same direction, the gene between them would be excised. However, if two sites are in the opposite direction, the gene would be inverted (Fig.7) [32]. Cre does not need ATP or other cofactor to achieve its function [33][34]. The length of LoxP is 34 bp, it contains two inverted repeat sequences (13 bp) and the interval sequence (8 bp). The interval sequence also can define the direction of LoxP(Fig.8).

Fig.8 The sequence of LoxP site
Flp is the other kind of recombinase found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It can recognize the FRT sign site. Flp and FRT form"

Explaining what is important to establish new iGEM team
We explained what is important in order to establish new iGEM team to Biwako Nagahama.
First, we stated what is necessary for managing their laboratory.
Second, we taught them what Synthetic biology is like, and gave them some technical knowledge required for iGEM.
Finally, we instructed them about BioBrick, which is one of the most important purposes in iGEM. By increasing gene registry, their research may lead to developing biology.
Holding study meeting to manage iGEM team
We taught them our knowledge from our experience, such as how to construct their project and to edit the wiki homepage, which is important in order to manage their iGEM team.  Furthermore, we discussed our projects with each other and exchanged advices. By lecturing them, we attained some new viewpoints on our project, and thanks to this discussion, we got a new point of view about our own project. So, this study meeting was meaningful not only for Nagahama, but also for ourselves.
Editing wiki
Even if you have done some experiments and got a positive result, this does not make any sense, unless you express the results to the world. However, the way to express your achievements in iGEM is quite unique and difficult for a green hand. In order to express our achievements in iGEM, we have to make our own homepage. Therefore, we helped making the most basic wiki design frames for Nagahama. We understood what they wanted to edit, and showed them the methods. We also left some comments of the method to edit the page in their source. Thus, we helped the establishments and developments of a new team. Throughout this activity, we contributed to spreading Synthesis Biology.
We helped a newly established team, Biwako Nagahama!!

We had a meeting with National University of Colombia in Colombia via Skype. We had received a request from the university for collaboration in outreach through our official twitter account. They were investigating how inexpensive and easy iGEM procedures can be done. They hoped to collect comparable data from other universities around the world. We responded to their questionnaires. We asked for their inputs in return. They answered our survey of genetic engineering.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Edinburgh trip_-_-_TEXT.html," day in Edinburgh began with breakfast provided by Pollock Hall, this was just a basic English/Scottish breakfast. Morgan went to the instructor's hotel to practice her presentation. We all checked out of the hotel before getting a taxi back to Edinburgh University. The day of presentations began - Chris French gave an overview of BioBricks, Morgan Taschuk gave an insightful view into her experiences on the Newcastle team in 2008, and Bruce Logan gave a talk on Microbial Fuel Cells. Coffee was again provided.
Lunch and a short walk outside came before a mixed team activities on the social and ethical aspects of synthtic biology by Emma Frow and Jane Calvert. Finally it was time for each UK team that was in attendace to give a short presentation about their hopeful project for the summer. Newcastle were the fourth team to talk, and Jess and Mathew did us proud.
The students ended the trip with a little bit of sightseeing in the afternoon, going to places such as Edinburgh Castle (see pictures below), before heading to Edinburgh train station to catch the 5:30 train back to Newcastle. This train was more crowded, and we were split up into two coaches. We arrived back in Newcastle and went our separate ways at around 7 in the evening.
The team appeared to enjoy the trip, and found it to be a useful experience.

Inoculation of 7/20 Transformtion
Lots of colonies were present, 6 colonies were picked and inoculated with 5 mL LB broth and 5uL 1000X kanamycin.
Inclusion Body Purification of Honeybee Protein
Determine wet wet weight of cell pellet after spinning liquid culter at 10000 x g for 10 min.
1.25 g
Resuspend in 5 ml/g Bug Buster (1x) by pipetting and gently vortexing.
This is 6.25 ml in our case
Put on shaker or rotating mixer for 15 min at RT
Took our first fraction at this point of the full cell lysate (F1)
Centrifuge 16000 g 20 min at 4 degrees C
Took next fraction at this point of the supernatant, labeled (S1)
Resuspend pellet in same volume of 1X bugbuster as before
6.25 ml
Pipette up and down and vortex gently to get an even suspension.
Took third fraction at this point (F2)
I did not go to great lengths to get an even  suspension here, but I noticed in retrospect that the protocol emphasized the importance of this in order to get pure inclusion bodies.
Add dry lysozyme to final concentration of 200 ug / ml
For 6.25 ml solution I added around 1.25 mg of lysozyme
Added 1 ul of DNAse to remove chromosomal DNA.
Add 6 volumes of 1:10 diluted bugbuster (.1X)
At this point we split the solution up into two 50 ml falcon tubes and added 18.75 ml of .1X bugbuster to each tube
Centrifuge 16000g 15 min. 4 degrees C to collect inclusion bodies.
Remove supernatant w/ pipette, take next fraction (S3)

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Interlab form_-_-_TEXT.html," number or rate of measurements taken with this instrument and protocol?
BioLector: With the used protocol 48 samples can be measured within short intervals of time, however, 3 of these should be used as control. So when measuring triplicates it is possible to measure 15 different strains in the protocol used for the interlab study. Analysing such a plate takes approximately 12 hours.
 
Section III: Measured Quantities
For each type of quantity measured, report on the following:
What are the units of the measurement?
All measurements are in arbitrary units in both the BioLector and the FACSCalibur.
 
What is the equivalent unit expressed as a combination of the seven SI base units?
Not applicable due to arbitrary units.
 
 
Precision:
What is the range of possible measured values for this quantity, using your instrument as configured for these measurements?
According to the manufacturer, the BioLector has a linear range for OD600 from 0.2 to 600.
 
What are the significant figures for these measurements?
We have fitted a mixed model with promoters as a fixed effect and replicates as a random effect. This model gave a residual standard deviation on fluorescence/OD of 0.040. With this result we can say that a single fluorescence/OD measurement is no more precise than the measured value ± 0.040.
 
Is the precision the same across the entire range? If not, how does it differ?
We have no data to determine if the precision differ through the entire range.
 
 
Accuracy:
When was the instrument last calibrated?
The machine “self-calibrate” before every cycle, meaning the BioLector sensor/probe returns to the original position and measure a fixed known light intensity. It is approximately 5 years old but the filters have been changed 3 years ago.
 
How was the instrument calibrated?
The machine “self-calibrate” before every cycle, meaning the BioLector sensor/probe returns to the original position and measure a fixed known light intensity.

Protein Expression
All work was performed within a sterile field created by a bunsen burner flame.
Cell Culture
Inoculate a single colony from an agar plate containing transformed cells in a 10 mL starter culture with appropriate antibiotic selection marker.
Let the seed culture grow overnight at 37 °C with 180 rpm rotation.
Measure the OD600 to confirm growth (an OD600 of around 2 is to be expected).
Prepare 1L of media with the required antibiotics.
Inoculate the media with 10 mL of the seed culture (1:100 ratio).
Let the culture grow until an OD600 of 0.5.
When the required OD is reached, put the culture on ice for 30 minutes.
After the 30 minutes, induce the expression of the protein by adding 1M IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM and 20% arabinose to a final concentration 0.2% arabinose.
Grow the cells for 16 hours ot 18 °C and 180rpm rotation.
Cell Harvest
Harvest the liquid culture by centrifugation at 5200g and 4 °C for 15 minutes.
Discard the supernatant and weigh the pellet. Resuspend the pellet with 6mL PBS/g cells.
Centrifuge the cells 15 minutes at 5200 g and 4 °C, and again discard supernatant.
The cells are now directly passed off to downstream processing.
Protein Purification dxCas9
This protocol describes the optimized downstream processing of dxCas9.
Cell Lysis
Retrieve a washed cell pellet from upstream processing according to the protein expression protocol.
NOTE: All following steps in this purification protocol are done at 4 °C.
Resuspend the pellet in lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCL, 250mM NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 1mM DTT, 5mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and one protease inhibitor tablet per 50mL lysis buffer. Make sure pellet is fully resuspended.
Lyse the cells using a high-pressure homogenizer (French Press) (2 rounds at 1 kbar).
Clarification
Clarify the lysate via centrifugation for 45 min at 16,000 g.
NOTE: The dxCas9 is now dissolved in the supernatant and the pellet contains cell debris.

These materials also allow limbs to be made to look more lifelike and natural. As you can see there is a precedent for technologies that are primarily rooted in space exploration, impacting people back on earth.
Other Tangible Benefits of Investing in the Space Industry
The prospect of space travel has been inspiring future generations since the first man, Neil Armstrong, set foot on the moon. A study shows that the number of students who pursue a more technical education has increased since the Apollo program was first launched in 1961. This number continued to escalate until Apollo 17, the last manned mission to the moon, where a sudden drop in PhDs was observed. A 2009 survey was conducted which revealed that 89 per cent of the respondents of the younger generation were inspired by space exploration to further a career in the STEM fields.
Space exploration has also widened our economic sphere. Entrepreneurs have moved passed Earth and set their sights outside of our known atmosphere. With the discovery of many invaluable resources on asteroids, and planetary satellites, humans have been searching for ways to expand their reach across the stars. These investments have enhanced our skills in troubleshooting, flexibility, and other aspects in daily life. The ability to work in a highly stressed environment has heightened our workplace environment here on Earth. Space exploration is becoming more and more relevant with each passing discovery. Both directly and indirectly, humans have largely benefitted from the developments of the space industry.
Perchlorate Contamination on Earth
Our inclusion of the Histidine tag on our synthetic G-Blocks was partly inspired by the success of various space technologies in bringing innovation and applicable solutions to issues on Earth. Like the technologies described above, our team wanted our project to not only address the issue of perchlorate in martian soil, but address possible challenges on Earth. So, with a little digging, we found that perchlorate ions have recently been identified as a localized  contaminant in ground and surface waters (Jarabek et al. 2002). Ironically, rocket fuel, as well as missile and firework production, are probable sources of this perchlorate contamination. With this in mind, our team concluded that our synthesized enzyme could be a potential solution to this emerging environmental issue. In fact, a paper written by Edward Todd Urbansky, in 2002, cites that biodegradation of perchlorate, that is by microorganisms, is a likely solution to combating contamination. This knowledge gave us much confidence towards using our Cld enzyme in regards to  this application.

What is Saccharomyces cerevisiae ?
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-celled microorganism commonly known as the brewer's yeast. This yeast is a facultative anaerobe which means that it has both the ability to grow using oxygen via cellular respiration as well as to undergo fermentation in the absence of oxygen.1
What is adrenaline ?
Adrenaline is a hormone secreted by the medulla of the adrenal glands. Its production is increased in response to fear and stress in order to prepare the body to react promptly. It causes a raise in blood pressure, vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, bronchodilation and pupil dilation. 2
What are the uses of yeast ?
S.cerevisiae is the Brewer’s yeast!
Indeed, it is the principal microorganism
responsible for the fermentation process
during brewing. It is also used in baking to
leaven bread, in winemaking to ferment the
beverage and in various scientific
research as a model.1, 3
What is the use of adrenaline ?
Adrenaline
is used as an
emergency treatment
during life-threatening
anaphylactic reactions
and  cardiac arrest. It
may also be used
to control minor
bleeding and
asthma.4
So, what's the problem ?
Beers are doing just fine. However, the current chemical manufacturing processes to produce adrenaline struggle to keep up with the demand, often leading to shortages of potentially life-saving medicine5. In addition, the chemical synthesis of adrenaline involves the use of toxic and dangerous substances6.
Our Solution
The union of yeast and the adrenaline enzymatic machinery.
We intend to use S. cerevisiae to produce adrenaline that can be purified and stored.
Bonus !
As the enzymatic pathway also produces metabolic intermediates of biomedical interest, we intend to create three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing dopamine, noradrenaline or adrenaline2.
Our approach
We designed a two-plasmid system which harbors synthetic human cDNAs encoding the adrenaline enzymatic pathway. We explored how the insertion of this plasmid system into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain engineered to overproduce L-tyrosine can be used for the biosynthesis of adrenaline7. The metabolic intermediates will be produced"

Providing the definition.- Our strategy reached its objective
As mentioned before, our main goal was to provide people with a “practical definition” of synthetic biology which is oriented towards the concept of engineering biological systems. As can be seen in Figure 1, when comparing personal definitions of synthetic biology before and after the talk given to students, nearly the half of the students surveyed (~42%) oriented their definitions towards the concept of biological engineering. This involves the use of interchangeable parts, design and construction of biological systems as opposed to artificial life per se, mixing engineering with biology and the pursue of a goal or benefit. Figure 2 shows all the definition categories for students before the talk. Although many people remained with the concept of genetic modification once the talk was given, this result suggests that the goal of providing the definition was accomplished.
Public Opinion
Several aspects concerning public opinion about the topic were addressed. These include a) to obtain an estimate of people supporting SB after attending the talk by schools(Figure 3), b) to evaluate the belief of engineering biology in the present day (Figure 4), c) meet people's opinion about what positive and negative consequences are brought about by the advance of SB as a technology (Figures 5 and 6), and d) to estimate how many years people expect to pass before SB changes our lives (Figure 7). In a general sense, the results suggest that the high school students are strongly supportive towards the development of synthetic biology, and the number of individuals that initially didn't believe in engineering organisms contrasts with the amount of students believing in the possibility of engineering organisms now. Figure 3 and 11, column 5 (La Salle León School) show a bigger proportion of  disapproval towards SB. While the reason for this remains to be elucidated, a possible factor could be the religious orientation of the institution. No significant orientation in negative comments was detected for this school.
With respect to positive and negative comments, it is important to notice that negative opinions were considerably less than positive ones (98 compared to 313), so in order to avoid any biases in future surveys of this kind, more emphasis on possible problematics has to be done. Unfortunately, different time assignment from an institution to another made it difficult to organize debates addressing positive as well as negative consequences.

Proof of Concept
1. Demonstration of AI-2 Controllers in real world
1.1 Manipulation of 'responcer cell' in co-cultures
In Proof of Concept page, experiment results showed that two AI-2 Response Devices could respond to different AI-2 concentration by emitting different intensity of GFP fluorescence. We managed to 'shut off or 'turn on' the expression of GFP in AI-2 Response Device A.
Results showed that a 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 Suppliers could significantly enhance AI-2-inducible GFP fluorescence compared to the control group (Fig. 1). Fluorescence microscopy images of the cells at 8 h in co-culture also illustrated that in the group which AI-2 Response Device A was co-cultured with pLuxS, the GFP fluorescence intensity is significantly higher than control group (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2: Fluorescence microscopy images of Device A cells co-cultured with pLuxS at 8 h
Also, 1:1 mixture of AI-2 Response Device with AI-2 Consumers could significantly depress AI-2-inducible GFP fluorescence compared to the control group (Fig. 3), as expected. Fluorescence microscopy images of the cells at 8 h in co-culture also illustrated that in the group which AI-2 Response Device A was co-cultured with pLsrACDB or pLsrACDBFG, the GFP fluorescence intensity is lower than control group (Fig. 4).

1.2 Manipulation of biofilm formation
While this methodology provides a tool to regulate synthetic systems, it may also serve as a modifier of natural processes such as antibiotic susceptibility, motility, and biofilm formation. It has been shown that AI-2 has a contributing effect on biofilm formation in E. coli. Therefore, we investigated if AI-2 Consumers and AI-"

You can click on the next image to see a table of our reactions with their kinetics.
* The equations are numbered like this because those we  had initially defined evolved into this final list throughout the  summer. We didn't want to change all references made to these equations  so we just adjusted the numbering.
Ordinary Differential Equations
We are taking into account the following set of ODEs, based on the biochemical reactions above. This set  accurately and completely describes our model. Please click on the image to see a higher resolution.
Assumptions of the model
Once there is nickel in the medium, RcnR no longer participates in the pump’s regulation. If there’s nickel in the medium, we can assume that RcnR is always  coupled with a Ni molecule, so it will not be capable of repressing  RcnA (The few RcnR molecules in the cell will cause noise, but this  will be indistinguishable from the pump’s normal behavior).1
Cell membrane permeability to AHL is not considered inside the model. The model assumes all AHL enters the cell, however the concentration  needed in the model to obtain the desired results is changed by us  accordingly. 2
All decrease in AHL concentration is due to AiiA. We consider the natural degradation of AHL to be unimportant given the  time taken to make the analysis (AHL half-life is long, from 3 to 24  hours). 3
The change in the transcription of cI* is dependent only on AHL concentration. There’s a basal production of cI*, however the change will always be  due to the AHL concentration given that production of LuxR is  constitutive.
It is a homogeneous system. This means that the coefficients of the equations are constant (so we don’t have compartmentalization).
The quantity of nickel used by the cell is negligible compared to the concentrations"

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#pttest_-_-_TEXT.html," they would take the advice of their doctor on this. This reinforced to us the importance of nurses and doctors backing our project idea. However, encouragingly, of those who wouldn't take the advice of their doctor, our treatment was favourite with just under half saying they would prefer the designed bacteria (48%), compared to 40% who would prefer antibiotics.
We had very similar feedback when we spoke to patients. During a visit to the Bedford Ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital, we spoke with one of the catheterised patients there called Mavis. She admitted to having had UTIs in the past, but said she had not contracted a UTI since having a catheter fitted. We found that patients like Mavis could end up using the same catheter for up to 10 weeks. This enforced the importance of being able to keep our bacteria alive for a sustained period of time. When we asked her about treating infection with bacteria, she said she would be happy to, if it had been recommended to her by a doctor. She said, in her view, it is not dissimilar to using antibiotics.
Return to nurses
During this visit we were able to talk to Laura Evans again, this time to ask questions specifically about our project.
Our project involves designing a catheter that prevents the formation of a biofilm on its surface. What do you think of this idea?
A catheter like that would be useful, but it depends on how long your catheter would work for. Patients can have a single catheter fitted for 3 months or longer. Catheters are also removed for other reasons, for example if they become blocked. Catheter blockage is a common issue for patients suffering from UTIs.
Both Laura’s and Mavis’ response regarding how long a catheter remains in place inspired us to research how we could keep our Solution bacteria alive, the results of which can be found in design. Jan Harris, Churchill Hospital, raised the issue that our solution does not tackle intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) and community UTIs. Jan made the point that UTIs are not just contracted through catheterisation, and it is important for us to also consider community based UTIs. IBCs and community UTIs are complex issues to solve but we have explored the potential of commensal bacteria as a treatment approach (See Commensal Bacteria ).

Integrated Human Practices
Systematizing Feedback Assimilation and Integration for Synthetic Biology Projects
Short Description
The flagship of our Human Practices efforts this year is the development of the OSIRIS (Optimized Societal Impact & Risk Integration System) Protocol; a methodology to efficiently receive and quantitatively integrate feedback into any synthetic biology project.
Mainspring of our endeavor
Any project, any initiative, however structured and well designed, will require feedback and through its fruition, adjustments will be made. Our team, upon deciding on its project and planning the basic steps to follow, had to try and find the most relevant researchers and professors in the field. Its purpose, of course, was to consider their opinions and utilize them to tweak various parts of our project accordingly. Despite our efforts, we could not pinpoint someone in Greece that was an expert regarding our topic, thus we had to extend our reach worldwide. While trying to get in touch with researchers from all over the world and participating in the 4th Systems and Synthetic Biology Summer School, we thought of decomposing the whole process that we've been through, in short, individual steps. We, then, had the idea to search vast-scale opinion taking from people of interest in world-wide range. We stumbled upon Societal Risk Evaluation Scheme (SRES), developed by Cummings & Kuzma et al., 2017 [ 1 ], that identifies and evaluates risks regarding Synthetic Biology projects. As it did not perfectly fit our case, we decided to modify specific parts of it, so that if will not only find possible risks regarding our project, but will also aid us in finding ways to mitigate them. However, as it requires experts to provide their feedback on various concerns, we fed it with the results of our primary eSWOT Analysis and different versions of Stakeholder Maps. Combining all those steps, the creation of OSIRIS became a reality. For an analytical, step-by-step explanation of the protocol, click here .

Rice is a low-cost, high-productivity, high-safety and commonly used model plant
Rice is easy to plant on a large scale and has very high yield
Rice seed is an excellent biomass container
Genetic modification technology is quite mature in rice
As a special nutrition storage organs,rice seed is convenient to store, extract and purify
Astaxanthin accumulation at seed would not interrupt the growth of the  whole plant
Genes responsible for carotenoid synthesis are inactive in rice endosperm. So it is impossibleo harvest astaxanthin from wild-type rice. Using multiple-gene metabolic engineering, we introduced the astaxanthin biosynthesis pathways which is specifically expressed in rice endosperm. Thus, possible negative effects of astaxanthin would not influence the growth of plants. In this way, rice endosperm serves as a special container for astaxanthin, which provides conveniences for storage and extraction.

PSY (phytoene synthase) catalyzes Geranylgeranyl-PP into Phytoene. The gene CrtI from Erwinia uredovora could finish the catalysis process from Phytoene to Lycopene. Therefore, when these two genes(PSY and CrtI) with specific promoters of endosperm ahead ,they will express CRTISO and β-LCY enzymes which synthesizeβ-Carotene to produce the famous Golden Rice. There are still two steps from β-Carotene to astaxanthin: BHY (β-carotenehy droxylase) catalyze β-Carotene to Zeaxanthin. And BKT catalyzes directly to synthesize the end product astaxnthin. The expression of  the endogenous gene BHY in rice is still unknown, accordingly it needs at least 3 genes (PSY+Crt I+BKT，BPC) or 4 genes(PSY+Crt I+BKT+BHY, BBPC) to synthesize astaxanthin. For the combination of three genes, if the endogenous gene BHY of rice has little expression, maybe there will be just a little astaxanthin produced(even nothing!). But for the combination of four genes, it will create a complete metabolic pathway for astax"

Such design process is a computation intensive work, so ABACUS may not be able to handle certain samples due to memory limitation. By then a notification will be sent to inform you of the failure.
BioCircuit
The design of robust and sensitive biological circuit are always bothering. To rationally design synthetic gene circuits with specific functions, we write BioCircuit. The plugin is an adpatation of the project BioBLESS developed by USTC-Software 2015, with the ability to design digital circuit, biological circuit as well as analyze the performance of them.
From a truth table to abstract logic circuits:
In Biocircuit, a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then “Create”. The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most cases is supposed to be a compli-cated multi-input circuit. Besides the function above, gates list will provide many Boolean gates, and users can drag them freely to our canvas to design logic circuits.
See the detailed structure of a designed gene circuit:
A simple click on “Gene network” button will lead you toanother tab where the detailed structure of your designed gene circuit is shown. When a gene circuit consists of many Boolean gates, it is crucial to understand the internal sub-stances and mechanisms. In this tab, you can see how substances react with each other clearly, such as inhibition and activation in or between Boolean gates.

Review - This could be quite important, could need to review after the research has been conducted to check if a patent is needed
3) Bioterrorism risks
Bioterrorism is a relatively new concern that could become a big problem if Synthetic Biology and other Biological Science research is used in the wrong way. Your device may have the potential to be made weaponizable and this is something that worries the public. This section deals with the potential of your device being harmful and what would happen if it were to be used for something other than its original purpose.
Identify – Could your device be weaponizable? Could your device have harmful effects? Can you identify any way that your device could be used in a negative way?
Control - How will you make sure that your device can't be used in a harmful manner? What precautions could you put in place to make sure that it can’t be used in that way?
Inform – How will you protect your device to make sure that it will not become weaponizable?
Review - This could be quite important, could need to review after the research has been conducted to think about whether the device could be used for other, harmful, purposes. What is the plan to make sure the device does not fall into the wrong hands?
4) Accidental release
A major worry of the public is that harmful bacteria, with modified genes, may be accidentally released into the environment if lab procedures are careless. However accidental release of genetically modified organisms is more likely to occur during their use in the field. The worry is that GMO’s could pass on their modified genes to wildtype organisms and create new lines of that particular species.
Identify - What problems could occur from your device being accidentally released?
Control - What measures need to be put in place to make sure that accidental release is minimised? What measures can you take to make accidental release doesn’t cause harm if it does occur?
Inform - How will you publicize that the organism is safe to use?
Review - After the project has been undertaken, did accidental release occur? When using the device in its field, what aspects have you considered to make it safe in case it is accidently released?
5) Testing
Some people share the view that testing on animals and humans is unethical and wrong. Your biodevice has to be tested in some way, but what experiments could you do that don’t involve testing on animals or humans. Some people believe that testing on humans is a little less unethical than testing on animals as humans have to give their consent to be tested upon, whereas animals have no choice and are often breed for that"

Outreach
Speaking to many of our industry experts, we learned that many of them knew very little about synthetic biology.  We designed a diverse outreach program to interface with our community.  We targeted a variety of audiences in fun and creative ways.

Human Practice
■Science Agora 2011
Science Agora , held at Tokyo Academic Park in November every year, is the largest science communication event in Japan. Participants are kids and parents, students, companies, researchers and so on. We took part in it with two other Japanese teams last year after the end of 2011 iGEM competition. In this big meeting, we exhibited posters that we used in World Jamboree and gave an account of iGEM and our project to not only specialists but also the public by using new posters. This was also good chance to explain synthetic biology to the public.
■Lecture at secondary school
On July 11, 2012, our team made a lecture at the career guidance to the 9th graders of Minamitama Metropolitan Secondary School. We described our project and activities of iGEM in the lecture and caught many interests about synthetic biology and iGEM from the future researchers.
In the one-hour lecture, we talked broadly about of our campus life and then focused on iGEM as an activity example. However, the students had no basic knowledge of synthetic biology. Therefore, began with catchy topics, used easy words besides technical terms and used more figures and illustrations besides long explanations to make the whole lecture more understandable. The reactions of the students were good. They paid good attention to our lecture and some were taking notes. The fact that iGEM is an international competition seemed to attracted their ambition.
Through this short time, we believe that we were able to make notice the 9th graders that there is a science field called “synthetic biology” and that there is an international competition for synthetic biology students. We gained many attention and interests of the becoming scientists to this field and iGEM.
■High school and university collaboration
In Tokyo Metropolitan University, collaboration activity with high school is frequently planned as a university's project. On July 11, 2012, the same day to a lecture in Minamitama Metropolitan Secondary School, it was held. We explained our project and activities of iGEM and caught many interests about synthetic biology.

I'm Xiong Yuxiu, a member of team NKU_CHINA and mainly contribute in experiment part. Being a biology-majoring sophomore, this is my first year taking part in iGEM. I LOVE challenges and iGEM gives me the chance to experience the thrills of trying different ideas in the field of synthetic biology by means of molecular biology and microbiology. The most exciting thing to me , is when results are not what we thought to be, and the team brainstorms to come up with possible explanations and new experimental designs. Being in iGEM team is my first time to complete a project from scratch and it feels awesome. This is the third year my school takes part in iGEM and not long ago our team had our own lab. We have every reason to believe that with experience accumulated, our iGEM team will be better with our joint efforts.

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Activities#SynBio_-_-_TEXT.html," were curious to know why we (not being a political organization) had set up our booth. Discussions about our project and synthetic biology started quickly and over the course of the day we had conversations with a wide range of people: from high-school students who wanted to study science after their graduation to emeritus professors and other scientists who used to work at our university. Of course biology-teachers from local schools were highly interested in our work but even families with young children asked questions about our progestin measurement system. In the late morning we were able to discuss up to half an hour with a single person. However, in the early afternoon, passersby rather wanted to take a look at the posters than have a conversation about synthetic biology.
All in all, our Synbio-Day was very well received. Especially scientists from University of Tuebingen’s science-campus were highly interested in our project and gave us lots of useful tips and pointed out ways to improve our measurement system.
Since SynBio-Day is a national event, other German iGEM-Teams have organized a booth or some other activity on that day. Team Bielefeld , Team Freiburg , and Team Marburg have written about their experiences in their Team-Wikis - have a look at their reports!

We checked the constructs by running  digest with X,P for MoClo level 0 and level 1,  then we ran gel to confirm.
The correct bands were then sequenced and they yielded the correct orientation and nucleotide order in the forward direction.
In terms of troubleshooting DVL2s, we decided to remake the pSB1A2 backbone from a glycerol stock of the biobrick of C0080  and digested it with X,P, in order to cut out the part.
And we are going to the iGEM Regionals at Pittsburgh!
October
Week 3
We are very excited to be back in the lab and work for the Worlds Jamboree!! :)
First, we are taking care of transferring the parts we submitted from pSB1A2 to pSB1C3.  We did this by digesting all the parts with E, S and pSB1C3 also. We ligated the digested parts and pSB1C3 and transformed.  However, none of them grew. We believe this is due to the low yield of Gel Extraction.
We also added fusion sites to R0040 using ligation PCR, we verified them on the gel and gel extracted it.
October
Week 4
We transformed a new set of Moclo Level 0 reactions , We got white colonies for the blue-white screening and we made cultures and ran a prep. However, when we digested them to confirm the sizes none of the parts showed the bands we were expecting.  We think this might be due to the amount of colonies we screened for each part, usually we have to screen four colonies per part and we just screened two.
Regarding the MoClo Level 1, we set up new reactions using the Promega buffer. Also, we doubled the volume of BsaI after we realized it was two times lower than predicted. We transformed them but we didn`t get any colonies.  We tried new reaction with a higher volume of Ligase and we are waiting for transformation to check them. Fingers crossed :)
Because the initial effort to convert the biobrick parts into the pSB1C3 backbone didn’t work, we tried the entire process again. However, as of Friday 10/26, we haven`t get to the point of transforming the ligations.
In the process of creating level 2 destination vectors, we already isolated the backbone"
Brown,2008,Team:Brown#Project#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," monitors changes in the current of the bacterial solution and outputs that change via a simple LED light signal (See the ""Application"" below for more details).  This novel electrical reporting system would enable any person with little or no knowledge of the machinery of the bio-sensor to utilize it effectively. Additionally, in comparison to a physical detection system, in which the number and surface area of the probes are fixed and limited, with a biological system, there are billions of bacteria, each with the ability to sense.
Economically feasible
E. coli bacteria, which provide the main machinery of the bio-sensor, are inexpensive to obtain, grow, and store. Additionally, after consultation with mechanical engineers, we discovered that the circuit required for our proposed system would be simple to create and inexpensive to produce, in the range of a few dollars.
Application
The proposed biosensor
Current Water Contamination Machinery
The proposed prototype for Team Toxipop's biosensor is pictured on above on the left.  It would be inexpensive to produce, portable, and user-friendly compared to a current water detection system, as pictured above on the right.
The Toxipop biosensor consists of a small box with a compartment containing lyophilized E.coli bacterial cells, engineered with the lysis cassette under the control of a specific toxin-inducible promoter.  Two graphite electrical probes are fixed on either side of this compartment (white arrows) which detect relative changes in current and feed that information to a small circuit board within the sensor.  This circuit board, receiving a constant voltage from a battery source, will compute relative changes in resistance (or conductance) and will report that information via an LED light signal.
The following protocol could be proposed for the Toxipop system:
Re-constitute lyohphilized cells with cell growth media.
Apply a few drops of the water sample with potential toxin into specified compartment.
Allow cells to to sit for approximately two hours.  The white light will remain on during this time.  Once the amount of time required for lysis has passed, either the red light will switch on, indicating the presence of the toxin, or the green light will switch on, indicating that no or very little of the toxin is present in the given water sample.
This physical biosensor is a possibility for the future with the novel electrical reporting system designed by Team Toxipop this summer.
Other Applications
After some brainstorming, the team came up with some other possible applications for our electrical reporting system and our auto-lysis cassette:
The electrical reporting system could provide a new and accurate means of measuring degree of protein"

Point 1: Defining the Scope of Implementation for Our Project
Rationale
This was our initial point of ideation . After several brainstorming sessions and team consensus, we thought that tackling innovation within the biofuels industry would be the most interesting and most realistic problem to solve given our constraint in time and resources. In order to learn more, we decided to reach out to Frank Fields, part of the California Algal Biotechnology Lab at UC San Diego. Established in part by a national initiative to further biofuel research across the United States, this particular lab's interests include expression of therapeutic proteins in algae and the structure of the chloroplast ribosome .
Exploration
Frank helped us focus on some of the most relevant challenges in biofuel production, including:
Producing on a scale large enough to actually contribute to energy needs
Operational costs - this arose primarily from two issues:
Lack of complete feedstock utilization made it an inefficient process
These settings were often susceptible to bacterial contamination
This lead to use of expensive antibiotics and eventual microbial resistance
Achieving price parity with fossil fuels
Frank also cautioned us about this last concern in biofuel production, noting that the PI of the lab, Dr. Stephen Mayfield, had started several relevant companies in the biofuel industry, including Solazyme and Sapphire Energy. He mentioned that one of the biggest reasons that recent interest in biofuel had dipped was that the renewable energy has heavily struggled to achieve economic parity with oil prices . Because the government agencies refrained from"

SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Drake_-_-_TEXT.html," compared with other gene in the operon, which may indicate that the livJ plays a crucial role in metabolism of E.coli, which is consistent with the references that livJ is the most sensitive gene to lrp regulation in the operon. What’s more, we interestingly find that all expression levels of six genes are reduced generally in the same sequence of their position in operon, which might shed light on the fact that the stability of RNA of those genes in the operon is determined by coding sequence. Definitely, we can’t neglect the role of UTR (untranslated region) of liv operon played in regulation of stability of RNA in wild type of E.coli. However, as we have mentioned before, all these genes’ coding sequence starting from ATG to TAA are cloned to the overexpression vectors, in another word, the only discrepancy of overexpression vectors is the coding sequence and 5’ UTR & 3’UTR are all the same because of identical promoter, RBS and terminator. What’s more, not only the BL21(DE3) shows this kind of tendency that the expression level of six gene decrease in order, but the DH5a shows the tendency as well. Thus, we have sufficient evidence to support our belief that the determinant of stability of gene’s RNA includes in ORF (open reading frame).
After ensuring that the gene can be overexpressed in E.coli, we go on to examine the function of these genes. Although there are service in company to test the amount of amino acid in liquid sample, we incline to finish our project by ourselves as much as possible. We choose spectrophotometer to observe function of genes. In order to ensure the amount of leucine can be detected by spectrophotometer, we artificially increase the concentration of leucine in liquid LB to about 1 g/L. Thus, the spectrophotometer can detect the alternation of concentration of leucine after incubation for more than 24 hours with engineered E. coli.
First of all, we established a standard method to dispose the LB medium in this project so that all the data can be comparable. The results of spectrophotometer indicate that all six genes can deduce the concentration of leucine in liquid medium, albeit in different level. However, the results are not very convincing since the background of amino acid in LB medium can disturb the measurement profoundly. Then, we try to utilize the inorganic medium, M9 medium, to inoculate the engineered E.coli and the medium is artificially laced with additionally leucine"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," and the third well is the concentrated supernatant.
As shown in the image above, we also explored the appropriate temperature for SAHS protein expression. As we expected, protein expression was be more efficient at 30 °C. However, we did not find the SAHS protein band in the supernatant even when it was concentrated by ultrafiltration. So we speculated that cell wall obstructed the secretion of protein on the basis of 2016 Peking University's working. See more information on Come form wiki .
Therefore, we have to design a new protein purification program. To get enough protein produces for the following experiment, the gene was cloned into the vector pET-28a with high expression lever combined with E.coli BL21. Besides, Two HIS-TAGs on the end of N-and C-terminal was produced and allow SAHS protein to bind with Nickel column (like Ni-NTA) for purification. Meanwhile, we purified the sample with heat water bath considering the characterization of heat stability by following the reference.
Figure 3. The picture on the left is a series of temperature gradient processed protein samples. The number represents the temperature (°C). And the picture on the right is the gel map of our final purified high purity SAHS protein.
So, we designed a set of temperature gradients from 70°C to 90°C, to explore the appropriate condition. What's more, we chose the 85°C for 15 min finally for large scale purification. But given that there were many other protein bands, we combined heating with Nickel column for producing high quality protein. Finally, we tested two patterns, heating-Ni-NTA and Ni-NTA-heating, and found that the later one is better.
After that, we obtained a protein sample with high concentration and purity by using this protein purification method（Figure 3）.
Verify the role of SAHS protein in preserving biological activity
In order to verify the preservation effect of SAHS protein, we used the lyophilization method. First, we tested the concentration of purified SAHS protein, which ranged from 0.3 g/L to 0.6 g/L. Then, we concentrated the purified protein to control the protein concentration to about 1 g/L.
We selected Taq enzyme as the protein preserved in our experiment, using SAHS protein as protective agent, and set a series of concentration gradients: 1 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 0.1 g/L, 0.01 g/L and 0 g/L， then stored with lyophilization. In order to verify the"

Figure 8: System Error presented as a histogram with bin size=0.1
The system seems to be very robust as the error is very low for almost all                     parameter values. To characterize our last parameters all we needed to do                     was, find the kon, koff and dT set with the aforementioned experimental                     errors and also with the corresponding transcription rate. Though, in order                     for the characterization to be valid we needed more data about sfGFP                     concentration from experiments. Using only the system error we could find many sets that were producing it. For different parameter sets, sfGFP                     expression was different too. With an extra scan for bigger values of kd,                     we found the same errors for very big amount of expressed sfGFP (Fig. 1).                     Finally, we decided to keep the small kd because of the strong repression                     that TALE does.

TALE tuning with IPTG-LacI
For the tuning of the final concentration of sfGFP, the system was studied                     when LacI was placed after the sfGFP promoter on the same plasmid,                     repressed by TALE. Our system is stabilized for specific binding                     characteristics of the TALE with the sfGFP promoter as discussed above.
When LacI binds to an operator site of the promoter of sfGFP, we have gene                     expression even if a repressor is bound to the promoter too. The ideal case                     with the incorporation of LacI would be to regulate the final amount of                     sfGFP in each copy number at a small deviation around it ‘s final                     concentration .
Although, when LacI binds to the promoter, it appears to reduce the                     possibility of TALE to also bind, due to steric interactions between the                     two, thus making the system’s behaviour undesirable.
Τhe competition mechanism between TALE and LacI on the binding sites of                     sfGFP’s promoter P can be described as the following diagram:
We will analyze the mechanism, in which, two ligands occupy different sites                     of the promoter and assume that both interact due to electrostatic                     interaction. Because their binding sites are close enough, we assume that                     due to the size of LacI, Repressor TALE will display weak DNA binding when                     it is to bind in the presence of LacI, increasing the dissociation constant                    "

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," for incompressible fluids is the following one:
\[\rho \left( {\frac{{\partial {\bf{V}}}}{{\partial t}} + {\bf{V}} \cdot \nabla {\bf{V}}} \right) =  - \nabla p + \rho {\bf{g}} + \mu {\nabla ^2}{\bf{V}}\]
These equations generally hold for incompressible Newtonian fluids. In the case of fecal matter, we consider the fluid to be Newtonian as it is composed mainly of liquid water (close to 90%) while inside the caecum and ascending colon and because the relationship between the viscous stresses and the local strain rate is linear.
Once we know the velocity field V as well as the pressure p in every spatial point of our geometry, we can determine the stress tensor, which in mathematical terms stands as follows:
\[{\bf{\sigma }} =  - p{\bf{I}} + \eta [\nabla {\bf{V}} + {(\nabla {\bf{V}})^T}]\]
From the stress tensor one could determine the values of two other important fluid mechanical quantities, the hydrodynamic force and the hydrodynamic torque, which are expressed mathematically as follows:
Hydrodynamic Force: \(F(t) = \iint\limits_S({{\bf{\sigma }} \cdot {\bf{n}}}) dS\)
Hydrodynamic Torque: $$L(t) = \iint {{\bf{x}} \times ({\bf{\sigma }} \cdot {\bf{n}})dS}$$
These two integrals are calculated on the surface S and x stands for the positions on that surface.
We should refer to a common dimensionless group in fluid dynamics that we used in our model. The ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces, Reynold's number (Re), is one of the most important dimensionless groups in fluid dynamics. The mathematical representation of Re is the following one:
\[{\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits}  = \frac{{\rho Vl}}{\mu }\]
where ρ is the fluid density, V the fluid velocity, l the characteristic length (characteristic area in 3D objects) and μ the dynamic viscosity. The Reynold's number could be used as an indicator in order to determine whether a specific kind of fluid motion is laminar or turbulent of even transitional. In our case, the Reynold's number has a very low value equal to 0.00003"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#translational system#translation mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html," non canonical amino acids. Scores resulting from the synthetase-test system . The negative score results from the emission quotient CFP(475 nm)/YFP(525 nm) when cultivated without the specific ncAA. The positive score results from the emission quotient YFP(525 nm)/CFP(475 nm) when cultivated with the specific ncAA. The mean rank allows the combination of the negative and the positive score to compare the efficiency of synthetases among each other.
As shown in Figure 4, the efficiency of the different synthetases to incorporate their specific ncAA vary significantly, and thus not all are not completely specific. This lead to the conclusion, that the applied aaRS also incorporates endogenous amino acids. In addition to the lacking specificity, the characterization of various tRNA/aaRS requires much effort, making it inapplicable for a higher throughput.
To receive a fully specific aaRS, a selection system should be used to select the most specific amino acyl synthetase from  a library containing numerous different aaRS variants. After the selection for the specificity of the aaRS, it can be analyzed for their efficiency with our improved Measurement Kit. With our improved system, we generated 27,672 different sequence variants, containing tyrosyl tRNA‑synthetase library , based on the vector pSB1C3.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which"

Step 1: Starting Sample Preparation
This protocol will result in CFU/mL for 0.1 OD600. Our overnight cultures will have a much higher OD600 and so this section of the protocol, called ""Starting Sample Preparation"", will give us the ""Starting Sample"" with a 0.1                       OD600                       measurement.
Measure the OD600 of the cell cultures, making sure to dilute to the linear detection range of the plate reader. In our case, the range is between 0.097 and 0.239. Include blank media (LB + Cam) as well.
For an overnight culture (16-18 hours of growth), we recommend diluting the cultures 1:8 (8-fold dilution) in LB + Cam before measuring the OD600.
Preparation: Add 25 μL culture to 175 μL LB + Cam in a well in a black 96-well plate, with a clear, flat bottom. Recommended plate setup is below. Each well should have 200 μL.
The scheme is the                             following:
A1 - A2: Positive Controls (cultures 1-2)
B1 - B2: Negative Controls (cultures 3-4)
C1 - C2: Blank media - 200 μL of LB + Cam (in duplicate)
Dilute your overnight culture to OD600 = 0.1 in 1mL of LB + Cam media. Do this in triplicate for each culture.
Use (C1)(V1) = (C2)(V2) to calculate the dilutions, where:
C1 is your starting OD600 C2 is the target OD600 of 0.1
V1 is the unknown volume in μL
V2 is the final volume of 1000 μL
Important: When calculating C1, subtract the blank from the reading and multiple by the dilution factor used.
Check the OD600 and make sure it is 0.1 (minus the blank measurement). The scheme is the following:
A1 - A2: Positive Controls (cultures 1-2)
B1 - B2: Negative Controls (cultures 3-4)
C1 - C2: Blank media - 200 μL of LB + Cam (in duplicate)

We participated with Oxford iGEM via skype calls, where we shared some of our most frequently asked questions from public outreach and saw that the question of how to keep genetically engineered bacteria contained from public release was a consistent question for both projects.
In addition, we shared with them our solution to this problem: 0.2 micron membrane filters from Sterlitech which can be used to make bacteria ""pills"". We also shared with them our user-friendly generator for markdown versions of the Wiki, in order for their team to more easily edit their Wiki content.

2. OGEM - Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine
OGEM is a consortium of iGEM teams from across Ontario. We met at different campuses over the summer term (at University of Toronto and Queen's University) to discuss how progress was moving along for all of the teams, and most importantly, to discuss any issues or roadblocks the other teams could help with. This lead to collaboration specifically with Waterloo iGEM.
3. Waterloo iGEM
Our partnership with Waterloo iGEM involved bringing copies of their surveys on the public perception of gene editing and genetically modified organisms to Toronto and Alberta, in order to broaden the scope of their research. Their research results also similarly aid our team in gaging what level of knowledge the public tend to have regarding issues such as GMO release, which is useful knowledge for the public outreach of our project.

The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the equation, Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of enzymes’ substrates, Km is the Michaellis constant of enzymes, [I] is the concentration of inhibitors, KI is the inhibition constant towards enzymes DszC brought by HBP, and   shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
Because substrate S has inhibition effect on DszC enzymes, we modify the model into:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Taking astringency into consideration, using MATLAB for models and experimental data fitting will be infeasible, so we choose graphical method to obtain K1 and  .
First we use double-reciprocal plot to analyze the 1/S changes over 1/v:
①The slope of double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
②The intercept of 1/v –axis in the double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
The intercept of I-axis is -αKI.
Based on models above, the value of KI,αparameters are derived.

Hypothesis:
2.3 Modeling Part
1).Suppose the two intermediates--DBTO2 and HBPS—are only present in cytoplasm.
2).The inhibition to DszA, DszB and DszC of HBP is considered, while the inhibitory effect of HBPS on DszC which is mainly exists in the early stages of BDS is neglected, with the purpose of simplifying our modeling.
3).The DszD’s activity is considered non-inhibited, therefore we took the enzyme out of our modeling.
4).The loss of biological catalytic activity without the effects of HBP is considered.
5).Assume that the concentrations of DBT and HBP stay the same in all the three different phrases as the stirring rate"

Experiments on this model have shown that A1 reactive astrocytes lose almost all functions displayed by resting astrocytes. A1 reactive astrocytes have very low ability to create synapses, can not perform phagocytosis, and do not induce neuronal rehabilitation or growth.
Single cell data has shown that the complement component C3 is a preferred reactive astrocytes marker to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). C3 is specific to A1 reactive astrocytes, over A2 reactive astrocytes and resting astrocytes3.

The proportion of activated bacteria in the population as a function of time averaged over 10 runs for Δ → 0.
As expected, the proportion of activated bacteria where proteins are packaged into vesicles is consistently and significantly higher even for n=2 unpackaged proteins.
'Switches stay shut indefinitely'
The graph below shows the proportion of activated bacteria in the population as a function of time averaged over 10 runs for Δ → ∞.  In this limit it is not necessary for all n proteins to arrive simultaneously to active a bacterium. However, the results suggest that if the series switch consists of more than about n=4 toggle switches, it is more effective to deliver the proteins bundled in a vesicle.

KILL SWITCH MECHANISM:
 
For our kill switch system, we used a sense-antisense RNA mechanism under an IPTG inducible circuit. MazF which is a non-specific ribonuclease coding gene is used as killing agent against Bacillus subtilis. In our system, MazF is produced constitutively under Pveg promoter. Also the same Pveg promoter is responsible for constitutive LacI production. Anti MazF is an antisense RNA producing sequence which is reverse complement to first bases of MazF and its RBS sequence. Its production is regulated by pHyperspank promoter which is inhibited by LacI and reactivated by IPTG.
According to this kill switch mechanism, in a medium where there is no IPTG, LacI will bind to pHyperspank promoter and inhibit its work. By this way, Anti MazF antisense RNA cannot be produced. Therefore, MazF production will not be inhibited and it will kill bacteria. On the other hand, if there is IPTG in medium, it will bind to LacI and prevent inhibition of pHyperspank by LacI. As a result, Anti MazF system will work and an antisense RNA will be produced. Since this antisense RNA sequence will be reverse complement of mRNA produced from MazF gene, it will bind to this mRNA and prevent the protein expression. In this situation, though both Anti MazF and MazF mRNA’s will be produced, there will be no MazF protein expression and so bacteria will not die.
 
Characterization of kill switch mechanism:
 
To see if this kill switch system, and so Anti MazF, is working or not we performed transformation experiments with whole kill switch construct and spreaded on media which contain IPTG and without IPTG. Briefly, MazF construct (K1197006) and Anti MazF construct (K1197001) were assembled in pSB1C3 in E.coli. Then, this construct were amplified and inserted into B.subtilis vector, K823023. Then, this vector was linearized and transformed by"

Collaboration with University of Colorado - Boulder
Collaboration is a fundamental need within the scientific community; thus, the Colorado State University and Colorado University at Boulder iGEM teams have collaborated to enhance and support each other’s work.
We tested a part constructed and submitted by the University of Colorado - Boulder . This part, M13ori (for M13 origin of replication) is a non-coding segment of DNA that acts as a packaging signal for M13 phage. Its inclusion onto a plasmid allows for the plasmid’s uptake into a phage capsid. This composite part is called a plasmid. The M13ori does not code for phage coat proteins so a second circular piece of DNA, the helper phagemid, is required to express and assemble the phage coat. This helper phagemid has a disrupted packaging signal so when in the presence of a phagemid, the phagemid will be packaged preferentially. For CU-Boulder we tested the packaging ability of their pSB1C3-M13ori phagemid compared to the M13K07 helper phagemid, which contains kanamycin resistance. We started the phage production protocol on day one then finished the isolation on day two. The phage we isolated were used to infect cells that were then plated onto Chloramphenicol and on kanamycin then the results were analyzed. There was more growth on chloramphenicol than on kanamycin, demonstrating that the M13ori was packaged into and delivered by the M13 phage at a higher rate than M13K07.

Toronto,2018,Team:Toronto#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," We contacted the Shapiro lab and they agreed to send us key bacterial strains needed            to produce our vesicular construct. Correspondence with the Shapiro lab and previous            relevant iGEM teams taught us how to optimize the parameters for gas vesicle            production to meet our needs. Concurrent with this process was research and the            writing of a comprehensive literature review. This research provided us with the            knowledge about the genetic system responsible for gas vesicle production and that            there are a few critical genes which we can be manipulated and used in the            optimization of gas vesicle production, GvpA and GvpC. Conveying this knowledge            to our Wet Lab Team, they were able to use these leads to optimize gas vesicle            expression and create a model bioremediation system in the lab. By developing a biomass separation platform using cells with enhanced biosorptive            abilities, we can capture high-value materials or pollutants from wastewater effluent            which could be a viable alternative dewatering process to complement or replace            traditional centrifugation and filtration processes. Our aspiration was to develop            such a platform that can be used in industry, to benefit the environment, and have            real-world application. Using scientific discoveries from various articles and            feedback from departmental graduate students [CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS] ,            wet lab decided to use microbial gas vesicles in the bioremediation of wastewater.            Meeting with stakeholders and experts allowed us to establish our project’s            applicability within the industry and the potential it had to eliminate energy            inefficiencies, harsh chemical uses, expensive processes, obtainment of high-value            materials and pollutant removal. Secondly, these meetings ensured our project was            developed to be used responsibly. Based on the feedback received from stakeholders,            public opinion, and policymakers, we had our Human Practices team focus on the            applicability of our project by determining design constraints to guide our wet            lab and dry lab work. We believe by focusing on addressing key issues, the rational            development of a useful “GMO” technology could outweigh the often irrational fear of            GMOs. Two specific stakeholder interactions influenced our project. From this, we            learned that our project had some potential to achieve remove pollutants such as            microplastics and pharmaceuticals, or extracting heavy metals and other high-value            materials, ultimately resulting in clean, usable water.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," mean that parts are tightly coupled together, preventing the simple swapping of parts. Therefore, we propose a modular, multicellular system for biosensor development, using a cell-to-cell communication system to eradicate the requirement for further genetic engineering of reusable biosensor devices (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Multicellular Sensynova system.
Cell-to-Cell communication
Bacteria have native quorum sensing systems which enable cell-to-cell communication through the production and detection of hormone-like auto-inducers. These molecules allow the synchronisation of behaviour in large populations of bacterial cells (Waters & Bassler, 2005). One such system involves the autoinducer AHL (Acylated Homoserine Lactone). AHLs compose of a lactone ring with an acyl side chain containing between 4 and 18 carbons (Churchill & Chen, 2011). Various AHL synthases exist, which produce AHL with different modifications and side change lengths. AHL receptors are sensitive to AHLs of specific length. For example, it has been found that the Rhl system, producing and detecting AHL of acyl carbon length 4 and the Las system, producing and detecting AHL of acyl carbon length 12, exhibit little crosstalk – the receptor component of the system is sensitive only to carbon chains of the correct length (Brenner et al., 2007). The orthogonal nature of the AHL family of autoinducers has enabled their use in a variety of synthetic systems. They are often used as biological “wires”, linking either inter- or intracellular processes. These “wires” have been previously used in a number of synthetic biology systems, e.g. Gupta et al. (2013) and Tasmir et al. (2011). In this project, it is proposed that modularity, and therefore the ability to use parts “off-the-shelf” without further genetic engineering, could be improved by splitting components of biosensors into different cells which communicate to coordinate responses. The orthogonal quorum sensing systems Rhl and Las will be used as biological “wires”, linking different biosensor components together. This separation of components will enable the decoupling of non-specific components from specific detection systems. Using this approach, production of biosensor variants will not require subsequent engineering steps: cells containing desired components will simply be mixed together (Figure 2).
Figure 2: SBOL Visual for the modular and multicellular Sensynova framework design.
The splitting of biosensor components into separate cells may have additional advantages besides ease of variant production. Goni-Moreno et al. ("

Exposition: For Kids & Parents
We held an exhibition in our local museum to attract kids and parents who know little about science. We introduced some new ideas of iGEMers (other teams and us) and used tangible models as well as attractive videos to demonstrate the abstract concepts of SynBio. A comic was also composed to deliver our ideas to kids!
Lecture: For Freshmen
iGEMers can be professorsA course in Nankai University invited us to give a lecture to freshmen! Most of them had never heard about Synthetic Biology and it was our lecture that introduced them to the subject!
Labcourse: For Middle School Students
Before entering a lab, young students might regard science as mysterious and difficult. So we gave a course in our lab to engage them in biological research. (A student even became a member of our team! ) After learning basic operations and knowledge, they were really excited and ready to learn more about biology in high school.
Investigation: For Young Scientists
Since that the karoshi of several young scientists in China shocked the public and that wrong operations caused a serious accident in a lab in Shanghai, we decided to invest the management of some labs in Tianjin. Many master and PhD students spend too much time in the lab. We also found some dangerous operations. After sending our report to the leaders of our school, we were surprised to see that they held a meeting to change this!
Overview Biologue Exposition Labcourse Lecture Investigation
An overview of the background
Though there are many Chinese scientists devoting themselves to science, the public is still suffering from the lack of knowledge. For most people in China, science is difficult, mysterious and far from daily life. As young students, we hope to be a bridge between 'science' and 'the public', especially the younger generation, which is the future of synthetic biology. Science can definitely attract many students as long as its charm is shown properly to them.
In China, several young scientists have just died from too much work. What"

Week 13
Indigoidine Production – Testing PPTases
We wanted to test various PPTases on their functionality in activating the indigoidine synthetases indC and bpsA. The plasmids pRB3-10 represent all possible combinations of either indC or bpsA with the PPTases sfp, svp, svp (pMM65) or entD. We transformed E. coli TOP10 with all the plasmids.
All PPTases are capable of attaching the 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl residue to the apo-form of the indigoidine synthetases as was observed by the blue phenotype of transformed E. coli TOP10 cells. The main focus was now on exchanging the T-Domain of the indigoidine synthetase indC to further proof the concept of modularity in the field of NRPS domains. We can easily determine which engineered versions of indC remain functionality by screening for blue colonies.
Week 14
T-Domain Shuffling – Assembly of ccdB Plasmids
In the subsequent weeks we wanted to exchange the indC T-domain with several T-domains of other NRPS modules. These are modules derived from the Tyrocidine and Delftibactin pathway, from the E. coli NRPS entF and two NRPS modules of unknown function from P. luminescens itself.
pRB11 (derived from pKH1), pRB12 (derived from pKH2) and pRB13 (derived from pRB3) carry the ccdB gene with a RBS instead of their native T-Domain, thus they express an unfunctional indC and the ccdb toxin which kills E. coli TOP10 cells. We extracted the ccdB gene from pDONR (Invitrogen, pDONR™221 ). E. coli OneShot ccdb survival cells produce an antidote to ccdB and are able to survive upon transformation with the ccdB carrying plasmid. After exchange of the ccdB gene with a novel T-domain only positive E. coli TOP10 transformants survive and the background colonies will be diminished.
Assembly and/or transformations were inefficient, as blue colonies on each plate suggest that an excess of template was contained in the transformation mix.

Project Riboregulator Abstract
Regulatory RNAs are RNAs that regulate biological processes on genetic and metabolic levels, and their importance has been established through the discoveries including those of RNA interference (RNAi) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). The elucidation of their mechanism has enabled their reverse engineering, transforming them into versatile tools in synthetic biology.
Riboregulators belong to a class of regulatory RNAs that controls translation by pairing of cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) RNAs. They have received attention from at least 7 teams during the early years of iGEM. For example, Farren Isaacs in 2005, iGEM 2006 UC Berkeley team and iGEM 2007 Caltech team contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry. Though there are more than > 100 riboregulator BioBrick records, comprehensive characterization information is missing. This hinders the iGEM community to compare and contrast different riboregulator pairs and evaluate their performance. For example, if we want to use the CR and TA devices that Berkeley 2006 made, we would not know which one to use and whether the device would work, because documentations were not put down in the Registry or wiki page and were therefore no longer accessible.
In light of this situation, iGEM 2014 HKUST team decided to embark on ""Project Riboregulator"", and we aim to:
Provide Characterization information on riboregulator BioBricks so that teams and labs will be confident in using these devices.
Summarize available information of existing riboregulators into a Feature Page and promote their uses.

These issues should be taken into account when evaluating whether the dangers risks of genetic engineering outweigh the potential for reducing animal mistreatment. As a relevant comparison, most of the cheese produced today is made with a rennet enzyme manufactured using genetically engineered organisms grown in bioreactors, which has limited the need for harvesting rennet from the stomach linings of young cows.
Statement of Ethics
Purpose of this statement
As part of our work on this project, we drew up a statement of ethics to help guide our practices. This document describes our core values and how we are striving to implement them in our work on the Real Vegan Cheese Project. Our code of ethics is based on the draft code formulated by participants in the 2011 North American DIYbio Congress. See also, the draft code developed at the 2011 European DIYbio Congress. These ethics are for the Real Vegan Cheese Project and do not represent the ethics of Counter Culture Labs, or Biocurious.
Open Access
Promote citizen science and decentralized access to biotechnology. We believe all people have the right to engage in scientific inquiry and we strive to promote access to tools and technical knowledge to make that engagement possible. Asking questions and seeking answers is a fundamental part of who we are as humans, and crucial to securing a hopeful future for the planet. We are committed to keeping Real Vegan Cheese 100% open, but in a world in which openness is not the norm, it is not necessarily obvious how best to achieve that goal. Our meeting notes and lab experiments are available online, but would this be enough to keep another entity from patenting our techniques? We considered several options to ensure that anybody who wants to can continue to work on this project in the future. One option we considered is the newly developed Defensive Patent License (DPL), which would make our technique freely available to anyone else who also agrees to put their patents in a common “pool” (a legal mechanism similar to and inspired by the GNU General Public License and other efforts to promote free and open source software development) (Schultz and Urban 2012). However, the DPL would restrict access to those who do not opt in to the pool. After some spirited discussion and a vote, our current plans are to patent our innovation and then “abandon” the patent into the public domain. This way, no one will be able to privatize our work and it will remain truly open to anyone who wants to use it."

The strain was capable of producing 9 g/L of psicose for 50 g/L of fructose in the culturing media after 24 h of incubation at 37°C, which represents a yield of 18%. This conversion rate is comparable to the biocatalysis yields described in the literature ( Click here to find out more ). However, we used non-optimal temperature (37°C the optimal E. coli growth temperature and not 55°C, the optimal activity temperature of Dpe from C. cellulolyticum), cells were not permeabilised and the enzyme was not purified. To the best of our knowledge our study is the first attempt to bioproduce psicose using living microorganisms in culturing conditions.
Multiple aspects of the bioproduction could be improved on, but one key element is the activity of the Dpe. To improve it, we developed a directed evolution system for Dpe and we screened around 400 mutants with our biosensor to select variants with improved activity ( Click here to find out more ). The fluorescence intensity generated by our biosensor can be correlated to the activity of the mutated Dpe, allowing an easy and quick screen of the mutant bank.
Our bioproduction method was also interesting for us since the biosensor will evaluate the activity of the enzyme inside a living cell. Therefore, our production and our screening techniques are carried out in the same conditions.
Perspectives
Short Term Perspectives
Going forward, we should recover the mutated plasmids to sequence the mutant enzymes, extract the sequences by PCR to put them in an expression vector and then implement them in a BL21-AI strain to produce psicose with better yields. There could be multiple rounds of directed evolution on these selected variants with higher activity to enhance the production. This would allow the prices to decrease so that psicose could have a greater societal impact.
Longer Term Perspectives
Apart from more rounds of directed evolution there are many factors that could allow us to improve our production to a global scale level. First of all, we could still focus on an in vivo technique by integrating our Dpe in Bacillus subtilis. This strain is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS), so it can be used to produce compounds for human consumption. B. subtilis is also able to efficiently export compounds of its cytosol, thus avoiding cell lysis to recover products.
In vitro production offers more versatility for bioproduction. By purifying an enzyme, one can avoid the limitations of the bacteria, therefore using the"

Lab Work
Based on our research, cholera biofilms grow best under stringent response. One of the factors affecting this response is salinity. As our cholera cultures are growing fine but aren't really producing a biofilm we decided to raise the salinity of our LB to better simulate the aqueous environment in which cholera biofilms are normally found. We made LB using a synthetic sea water recipe in place of water. The recipe was obtained online from thelabrat.com. Our synthetic seawater (SSW) LB recipe consisted of the following:

HONEYBEE SILK PROJECT
Goals
The goal of this project is to recombinantly express honeybee silk proteins, with the intention of creating synthetic honeybee silk fibers.  We hope to develop protocols to efficiently produce the raw protein, process the protein into various materials, and characterize these materials.  Furthermore, by conjugating the honeybee protein with other proteins, we aim to create honeybee silk materials with a wide array of properties and functionalities.
Achievements
As of 9/18 we are well on our way to establishing a strong foundation for this project.  We have cloned five honey bee sequences into biobrick approved format, have expressed and purified honey bee silk protein. (For detailed achievements see below)
Cloning
We have successfully cloned and sequence verified five honeybee silk constructs into the igem psb1c3 plasmid backbone, in the correct biobrick format. A comprehensive list of our biobrick parts can be found here
The first sequence is just the honeybee silk protein #3 in the psb1c3 backbone.  The annotated sequence, along with further details on how we designed and cloned this biobrick can be found here. BBa_K1763000
The second sequence is the same silk coding sequence, but with regulatory elements upstream for protein expression, including BBa_R0010 Promoter and RBS BBa_B0034 .  The sequence can be found here. BBa_K1763001 along with further details on the design and cloning of this biobrick.
The third sequence is a fusion protein between our honeybee silk and the Spycatcher, protein which has specific affinity for SpyCatcher. It also contains regulatory elements like a promoter and rbs for expression. You can view the sequence BBa"

We exchanged suggestions to each other on problems encountered in experiments, modeling, human practice framework, etc. In addition, they also led us to visit their laboratory, as well as SynCTI, Asia's largest synthetic biology center. Through this meet-up, we have a better understanding of synthetic biology and our project, which will make our goal much more clear.
Collaboration with XMU-China
We offered XMU-China the information of our team, including team introduction, project description, etc, which will be used to record on the Newsletter edited by XMU-China. Through this platform, more people could learn about our projects and we have more opportunities to exchange and cooperate with the external world.
Biosafety Collaboration
Since we are conducting the experiments associated with “High Titer” and “Broad Spectrum” of viruses, which is identified to have some potential dual-use biosecurity considerations, we deeply understand that we need to be more sensitive to these concerns. Following the advice from The Safety and Security Committee of iGEM, we have contacted with Fangzhong Wang, who is at the Center for Biosafety Research and Strategy at Tianjin University. Through the exchange and discussion, Prof. Wang kindly offered us lots of quite pertinent suggestions and we recognized that we need to take more safety issues into consideration. Therefore, we followed his advice, increased management training in experimental safety, and implemented many safety measures, which would all ensure the safety and the security of our project.
Industry
Collaboration
This year, our project is dedicated to reduce the excessive cost of producing cell-based animal vaccines. This problem was identified by our strategic collaborator, Beijing DaBeiNong Company. Thus, we are financed by them to carry out virus related experiments in this project. The outcome of our project can greatly help the factory to reduce the cost of producing a series of vaccines by using MDBK cell line.
