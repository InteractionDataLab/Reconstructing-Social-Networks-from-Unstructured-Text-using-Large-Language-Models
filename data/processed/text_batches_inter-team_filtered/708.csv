By replacing the gene normally present under this promoter with our gene of interest, we successfully manipulated the cascade to produce an appropriate cellular response when allergens are present.
Assay to Test Signaling Cascade Functionality
Our assay to test these receptors’ affinities for histamine is based on fluorescence. Because the intracellular cascades of both Trg-EnvZ and Tar-EnvZ induce transcription under the OmpC promoter, we have constructed a cassette that places the OmpC promoter over the RFP gene for red fluorescence. Testing for functionality of the cascade then simply involved observing whether RFP expression occurred under ompC, a simple fluorescence assay conducted on an epifluorescence microscope. Qualitative visualization of red-fluorescing colonies transformed with both the receptor and cascade components indicated a functional intracellular signaling system.
We have tested this signaling cascade by performing the following series of transformations. The E. coli strain RU1012 was used, because it is an EnvZ knockout strain. As efforts to construct a novel histamine receptor were being conducted in parallel to these assays, testing of the cascade was conducted with the original chimeric chemoreceptor Tar-EnvZ. The binding of the wild-type ligand aspartate to Tar and the intracellular transcription of ompC-RFP it initiated was thus used as a proof-of-concept of our future histamine-initiated system.

Comments about iGEM and distributed computing:
""We need more distributed computing projects in biology and medical fields."":
""I did not know about synthetic biology until I participated on iGEM@home. Synthetic biology has great potential to benefit humanity that most people do not realize. Many people are still not aware of this new project. Time to spread the word out!""
Conclusions
We consider iGEM@home a great success. The elaborate evalution of the project showed that the product iGEM@home fulfiils all the requirements for a vivid distributed computing AND science communication plattform at the same time. Not just were we able to do calculations impossible without a huge server cluster, we also reached a lot of people who didn’t know about Synthetic Biology and iGEM before. At the moment the majority of iGEM@home users are experienced BOINC supporters and crunchers that also support additional projects. But we did not only show that we were able to recruit about 100 new BOINC supporters in a short time but that the content distributed via the screen saver slide show is accessed by many users and especially by the ones recruited directly for iGEM@home (80%).
We hereby have shown that it is feasible for an iGEM team to run an distributed computing project and it offers a great new approach to reach out to the society.
Future
Of course we think that iGEM@home is a great tool and needs to be continued after the end of this year’s iGEM competition. As it has an active and interested community and offers teams to do impressive computations, we hope to hand iGEM@home over to the headquarters for a centralized access in future. So that it becomes an integral part of iGEM, for the benefit of society.

In order to make input more easily, we add a simple NOT gate after PompC promoter which is consisted of protein cl and P lamda, and can change this system into being activated by red light and being inhibited by dark. Through these two TCS, the information which is in binary form can be inputted conveniently.
Oscillation
    For better effects, we hope each of the encryption unit could change dynamically, that is, for the same input signal at different times, our system will produce different responses, and this change is a periodic process. We want to use the classic negative feedback loop to achieve it.
Fig.1
    The substance A can arouse promoter Pa+, resulting in the expression of gene B; And the product B will inhibit the activity of promoter Pb-. Therefore, the concentration of A or B will increase and decrease periodically, and the phase difference of these two extremes is half a period.
    However, this system can only be used in a single bacterium. Among bacteria, due to the differences between individuals, we can hardly observe a group-level stable oscillation. Gene expressions among the whole group need to be synchronized, which needs quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is a system of autoinducers released by bacteria themselves and response correlated to population density to regulate group behaviors like gene expression. Gram-negative bacteria has two kinds of quorum sensing system, and the autoinducers are AHL (Fig.2a) and DPD (Fig.2b).
Fig.2a
Fig.2b
    We use gene lux l as gene A, and it can encode luxl protein which is AHL synzyme; we use gene aiiA as gene B, and it can encode aiiA protein which is AHL clastic enzyme. (Fig.3a)  When AHL accumulate to a certain concentration, aiiA will be expressed to resolve AHL. During the decreasing concentration of AHL, the expression of aiiA will decrease too. After AHL is resolved totally, aiiA will stop expressing and be resolved, and then AHL will accumulate again. And so on (Fig.3b). Use GFP as the reporter gene, we can observe a stable oscillation (Fig.3c).

Concluding, we were able to verify the function of PtNTT2 without using radioactively labeled nucleotides. The native transporter variant shows the highest activity in all experiments. Uptake of the unnatural nucleotides was verified by determination of the RBE of the different transporter variants when cultivated in MOPS media supplemented with the unnatural nucleotides. Since ATP is constantly exported in exchange for iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP, leading to substantial negative influence on the growth of the cultures.
Subcellular Localization of PtNTT2
To investigate the subcellular localization of the different PtNTT2 variants, GFP fusion proteins were constructed as listed in Table 1. Each PtNTT2 variant was tagged with a cMyc epitope tag as a linker and GFP (BBa_E0040). The cells were cultivated and prepared for microscopy as described in the methods section . Microscopy was performed using the Zeiss LSM 700. The pictures shown in Figure 19 were taken at 100x magnification and clearly show the subcellular localization of the different PtNTT2 variants.
Figure 19: Confocal laser scanning microscopy of the different PtNTT2 variants fused to GFP (BBa_E0040). The pictures were taken with 100x magnification and show from A to E: E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2, E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575), E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(31-575), E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-pelB-SP-PtNTT2 and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-TAT-SP-PtNTT2.
All PtNTT2 variants can be localized within the membrane, since the fluorescence signals of the GFP tag are concentrated there. Judging from the pictures, the variant with the pelB signal peptide is weakly integrated into the inner membrane, which would explain the good growth characteristics and the weak functionality of this variant. The TAT-signal peptide variant, which showed bad growth characteristics and no substantial function, seems to be located within the"

Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," we analyze an agarose gel but also water-bath and electrical/fire risks.
For protecting us from the UVs, we use adapted glasses.
At the end of every day, the last persons to leave check that everything is ok in the lab (no water-bath stayed on, everything disconnected).
Risks to the safety and health of the general public
If biological materials escape from our lab, the risks regarding safety and health of the general public is low because the manipulated parts are harmless. The only risk is the contact with DNA or RNA from a bacterial organism.
Moreover, we have to be cautious with the use of antibiotics and we must not wash them down the drain.
Risks to the environment
If biological materials escape from our lab, GMOs can spread in the environment and gene transfer can occur. Moreover, the aim of our bacterial system (called SubtiTree) is to kill a fungus (Ceratocyctis platani). The risk to the environment is high because our system could perturb ecological niche and unbalance the environment of some plants. All our waste is autoclaved to minimize the risk for the environment.
We use three fungicides.
The first one, D4E1, is a synthetic peptide.
The second is EcAMP-1 (BBa_K1162001), an AntiMicrobial Peptide from banyard grass added to the Registry last year by the team Utah State.
The last one is GAFP-1, the Gastrodia AntiFungal Protein.
These fungicides are not authorized yet by the European Union because they are not commercialized.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries
If someone steals the biological material it could be dangerous for the environment because our bacterium will produce three bio-fungicides. This could lead to the disturbing of some ecosystems.
However, the fungicides are natural and one of them is used in agriculture. With these considerations, we can assume that the risk is not very high for the chosen parts.
How to reduce these risks?
We take care of our waste and our biological material.
We have chosen only non-pathogenic species to work on: E. coli and B. subtilis.
We use non-pathogenic fungus to test our SubtiTree system: Aspergillus brasiliensis, Chaetomium globosum, Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus nidulans.
Indeed the targeted fungus, Ceratocystis platani, is pathogenic. Therefore we avoid working with it.
Risks in the Future

iGEM Tec de Monterrey has participated 5 consecutive years in the competition, so we have some experience regarding shipments of DNA across the border, material, laboratory kits, etc. Although Monterrey is only two hours away from the US border, every year we have had problems at customs when crossing this kind of material.
México is a member of the World Trade Organization and active member of the Cartagena protocol. The participation in these Organisms should facilitate the transit of samples of Genetically Live Organisms and Genetically Modified Organisms through the border [1]. After a review of the Mexican customs Act, we realized that there is no specific legislation regarding DNA material, when received at customs, this kind of material is cataloged as “others” [2]. This means that there is no standard specified for this kind of material in the customs norms and as a consequence each customs office in the country acts differently towards this issue. This can delay the shipment for weeks or months and sometimes the shipment is turned back. Having just a few months for the realization of our projects, this can represent a huge setback for Mexican iGEM teams and it also affects the daily work of several biotechnological institutions across the country
iGEM Tec de Monterrey 2010 created a list of recommendations for future Mexican iGEM teams in order to facilitate the customs problems [3], although  this recommendations sometimes work, others don’t. iGEM UNAM 2013 tried to address this problem sending a letter to the National Congress of the nation explaining the need to solve this issue and hoping for the congressmen to create a new law in consequence, unfortunately they had no response [4].
To solve this situation once and for all, iGEM Tec de Monterrey 2014 participated in two approaches:
First we came in contact with fellow mexican iGEMers Virtus Parva, Biosint México, Genetix Tec CEM and iGEM Guadalajara to join forces. With the experience and advice of past teams, we realized that the best way to address the situation was to make a proposal for a modification of the norm on our own for later delivery to a local congressman who would be responsible for endorsing it to the local congress.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Shanghaitech,2017,Team:Shanghaitech#CMZ-TEST_-_-_TEXT.html,", we went to Tongji University for the opening night for iGEMer hosted Fablab workshop.
Fablab originates from a course called ""how to create anything"" by professor Gershenfeld.  Fablab is generally equipped with a 3D printer, a print circuit, the lathes and other instruments for guests to create anything they want in the workshop. The Fablab we went also had some biological elements. It has a series of equipment can be used for biological experiments. Fablab believes that the passion to create new things is most important to gain knowledge . The concept of the Fablab and the spirit of iGEM are so similar in this aspect. The “maker” in Fablab is full of curiosity and has the potential to be an iGEMer.
The main activity of the opening night started with project introductions from iGEM teams of East China University of Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University and our team. Since “the key element” of our project, the robot, is designed for  nonprofessional person, we hope someday “makers” can create something unique using our platform.
August 26, 2017: Central China iGEM Consortium
In August 26, 2017, we visited Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU) in Fuzhou, where this year's CCIC (Central China iGEM Consortium) meeting venue was held. As a communication platform of iGEMers in China, CCiC is hosted by different schools each year and is organized by students independently.
During this meeting, we communicated extensively with dozens of iGEM teams from all over the country through the poster session and an oral presentation about our MagicBlock project. In addition, our team leader Mingzhe Chen also delivered a special talk to introduce the quorum sensing system. The brief three-day visit was fully filled with project reports from different teams and keynote speeches from invited guests. This is a very rewarding experience for us. Some teams with more experience of participating in the iGEM competition shared their ideas and designs of experiments, which enlightened us a lot. At the same time, we were also glad that we could offer assistance to other teams when they encountered difficulties.
In addition to organize the communication between teams, the organizers of CCIC also invited Dr. Haoqian Zhang, a former senior iGEMer, and Professor Oye from iGEM headquarter to share their insights and experience in iGEM competition.

To analyse the results of the wet lab transformations of the inserts into B. subtilis, we used two methods: microscopy and flow cytometry.
Microscopy
Microscopy work from 08.09.08 showed a difference in the level of flourescence of the iGEMgfp fluorescent cells (higher in 10% subtilin-induced cells compared to 0% subtilin-induced cells). However, there was little difference in the number of cells that fluoresced between the two cultures.
There was no difference in the number of fluorecent cells or the level of fluorescence between the 10% subtilin-induced and the 0% subtilin-induced iGEMcherry cells.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry measures cell fluorescence and light scattering, cell-by-cell, allowing us to quantify our results and present them in graphical form.  A sample of our cells engineered B. subtilis cells were injected into the machine, which hydro-dynamically focusses the fluid. Lasers of a particular wavelength are directed onto the stream of fluid, and each particle which passes through the light beam will cause the laser to scatter in a different way. Cells which absorb and then re-emit the light, result in fluorescence (a higher energy state).
The detectors in the machine measure the scattering of light and any fluoresence which occurs, and the data is displayed as histograms and dot plots.
Induction by 0% v/v subtilin (i.e in the absence of subtilin): mean fluoresence = 7.70
Induction by 1% v/v subtilin: mean fluoresence = 14.77
Induction by 10% v/v subtilin: the mean fluoresence = 21.95
These results show that the higher the concentration of subtilin, the more GFP is expressed.
At 10% induction, the subtilin began to cause some of the cells to lyse - this can be seen by the two distinct populations of cells - one being the cells which have lysed, and the other being the remainder of intact cells.  Since subtilin is an antibiotic, this was a good indication that the subtilin we had collected that day was of good quality.

Procedures in detail
1.2 Procedures of Experiments
     1.2.1 PCR Proliferation
        Due to high content of G-C base-pairs in target gene segments, GC Buffer is required in PCR proliferation. Refer to Takara's protocols to prepare 200μL of system: 100μL of GC Buffer, 16μL of dntp mixture, 4μL of sense primer, 4μL of anti-sense primer, 4μL of DNA templet, 2μL of Taq, and 70μL of H2O. 60°C-70°C is used for Gradient PCR, the sixth bad is the brightest (Figure 9) thus the temperature of such is best for annealing. In new system, PCR is proceeded in that temperature; finally we get the gene segments with gene linkers.
    1.2.2 Gel electrophoresis, purification
    1.2.3 Digestion
        Put NotI and NdeI restriction endonuclease in gene segment and vector pET-28a respectively.

The signal peptide of the N-termini of this fusion protein targets the protein on the membrane while the trans-membrane domain of Ompa serves as an anchor. MBP is on the externally exposed loops of OmpA, which can be anchored to the outer membrane.
4 assemble
To make full use of the spaces and reduce the energy consumption to the least while improve the efficiency of metal binding, we assemble the three genes together: mbp, Dsba-mbp, lpp-ompa-mbp, which are expressed separately in cytoplasm, periplasmic space and on the membrane.More information about this design will be given in the ""Part design"".
[ TOP ]
Part:BBa_K346005: Part Design
Design Notes
This part is designed to combine three subparts----the T7promoter-rbs-Dsba-mbp-terminator, T7promoter-rbs-mbp-terminator and T7promoter-rbs-lpp-ompa-mbp-terminator.
Metal binding pepside(MBP)
To achieve the goal of making a high performance MBP, we constructed a single polypeptide consisting of two dimerization helixes and metal binding loops of MerR, to form an antiparallel coiled coil MBP mimicking the dimerized metal binding domains of the wild-type as described in the Fig. We amplified the N-terminal and C-terminal of MBP directly from full length MerR by PCR, and then cloned them into the backbone together in one step. After that, RBS, T7 promoter and terminator are added.
Dsba-MBP
Dsba-mbp is a fusion protein aiming to transport the MBP protein to the periplasm. Dsba is a signal peptide, which can be recognized and transported to the periplasm.
LPP-OmpA-MBP
LPP-OmpA-MBP is designed as a fusion protein consisting of the signal sequence and first 9 amino acid of Lpp, residue 46~159 of OmpA and the metal binding peptide(MBP). The signal peptide of the N-termini of this fusion protein targets the protein on the membrane while the trans-membrane domain of Ompa serves as an anchor.

Therefore, we can evidently improve the output of riboflavin by knocking out the FMN riboswitch or overexpressing ribB. Related experiment statistics can be referred from Fig 3. Compared with the whole riboflavin synthesis genes cluster, ribB has the advantages of convenience, high efficiency and short sequence as it is only 654bp. Consequently, our team choosed ribB as a report gene to construct parts and then builded the connection between heavy metal ions and ribB and finally used the product of ribB riboflavin to impact the voltage of MFC so that we realized the monitoring of heavy metal ions automatically, quantitatively and efficiently.

Prussian Blue Ferritin
What is Ferritin?
Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron storage protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes allowing cells to keep iron in a soluble and non-toxic form. Ferritin across different species has very similar architecture and function. This is in despite of variations at the primary structure level (Harrison and Arosio, 1996).  The 450 kDa protein shell consists of 24 subunits that can be composed of both heavy and light chains  (Lawson et al., 1991) (Figure 1). Inside of this shell is room for an iron core composed of up to 4500 Fe (III) atoms stored as ferrihydrite phosphate (Ford et al., 1984). The goal of our project is to make use of this natural nanoparticle as both a scaffold and a reporter system.
Figure 1. Ribbon visualization of a fully assembled ferritin protein.
How can Ferritin be a Reporter?
Iron has naturally attracted attention for its ability to participate in Fenton chemistry. In this reaction iron acts as a catalyst in order to cause the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen-radical species (Figure 2). The resulting hydroxyl radical can cause the oxidation of common horseradish peroxidase substrates such as 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce a colourimetric output.

DREB1C promoter Team:Nevada/registry submissions
The DREB1C iGEM promoter is derived from a transcription factor that is up-regulated by cold stress and down-regulated by circadian controls to prevent plant growth retardation due to the buildup of DREB1C (Dehydration Response Element Binding Protein) during the day (the cause of dwarfism). The promoter region for DREB1C begins just upstream of the translational start sequence (ATG) and contains 463 bp of the upstream sequence with six ADA independent, cis-acting elements for the up-regulation during cold stress and circadian controlled down-regulation.
The DREB1C iGEM promoter was isolated using custom primers directly from the Arabidopsis thaliana genome via PCR, blunt end Topo cloned, and then ligated to pSB1C3 using EcoR1 and Pst1 sites.

We considered laws currently in place in Australia surrounding the application of our biosensor. This is crucial when developing a product, as it must comply to regulations before it can be implemented. It was found that our biosensor doesn’t fit directly into a box, and so there is room to use our device to drive legislation change surrounding synthetic biology technology.
Environment & sustainability
One of the obvious concerns when we first settled on the sticker design was waste. Consumers eat fruit and throw stickers in the bin, or stick them somewhere they shouldn’t be. By mass-producing even more packaging in this way, we are perpetuating the issue of landfill and pollution.
In conjunction with discussions we had with OzHarvest volunteers, it was agreed that the way to overcome this problem was to ensure our stickers are biodegradable.
Social Justice
Our interaction with OzHarvest, a non-for-profit organisation, was extremely influential in the design selection of our product, as they emphasised the importance of biodegradability. Engagement in this way also provided more depth in our outreach efforts, because we were engaging with an audience already educated in the issue of food wastage.
Theory of Knowledge
This aspect of our human practices was somewhat unplanned. It came about following a discussion about our amilCP mutants, and how they should be classified. These mutants have identical sequences as the wild type, with the exception of a single nucleotide. However, they are all vastly different colours.
Is it appropriate to refer to them as amilCP variants, when amilCP is by definition blue? Or does a single mutation make them their own entity? If so, is it incorrect to class these mutants as “improvements” of the wild type?
Survey
We conducted a survey on fresh produce consumption habits to gain an insight into the context of our project firsthand. We engaged with over 260 people from over 16 countries – at least one from every continent (except Antarctica)! It was a"

Not only will the method drastically reduce the number of samples having to be sent for sequencing, but all the reagents needed, except for the primers and oligos, are also practically a one-time investment. This results in economic benefits in the long run if the mutagenesis is to be repeated. We believe that this definitely could be of interest for future iGEM teams since expensive mutagenesis kits are not an alternative for many teams.
Furthermore, the SAMURAI procedure has only three PCR steps, where multiple mutations can be introduced at the same time. As an example, SAMURAI can be really useful for introducing mutations in the active site of an enzyme, since these amino acids are often dispersed across the protein sequence. Hence, this technique has the possibility to work well together with rational enzyme design, one of the main parts of our project.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#HP#transformandtranslate_-_-_TEXT.html," was gained into how these terms are frequently discussed in the media.
So after discovering the collocates of each search term (the top 20 for genetic engineering and synthetic biology are shown above), I looked further at how these words were used, using the articles which the corpus identified they had featured in. Full details of this can be read in my report- A Corpus Based Investigation into Science Communication. Overall, here is a taste of some of the key conclusions!
In discussion of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and GMOs, both positive and negative attitudes are displayed. By acknowledging these attitudes, they can be used to help aid how and where you communicate.  Regulation came up again and again- many of the collocates related to discussions of issues and concerns surrounding regulation. Clearly, safety and control are key pubic concerns with synthetic biology, genetic engineering, GMOs, and biosensors. This can also be said of science and new technologies in general, and these concerns must be addressed when communicating science.  Transparency in language use when communicating science is key to gain trust and understanding. To address this, we’re creating some guidelines for communication in science, many of which will focus on transparency!
It doesn't end there
From a click of a button on a corpus, you can discover so much. What’s even better is that there is still so much work which can be done in the future, as these corpora grow with time! Keep searching…
Having a blast at Big Bang!
August 24, 2017
Friday 14th July saw the North East Big Bang fair, a science fair hosted by Northumbria Uni, arrive in Newcastle. Thousands of local primary and secondary school pupils and teachers attended- it was a fantastic event to get children engaging with STEM outside of lessons, inspiring them about how the things they learn in the classroom work in the world, and how they can be involved in this.
Spreading Synthetic Biology
As Newcastle iGEM team, we attended Big Bang with a few aims. Primarily, we wanted to spread knowledge of synthetic biology and get younger students excited about the field! Alongside this, we saw the opportunity to discover how much is known about synthetic biology and the impact it can have on the world, from the perspective of the scientists of the future. This involved learning more about how the current curriculum tackles synthetic biology, how science is taught in schools, and discovering how students actively participate in science and the conversation surrounding it.
Build your own Biosensor
As an interactive activity for the students, we had a make your own biosensor station. By choosing any input, and"

In summary, we need to take under consideration that this promoter could be active when we use this promoter in our model system.
Experiment 3: Promoter Assay pTIMP1 and pSTEAP4 and pF4/80 in HEK293 cells.
In order to test the cell specific activity of the promoters, we plan to use HEK293 to perform the promoter assay and examine their activity. We used HEK293 cells because they are from human embryonic kidney and therefore are not relate to neuronal cells or microglia. In addition, these cells are easy to transfect which suggest that this assay will be easy to perform.

Eugene - June 18, 2013
We met with Ernst and Diana from the Eugene team. We now have access to the newest Clotho releases through the SVN, and Ernst created a dynamic naming system in the Eugene language so users can use for loops to name parts that have consecutive numbering systems. We are working on the Promoter Characterization Devices (PCDs) eugene file, and trying to make an inverter example. We have been also populating a database in Clotho with the parts and their sequences. This was started with a file Sonya had provided at the Eugene tutorial meeting, and we are filling out the sequences from the iGEM registry and from our lab members' sequencing files.
Datasheet - July 2, 2013
Today we met with Swapnil, Evan, and Jenhan to discuss the datasheet app.  We discussed what fields on the datasheet should be auto-generated, user inputted, or part of a drop down menu.
The Purdue Biomakers responded to Thomas’s email.  Thomas had sent them our datasheet research and initial plans, and we got a positive response from them.  They want to potentially collaborate on the datasheet.

UESTC-China,2017,Team:UESTC-China#test4_-_-_TEXT.html," our project. We met up several times and discussed science, society and where those overlap. Their views on our project and synbio in general helped us in designing our project and adapting it to real life demands. For a concrete collaboration, we asked one of the students – Thieu – to design our end product, BeeT, in a way it could be presented to future users. Our collaboration with the DAE did not only lead to us having a positively received final product design, but also led to our project influencing the design students’ projects.  One of the students gave us the opportunity to have a “real life bee experience”. The aim of this project was to study group dynamics, stress, and teamwork. The task was to prepare a dish (Baklava) like bees would do it. Leif Czakai made a movie out of this.
Synenergene
Synenergene is a four year program to promote the dialogue about the future of synthetic biology between relevant stakeholders, contributing to responsible research and innovation. Synenergene partners, including the Rathenau institute, are in close collaboration with several iGEM teams from all over the world.
Our collaboration with Synenergene consisted of two assessments: an application scenario and a techno-moral vignette. The assessments were intended to help us evaluate the viability as well as the societal impact of our envisioned product. We chose to write a “Resource from the future” for our techno-moral vignette. “Resource” is the magazine and news website of students and employees of Wageningen UR. By writing a Resource from the year 2030 , when BeeT will be available on the market, we aimed to bring up ethical issues around synthetic biology in a way that is fun and accessible to the public. Some of these issues are highlighted in the interviews with the general public we included in the magazine. At the same time, the magazine served to spread the word in Wageningen about our iGEM project. Additionally, we wrote an application scenario . This scenario explores how European legislation could affect future BeeT usage.

RIVM
In the Netherlands, the RIVM (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu) is a  governmental institute that is concerned with public health and a safe living environment. They investigate the impact of synthetic biology on these aspects of our society, and aim to bring existing knowledge on the topic together. Part of their work is encouraging discussions about the"

With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models weren’t communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. We’ve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
We’ve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.
As a webpage it’s much more"

Scientific project : Every bacteria counts!
This counter operates on the principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled : the percentage of cells expressing a new phenotype is proportional to the number of events occurred. Thus, the cells can cooperate to act as a timer.
This counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale. Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one ""notch"" on the counter.
Human Practice projects
This year, iGEM team Paris has made a piece of software to analyze the word content of iGEM wikis. We have implemented an algorithm that uses Statistically Improbable Phrases (SIP) to try and extract the meaning of a text, an approach which has been used recently by Amazon to find relationships between books. We have extracted and calculated this for the last 3 years of iGEM, and have made the data freely available.
Synbioworld is a collaborative web platform created to give the synthetic biology community a place  to talk, share data and resources, and stay abreast of new developments in the ﬁeld. Developed by iGEM Paris past and present members in collaboration with members of the Peking U. and UCSF teams, SynBioWorld's beta version has been tested across the world and will be available for trial during this year's Jamboree! Come and discover SynBioWorld in the dedicated session on Saturday.

BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," groups working with the same enzymes as KoreaSonyeod team. Therefore, we offered KoreaSonyeod to makes rational mutations in order to stabilize the protein and improve the enzyme activity by using the algorithm from Dr, Sarel Flishman, the Weizmann Institute, Israel. Upon their request, we sent them the structures and sequences of our 7 variants of the PETase protein that we have synthesized  and characterized their of activity compare to the wild type protein.
The Technion - Israel
We collaborated with the Technion in a scientific way and also, we participated in a mini Jamboree hosted by the Technion team.
The scientific way:
Description:
""Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli. This process is mediated by chemoreceptors – membrane proteins that bind to different substances with high specificity. Project S.Tar offers a way to harness the chemotaxis system. By changing the ligand binding domain of the E. Coli Tar-chemoreceptor, we show that bacteria can be programmed to respond to different substances. As an implementation of our system we introduce a novel method for the detection of materials, such as pollutants and allergens, using a microfluidics chip. The chip’s design provides signal amplification while maintaining user-friendly experience.""
We learned that their project is about chemotaxis applied in E. coli. After reading articles about P. putida kt2440, we discovered that P. putida kt2440 has a similar chemotaxis mechanism as the E. coli used by the Technion (Ditty et al 1998). The Technion team offered to improve our Bacterium's chemotaxis mechanism though a their developed systemthat makes a specific mutation in the domains of the receptor. By making mutations, they can  change the receptor  that will bind the desired ligand . In our design system, the LC cutinase breaks  PET's first bond into two products- Terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. The products are then consumed by either P. putida kt2440 or E. coli. Terephthalic acid is transferred into P. putida kt2440 by tripartite tricarboxylate transporter and Ethylene glycol is diffused into E. coli.Therefore, we chose to use these two products as ligands to designed improved receptors by the Technion's team. As a result, the bacterium is expected to  detect these products in the solvent and migrate towards them overcoming the diffusion's limiting rate. This mechanism can expedite the degradation rate of"

Proof of Concept
Life is like a mirror - we get the best results when we smile at it
Proof of Concept
We developed a novel in vivo system for generating binding proteins in E. coli via directed evolution. The concept of our system subdivides into a library for initial diversity, a system for mutagenesis to further increase the diversity and a selection system to identify high affinity binding proteins.
Library
At first, we designed and created two libraries of partly random binding protein sequences in E. coli based on Monobodies and Nanobodies , respectively. Each library reached a size of over one hundred thousand clones posing a solid start point of our system. High diversity of the library was confirmed by stade-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing . Applicability of our library was confirmed by finding multiple potential binders against diverse targets . This library poses a valuable resource for our following directed evolution. Moreover, we provide an unprecedented part collection to the whole iGEM community enabling the application of libraries in future projects .
Mutagenesis
Furthermore, we used an error prone polymerase I for targeted mutagenesis of the binding protein encoding plasmid. This system is well suited for the diversification of initial binding proteins derived from our library. This mut"
KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Journal#MeS#qPCR_-_-_TEXT.html," we still have DNA-contamination in our RNA-sample, even after a DNase treatment.
19/08 – 23/08
Week 8: LET’S DO THIS! (again)
Because of the DNA-contamination we decided to start this experiment all over again. This time with closer assistance from a more experienced RNA-expert.
We prepared the samples again using the same protocol (‘qRT_PCR_Protocol’) as we did the first time but now included a few extra steps where we flash freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen (step 1-12). Then we also did the RNA-isolation (step 13), and again checked for any DNA-contamination.
We first checked whether we had any genomic DNA-contamination by doing a PCR on a genomic region of our E. coli (csrA gene). The results were very good:
Only our positive control showed a decent band, which means that we have successfully removed the genomic DNA out of our RNA-sample. (The small bands are primer-dimers.)
So with good expectation we started a new PCR to check if our plasmid DNA is completely removed with the following result:
Unfortunately it is pretty clear that the plasmid DNA is still present in the sample. Even with a good DNase treatment, which clearly works on the genomic DNA but it does not manage to break down the plasmid DNA.
So we did some troubleshooting and mailed to the company whose DNase treatment we’ve used. Apart from that we’ve also contacted dr. Basak Ozturk, who had some previous experience with qPCR on a plasmid region. Soon we discovered that doing a qPCR on plasmid DNA, especially a high copy number plasmid, is a very delicate case and almost impossible to remove the DNA contamination using regular DNase treatments.
26/08 – 30/08
Week 9: Overheating our brains
The troubleshooting goes on this week. We thought about a lot of different ways to solve our problem with the contaminating DNA, without damaging our precious and fragile RNA. But all of them were either too dangerous for our RNA, or impossible to do in the timeframe we had.
The only one were we might have a chance for success is doing a restriction digest, with an enzyme that cuts the fragments that will be amplified in the qPCR itself. This way the contaminating DNA will not be amplified while the cDNA will be correctly amplified and we could take unbiased conclusions. So we went looking for a good restriction enzyme that does the job perfectly for the 2 genes.

We are combining the lemon smell (limonene) with a sweet taste (either “diet” aspartame or “full-fat” glucose isomerise) and targeting the two to the microcompartment. The idea is to concentrate the flavours in the microcompartments and then purify them so that the bacterial metabolites do not end up in the final drink.
In vitro applications: it's a box, not a bug!
One final idea we would like to explore is to remove entirely from the equation any concerns about releasing genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. We will design our sphereactor so that it can be isolated and used for cell-free applications. For example, a single sphereactor could be filled with any number of enzymes - a complete multi-step pathway perhaps - but as a proteinaceous complex would be unable to modify or recombine with natural organisms.
Relevant, modern and cool software for all
In addition, through collaboration with expert applied computing scientists, we have developed software, which will help in the design and construction of our biobricks. They are also the ones responsible for the design of this superb website and two brilliant smartphone apps!

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," time interval between droplets and the given flow rate to calculate what the experimental volume is.
After comparing the experimental droplet volume to the theoretical droplet volume value at flow rates of 1 mL/hr, 2.5 mL/hr, 5 mL/hr, 7.5 mL/hr we learned two things:
The theoretical volume from the model was less than the experimental.
This difference, on average, increased with flow rate.
The droplet volumes were expected to be consistent across all flow rates and only change depending on tubing geometry and material. As flow rates increase, the interval between droplets decrease as the volume of the droplets should remain constant. We concluded that the model was not accounting for a series of parameters that would both contribute to the theoretical droplet volume and account for the dependence on flow rate.
A potential reason for the missing parameters is that the model assumed that the fluid is static instead of dynamic, due to the constant flow rate of fluid moving through the chip.1 In a dynamic model, the total droplet volume is characterized by the static volume and the pinching volume.1 The pinching volume is formed during the droplet’s fall when the droplet breaks off the tube.1
However, after researching the physical phenomenon behind dynamic droplets we realized that a complete dynamic model, as described in Zhang et al, requires complicated parameters, such as the fluid interface, making it difficult to implement.1 Therefore, we decided to create our dynamic model empirically by adding a correction factor, which would depend mainly on flow rate.
Zhang et al.
In order to determine the correction factor we ran a series of experiments to calculate experimental droplet sizes at 15 different flow rates, following the data collection method outlined earlier. The flow rates tested are 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 mL/hr. For statistical significance we measured 30 droplet volumes per flow rate by measuring the time interval between droplets, using the same method for droplet volume calculation mentioned above. Finally, the correction factor, C, was isolated in the dynamic model and was calculated using the experimentally calculated droplet volume and other parameters from the dynamic model. These calculations were performed in a MATLAB script. The average correction factor for the 30 droplets for each flow rate was then calculated to obtain a final set of 15 empirically C values to see how they differed between flow rates. The plots"

To calm down the excitement, Aachen organized a funny game of Jeopardy, building the perfect platform for Team Darmstadt to entertain the rest. We did our best, but were bested by Team Tübingen and their shadowy mastermind. In the evening, we had the chance to publicly present our project to a great crowd. But this was just the start for a joyful night to follow. After a few rounds of drinks organized by team Aachen, we went to the world famous Pontstraße, the place in Aachen that never sleeps... Rumour has it that a certain team had so much fun that they could not show up on the next day. On Sunday, guest speakers held lectures and the teams had the chance to present their project once more in greater detail to each other. It was nice and inspiring to see how the other teams that we don't regard as competitors anymore but as dear friends had progressed during the past months.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.

One way to compensate for that is to add other enzymes to the artificial metabolic pathway, in order to speed up             the second oxidation of HMF acid into FDCA.
An enzyme of interest, HMF dehydrogenase (Aldh1), is found to catalyse identical reaction as HmfH. This enzyme oxidizes             HMF into FDCA with HMF acid as a reaction intermediate. The Kcat of this enzyme on 5-HMF has been estimated to             5.1 mM-1.min-1 [8]. By acting synergically with HmfH, Aldh1 could limit the accumulation of HmfAcid.
HmfO protein structure
An other enzyme that may turn worthwhile for the biosynthesis of FDCA is HmfO (5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural Oxydase).             This enzyme is present in Methylovorus sp. and in C. basilensis. HmfO belongs to a C. basilensis HMF14 gene cluster involved in Hmf degradation pathway. HmfO and HmfH are homologous, they             both belongs to the GMC (glucose-methanol-choline) oxidoreductase proteins family. The N-ter GMC domain bind             to FAD, and release H2O2 as a byproduct [4]. However, unlike HmfH , HmfO needs three successive oxidations of             HMF to reach FDCA (fig 1.). Thereby two intermediary compounds are formed, 2,5-Furandicarboxaldehyde (furfural)             (DFF) and 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFA) [4].
Artificial metabolic pathway of oxidation of HMF into FDCA, using HmfH,HmfO and Aldh1 enzyms. Oxydation reactions                 imply the use of a FAD co-factor and the release of hydrogen peroxyde.
In order to obtain an efficient whole cell biocatalyst genes coding for the three previously described enzymes have             to be under control of a strong promoter. To maximize the expression of these proteins it was planned to put             them under control of promoter improved by freiburg 2011 iGem team and characterized by Slovenia HS 2015 iGem             team (BBa_K608002).

After talking with other iGEM teams, we were surprised by their work during the summer. China-Tongji iGEM team tried to make nematodes light-sensitive, which we thought was an amazing project. Although scientists had created light-sensitive mice, challenge remains expression of light-sensitive proteins. We also pointed out issues with ethics and safety for China-Tongji.
ZJU-China team made a funny biological playing card; this board game could help student learn much about synthetic biology. We advised them to make the board game easier to understand and design it with information that is more detailed so that public could accept it rather than biology students only.
NYU-Shanghai did a fantastic project; their work not only limited to synthetic biology but also involved applying knowledge and technologies from multiple subjects including electrical engineering, computer science and VR. We learned a lot from what they did on expanding human practices and thus designed LEGO project to show our genetic circuit and RNA thermometer. We wish this attempt would make our project to be easier to be understood by general public. Furthermore, we started to cooperate with them after the workshop. We provided several biobricks for them as support to finish their project.

To convert large amounts of blood while keeping the costs of the system low, we are planning to design a column based method. The resin is coated with specific conversion enzymes and donated blood can be pumped through the column. Blood which is moving through the resin is converted, while enzymes as well as other contaminants are not present in the donated blood (also see Figure).
The usage of a column design has several other advantages: if conversion after one passage is not complete the blood can be pumped through the column again and thus increase the incubation time of the enzyme to the blood. Even a circular device is thinkable, which cycles the blood for a defined number over the column until a sufficient conversion is achieved. This approach guarantees complete conversion while reducing protein consumption. Another advantage is the reusability of this system. One conversion column can be used several times, this reduces costs and improves efficiency of the system.
Taken all features together, T-ECO could help to overcome the shortage of highly demanded blood types and ultimately save lives.

The reason for choosing the first three parts is because they serve as a good point of comparison between parts with the same binding site.  We decided to transform the Zif activator + reporter simply because we had it available, because we had extra cells after the final centrifugation step, and because this activator had been characterized beforehand in the paper by Caroline Ajo-Franklin.
Resuspended in 0.75 mL before plating.  Then plated 200 uL on one half of each plate and 50 uL on the other half.  Placed in incubator at 6:00 pm.
Also note that because we needed a shaking incubator set to 30 degrees C, we were ultimately forced to turn down the temperature on the incubator that already contained the E. coli cultures from last night (promoters and shuttle vector).  This was done around 10 hr and 30 min into their incubation time.  The result will be a slowing of cell growth for these cultures, possibly also bringing them out of log phase.  As a result, it will be necessary to make glycerol stocks and to do minipreps a lot later tonight.  Note that the incubator was switched back to 37 degrees around the 14th hour.  The cells were then taken out of the incubator around 16 hr and 35 min after they had been put in.  Note that pRS303 showed no signs of growth.  Hopefully this is just due to the fact that the colony on the plate was not properly collected, instead of a sign of contamination on the plates.  In any case, successfully glycerol stocked p413_PCYC, p414_PADH, and p413_PTEF, making two stocks for each part from the same culture.

The importance of acknowledging that food comes from a limited source, is a part   of our project. We wish to highlight the limited source of food by presenting a solution to the   problem: Protein and essential fatty acids produced by a strain of E. coli. We hope that our project will lead   to a realization of the limited source of nutrition, and that this realization will be followed by a debate about introducing   nutrition produced by microorganisms and in addition, the acceptance of it.
The idea of generating nutrition from bacteria is a contradiction between the common opinion of how food  is produced and of finding a solution on obtaining food in the future. This means that the importance of   doing good research and including ethics and social aspects will have great impact on our iGEM project.
This project is our proposal for a solution to malnutrition. We intend to present a possible solution, but  we also aim at addressing the problem of malnutrition and the upcoming dilemma of obtaining food for   everybody in a future with more, and more people to share this world.

Note that the gRNA for Cas9 from Qiu et al., 2018 was instead 21 bases long (15 and 6): we decided to add one more base at the end to completely match the length of the miRNA.
We can notice that also in this design the spacer has to coincide with the reverse complement of let-7a (as for Cas 9) . The template of the gRNA for Cas12a would therefore be:
5'-[scaffold]-[reverse complement of miRNA]-3'
Probes for Cas12a
From the template above we can therefore conclude that the gRNA for our Cas 12a system, designed as the one for Cas 9 from Deng et al., 2014 , has to be:
5’-(UAAUUUCUACUAAGUGUAGAU)AACUAU|ACAACCUACUACCUCA-3’   [gRNA sequence]
From the specifications for the probe above (10 bases small loop, 16 bases large loop) and from the gRNA sequence, the template amplicon therefore needs to have the following structure:
5’-ATAGTTNNNNNNNNNNNNTTTNAACTATACAACCTACNNNTGAGGTAGTAGGTTGT-3’  [amplicon template]
We then proceeded to define the bases for the Ns, aiming not to have unwanted minor secondary structures (e.g. smaller loops) in the loops. This was done mostly by considering pairing principles, e.g. avoiding non-Watson-Crick interaction (e.g. T-G) which might be thermodynamically favoured or trying not to have complementary bases with more than 1 base in between (which might lead to hairpin loops). In all cases, the minimum free energy structure (MFE) was plotted by means of the available software (NUPACK, Mfold), both for the amplicon and the probe - i.e. its reverse complement-, to check that the intended dumbbell shape was indeed achieved.
This lead us to the sequence of Probe 1 and Probe 6 (Probes from 2 to 5 were the probes for Cas 9 from Deng et al., 2014 and Qiu et al., 2018 ).

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," sequencing, it was deduced that a region of the plasmid containing both the promoter and the BioBrick prefix had vanished. To circumvent this inconvenient cloning two other promoters, that are constitutive in E. coli, were examined, namely the PenI-regulated, BBa_R0074 , and the Mnt-regulated, BBa_R0073 , promoters. By performing fluorescence microscopy on composite parts of the promoters controlling yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), BBa_I6102 , and BBa_I6103 , respectively, the expression levels were assessed. The obtained results revealed that the PenI-regulated promoter facilitated very strong expression of the marker gene, whereas the expression controlled by the Mnt-regulated promoter was noticeably lower. Based on these findings, the photocontrol device was placed under the control of the PenI-regulated promoter instead of the strong constitutive promoter from the constitutive promoter family. As it turned out, this cloning likewise emerged difficult. After several attempts, it was decided to focus on the other aspects of the dormancy system.
Regulation of the OmpR-dependent Promoter Required a Low Copy Vector
The first construct containing the genes required for the light-induced dormancy was designed as shown in Figure 1. As the conducted modelling clarified, the necessity for stringent regulation of the RelE and RelB expression, the properties of the OmpR-regulated promoter were studied thoroughly. To assess the functionality of the OmpR-regulated promoter in practice, a reporter system containing the OmpR-regulated promoter controlling RFP was cloned into the E. coli strain MG1655 ΔOmpR. The phenotype of the resulting cultures revealed a dysregulation of the OmpR-regulated promoter. Thorough research lead to the finding that the OmpR-dependent promoter is not controllable when cloned on a high copy vector. As the modelling revealed, and which is evident from Figure 2-Main-Page
, a relatively low expression of RelE is required to induce dormancy, whereas high expression levels quickly result in overshooting. Since the OmpR-regulated promoter is an integrated part of the light sensing system, replacement is not an option. Therefore, the variability of the relE gene copy number was studied, and it was found that the OmpR-regulated promoter should be cloned into the bacterial chromosome or a low copy vector to obtain proper regulation Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al.

Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

-KP Today we decided to stick with the cholera project. I am glad, because at first I was slightly disappointed when I realized that our project wasn’t as novel as I originally thought, but I am still very interested. Today we realized that the most important thing that we can do now is to find a way to disrupt the biofilm from the outside. I found a summary article on using phage against biofilms and each one of us chose a few article to read in order to understand the best ways to tackle the problem. I like the idea the paper that Kendall cited above that talks about bacteriophage that have been engineered to express enzymes that degrade the biofilm. I think that that is a good approach because we can combine our findings with the phage group and have a great presentation. Also, there is a lot of research that I have found from the papers that I have read suggesting that it is very possible to do what we will be trying to do.

To let more people learn about biology, we went to elementary school and brought the latest biological knowledge to the children there.
Public engagement
While conducting our experimental projects, we also actively organized or participated in communications with other iGEM teams. Through learning exchange activities again and again, we continued to draw on one of the parties and eventually improved our project.

Software tools
After consulting with several fermentation engineering experts and conducting field research, we found that how to screen out the optimal wiring method is the most important thing in establishing cell engineering. So, in order to achieve the goal of the cell factory, we modeled the metabolic pathway of Yarrowia lipolytica and finally designed an available software, which can obtain the corresponding optimal metabolic by simply inputting and outputting data.
iGEM popularizationls
In the process of communicating with the outside world, we found that synthetic biology is still only a few people's carnival, which is still unattainable for most ordinary people. So we have organized many science education activities, not only describing our project to the public, but also popularizing science education and promoting iGEM. In this process, we gained a lot of partners, and under our promotion, we were honored to guide Jinshan High School to participate in next year's iGEM.
Social work
After our research and analysis, we found that most people are looking forward to synthetic biology, but they also have concerns. So, we need a more suitable entry point to integrate synthetic biology into more people's lives instead of boring presentation. In order to keep up with the footsteps of the Internet era, we rely on WECHAT to develop a set of emojis that can be applied to normal life, hoping to bring the distance between synthetic biology and ordinary people closer, and attract them to understand the interest of biology. We are very happy that this set of emojis has been well received by students."

In addition, all members must pass the university courses for WHMIS, general laboratory safety, biosafety and autoclave handling prior to entering in the lab.
Public safety: The strains that we use in the lab are non-pathogenic. Although we do genetically modify the organisms that we use, they never could possibly make it into the external environment due to the fact that we use decontamination techniques such as autoclaving and bleaching. The organisms that we modify may contain genes that are less advantageous than those seen in wild type strains, as we occasionally knock out genes that have an impact on the metabolism of the organism, such as genes that pertain to adenine metabolism. There are no risks to the biosecurity of different groups of people. The modifications that we make to the organisms that we use in the lab could not possibly cause the organisms to become pathogenic.
Environmental safety: The genes that we modify in the organisms that we use typically impact their metabolic processes such that they are not as ""fit"" as the same strains in the external environment. The wastes that we dispose are autoclaved first before they are disposed of. The phenol and chloroform waste that our lab produces is shipped to another facility that is designed to handle chemical waste. Overall, the amounts of phenol and chloroform that are used within the lab are so small that there should not be any environmental repercussions if they were to escape from the lab without being sent to a chemical handling facility first.
In order to reduce these risks, we only work with organisms that are of a level one biosafety containment, meaning that they are non-pathogenic. In order to fully assure that the organisms that we do use within the lab do not make their way out of it, we decontaminate any live samples that are used once we are finished with them. This also includes antibiotics, which we sterilize in order denature them so that they do not have any harmful effects on the environment. We do so through the use of sterilization techniques such as autoclaving. Our lab in general is very secure (ie. An access card is required to get into the lab, any side-entrances into the building are locked after hours, and there are security guards stationed within the building,) so there is a very low chance that any malicious persons will obtain access to the genetically modified organisms that are present within our lab.

Neptune (feat. HEK 293)
Putting Biology in Our Chips: Part 1
On our first visit to the MIT iGEM team's lab, we were testing a device with an input, and output, and a pair of valves surrounding cell traps in between. The design and fabrication of this device utilized our Neptune user interface, and proves it is capable of designing and manufacturing microfluidic devices for lab use. In the experiment (as further detailed on the collaborations page), we pulled ethanol solution, buffer solution, and cells through our microfluidic chip. In order to flow these liquids, we opened the (by default closed) valves with our servo-syringe combination pumps, utilizing our hardware and firmware in the process. The successful valve operation proves the proper functioning of our fluid controlling hardware, and the firmware which controls. After flowing cells through, we detached the microfluidic device from the control hardware (shutting the valves), and were able to see masses of HEK293 cells moving inside the valved off segment of the chip. Unfortunately, this evidence was only caught by eye and not on camera. However, we did capture images of the device under the microscope seen below.
Putting Biology in Our Chips: Part 2
Our second visit with the MIT iGEM team occurred within a week of the first and iterated on the previous design, highlighting the rapid prototyping made possible with the Neptune microfluidic workflow. This prototyping could have occurred even faster, as Neptune's the design and fabrication procedures take less than half a workday to complete, but both team's busy iGEM schedules were not that flexible. This design removed the controlling valves and pumps from the previous design, and replaced the cell traps with a diamond chamber meant to slow fluid flow at it's relatively wide center, allowing the HEK293 to attach to our device. Seen below, we captured evidence of the cells surviving and starting to multiple inside of our device."

Background
Recently, techniques have been developed that afford researchers the ability to control gene expression with light. To date, sensors that respond to red, green, and blue wavelengths of light have been reported. Light induced expression of genes has a number of advantages over chemical induction methods.  For example, light induced expression is cheaper than chemical methods, can be used to finely tune expression levels through modulations of intensity, and can be rapidly removed -- a feature lacking in chemical induction systems. Furthermore, many light expression systems are reversible, depending on the wavelength of light used.  Finally, the ability to control the expression levels of multiple genes of interest simultaneously could have far reaching implications for tuning biosynthetic pathways. The use of chemical inducers for this application would likely prove to be difficult and cost prohibitive, but multichromatic gene induction represents a potential solution to this problem. To this end, the 2013 University of Washington iGEM team chose to continue a project we began in 2012 that is aimed at the development and characterization of a set of tools that bring multichromatic gene expression into the realm of possibility for synthetic biologists.
In 2012, the University of Washington iGEM Team developed a freely available app for the Android operating system that affords spatiotemporal control over light wavelengths and intensities. When installed on an appropriate tablet (see E.Colight ) the app could be useful for carrying out complex light induced expressions. In 2012, we were unable to fully characterize the app’s ability to control expression of light inducible genes. Thus, the 2013 iGEM Team’s goals include fully characterizing the app’s ability to control gene expression with light, and the development of a toolkit of light induced expression biobricks that are confirmed to work with the tablet app.

School of Life Sciences, USTC
The School of Life Sciences was founded by Bei shizhang，a renowned scientist in Beijing in 1958 with emphasis on Biophysics at beginning and flourished to many branches of biological sciences in recent years. The new School of Life Sciences was established in Hefei, AnHui province in 1998 and the founding dean was Prof. Shi Yunyu, a member of Chinese Academy of Sciences. It consists of four departments: Molecular and Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Biophysics, Systems Biology and Biomedicine and Biotechnology. For scientific research, the School of Life Sciences has established a Center for Laboratory Techniques of Life Sciences and a division under National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale. Moreover, there are two students practice bases which are located in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province and Shengjing Lake, Anhui province.
At present, there are eighty-seven teachers in the School of Life Sciences, forty-two of them are professors (including two academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and fifteen of them are associate professors. All professors and associate professors are responsible for various aspects of teaching and research. They are providing various courses for undergraduates, graduates and PhD candidates. The teachers in the School Life Sciences are running many research projects, including general and key projects from National Science Foundation of China, key projects from the knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, projects of the National Basic Research (973), projects of the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863), and the Major Program for the Fundamental Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. More than 70% of the professors are recruited from overseas in recent years. Twenty-two of them are honored as “One Hundred Talented People” of The Chinese Academy of Sciences, eight of them are honored as China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, three of them are ChangJiang River scholar award scheme professors.
Presently, there are about 400 undergraduate students, 400 graduate students and 200 PhD candidates in our school. Because of the strong backgrounds in life sciences, our graduated students are playing more and more important roles in high education of scientific research both at homeland and abroad. Some of them have made prominent contributions to national sciences and were honored by various awards and medals from academic societies. Three doctoral dissertations were honored as the Awards for National 100 Excellent PHD Thesis. Four doctoral dissertations were honored as the Excellent PhD Thesis of the"

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.
Degradation tag is a useful part in synthetic biology. It can be attached to any protein and then help engineer controllable protein degradation. This year, to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K133900"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Bioinformatics_-_-_TEXT.html," simulations are only simulations and sometimes may not be able to perfectly represent nature. Even though the MD models are by now quite sophisticated, they cannot always easily be applied to every protein. However, the boundaries of molecular dynamics simulations are shown, when complex geometry and binding angles are supposed to be simulated. Often those calculations are not correct or not even calculated at all, hence the simulation lacks certain interactions.
As the structure suggests, BoNTC has several forces acting in many different directions, rendering MD simulations difficult. In our case especially all kinds of forces played vital roles. The two times positively charged, for the toxic functions essential, zinc ion, interacts through electrostatic forces. However, as explained earlier, electrostatic forces are only a small part of the real interactions. The zinc ion is in reality also influenced by geometrical conditions, which were not simulated in the molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, there aren't many force fields available which can model metal ions and interactions with metal ions. As a result we were very limited in our choices of force fields. We thought of parameterizing a different force field specifically for metal ions and BoNTC, but quickly noticed that this would be far beyond the scope of the relatively short project time of iGEM.
Our results and extensive documentation of many different attempts summarize the current state of molecular dynamics simulations of complex proteins and the experimental field of theoretical structural biology in general. Molecular dynamics simulations, although a very powerful concept, can often lead to time consuming trial and error phases, where it is not guaranteed that a working configuration is finally found.

At the meantime, Binglin Liu contacted with bio companies to buy related reagents. The role Jianzhe Yang played in the experiment was mainly to finish the construction and verification of vectors.
➤ Plasmids Construction
Licong He , Jianzhe Yang and Demin Xu were mainly responsible for plasmids construction. They constructed all the plasmids needed for the project, which were transformated into tobacco by agrobacterium. They also constructed biological bricks. In addition, Licong He completed the construction of the mutants and biological bricks of the mutants.
➤ Plant Tissue Culture
Ang Chen and Wei Liu were mainly responsible for plant tissue culture and agrobacterium-mediated tobacco transformation. They tried hard to make the plant in good condition and kept the providing of the plant material. After vector construction, they begun to transform these vectors to the plants and screened out positive plants. They also made the hydroponics to get data for detecting the conversion of TCP to GLY in vivo. By the way, the cooperation with Zhejiang University was done by them.
➤ Positive Detection
Mengyao Li and Xilin Suo were mainly responsible for positive detection including extracting the genomic DNA or RNA of NT, and reversing transcription. Also they did partial enzyme assay to support data for modeling.
➤ Enzyme Assay
Tingting Dong, Yuhong Wang and Demin Xu were mainly responsible for enzyme assay. They detected the multi-enzyme conversion of TCP in transgenic tobacco by gas chromatograph, and used the leaves of transgenic tobacco to detect enzymes activity in vitro. The method of hydroponics was also used to detect the conversion of TCP to GLY in vivo.

pursued secret side experiment___hold your breath
Trang-Anh's day
Got the codon counter to work (yay!) and ran the analysis on the monster. Obtained marchy codon table.
Looking at codon table: c preferred at the end of codons and c-g sites frequent, as in Arabidopsis.
Wrote up on the bioinformatics progress so far.
Will
Enhancer trap experimental design. Vector for random integration of minimal promoter into Marchy genome designed, and primers acquired. Jim gave me his vector for amplification of the minimal promoter (NB: it's an Arabidopsis promoter- although surely there must be some degree of homology between Eukaryotas, and *definitely* among plants). Ideally need Bernardo's vector as well. Primers arrive on Friday; will make vector then.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#microtubule_-_-_TEXT.html," have already combined with GTP, which is essential for polymerization to happen. The enzymes and ions needed for the polymerization process are all optimal and held constant.
We are using a relatively complex model to study the dynamical behaviors of a microtubule population in a closed system. To simplify our calculations, we view a microtubule as a one-dimensional molecular chain, since the fact that it is composed of 13 protofilaments (Amos and Klug, 1974) does not have an essential impact on the formulation of our model. However, later we will use this information along with the fact that each tubulin dimer is about $8 \ \text{nm}$ long (Chrétien et al., 1995; Burns, 1995) to transfer the number of tubulin dimers in a microtubule to its length.
Polymerization can take place at both ends (the ""+"" end and the ""-"" end) of the microtubule. While only tubulin dimers that are combined with GTP (denoted Tu-GTP) can assemble onto the end of a microtubule, both Tu-GTP and Tu-GDP can depolymerize into the solution, although with different rate constants. The model also considers other processes involved, such as nucleation, GTP hydrolysis on microtubules and the regeneration of Tu-GTP in the solution.
Using a stochastic approach to chemical kinetics (Mcquarrie, 1967), we can capture the above dynamical processes in our model. With the parameters given by Walker et al. (1988), we can do Monte Carlo simulations to study the problems we are interested in.
Next, we shall give a detailed description of how our model is constructed. This part is folded for the convenience of those who are not interested in the technical details. Click on the arrow below to view the complete text.
Experimental data typically takes the form of rate constants, which are macroscopic descriptors of chemical processes. To do simulations on the individual microtubules, we have to transfer these data to a microscopic level. We shall now explain how this transformation can be done.
Chemical reactions first require the collision between molecules, and this collision can be viewed as a Markovian process. Therefore, chemical reactions themselves are Markovian processes. For instance, let us look at a simple reaction between two molecules:
\[   A+B{\rightarrow}C   \]
From the theory of molecule collisions, we can define $\pi_{AB}$ as the probability that molecule $A$ and $B"

SCUT-China_A,2017,Team:SCUT-China A#Project Lysis_-_-_TEXT.html,". coli with mercury detecting device can merely                     lyse after we added Hg2+, and did not cause the same effect. Consequently, this device’s specificity                     is good. (figure 7.)
         The result of cadmium detecting device’s specificity experiment was that this                     device’s ion response was not obvious in the lysis, which may be caused by misoperation.
Conclusion
        Combining the lysis module and detecting module, we have constructed five devices corresponding to different                     metal ions, which have been proved by the lysis experiment that three of them, mercury detecting device( BBa_K2360008 ),                     cadmium detecting device( BBa_K2360010 ) and lead detecting device( BBa_K2360011 ), had the ability to make                     a response to its corresponding metal ion. What’s more the mercury detecting and the lead detecting devices                     performed an obvious specificity. And we found out the response speed of SRRz gene is faster than GFP.                     So we have created three efficient devices for metal ion detecting.

NAME NAME
Product Description
'Sporal Up Ready' is a fungal pesticide that will keep your fruit and vegetables safe from insect attack.
The user can cultivate the fungus to attack specific parasites. All you have to do is catch some of the undesirable critters you want the system to target. Now treat the fungi cells with a special substrate which makes the genetic variation of the mushroom very flexible, and add the parasite to the contamination component of ""Sporal Up Ready"". The fungus then changes its genetic property to specialize its liking to that specific parasite. After 20 days or more one of the parasites will be successfully infected by the fungus and will die a pain-free death as a result of a fungal growth in its head. This provides you with a special fungus for further spore production. One such fungus is enough to protect hundreds of fruits and vegetables and give you a better garden, naturally!
This revolutionary new product combines only the best moss abilities: crush resistance, fast growth, moisture absorption and disinfection. 'kokoromo' is a reliable partner for every occasion in your home, be it as an indicator for fungi, as a dryer for wet walls or a cleaner to reduce allergic illnesses.
In addition, the dying parasitic insects will decompose in your garden, providing a fertile dung and helping your plants to grow stronger.
Technical Description
We engineered a complex parasite recognition genepool we introduced into fungi. Bringing the fungi in contact with any parasites leads to recombination of certain genes in that pool and thereby to evolution of parasite recognition systems directly inside the fungi. Thereby, a specialized detection and defense from any parasite, even very unusual parasites, is enabled.

TAS_Taipei,2015,Team:TAS Taipei#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html," was sandwiched between two LB agar layers, but covering only half of the area. Bacteria carrying a GFP generator device was streaked onto the top LB layer. After allowing growth overnight, we checked the presence of GFP on the clean bottom layer (under blue light). GFP was only seen where the membrane did not cover the bottom gel.
After showing that bacteria cannot pass through the membrane, we needed to test whether the proteins could actually move across the membrane. We placed our membrane in a Buchner funnel over a filter flask (Figure 18). Liquid cultures were prepared and pulled through the membrane using a vacuum.  For our experiment, we set up 3 groups: (A) lysed cells releasing free GFP; (B) E. coli cells expressing GFP; (C) LB without bacterial cells. Each group was filtered through the 0.2 um pore membrane and the filtrate was collected. When the filtrate was exposed to blue light, only the group that contained lysed cells glowed (Figure 19). This shows that proteins passed through the membrane.
Figure 18. Testing protein permeability through our 0.2 um membrane. We set up three cultures with (A) containing lysed bacteria and free GFP, (B) containing bacteria expressing GFP, (C) LB with no bacteria growth.
Figure 19. Proteins are able to pass through the membrane. After the filtrate was collected, (A) shows free GFP travelled through the membrane, (B) shows that bacteria containing GFP did not pass through the membrane, (C) the negative control for the experiment showed no florescence.
Building and Testing the Bandage Prototype
We built the entire bandage prototype, and found that the semi-permeable membrane used successfully keeps bacteria inside the bandage in our final product (Figure 20).
Figure 20. We built and tested the bandage prototype. Bacteria carrying a GFP generator device was streaked onto a thin layer of LB agar. This was sandwiched between the semi-permeable membrane and an outer hydrocolloid covering. Under blue light, green fluorescence could be seen inside the bandage (circled in red), but not on the bottom LB agar.
Microneedles
Figure 21. Use of microneedles might help with delivery of our GzmB inhibitor into the body. Microneedles are an option that can help delivery of our protein through the skin. This may be used before applying our bandage to target deeper areas, such as arthritic joints.

“A” indicates antioxidant, and can also                     represent the best in the grade rating. So the core of our project is to build an antioxidant                     detecting system to rank antioxidants.
Antioxidants are
compounds that inhibit                     oxidation.They can scavenge the excess ROS in the organisms. The antioxidants mentioned here is the                     one working in our bodies, helping us defect the damage of oxidation.
Oxidation damage is very common in our daily                     life. It may be caused by UV in the sun, unhealthy living habits, irregular work and rest times,                     and its accumulation will eventually infect the normal function of our body, lead to gene mutation,                     cell cancer and aging. Therefore, antioxidants are urgently needed to defended the damage of                     oxidation.
Even though antioxidant is so important,                     there’s no standard ways to tell us which antioxidant works better.
Our goal is to build a system with function                     of detecting the antioxidants and has the advantages of high biological relevance, simple                     operation, low-cost, good reproducibility, accuracy, and high sensitivity for antioxidant                     detection. More importantly, we hope to establish an efficient standard for evaluating antioxidants                     through our system"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the"

This discards the potential expressional inhibition effects to to binding of the fusion complex. Furthermore, we took along some controls including Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which is present by default on iGEM backbone vectors (pSB1K3). Together with blue phenotype, this resulted into a purple colony phenotype.

When transforming the donor DNA plasmid (BBa_K2643011) into E. coli DH5α and selecting on medium complemented with chloramphenicol and kanamycin, we observed formation of red colonies. This indicates that the kanamycin cassette, as well as the RFP cassette were intact and functional. The sequence verification confirmed both sequences were intact and oriented as desired. DH5α was not able to grow on LB+Kan+Cam, and demonstrates the negative control.
The MEs of the donor DNA (BBa_K2643011) were also sequence verified and confirmed to be located as designed, but we were not able to show that they were recognized and that the donor DNA was integrated, neither in a targeted nor a non-targeted manner. Surviving colonies demonstrated development of purple phenotype, sometimes requiring several days (figure 16), while going through an interesting metamorphosis of color changes. Based on the evaluated controls, it is very likely that a purple phenotype was due to the presence of the original RFP-containing template plasmid used for creating the linear donor DNA sequence. The RFP cassette was kept on the plasmid to observe this deviant purple color to identify growing false positives. These colonies survived in the presence of"

Today we started the experiment for bioaccumulation. The main idea is to let the bacteria let bacteria E. coli DH5α with our construction (BB_Essential + K346004) in liquid medium and after, quantify how much mercury is on nutritive medium and how much it has inside the bacteria. This is due to the bacteria capacity to accumulate mercury inside it.
For that, it was tested four different concentrations (0.5 ug/ml; 0.25 ug/ml; 0.1ug/ml; 0.05ug/ml) besides of a sample without mercury. We used as control the same bacteria linage with a gene not related to mercury metabolism (GFP) to analyze the influence of the mercury binding proteins naturally expressed by bacteria.
The procedures were made based on bio detection’s procedures. We also continued the validation and characterization of our parts regarding to genetic-molecular level.
Backing to the rigorous digestions of our bio bricks with the following system for BB_Essential + E0840, BB_Essential + K346004 and BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation:

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"R has evolutionary conservation in many gram-negative bacteria, which enables E. coli to receive AHL from other bacteria. Thus we                                 engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentially                                 amplified results.
To achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by                                 Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters. And in Bacteria                                 II, LuxR will be directly expressed regulated by lac operon, triggered by IPTG. With                                 treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be constitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex will                                 initiate the expression of required genes.
Second Level Amplification                                 Module
In addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically                                 engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.
In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux,                                 then express cI derived from λ phage. Since cI is a highly efficient repressor that is a                                 low concentration of cI will completely repress the efficiency of λ promoter. As a result,                                 EGFP will be drastically and negatively regulated when treated with antibiotic                                 substances.
It is notable that this second level amplification module won't directly expand the signal                                 intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different                                 antibiotic concentration gradients. Our theoretical modeling also illustrate a higher                                 resolution implementing this amplification circuit.
Integrative                                 Modification on Bacterial Permeability
Our ROSE construction is systematically not only include quorum sensing and logic                                 amplification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system                                 and overexpression of exogenous porin. Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact                                 with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the                                 center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.
Porin: OprF from Pseudomonus aeruginosa Porins are beta barrel                                 proteins crossing a celluar membrane and act as a pore through which molecules are able                                 to diffuse.
In E. coli different porins, for example OmpF and OmpC is expressed endogenously                                 in different situations for different molecules. But these natural occurring porines are                                 only permeable for molecules like sugars smaller than 600 Da. And more importantly,                                 implement of micF, an antisense ncRNA may inhibit the material diffusion through OmpF. Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small                                 molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from Pseud"

A mini-game of “How to build your own MFC” was also introduced to test the public’s understanding of our project after our thorough demonstration and explanations using posters and real models.
Poster shown in the exhibition:
Other than public education on synthetic biology and MFC as a renewable energy, this exhibition also serves the purpose of initiating discussions and collect opinions through our survey on concerns that the public has when choosing renewable energy. Results from this survey will be used for the team to prioritize the area of focus for our MFC improvement.
When designing our survey, we have considered the fact that most of the public involved in the survey do not have the same level of knowledge of renewable energy. Therefore, our survey is designed such that it includes,
A short video in both Chinese and English to provide the public with the basic knowledge on how each renewable energy (wind energy, solar energy, and bioenergy) available in Hong Kong functions and each of their limitations.

Chinese Version
Pre and post video questions set based on 4 major groups of concerns:
Environmental damage
Impacts on human health
Production constraints
Cost to society
The pre video questions take on the assumption that the public has little or no knowledge to how each renewable energy functions. The question of concern only identifies the broad issues on whether the public value environment, health, production, or society the most.
Post video questions listed out the mentioned limitations of each renewable energy and ask specifically how the public values each limitation. These questions will trigger the inner thoughts for the public to identify the areas they concern when choosing energy. This should be done before they choose a specific type on energy. This part of the survey would allow us to select an area of focus when modifying our MFC since we cannot modify every aspect of the project due to the time constraints and financing.
If the pre and post video answers are different when grouped to our identified grouping in section 2, the answers might suggest the need for education before we implement a new kind of renewable energy, especially for MFC when it requires engineered microorganisms. The differences might also be due to the fact that there are views to the issues that they did not consider.
The final question on the actual type of energy should tell us which kind of energy would the public prefer and, therefore, allow us to estimate how acceptable is using MFC as one of the energy source in Hong Kong.
