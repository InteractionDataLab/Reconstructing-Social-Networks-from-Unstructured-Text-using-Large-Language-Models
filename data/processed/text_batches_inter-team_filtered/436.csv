We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment"

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

Background
“All of the 2016 iGEM teams are invited and encouraged to participate in the Third International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.” Our team took part in this study with the aimed to standardize the measurements of fluorescence in different labs. The main task was to quantify expression of GFP in common, comparable or absolute units. In our case, we measured fluorescence using plate reader.
Design
Fluorescence is widely used as a proxy for promoter activity by expressing fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite this is an indirect measurement, it provides a useful insight into expression levels and has significant advantage that it could be a real-time monitor without disrupting cells.
Fluorescence/OD600 is routinely used to give an adjustment of the relative expression per cell.
Morever, we aim to contain instrument variability, at least to some degree, by measuring a standard scattering solution of a mono-dispersed silica suspension (LUDOX). The objective is to see if a simple, single fixed-point measurement can be used as a ratiometric adjustment to provide greater uniformity in fluorescence/OD600 measurements across sites.

P. putida clones bearing miniTn7BB-Gm insertions were selected on LB plates supplemented with Gm (and chloramphenicol when mating was used). Viable counts were also performed in both experiments, and plasmid transformation efficiency was determined using the gentamycin resistant replicative plasmid pBBR1mcs-5 in the electroporation experiment. The results are shown in Table 1.

.
The results clearly show that the gentamycin-resistance marker was acquired by P. putida KT2440 by both electrotransformation and conjugation, suggesting that the transposon was transferred to this non-enterobacterial recipient. In the electroporation experiment, the efficiency was low, with only 70 potential insertions per μg plasmid DNA, despite the fact that the strain had become very competent as shown by the high transformation efficiency achieved with a replicative plasmid. On the other hand, transposition frequency in the mating experiment was quite high, suggesting that conjugation may be a more efficient means to transfer the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon to P. putida. Similar results were obtained with the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon borne in the commercial plasmid pMA (Mr. Gene). Interestingly, conjugative transfer of pUC18 or pMA has not been described, and a transfer origin is not documented for any of these vectors. Similar frequencies and efficiencies have been obtained with other miniTn7 delivery plasmids, such as those of the pBK-miniTn7 series ( Koch et al., 2001 ) (Fernando Govantes, personal communication"

Human Practices
With More Humanities, Do More Practices.
In order to understand the extent of the public’s understanding of biology and synthetic biology for planning our Human Practices, we interviewed hundreds of citizens before our projects started. We hope that we can learn the current social situation and get the project inspiration. From the investigation, the problems existing will make our Human Practices significant and targeted. The feedback we received for using will push our project closer to the public.
During the interviews, we asked 3 different questions:
Question1: How much do you know about Biology?
Question2: What is your attitude towards Synthetic Biology?
Question3: What advantages do you want DNA storage to have?
There is no doubt that we will get lots of different feedback. We aimed at getting in touch with more and more people, understanding what they are interested in, making clear what they misunderstand. The results of investigation are showed below.
Fig.1.The degree of understanding pie chart.
In order to know the situation in different age groups, we conducted a more detailed statistical analysis of the survey results. This helped us to take different approaches to people of different ages.
Fig.2.The degree of different ages understanding bar chart.
We can see, the situation is serious. It’s very important and necessary to change it. In this summer, we tried our best to spread the knowledge about Biology and influence more people. As iGEM spirit encouraged us, we are willing to drive more people to learn biology.
Our Approach
During the interview and investigation, we found that many misunderstandings existed in the society nowadays. Even though the problem is universal while our strength is thin, we tried to solve it from little things we can do. Sometimes, little things have large effect.
STEP 01, Propaganda
""Science for all"" is a central concept in contemporary science education.
We decided to talk to the public about the knowledge of synthetic biology to understand their views and attitudes towards synthetic biology. There is a wide range of people in community, including people from different industries and people of all ages. So community is a certain representative place to do propaganda. In the meantime, we took forms of posters publicity and leaflets distribution to exert more profound and durable"
SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"axanthin product at present, So we should enhance the propaganda.
According to the data which we have got from investigation, we can see that most people are now holding a neutral attitude on development of GMO, so it's possible that we can help them to learn more about transgenic and dispel their qualm, thus making more people accept GMO products. So as to achieve this aim, we designed a series of interesting activities.

     For negative data, we chose the sequences which are not antimicrobial peptides and the sequences length should be around 30 to 300 amino acids. The amount of these random selection is the same as the amount of positive datasets. Therefore, the ratio between positive and negative would be 1:1.
     Next, all the datasets were mixed together, 2/3 for training and 1/3 for testing. After training, we got a threshold and the score of each amino acid sequence. Then we can calculate the score of any peptide through this scoring card.
     At last, comparing the score of peptides with threshold, we can easily determine whether the unknown peptide might have the function of inhibiting bacteria’s growth.
Figure 1: Scoring card of antimicrobial peptide.
The more blue the dipeptide the less likely it is antimicrobial, the more red the dipeptide, the more likely it is antimicrobial.

The smaller the overlap area, the more precise the peptide prediction model is.

Voluntary
Frankly speaking, popular science about biology is quite inadequate, causing many students in rural areas unable to scratch the surface of biology until senior high. As a result, during the summer vacation, our team members went to three country schools in Jiangxi and Ningxia Province for volunteer work and brought biology to younger students.
BNU-China organized a seminar class and shared anecdotes about biotechnology with children from several villages. In the active class, team members held a heated discussion involving transgenosis and environmental protection that people concerned and we got established a long-term friendly relation of cooperation with OUC-China, who helped us with the comic book about synthetic biology. The book exhibited the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, making it more easier for students initial contact. Besides daily activities, we also conducted an interview about their fancy ways of education. Most students responded that they were looking forward to participating in scientific experiments, but had laboured under the disadvantage of not having enough equipment. Their words went directly to the heart, finding their support in the understanding. Grown up in cities, we had no idea of strong thirst for knowledge of rural children. From then on, we were deeply determined to create a revolutionary new way of science popularization, ameliorating the poor condition and offering these lovely students opportunities to a better future.
e-SAM
Having been back to our laboratory, we held a series of conferences, coming up with ideas on how to popularize synthetic biology intended for demonstrations at low cost.At the beginning, we planned to help students to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology in the means of lecture, but soon changed our mind for the teaching practice with local high school students who reported that this form would be boring for the public. Then we thought of, a mimic electrocircuitt relying on the gene pathway would offer a great advantage of viewable and intuitive understanding of the core idea of synthetic biology. And it can inspire people to participate in gene-designing process.
As a result, we used e-SAM© system, an ideal analog model to expound the definition of synthetic biology, applying engineering structures to build artificial biological systems for research, engineering and medical applications. We also drafted a detailed description of experiments that can be performed with e-SAM© system as well as suggestions for customers. The one-to-one match between e-SAM© system and the biology parts are shown below.

Before performing in vivo experiments in yeast an in vitro assay was implemented. For this the three enzyme pathway leading to PDV was reconstructed, testing VioA, VioB and VioE. To enable the best conditions for the enzymes, the pathway was studied intensively and all needed cofactors were calculated and added to the in vitro reaction (see protocol prodeoxyviolacein in vitro assay ). This included FAD, MgCl2, catalase for decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and the substrate L-tryptophan. The in vitro reaction was followed by qualitative analysis via HPLC and mass spectrometry.
Design Rules For Genome Engineering Regarding Customization of Peroxisome Properties
In order to reach the ultimate goal of creating a fully controllable artificial compartment, genome engineering can be utilized for customizing the compartment's properties,.These include aspects such as membrane permeability, size/number, or decoupling of peroxisomes from the cytoskeleton, the peroxisomal proteome or metabolome. In our project we used the Crispr Cas9 system for knocking out several genes (Pex9, Pex31&Pex32, INP1, POT1) at the same time in order to engineer the previously mentioned properties. Furthermore, we designed a yeast strain  with a completely replaced protein-import machinery for controlling the entire peroxisomal lumen.
For the future one could think of much more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering with a final goal of a “minimal peroxisome” by redirecting metabolic pathways through changing the protein-localization-signal in the yeast genome. Additionally, endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment for establishing a customized metabolism specifically tailored for the user's application.
Introduction
In order to achieve a fully controllable artificial compartment, the first step was to design a completely orthogonal import system. Next was the knockout of endogenous import systems. However, a few proteins are imported neither by the Pex5 nor the Pex7 import machinery. Therefore, specific genome engineering designs, such as knockouts, deleting or redirecting the protein localization could be utilized for the ultimate goal of creating a synthetic organelle.
Additionally, knockouts or genome integrations enable customization of the peroxisomal properties, such as membrane permeability, size/number, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton and the peroxisomal metabolism.
All these strategies allow a rational design of an artificial compartment, which is fully engineerable regarding "

It provided a better appreciation for the process of learning and discovery, and also the limitations and frustrations of a novice scientist. Since the project Joanna and I are brainstorming is a visual and interactive piece that is focused on outreach, our assumed audience is the inexperienced scientist. So, many of the same feelings and trepidations we had in the lab are probably also the feelings that this user group would experience. As we went through the protocols, we sometimes felt overwhelmed because the process wasn’t completely clear to us, but we collaborated, asked questions, and used our logical assumptions to follow through. We did sometimes feel that we were moving mechanically through motions and wished for a better understanding of what we were doing, which might indicate something to consider when developing our project. There is the future challenge of making the process of synthetic biology relatable, informative, exciting and interactive for the inexperienced scientist all at once, while limiting the frustration that comes from inexperience.
Week 2: June 3 - June 7
Monday - Tuesday: We spent the past two days at BU, getting to know our collaborative partners, learning more about synthetic biology, and working with the Eugene programming language. Both teams presented their projects and potential projects for the summer. It was interesting to see the underlying processes of a wetlab team, and we received some helpful feedback as we continue to brainstorm and research.
Wednesday - Thursday: Joanna and I continue to develop and expand upon our ideas. Our research has uncovered some really fascinating projects and developments in synthetic biology from which to draw inspiration. We continue to think about the various intersections of synthetic biology with the environment, energy, ecology, and art.
Week 3: June 10 - June 14
Brainstorming
Monday: This morning we met with Orit and presented our preliminary ideas. The advice and guidance she provided was so helpful and instructive. We are beginning to feel like our ideas are taking shape, and are going to begin thinking deeper about the synthetic biology concepts we would like to convey and the details of user interaction.
Tuesday - Wednesday: Joanna and I have been creating preliminary storyboard rough drafts. We chose three of our ideas to develop further, and have begun to think about the details of implementation. As we think deeper we are discovering new possibilities and challenges, which are helping to inform the ongoing direction of our thought process.
Thursday: Today we revised and edited our storyboards, fleshing out more details and phases and critically thinking through the different possibilities. We then created more comprehensive “final” drafts to use in future planning. As we prepare for the collaborative brainstorming session tomorrow, we are also"

Figure 2: Peptide aptamer Device: Peptide aptamer-scaffold fused to the T18 domain through a flexible linker.
The bacterial two-hybrid screening system is made up of two primary devices. One containing the T18 domain and containing the T25 domain.
Our device with the T25 domain is our target device. It contains a target conjugated to the T25 domain through a flexible linker. The gene is controlled by the lac promoter, Plac lac promoterThe lac promoter is inducible by isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The promoter has two binding sites: one which can bind catabolite activator protein (CAP), that binds cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and another which can bind the repressor protein LacI. When IPTG binds LacI, the repressor protein is inhibited. . The lac promoter is chosen because even when not induced, it still has a sufficient expression when placed on high-copy pl"

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," parts of our life it is involved. In order to give an impuls of thinking, we decided to create a postcard with the title “TOP DOWN is sometimes the right way” - according to the strategy of synthetic biology we applied in our project.
The postcards from the participating teams.
We took this great opportunity also to get in direct contact with generally educated people, who are no natural scientists. Distributing the postcards on both campuses of Göttingen, we came in direct dialogue with students of, for instance, economics, medicine, mathematics, law, philosophy, and school teaching. We invited them for discussions about genetically organisms, challenges, risks, and necessities to use GMOs to solve severe problems of our world. Many of them had an approximate idea of biotechnology, but were indeed surprised, that Synthetic Biology might be such a clean and effective alternative to traditional applications. A great example: Although knowing that cheese can be fermented with microbial rennet enzyme, several vegetarians were not aware of the fact that it can only be produced by GMOs. After all, we see that most educated people have an idea about it, however, we see that there is still a lot of potential to strengthen the awareness of the importance of Synthetic Biology.
We think that this post card campaign was a big success, because using postcards as a medium, we also reached people with many different educational backgrounds. Furthermore, combining it with engagement work, we reached people directly.
Bio&Pretzels
Since 2014, the student council of our faculty organizes so called Bio&Pretzel talks, in a semi-formal atmospherere with beer and pretzels. The speaker, usually a professor or assistant professor, gives insight in his scientific field for a general audience: school students, freshmen of the university, relatives of the students, but also for ongoing scientists themselves. The aim of these talks is to inform the general audience, but also to give insights for ongoing scientists still looking for their scientific profession. Thus, it was a great honor for us as the iGEM team to have this opportunity. We talked about synthetic biology in general and the awesome applications which might be possible in the future, and of course the responsibility which comes with it. We also outlined the idea of the iGEM competition, and presented our own topic. We told the audience about the importance of Vitamin B12, from which nutrients it can be uptaken, and how we could improve the efficiency of production with our synporter.
Our talk was received very well by the audience, and numerous questions from the scientific fraction were asked and answered. Probably"

The Experiment
We grow two large cultures of cells. One contains cells that will lyse and release plasmids into the supernatant while the other has non-lysing, ""normal"" cells.
Adding IPTG to both flasks induces lysis in one set of cells but not in the others.
Thanks to qPCR, the supernatant harvested from the lysing culture reveals increased numbers of plasmids while the non-lysing culture exhibits significantly lower numbers of plasmids. A similar test involves transforming the supernatant (whose plasmid content is not known a priori) into cells and counting the number of resulting colonies. The plates containing transformations from the lysing supernatant have vastly superior number of colonies compared to the non-lysing supernatant transformations.

Utah_State,2014,Team:Utah State#Results#IBP_-_-_TEXT.html," while trapping the enzymes in its network. Entrapment is a fast and inexpensive process which requires controlled, mild conditions (Bernfield & Wan, 1963). Different methods of entrapment include gel entrapping, fiber entrapping and microencapsulation.
Adsorption is a simple, reversible immobilization process using adsorbents such as activated carbon, alumina, and ion exchange resin. While inexpensive, the bonding force between the enzyme and the adsorbent is weak compared with other methods (Brady & Jordan, 2009). Chemical bonding present are normally ionic and Van der Waals forces due to partial charge of the substrate and the carrier. It is the oldest and easiest enzyme immobilization technique.
Affinity binding generally involves one of two methods. Support material can be activated which contains the coupled affinity ligand followed by the addition of the enzymes. This procedure allows the enzyme protection from exposure to harsh conditions. In the second method, the enzyme’s structure is changed in order to promote enzyme affinity to the matrix (Nisha et al., 2012).
Immobilized enzymes are applied in numerous industries including biomedical use, food industry, biodiesel production and wastewater treatment.
Immobilization methods for Bioplastics
The immobilization of enzymes on plastics has been a practice utilized several times to create a more stable, efficient enzymatic reactions.  Enzymes immobilized on plastics can perform operate multiple times before disassociating which improves their overall operational stability. Therefore, an immobilized enzyme is a reusable enzyme.
The most common forms of enzyme attachment are currently through covalent coupling. This requires treatment of the plastic with a nitrating acid, or something similar, to create cleaved chain polymer ends  projecting from the surface. Most procedures then use a glutaraldehyde solution to create a binding location for the subsequent enzymes. This method has shown relative success allowing enzymes to withstand multiple uses and retain activity for longer.
Although the enzymes primarily put to use in study have been protease, lipase, and amylase (major enzymes in laundry detergent,) other enzymes are being tested for various applications such as: cleaning pollutants out of ground water, and medical testing/diagnosis/treatment.
Biological Functionalization of Bioplastics
Using a synthetic biological approach, we aimed to functionalize the bioplastic, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), with the enzymes described earlier (chlorophyllase, cellulase, and amylase). Functionalizing the bioplastics with these enzymes could allow for various applications of the enzymes, including reusable use with laundry detergents.

(b) Normalized IRM acquisition and DC (Direct Current field) demagnetization (DCD), measured at 5 K.
The thermal decay of isothermal remanence acquired in a field of 2.5 T after cooling in ZFC and a 2.5 T FC was measured. The 2.5 T ZFC and FC curves show a repid decrease of remanence with increasing temperature，(Fig.12.) and the remanences are almost zero, suggesting most of the magnetic particles are superparamaneti，c particles. The ZFC and FC curves are nearly superimposed suggesting that ferrimagnetic particles exist in E. coli.
The intersection of saturation isothermal remanent magnetization and DCD is below 0.5, indicating magnetic mineral particals aggregated and formed magnetic interactions in E. coli. IRM and DCD could be divided into two parts: the saturated part and unsaturated part. The saturated part is around 200mT, suggesting that ferrimagnetic minerals: magnetite or maghemite exist.
After verify the superparamagnetism property of iron core, we finally did heating test.
Alternative Magnetic Field Heating Detection
We used Optical Fiber Thermometer to detect the effect of heating mineralized ferritin in vivo and in vitro.
The end of optical fiber was immersed in the sample to measure the temperature change. Mineralized sample and control were in the fixed position of the solenoid of electromagnetic field generator (strength of electromagnetic field is 8 mT the frequency of it was 540 kHz).
Fig.13. The detection process and relative equipment
The temperature curve didn’t show apparent difference between mineralized sample and control. Dr. Xiaowen Wang explained that it is hard to observe the heated effect of ferritin solution. This protocol would be more promising if ferritin was high-throughout prepared, concentrated and freeze-dry into powder.
Future Work
The circuit PT5-FtnA-RNAT has been constructed and we would try to detect the whole cell heating again.
There are some methods to detect the local heating, such as using fluorophores as molecular thermometers, the fluorescence intensity was recorded with the Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device(EMCCD). [13]
Valuing Protein Concentration per cell
To supply our modeling with concentration of ferritin per cell, we explored a method for valuing protein concentration per cell, and tried to make it more convenient.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Internal_-_-_TEXT.html," step in gene expression is the translation of the synthesized mRNA to a protein. This involves the binding of a ribosome complex to the RBS site of the mRNA, followed by elongation and termination. The initiation step is the rate-limiting step of the three. The translation rate is thus tied to the thermodynamics of RBS-ribosome interaction, but other sequences (5’-UTR, Shine-Delgarno,repeats, internal startcodons) and possible secondary structures (hairpins) also play a role [8] . Salis et al have developed an algorithm to predict the translation initiation rate based upon thermodynamic calculations. This algorithm is used in the Ribosome Binding Site Calculator 9 . We used this calculator to predict the translation rates of our mRNAs.
The results of the calculator are shown in table 2. The program gives us results in au (arbitrary units). Since we know the translation rate of LuxI and LuxR, we can use these as a standard to calculate the other translation rates since the used scale is proportional [10] . LuxI and LuxR have almost the same output from the calculator which corresponds with the paper where they also have the same translation rate. Our values are also normal values since values between 1 and 100 000 are possible [7] . We did get warnings about the accuracy of the prediction (NEQ: not at equilibrium) which happens when mRNA may not fold quickly to its equilibrium state.

Before the proteins can bind the promoter region, they first have to form complexes. cI and PenI form homodimers, while LuxR first forms a heterodimer"

Week 1
(1st - 7th August)
Our aim was to design and assemble sequences of the G-blocks for 5 genes coding only for proteins involved in hydrogen production to produce functioning hydrogenase enzymes in E.coli, thus allowing the production of hydrogen by reducing H+ ions.
Background research on the G-blocks, Bio bricks and codon optimization restriction enzymes was conducted. BlastX was used to search each gene and alter any mismatches, ensuring that the identity of the genes are completely to the protein we require. Due to gene 3 being too big (maximum it can be is 500bp) it was made into two parts. A mismatch was found on gene 3 part 1 (75 bases from the end) and this was corrected by changing the proline was changed to alanine.
After the clarity of the genes was confirmed, a restriction mapping site, NEBcutter, was used to find the frequency of the restriction cut sites for E (EcoRI), X (XbaI), S (SmaI) and P (PstI) on the G-blocks. It was confirmed that the presence of 1 cut site for each restriction enzymes was present in the correct order required for the biobricks.
Sent the sequences of the genes to IDT for the G-blocks.
Week 2
(8th - 14th August)
The G-blocks arrived and they came as Hyd EF part 1, Hyd EF part 2, Hyd1, HydG and ferredoxin. Each sample contained 1000ng of DNA.
The G-blocks were resuspended in 100μl of nuclease free water.
For D1, G and Ferredoxin:
Restriction enzyme digest was performed; the G block were digested with EcoRI HF and PstI HF and Cut-smart buffer. Plasmid backbone with CAM resistance was also digested with the same enzymes.
The insert and backbone were then ligated using T4 DNA ligase and these parts were used to transform competent E. coli cells.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," low reaction rate. In order to increase the reaction rate and glutathione formation we decided to enhance the gene expression rate by using a strong promoter and RBS. Thus, we looked through the existing promoters and RBS in iGEM database and examined their strengths which were compared by LMU-Munich 2012 iGEM team and the Alverno_Ca team.
Promoter Analysis
Figure 8: (LMU-Munich 2012 iGEM Team)
RBS Analysis
Figure 9: The Alverno_Ca team.
Decision
Thanks to the modeling of different promoter and RBS strengths, we decided to use the promoter J23100 because of                 it being the most powerful promoter among the Anderson promoter family and B0034 as RBS because of it being one of                 the most strongest RBS and the encouraging comments. Then, we decided to construct three different modules to improve the lifespan and ethanol production of E.coli KO11.                 Our first module consists of a strong promoter (J23100), an RBS(B0034), FucO gene only and a double terminator (B0015). Our second module consists of a strong promoter                 (J23100), an RBS(B0034), GSH gene only and a double terminator (B0015). Our last module is named Bio-E because it contains both genes with the same promoter, RBS and double                 terminator. The modules are tested to observe the lifespan against un-engineered E.coli KO11 then, simulated and compared by Monod equation with the data obtained from our                 wet lab team. Moreover, we simulated the expected ethanol production results by fermentation kinetics with the estimated parameters.
Growth and Fermentation
Because fermentation mainly depends on the cell growth of bacteria, there are no striking differences between cell growth and ethanol production (Luong, 1985). We demonstrated                  the kinetics of cell growth and fermentation with the alcohol and furans inhibition. We tested four modeles: Un-engineered E.coli strain KO11, with the overexpression of GSH,                   with the overexpression of FucO and with the overexpression of both GSH and FucO. The equations and results are shown below:
Growth
The growth rate of our bacteria is important to determine the effects of our genes because we aimed to increase the toxicity tolerance of E.coli KO11 and consequently leading to                 a better cell growth rate and lifespan. The specific growth rate and the substrate concentration data were used to define the maximum specific growth rate and Monod Constant.

Others fluorophores can be present within the samples. [22] As no photons are introduced into the sample, background levels in bioluminescence assay are much lower. [22][21]
As a results, bioluminescent chemistries present 10- to 1,000-fold higher sensitivity than fluorescence assays [23] Bioluminescence can be measured to zeptomole levels (few molecules per cell) and linearity extended over six to eight logs. [22]
Moreover, as bioluminescence naturally evolved within a biological context, it is more compatible with bioluminescence systems. [22]
To conclude, bioluminescence is greatly used in assay methodologies and these assays are known for their quantitative precision, low inherent backgrounds, and low sample interference. [22] For all these reasons, we decided to base our biosensor on the use of bioluminescence as the reporter gene.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Current therapies_-_-_TEXT.html," of temporality of the medicinal product. Several complementary and important concepts should be considered: systemic absorption speed and toxicity threshold.
Major problems facing these therapies are inter-patients variability in reactions to medications which become a substantial difficulty for the pharmaceutical research and medical considerations.
With the concern of improving the effectiveness of therapies, a new Pharmacology with genomic DNA or RNA for targets, has been developed: genetic pharmacology.
Back to top
The genetic pharmacology interest [1,2]
The gene therapy challenge is to achieve correction of deficient cells (via genome modifications) which induce a disease. Unlike protein therapy, gene therapy is not only reducing symptoms but goes well below: it aims to the total deletion of the disease.
Even when an exogenous protein can be used, gene therapy has major advantages:
- Protein produced from the transgene is subjected to post-transcriptional host change processes. Glycosylation profile is therefore strictly like the patient’s one, it provides thus a better biocompatibility.
-It allows to pass the administration issue of complex proteins within the cell, in fact the transgene is expressed directly through the cell machinery.
-It allows local expression of the transgene, avoiding any risk linked to the systemic presence of protein.
Gene therapy has the advantage to present a better pharmacokinetic avoiding repeated administration of treatment and toxicity linked. It also allows a prolonged expression of the gene-medicine because the biological activity of transgenic protein appears to be greater than recombinant protein. In addition, deletion of injection peak helps to prevent a receptor desensitization.
Finally, a last point, which can seems less crucial but that certainly has its importance: the patients comfort. In fact, single administration (or repeated at very low frequency) is better tolerated by the patient as a day-to-day administration, as it is currently the case for insulin in the diabetes treatment. Moreover, the financial aspect is not negligible since the administration of chemical or biological drugs occurs in ambulatory or hospital and, thus, still slow down their generalization. Similarly, a recombinant protein extraction and purification cost is higher than the synthesis of an oligonucleotide.
Back to top
Conclusion
Instability of proteins, their difficulties to be produced, are responsible for a large number of diseases. It thus highlights the interest of the drug-gene.
Few treatments have actually proved their effectiveness, without making a high toxicity. For this reason, gene therapy appears to be a very promising approach. Transforming the gene into a drug appears as a seductive strategy.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," systems reported to date have continued their reliance on the loop-mediated RNA interactions from natural systems. Although these loop interactions have been selected by evolution in nature, alternative approaches employing linear-linear RNA interactions are amenable to rational engineering and exhibit more favorable reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, factors that could be exploited to increase riboregulator dynamic range.
A riboregulator that activates gene expression must switch from a secondary structure that prevents translation to a configuration that promotes translation upon binding of a cognate trans-acting RNA. Although the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is an important factor in determining the efficiency of translation from a given mRNA, studies have found that secondary structure in regions near by the start codon also plays a critical role (Kudla et al., 2009).Furthermore, genome-wide analyses have revealed strong biases toward low secondary structures around the start codon of mRNAs from a panel of hundreds of bacterial genomes.
Toehold switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the switch and trigger (Figure 1B). The switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. Upstream of this coding sequence is a hairpin-based processing module containing both a strong RBS and a start codon that is followed by a common 21 nt linker sequence coding for low-molecular-weight amino acids added to the N terminus of the gene of interest. A single-stranded toehold sequence at the 50 end of the hairpin module provides the initial binding site for the trigger RNA strand. This trigger molecule contains an extended single stranded region that completes a branch migration process with the hairpin to expose the RBS and start codon, thereby initiating translation of the gene of interest. The hairpin processing unit functions as a repressor of translation in the absence of the trigger strand. Unlike previous riboregulators, the RBS sequence is left completely unpaired within the 11 nt loop of the hairpin. Instead, the bases immediately before and after the start codon are sequestered within RNA duplexes that are 6 bp and 9 bp long, respectively. The start codon itself is left unpaired in the switches we tested, leaving a 3 nt bulge near the midpoint of the 18 nt hairpin stem. Because the repressing domain b (Figure 1B) does not possess complementary bases to the start codon, the cognate trigger strand in turn does not need to contain corresponding start codon bases, thereby increasing the number of potential trigger sequences. The sequence in the hairpin added after the start codon was also screened for the presence of stop"
SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour41_-_-_TEXT.html," doxycycline. This  indicates that the Tet promoter is leaky and is not fully inhibited by TetR as it was also seen from the FACS  results. Furthermore, the plating assay proves that the bricks are functional, however slowly responding to induction (continuous induction over 24 hours compared to induction over 1 hour)
To see how the growth of the bacteria expressing GFP controlled by pTet are affected, we measured  OD over 8 hours. We measured OD on triplicates of bacteria with an empty vector, pTet-GFP, pTet (no LVA)- GFP, pTet (+LVA)-GFP and a wild-type.
Figure 3: Growth curve of bacteria expressing pTet (+LVA)-GFP, pTet (no LVA)-GFP, pTet-GFP, an empty vector and a wild-type.
Figure 3 shows the growth of bacteria expressing GFP constitutiely, are attenuated the most with most  comprised growth. Removing the LVA tag from TetR also has a negative effect on the growth of the  bacteria. This could be because TetR without LVA stresses the metabolism of the bacteria more than TetR with LVA or because LVA tags TetR for degradation and thus TetR with LVA stresses the cell less than TetR  without LVA.

2013 SDU-Denmark iGEM team proved that the natural lac inhibitor has a faster respondance on induction  by IPTG, than lacI with LVA ( Link ). As for pTet, we wanted  to test if the lac promoter could be fine-tuned. Due to the 2013 SDU iGEM team, we used the lacI without  LVA. We wanted to ligate a constitutive promoter-lacI (no LVA) with plac-GFP. This was done successfully  and can be found as Bba_K1475007 . Due to time constrains, we were never able to characterize this part and compare it to pTet.

Chemotaxis explained
Chemotaxis enables bacteria to sense their immediate environment and quickly adapt to changes in it. The ability to          sense changes in the environment and quickly respond to them is essential to the cell's life (3).          The bacterial chemotaxis system has evolved to answer this need.
Chemotaxis is the movement of an organism towards or away from a chemical stimulus, as is presented in figure 1.          The most common sensory pathways in prokaryotes use a chemotaxis system that contains          at least two components - a dimeric histidine protein kinase (HPK) and a response regulator (RR).
Fig. 1: Chemotaxis concept, adapted from iGEM gottingen 2012 .
The E.coli chemotaxis system is considered a model system that demonstrates some           of the core principles of chemotaxis. Through use of its flagella, E.coli has the           ability to move rapidly towards attractants and away from repellents, by means of           a random movement, with “runs” and “tumbles” by rotating its flagellum counter-clockwise           and clockwise, respectively.
Fig. 2: Random and run movement of E.coli. (2).
When E.coli moves in a medium that lacks a concentration gradient – the cell travels,           stops or tumbles and then continues moving in a new random direction.
When the flagella rotate counter-clockwise it forms a tight bundle and directs the           cell forward in a straight running motion. After a brief period, the direction of rotation is reversed,           causing a tumble. As the cell moves up the chemical gradient the runs become longer           in comparison to moving down the gradient.
The overall result is random movement in the absence of a chemical gradient, and           movement towards or away from a chemical when a gradient exists (3).

Friday, July 5, 2013
Investigators: Kerstin, Laura, Jan
When we checked the agar plates for transformed colonies with the LuxI and lactonase containing constructs we did not have any colonies.
The digested chromoprotein DNA was ligated with the RBS and the promotor-RBS construct at room temperature for 30 minutes. The ligated DNA was transformed in E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' by heatshock and plated on agar plates. We cannot wait to see colorful colonies on Sunday :-)
Since we almost ran out off our competent cells it was time for new ones. New compentent cells were made and transformation efficiency was tested.
A new idea to cope with the leakiness of the Plas and Prhl was to try a different antibiotic which cannot be metabolised. We used carbenicillin instead of ampicillin at different concentrations in liquid culture with 2xYT medium. Unfortunatly no effect could be observed on the leakyness of both inducible promotors.
Week 8: July 7 - July 13, 2013
This week we cultivated  the chromoprotein expression cassetts for the first time in liquid culture. It was a great motivation to observe our constructs to work as expected. Everyone is really excited about the colorful cultures!
The leakiness problem we still try to get rid of is less motivating but we still did not give up trying to find a solution this week.
Sunday, July 7, 2013
Investigators: Laura
Today, 2xYT liquid cultures were inoculated with colonies of E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' transformed with the constructs containing the blue, red and yellow chromoproteins (aeBlue, eforRed and amilGFP respectively) controlled by constitutive promoters (J23100) and equipped with a ribosome binding site (B0032). Cultures are grown overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm

As the cultures were prepared yesterday, plasmid DNA containing the chromoprotein expression cassettes were minipreped and glyercol cell stocks of cells were prepared. Also, transformations of the ligated DNA of lactonase expression cassette and Lux  autoinducer synthase LuxI (C0061) flanked by a ribosome binding (B0032) site and a double terminator (B0015"

Modelling
On friday, the two models for a proposed threshold switching system were created. Model 6.2 (competition between activator and repressor for a site on the DNA) was investigated; For different 'arabinose' (or other proposed input) and repressor concentrations the final level of output from the system was plotted. It was hoped that for different input levels (shown in the below graphs by the different green lines of output) the position of switching to low output would take place at different repressor levels due to the competitive nature of the system. Investigation into refining the model will take place. It is important to remember that whilst total output is what is seen, plotting rates of output production is necessary; the 'switching level' could be considered to be the point at which the rate of output production becomes zero. A standard way of designing this switching level is required.
Rate of output production against time for a series of set repressor levels showed that different steady rates of production were rapidly obtained (figure 1 below). The final rate of production (representative of the steady state) was plotted against repressor level, showing that the 'switching level' would occur in the region where the rate falls to zero (figure 2). Ideally, our system would have a well defined switching point, with a much sharper rise to high rates of output. This would likely be achieved by increasing hill coefficients, requiring a system with a greater degree of cooperativity.

Figure 6: Mean and standard deviation of the absorption spectrum of the three samples from 400 to 550 nm.
Figure 6 shows that the lycopene production of the two amber variants is less than in the functional lycopene producer.  Also, a difference in the lycopene production of the two variants can be detected. While the cotransformant TAG353 shows about half of the lycopene productivity, the variant TAG318 shows less than a third of the productivity of the lycopene producing strain (LP). This implies that the two different positions in crtI have different effect on the binding activity of the active site.
Irradiation, Switching and Stability of AzoF
To make sure that we are able to switch the conformation of AzoF and that the cis and trans conformations are stable over the cultivation time, we irradiated a sample of LB-media containing 1 mM of AzoF with our LED panel . One sample was irradiated with 367 nm for 40 minutes with 100 % brightness which causes AzoF to change to its cis-conformation. The conformation of AzoF can be detected through its absorption spectrum (Figure 7).
Figure 7: Absorption spectrum of AzoF in LB media after irradiation with light of 367 nm wavelength. The black line shows the typical absorption of AzoF in the trans-conformation while the other lines show the absorption spectrum in the cis-conformation. The spectrum was measured directly after the irradiation, then after 2, 4, 17 and 20 hours. The sample was incubated at 30°C.
Figure 7 shows that we were able to switch the conformation of AzoF in LB-media with our LED panel . Furthermore, the less stable cis-conformation, which is induced by the UV-light of 367 nm, was stable for over 20 hours at cultivation conditions. This led us to the conclusion that we could start a cultivation of the three crtI variants with the two different AzoF conformations and that any detectable difference in the lycopene production would be caused by the photoswitching event of the amino acids.
Influence of Photoswitching on the Lycopene Production
To investigate the influence of photoswitching on the lycopene production, we cultivated three biological replic"

Resources for the younger generation
In response to the survey, we wanted to make synthetic biology and iGEM more accessible to the younger generation, and the rest of the public. So we decided that we wanted to make some resources for young children about our project, synthetic biology and ideas around synthetic biology. We have this document translated in English, German, French, Farsi, Spanish and Mandarin.

1. Project Idea
1.1 Why we name after ‘ECHO’?
In Greek myths, there is a story of the love between nymph Echo and Narcissus. The voice of Echo remains hovering in the valley in the end of the story, from then on, ‘echo’ starts to have a meaning as reverberation or response of sound. In the field of automation, we use ‘feedback’ to refer the process of response in a system, that is, the process in which part of the output is returned to its input in order to regulate its further output, just as an echo.
Analogously, ‘echo’ plays a significant role in our design. CELL-A generates AHLs, sending a message to CELL-B, and after B expresses the particular gene, B will ‘echo’ the message to A as a response. Therefore, the pre-state of A has a regulating influence on the next-state of A, restricting A to fluctuate in a certain behavior within a certain range. The ECHO feedback part contributes to the communication and well-function of the system.
1.2 How can bacteria act as group?
As the passages state above, CELL-A & B communicate by AHLs both within their own populations and with the other. To understand this principle, we need to take a further look at the quorum sensing (QS).
QS is the ability of populations of bacteria to communicate and coordinate their behavior via inter-cellular and inter-species signaling molecules. AHL is one example of these molecules. AHLs produced by a certain group of E.coli (as Group I) accumulate, and once the concentration passes the threshold, the receptors in another group (as Group II) are activated, and the specific gene is regulated to express. Thus, bacteria will act as two groups, in which I induces II under the quorum sensing.
1.3 How does the system work?
In ecology, the predator-prey system often serves as a wonderful example to describe population dynamics. In the"

Colicin Production
Here we show a glimpse of our results. You can see the observed effect produced by our colicins.
To check the different colicin activities, we sow wild type Escherichia coli in different plates. After 10h, we added 100 µL of the different liquid colicin-producer cultures to each plate. Finally, 20h later we noticed a blue halo in the plates, indicating the death of wild type E. coli. The negative control plates did not present this coloring.
We want to study the different colicin and microcin properties regarding pH-dependence, minimum active concentration, time dynamics, etc.
In order to gather all this information we designed different experiments. Unfortunately, we are still lacking enough experimental results, so most of the statistical and mathematical models we have developed are not validated, yet. Even so, we can advance that the activity vs. concentration model follows a logistic growth model.
Antimicrobial peptides
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of gene-encoded natural antibiotics found in all living organisms. In multicellular organisms, such as mammalians, defensins and cathelicidins  are a principal component of innate immunity. In unicellular organisms, bacteriocins function to suppress competitor species. AMPs kill bacteria by disruption of membrane integrity and are less likely to induce resistance than common antibiotics, so they have attracted attention in different fields such as medicine and food safety.
Bacteriocins
Bacteriocins are lethal to bacteria other than the producing strain. As a group, bacteriocins are heterogeneous and are classiﬁed according to their molecular weight. The activity spectrum of bacteriocins can be narrow and conﬁned to inhibition of closely related species, or it can be relatively broad and include many different bacterial species. Bacteriocins are often considered more natural than common antibiotics because they are thought to have been present in many of the foods eaten since ancient times. This is one of the reasons why we have chosen bacteriocins over other antim"

It seems that 6-mer amplification is somewhat successful. There is the desired band present, although there are also non-specific bands present.
9-mer amplification seems to be inefficient. The desired band is present, but is very weak intensity compared to 6-mer. In addition, non-specific bands are present.
We don't know is the accessory bands are an artifact from ICA, or an artifact from PCR. One way to verify would be to excise the band corresponding to the desired product, gel-extract, then use as template for a subsequent PCR. If the accessory bands reappear, then the problem lies with non-specific primers. If the bands are no longer present, then the artifact bands arise from a problem with ICA."
Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," PETase is most active at higher pHs, so we want to determine a happy pH medium between E. Coli growth and enzyme activity.
Materials: NaOH, E. Coli, LB
Experiment methods: We set up triplicates in 48 well plates of E. coli with lb set to different pHs and left it in an overnight plate reader for 350 mins.
Controls: We also ran triplicates of just LB (without E. coli) but because this was not very useful information, we didn’t include it in the results page.
Experiments: Microbial Fuel Cell
Experiment name: D. tsuruhatensis Metabolizing Terephthalic Acid (TPA)
What experiment will show: Whether D. tsuruhatensis can grow using TPA as its sole carbon source
Reason for doing experiment: In order to use D. tsuruhatensis in a microbial fuel cell with TPA as the carbon source, the bacteria has to be able to efficiently metabolize TPA.
Materials: TPA, M9 Minimal Media, D. tsuruhatensis, Well Plates, Optical Density (OD) plate reader.
Experiment methods: Prepare plates that contain the following: 1. Just M9 Medium 2. M9 + TPA 3. M9 + TPA + D. tsuruhatensis 4. M9 +D. tsuruhatensis. *Plates were grown for just over 14 hours at 30 degrees celsius.
Controls: Plates containing M9 Medium alone; plates with M9 media and TPA; plates with M9 media and D. tsuruhatensis
Experiment name: Voltage Measurement in the Fuel Cell
What experiment will show: Will show whether injecting TPA into our microbial fuel cell with Delfita and methylene blue will result in an increase in voltage.
Reason for doing experiment: This will signify that our bacteria can use TPA as a substrate to produce electricity, and thus a signal.
Materials: Fuel Cell with D. tsuruhatensis, TPA, M9 Minimal Media, D. tsuruhatensis Broth, Methylene Blue, Voltmeter connected to a PC
Experiment methods: We first centrifuge the D. tsuruhatensis bacteria into a pellet in order to remove it from the original broth (which has a carbon source). We then resuspend the D. tsuruhatensis in M9 minimal salt medium (which doesn’t have a carbon source), then we add methylene blue and add it to the fuel cell.  After the voltage has plateaued,"

This analytical method can be used for separation and identification of proteins according to their electrophoretic mobility. The mobility is a function of length of the molecular weight. Proteins that have identical charge per unit mass due to binding of SDS results in an equal electrophoretic mobility.
Pouring the polyacrylamide gel
Make a master mix for the stacking and separating gel without adding  ammonium persulfate and TEMED.
Aliquote 6,5 mL for each separating and 2,5 mL for each stacking gel.
Add ammonium persulfate and  TEMED to each separating gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into the gel casting form. Leave about 2 centimeters below the bottom of the comb for the stacking gel.
Layer isopropanol on top of the gel.
Leave the separating gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize.
Remove isopropanol and wait until the surface is dry.
Add ammonium persulfate and TEMED to each stacking gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into your gel casting form.
Insert comb without getting bubbles stuck underneath
Leave the gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize.
For storage
Remove sealing and store the gel wrapped in moistened paper towel at 4°C.
Preparing the sample
Mix your protein mixture 4:1 with Laemmli-buffer (30 mL protein solution + 10 mL Laemmli-buffer)
Heat for 5 minutes at 95 °C.
Running the gel
Remove sealing, put the polymerized gel into gel box and pour SDS running buffer into the negative and positive electrode chamber.
Remove comp without destroying the gel pocket.
Pipet the sample into the gel pockets, adjusting the volume according to the amount of protein in your sample. Make sure to include a lane with molecular weight standards (PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder™ (Fa. Fermentas)) to determinate the molecular weight of the sample.
Connect the power lead and run the stacking gel with 10 mA until the blue dye front enters the separating gel.
Raise amperage up to 20 mA for running the separating gel.
When the distance of the lowest molecular weight standard lane to the gel end is down to 0.5 cm stop the electrophoresis by turning off the power supply.

Introduction
There is no doubt that ethical questions and their public discourse especially come into play when talking about genetically modified organism. In a field of research that has tremendous potential to impact our society, figuring out what is right and what is wrong can sometimes be difficult. Therefore we tried to involve as many people - experts, greenhorns, academics and business people alike - in the ethical evaluation of our project.
An opportunity for a collaboration
This is where the Bordeaux team comes in to play as their project shares some similarities with ours. Therefore the ethical questions and challenges they face are overlap with ours. As they are in contact with a number of French experts in the field of GMO and even organised a conference on the subject of ethics, meeting with the Bordeaux team should be very valuable.
In order to prepare for the meeting with the Bordeaux team we started out by reading introductory papers on the field of ethics related to microbiology. Especially the ethics handbook written by the 2017 Israelian team from Technion was of great use, giving us an overview of the different ways of looking at the “badness” or “goodness” of actions.(1) Should we only look at the consequences or just at the intention or justification? Members of the Bordeaux team pointed us to the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, held in 1975, where for the first time international guidelines on the safety of recombinant DNA were drawn up. Besides reading up on ethics we made a whole list of questions to ask to both the Bordeaux team and to the experts they have been in contact in with.
Armed with proper background knowledge and a document full of questions we set out to collaborate. The Bordeaux team kicked of the meeting with a presentation on what the term GMO entails, and which ethical issues GMOs raises. They then"

Apart from the fact that it is crucial to be able to control cell shape, round cells offer the advantage of being symmetrical along all axes, so the orientation of your lens does not matter for the optical properties.
In order to create spherical E. coli, we overexpress the BolA gene. BolA is a gene that controls the morphology of E. coli in the stress response (Santos, Freire, Vicente, & Arraiano, 1999) . By overexpressing this gene at 37°C, the rod-shaped E. coli cells, will become round (Aldea, Hernandez-Chico, De La Campa, Kushner, & Vicente, 1988) . We will express this gene both under a constitutive promoter (Part K1890031 ), as well as an inducible promoter (Part K1890030 ). When we express both the BolA gene as well as silicatein, we are able to construct round cells, coated in glass.
Methods
The expected phenotype of the cells expressing BolA is  very different from the phenotype of wildtype E. coli. If the gene is successfully overexpressed, the cells become round, which we can easily observe under a widefield microscope. In widefield microscopy, the whole sample is simultaneously illuminated using a white light source so the phenotype of the sample can be inspected. This is comparable to normal light microscopy.
In order to obtain round cells we tested transforming E. coli BL21 with BolA under both a constitutive promoter ( J23100 ) and an inducible promoter (Lac-promoter), to do so it was cloned in a backbone containing the promoter and all machinery necessary for it to work. This backbone was obtained from pBbA5c-RFP, a gift from Jay Keasling (Addgene plasmid # 35281) ( Lee et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, we tried if transforming a strain with both BolA and the OmpA-silicatein fusion plasmid yielded round, glass covered cells. The strains and conditions tested are summarized in table 1.

Figure 5: Sex ratio of iGEM teams through the years and across continents. The proportion of team members of each gender over time and between regions in the collegiate iGEM competition.  Bars represent the 95% Confidence interval.
Women do not supervise as much as men
   The second question investigated was the sex ratios for the different categories of people participating in iGEM. Indeed, iGEM is not only undergrad students. Advisors, instructors, judges also participate representing the complete professional ladder of synthetic biology. A category called Supervisors was created corresponding to instructors and advisers. Indeed, those terms are not understood and used in the same way in different continents. In some countries ""advisers"" means people who directly teach the teams (mostly grad students and post docs) whereas it means general mentors for others and vice versa.
Figure 6: Sex ratios in iGEM according to categories of people participating. The gender balance of students, Supervisors and Judges in iGEM collegiate competitions.  Supervisors is taken as the combination of advisors and instructors due to variations on how individual teams differentiate between them.  Bars are 95% confidence intervals.
   When executing comparisons tests , team members' sex ratio is found to be different from judges' and instructors' ones (p value < 0,01). However judges and advisers are not significantly different ( p value > 0,5). This result reveals a tendency of women to supervise less than men. Indeed, from team members to instructors, the sex ratio is divided by two. What is even more interesting is to compare those numbers to sex ratios of PhD students and post docs in labs. The sex ratio of instructors is 10 points lower.
Women constitute a pool of talent that is not mobilized. They participate but do not supervise teams. They are ""lost"" along the way.  Indeed, in a study published last year in PNAS, researchers showed that P.I. were less prone to have a woman mentoring students than man. This unconscious bias can be translated by a lack of encouragement from P.I.s but also by a self censorship which is not taken into account by  other supervisors as explained in an recently published article by Eileen Pollack (E. Pollack Why Are There Still So Few Women in Science? NY TImes October 2013).
Tracks and sex ratio in iGEM
   The third finding goes against an often-heard stereotype ""women are more interested by applied research"". In order to investigate this"

1. Goals for the week
Our goals for this week are to correctly prepare and successfully extract phage from a CsCl gradient.
2.Experiments and results
After our first attempt at purification using PEG, we decided to perform a phage titer to check for phage viability. The titers were successful. Both plates showed plaques. On the plate of W3110 infected with T4 phage, there was contamination. Plaques were still visible and it was determined that the team should continue on, as the next step of a CsCl gradient should remove any contaminants.
w3110
BL21
When performing the next step of the CsCl gradient, we added the incorrect amount of CsCl to phage suspension buffer, causing the gradient to be half as dense as it should have been. We had layered in very little phage to begin with, and the team determined it would be better to restart with a larger amount of phage particles to purify.
We completed the first step in PEG purification for the second time. With the doubled amount of phage, we had much more to layer in the CsCl gradient and there were visible bands in the gradient since the correct concentrations were used.
The CsCl gradient was successful the second time it was ran. There were visible bands of bacterial debris and phage particles.
3. Next Steps
Successfully extract phage particles from the CsCl gradient, remove from CsCl using phage suspension buffer.
Perform the third and final step of purification with an equilibrium CsCl gradient.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html," selection assay
The main aim of our project was to “engineer E. coli to act as tracking dogs”. Seven substances were chosen as new attractants for our “tracking E. colis”: some were taken because of structural similarity to L-aspartate, the target of the tar receptor, others because of medical relevance and a third group was made up by just subjectively interesting chemicals. The first substance was D-aspartate, which is the enantiomer of L-aspartate. L-aspartate-4-benzyl-ester was chosen because of its structural similarity to L-aspartate. Another substance was 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol, which can be detected in the breath of lung cancer patients (Filipiak et al. 2009). The well known stimulant caffeine, the flavoring substance vanillin and  geraniol, the smell of roses, were tested additionally. Finally, sodium cyclamate was chosen, an artificially produced sweetener. The mutational library of the tar receptor, our receptor of choice, was produced by focus group #3 . Here, focus group 1 designed a selection system for the “tracking E. colis” (Fig. 2A).  In our system, the BL21 cells containing the mutagenesis library of the Tar receptor were dropped on 0.3 % tryptone agar plates with the attractant soaked into Whatman paper placed in the middle. The clones that moved the fastest towards the attractant and the reference strain were selected in three successive rounds and the plasmid DNA of single clones was sequenced (see results of group 3).
Fig. 2A: Schematic illustration of the library selection assay of the tar mutagenesis library. 1. One 1 mL cryostock of the library was thawed and used to inoculate 50 mL LB-broth with chloramphenicol, the culture was incubated over night at 37 °C and approximately 180 rpm. 2. In order to reach a high cell density in a small volume1 mL of the culture was spun down for 10 min at 1.5k X g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in the amount necessary to place 24 x 5 µl drops LB broth, which is approximately 200 µl. Alternatively, the supernatant was discarded by inverting the E-cup and the pellet was resuspended in the remaining liquid. 3. 7 x 12 cm plus one control Petri dish were filled with 0"

TLCR (Thermostable Ligase Chain Reaction)
All sticky ends should be completed by T4 ligase first.
As for primers when we mix PCR solution, only forward primer of the first DNA fragment and the reverse primer of the last DNA fragment are added. Then we additionally add helper DNA as well. (Helpers are DNA strains that contain the same sites of two to-be-connected ends of two DNA fragments.) The rest adding of the solution is almost the same with normal PCR.
Note: both forward and reverse primer should be phosphorylated by enzyme PNK, since T4 ligase would end up completion with no phosphate group at the end of DNA strains.

Intéressons-nous tout d’abord à l’importance de ce risque. Mycobacterium avium est parfois responsable de graves infections chez l’homme. Mais, comme l’a rappelé Willy Rozenbaum, « c’est une bactérie très ubiquitaire, on la trouve dans l’eau du robinet ; on est presque tous contaminés » ; or cette contamination n’a que très rarement d’effets conséquents. Les cas reportés concernent des patients au système immunitaire très affaibli, par le VIH par exemple. Nous avons par ailleurs prévu d’analyser les effets de l’infection sur des phénotypes tumoraux. Quoi qu’il en soit, Willy Rozenbaum estime que « tout ça n’est pas très embêtant ». Outre les nombreux tests et modélisations qui seront menés avant l’utilisation de notre traitement, cette affirmation est justifiée par le fait que les bactéries sont lysées lorsqu’elles libèrent le phage ; elles ne persistent donc pas dans l’organisme.
François Le Fèvre s’est légitimement interrogé quant au risque que le phage n’infecte d’autres bactéries déjà présentes dans l’organisme. Nous lui avons donc expliqué que notre vecteur cellulaire n’encapsidait que le plasmide d’intérêt, et non son génome. S’il infectait une bactérie résidente (ce qui peut être empêché par la modification des protéines d’internalisation), celle-ci ne recevrait que le  plasmide d’intérêt enveloppé de protéines. Le phage serait donc incapable de s’y multiplier.On pourrait également s’inquiéter des dérives au niveau de l’intégration du transgène, comme les risques de recombinaison homologue ou d’intégration hasardeuse. Lluis Mir a appuyé notre idée à ce sujet, qui est que le problème est limité par le fait que l’hôte et le phage n’appartiennent pas au même monde : « "

B. subtilis Competent Cell Preparation and Transformation
1. Streak recipient strain on LB Agar plate. Incubate overnight (18 hour) at 37°C.
2. Inoculate a few colonies into 4.5 ml of Medium A in a 16×125 mm test tube that lacks visible scratches. Mix the contents of the tube thoroughly. Read its optical density at 600 nm in the spectrophotometer. Adjust the OD600 to be 0.1-0.2, maintaining the volume at 4.5 ml.
3. Incubate at 37°C with vigorous aeration. Read the OD600 every 20 min, plotting OD600 against time on semi-log paper. After a brief lag, the OD should increase logarithmically—that is, they should fall on a straight line. Note the point at the culture leaves log growth—the graph points fall below the straight line. In B. subtilis genetics, this point is known as t0. It should take 60~90 minutes of incubation and occur at OD600=0.4-0.6.
4. Continue incubation for 90 minutes after the cessation of log growth (t90). Transfer 0.05 ml of this culture into 0.45 ml of pre-warmed Medium B in a 16×125 mm test tube. Set up one tube for each transformation you intend to perform, plus an extra for a DNA-less control (negative control).
5. Incubate the diluted cultures at 37°C with vigorous aeration for 90 min. At this point, the cultures should be highly competent.
6. Add 1 µg of DNA to the competent cells and incubate at 37°C with aeration for 30 minutes.
7. Plate 200μl of the transformed cells onto selective agar.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

For the growth curve experiment the teams simply measured the OD600 every 10 minutes for 5 hours, in the Vibrigens InterLab the iGEM InterLab cell measurement experiment was repeated.

8 InterLab plasmids

V2 salts
Vibrio natriegens on a plate, ATTC14048
Flyer Vibrio natriegens 101
We created a Vibrio natriegens flyer containing the most important facts and most useful protocols for the organism. Our protocol for the Vibrigens InterLab is in our lab book on our Wiki.
For the Vibrigens growth curve we only sent V2 salts, Vibrio natriegens on a plate strain ATTC14048 and the Vibrio natriegens 101 Flyer.
Results
Figure 3: Pie chart showing the percentage of teams that would want to work with Vibrio natriegens again.
In our Google form we asked our participants to tell us all about their difficulties with the experiments and Vibrio natriegens and to answer some general questions. When asked if they could imagine working with Vibrio natriegens in the future, 7 out of 8 teams answered yes (figure 3).
We could identify four main critique points based on their feedback:
The shipping
We received a lot of feedback on our shipping. Some of the plates broke during transport because we didn’t pack them as well as we should have. For the future we recommend using bubble wrap around the plates or enough crumpled paper to really cushion the plates. Relying only on parafilm and paper towels wasn’t enough to send plates in an envelope instead of a box. Boxes provide more protection against mechanical impact and are therefore better suited for this.
Transformation
Some teams had problems transforming the plasmids into Vibrio natriegens and needed two attempts until they were able to insert the plasmid into V. natriegens. Two of the teams couldn’t perform the transformation, so we sent them the strains. In our lab we observed that the more experience you have, the higher the success rate of transformations. We believe that with guidance and a few more tries the teams would have been able to complete this step, but it would have taken precious time away from their projects.

Attracting people from a diverse range of backgrounds,  the Makespace community is a promising way to improve the interaction of non-scientists with the field of plant synthetic biology.
Since our return to Cambridge, we have continued the design of a growth facility and gene gun. Several of our team members are also in the process of establishing Cambridge’s first Bio Makespace, which we hope to support as a team with the hardware we are developing and outreach activities later this summer.

Mixing the dye with UV absorbing lipstick.
To pursue with collaboration in a more practical way we came up with an interactive         bilateral collaboration. The idea was based on visiting each other’s biggest science         events. On 23rd of September part of our team travelled to Finland to organize a         workshop at event of Heureka’s Science Centre! We explained synthetic biology         principles and our project idea in a play form to local visitors (check our board games         instructions!) We truly appreciate Aalto-Helsinki team’s help with organizing our         workshop!
On the 28th of September we organized a workshop at the Researchers’ Night Festival         held in Ahhaa Science Centre. Our team was happy to welcome Aalto-Helsinki team         members in Tartu, Estonia, and help them with translation and explanation of their         experiments to local visitors!
Photomosaic challenge
In the beginning of September we contacted iGEM teams all over the world and offered a         collaboration opportunity! The idea was to create a photomosaic of stylish lab photos,         which would make up the word ""iGEM"" and express unity of iGEMers: combining the         world, synthetic biology and teams in lab all around the world. For a collaboration we         asked teams to send 3-5 photos with an original lab-look/ composition.

For them, it was spider silk production and functionalisation, in much the same fashion as our work with cellulose. Despite the differences in our chosen material building blocks, our overall goals were similar. Thus, a collaboration was only natural.
As part of our collaboration we wanted to bring all the iGEM teams a bit closer together. We invited them all to join reddit.com/r/igem a place where all the teams can discuss openly about aspects of their projects and the competition in general. We hope that it will provide a communication platform not only for the competing teams, but also for people that seek to participate in iGEM in the future.
Stanford-Brown-Spelman
Social media brought us to our second collaborator. After seeing a picture of our raw bacterial cellulose posted on Twitter, the Stanford-Brown-Spelman (SBS) iGEM team approached us. Our email exchange led to a fruitful Skype meeting and the exchange of protocols for cellulose growth and processing.
Both of our teams are working on bacterial cellulose, but at the same time we are participating in different tracks and have completely different approach on applications. While we are looking into water filtration, SBS is looking into building biosynthetic Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
Edinburgh
We helped Edinburgh iGEM with their policy and practices project through a short Skype meeting about our team structure and dynamics.
London BioHackspace
The London BioHackspace, a community lab based in Hackney, London fielded their first ever iGEM team this year. Their project also involved bacterial cellulose, but focussed on using it as a medium with which to 3D print objects. We produced a model to simulate the 3D shape of their bacterial cellulose (BC) sculpture. More information about this can be found on the modelling page .

Our human practices involve in several aspects including biosafety, social activity and public education. Our aSTARice is a genetically-modified organism, (GMO), so our work focuses on promotion of the knowledge for GMO and survey on people's concern about GMO.
1. Survey
We hoped our human practice work could influence more ordinary people. So, we should understand the people's opinions towards GMO food. Thus we made a questionnaire about GMO.
The data we have obtained in questionnaire is showing below:
The respondents' proportion between men and women is approximately balanced. The number of age group from 18 to 25 is the majority. What's more, the respondents have a Bachelor degree or a higher degree.
1.1 The main contents
Question 4: Do you know what GMO is?
Analysis of the Q4: 4/5 of the respondents have a certain understanding for "" GMO technology"", 1/5 respondents don’t understand this technology or even know nothing about it. This suggests that the "" GMO technology"" is accepted by the majority of respondents.
Question 6: Will you eat GMO food?
Analysis: About a third of the people can accept GMO food. 17% of people refused to eat GMO food. The data suggests that the public acceptance for GMO foods is improving.
Question 11: Is transgenosis beneficial or harmful in your opinion?
Analysis: Most people have a skeptical attitude to GMO. For respondents, GMO is an emerging technology. The public don't understand enough about GMO crops, so they cannot hold a certain attitude to it.
Question 12:Will you use GMO products (non-food)?
Question 13: Have you ever heard of skin care product that contains astaxanthin?
Question 14: Will you choose skin care product or health food which contains astaxanthin (GMO) ?
If new GMO foods were put into market, about half of people can fully accept. While the acceptance of GMO products (non-food) is even higher. However, our public do not know much about astaxanthin product at present, So we should enhance the propaganda.
According to the data which we have got from investigation, we can see that most"

TALE Expression
Background – pTAL1 vector
Based on the fact that Golden Gate is an effective way to assembly TALE (Transcription activator-like effectors) and various eukaryotic expression systems have been established but few in prokaryotic systems, we are determined to construct such efficient expression system in Esherichia coli so that we can test our brilliant idea. Through referring to numbers of paper, we find that most scientists choose to construct stable cell line via homologous arm such as attL1 and attL2 or they just introduce exogenous TALE[1].  Considering the principle of Golden Gate Assembly, we only need to reconstruct the final vector pTAL1 (figure 1) to solve this problem. The vector pTAL1 contains TALE N-terminal, TALE C-terminal, lacZ for blue white scanning and attL1, attL2 homologous arm. However, it lacks necessary elements for prokaryotic creature such as promoter, RBS and terminator. Here comes to our story of establish a TALE expression system in prokaryotic creature.
Figure 1. The original vector pTAL1
Constitutive pTAL
Wisely, we choose 3A assembly to construct our expression system. Firstly, we design forward and reverse primers with extension on which contains EcoRI, XbaI and SpeI, PstI restriction enzyme sites to get PCR prodcuts of pTAL. Then through naïve enzyme digestion and liagtion we can ligate pTAL with terminator, promoter and RBS one by one. And finally, we can easily get our constitutive TALE expression vector (Figure 2). And we also submit this expression vector as K1311003 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311003:Design ) in part.igem.org.
Regulative pTAL
Similar to the method of constitutive construction, we make use of the ligated pTAL with terminator to continue our regulative pTAL construction. After browsing on the igem parts website, we find that there is no ideal regulatory parts that can be directly applied. We need to make use of some parts to get our ideal composite regulatory parts. Based on parts C0040, we added promoter and RBS, terminator, pTet (TetR repressible promoter, R0040) and R"

I believe that a field that combines the enormous knowledge we have gained in the field of molecular biology with the approach and technicality that the field of Engineering has to offer, allows us to obtain much greater achievements than with those two fields studied separately.
iGEM had appealed to me greatly since both the research idea and its execution is made by us - first degree students. I thank iGEM for the opportunity to be a part of something that is so close to the real world, in terms of research, lab work and problem solving.
Apart from my educational interests, I like to play chess, meet with friends, and play computer games.

TaiCO Features
Our proposal for reliable and fast computational production of optimized DNA sequences comes under the name TaiCO. The need for a specialized software tool for optimization of Y. lipolytica DNA sequences became evident when the product subgroup of DTU Biobuilders started to design constructs for protein expression. TaiCO allowed the rapid analysis of the coding sequences of interest and due to the final simplistic architecture and low resources demands it was decided to extend its capabilities for every organism with tGCN files available.
Software Overview
TaiCO is implemented in Python3 , a high-level programming languages with a built-in library for GUI development called tkinter. The algorithm was structured in an easily modifiable layout, due to its static philosophy with the exclusive usage of only built-in libraries and modules in addition to the already known and commonly used ""Pythonic"" data structures (e.g dictionaries,lists). This software comes with the Open Software license GPL v3.
For a more descriptive view on how the algorithm was implemented, links for the available versions are provided in a further section.
Input Files and Result
The first input file requested from TaiCO is a GCN table in simple text format. Although the software comes bundled with 7 GCN files from model organisms, other GCN tables can be uploaded. The second input file that the user has to provide is a list with a single or even multiple protein sequences in FASTA format. The final input file that the user can provide is the powerful capability of parsing a simple text file including the sequences of the restriction sites that have to be absent from the optimized DNA resulting sequences. The output of the analysis is a file saved in a FASTA format that contains all the optimized DNA sequences.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Early biophysical work shows that homodimer is the active form of MerR. The metal binding domain lies at the C-terminal half of the protein, as predicted by earlier genetic, biochemical, and biophysical work, while the Helix-Turn-Helix DNA binding domain locates at the N-terminal (Fig 1A). To be specific, MerR can response to as low as 10-9 M Hg (II) even in the presence of 1 to 5 mM competing thiol ligands[1] ,which indicates that MerR may act as an effective mercury accumulator in aquatic environment.
However, since MerR is a transcription regulator, over-expression of MerR in bacteria may lead to some unpredictable side effect. Earlier work suggested that the truncated peptide only consisting of the metal binding domain can form a stable dimer with its mercury binding affinity remained [2];"

The last decade has seen a significant increase in the use of vector controlling methods to prevent infection with malaria. Vector control is where the population of the malaria spreading vector, the mosquito, and its access to people is controlled. For example the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) is a very popular method of vector control. Today, 43% of the population that is at risk sleeps under these nets, which is a significant increase from only 2% in 2004. Sleeping under these nets significantly reduces the risk of being bitten by parasite carrying mosquitos. In the future, more of these nets should be provided to people in at risk regions of the world.
For the future of GMO’s in the atmosphere, when it comes to making mosquito species that cannot carry the plasmodium parasite or eliminating a certain mosquito species completely by genetic modification, Kay Monroe concluded that :
(People) are concerned about creating Franken-monster mosquitoes or something ridiculous like that. We need to do a lot more communication at the lay person level to make sure people understand what’s going on to explain to them about GMOs.
Other drugs and the future of SSA
Both Chris Paddon and Kathleen Monroe shed some light on future projections when it comes to combating Malaria with different drugs as well as on the future of SSA and plant based artemisinin to fight the disease in the coming years. Chris mentioned that the Gates foundation funded some other projects like the one in University of York in the UK where they’re actually developing higher production plants capable of producing more artemisinin.
Kay Monroe went further on to talk about future prospects in the drug industry:
There is really amazing technology about state-of–the-art drugs but it’s very expensive so they can’t be used in the developing world right now. The WHO is well aware of this, trying to address it. The manufacturers have to work at a level where they make the drug and package it... With 3D printers you can do pretty much anything. A US drug just got made through 3D printing. But then again such and other kinds of advanced technology is very difficult to implement in the developing world.
She also mentioned about MMV- Medicines for Malaria Venture, who have a portfolio of drugs that have a different mechanism of action from artemisinin and are currently in phase 2 and 3 drug trials. They are to be released in the market in 3 to 5 years. When it comes to growing Artemisia plants, she said that it will easily stay in the market for the next 10 to "
