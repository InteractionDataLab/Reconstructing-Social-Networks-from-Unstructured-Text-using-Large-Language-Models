UCLouvain,2018,Team:UCLouvain#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," our project, we paired up with Young Change Maker to interconnect non-scientific people with young researcher.
Market analyze
Swot analyze
Strengths:
Our solution has modular design, that can be easily modified according to the specific pathogen genes that to want to target.
We want to offer a new solution to fight bacterial infections.
We build strong partnerships with key market leaders to push our project further in the different aspects (Hospital, Lab, Regulator).
It is a huge market size.
Weaknesses:
We have to engineer an efficient bio-containment system to be able to spread our solutions (we already have an approach).
We encounter few stability problems that we still have to fix.
Opportunities:
We created a new approach in a inflated field, it is huge market and many companies are working on it.
We are working on an patented application with the Technological Transfer Office of our university.
Threats:
To have a go to market we have a lot of process to go through. This solution require heavy preclinical studies and clinical studies.
The legal frame for GMO and CRISPR based therapeutic solutions.
There are already on the market a similar approach that use a engineered plasmid, however their vector is different since they use phages as vector.
Our field approach
From the very beginning, we wanted to work on a real solution to address a real problem. The only way to understand what we were potentially going to face was a trip in the field! For this reason our colleague Sara, medical student and iGEMer decided to go to Benin on a humanitarian trip.
The Benin was not choose by hazard, we talked with our partner the Belgian Red Cross to organize this trip. Benin is heavily affected by cholera and salmonella outbreak. Through our contact with the Red Cross Sara were able to visit the infected camps in the north of the country.
It was a life-impacting experience that allowed us to help local people and even more important to collect data on epidemics! We had the advices of several local microbiologists and doctors to better understand the local conditions. One of our learnings was for instance to graphically explain how to use our solution, rather than a written explanation due to the low literacy level. This may seems like a detail, but all this kind of information is crucial to develop a real solution.
Once again we were glad to see that our project impressed many people and the terrible situations we saw pushed us once again to do our best to achieve our project. We can have an impact and we have a potentially interested public!

The ligation failed. We amplified more of the dCas9 system using PCR Rescue, in which 2 out of 4 PCR's were successful - both Emily's!. We are evaluating this difficult PCR and will be altering the annealing temperature. PCR Rescue for dCas9 were repeated at 58 degrees C and 62 degrees C annealing temperature. We inoculated LB broth with ampicillin resistance and dCas9 from cryogenic stock. We also conducted colony PCR of the second set of genome overlaps. We received our sequencing results and two out of three colonies have the correct sequence.
Overnight cultures of transformed cells streaked on plates.

PCR Rescue RFP cassette and gel purified - all 4 RFP PCR's worked. Gel purified dCas9 Rescue from yesterday. PCR Rescue colE1 origin and chloramphenicol resistance cassette to construct plasmid 2, which will contain ColE1, CmR, RFP, HMF pathway, and two P. putida genome overlaps. We plasmid prepared new dCas9 to use as a template for PCR. New and old dCas9 templates were used for PCR Rescue of the third genome overlap. See the schematic here for more information.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#jp_-_-_TEXT.html,"  In 2010, the Japanese government invested US$ 50 to 60 billion in science and technology, with life science being viewed as an area for significant future growth. Many companies are therefore looking for chances to benefit from this opportunity (""The Japanese market,"" ).
One example of a government-funded research institute is Okinawa Health Biotechnology Research and Development Center. It provides free research facilities to biotechnology companies. Additionally, it promotes the development of manufactured products through collaboration between government, industry, and academia (""The future of,"" 2011).
Regulations for Synthetic Biology
In a life science workshop in 2006, “design and reproduction of life function” was highlighted by the Center for Research and Development Strategy, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST CRDS) as a field with principle priority. Also, in cooperation with local experts in fields related to synthetic biology, the Council of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology proposed a policy to promote research on synthetic biology. At the same time, it considered the need to draft regulations against improper applications of synthetic biology. Although following the pre-existing “Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms” could minimize the occurrence of a serious problem, it would be necessary to improve regulation of synthetic biology by specifically mentioning it in a new law (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011).
Perception of Synthetic Biology
In 2010, only 15% of the population was familiar with the term synthetic biology.  This term showed up in 15 articles in the 5 major Japanese newspapers. The relatively low degree of social recognition is probably because significant discoveries of synthetic biology have not been widely reported, and researchers use terms other than synthetic biology such as molecular biology and systems biology to describe their work (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011).
People
Hirohide Saito, Koji Sode, Kenichi Yamazaki are examples of Japanese scientists who have interest in synthetic biology.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," require flipping the BioBricks added to the preceding strand or using reverse complement BioBricks. This would not be very convenient. Hence, we made a duplication of the OR sites, one coupled with the PRM and the other connected to the PR promoter. We suggest we are able to repress the PR promoter and activate the PRM promoter with CI dimers despite this duplication.
The third hypothesis is related to the DNA looping as a result of CI octamerization at the operator sites ( ). Originally, DNA looping takes place between OR and OL sites by octamerization of CI dimers bound to operator sites 1 and 2 at both locations. As OR and OL regions resemble each other in terms of CI affinity and as the interacting factor seems to be CI and not the DNA sequence, we hypothesize that OL could be replaced by OR region without losing the DNA looping capability. This would also underline the significance of the previous assumption: as we have duplicated the OR sites we already have the hypothetical factors required for DNA looping and PRM repression. Therefore, if we duplicate the OR region and separate them with correct number of bases, we might be able to form the DNA loop between these regions without having an OL region as illustrated in .
The lambda repressor functions in lambda prophage when the virus is in the lysogenic state. This means the lambda repressor is integrated as a part of the genome. It has been shown that the DNA looping takes place in the infected E. coli cells (Manzo et al., 2012). However, we have not found evidence that this would happen also in the plasmids containing the lambda repressor region. It is possible the supercoiled structure of the plasmid prevents the normal function of the lambda repressor. We have identified three possible scenarios. Firstly, the lambda repressor could function within the plasmid without any issues. Alternatively, the loop size formed by lambda repressor may be changed or it may be easier or more difficult to be formed but it may work with some modifications. The worst scenario is that the lambda repressor does not work at all in the plasmid context. In such case, our three channel switch could be integrated to the E. coli genome.
Lastly, we made some hypotheses regarding the CI concentration. The wild type CI half-life has been measured to be longer than 10 hours (Parsell et al., 1990). This would mean that it takes very long time to reduce the CI concentration that is, switch back from the channel C in our system. However, we can fuse an ssrA tag to the protein"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,". This makes up the skeleton of our project. It describes the steps that are necessary to get an Evobody sequence and how to continue after the production of the Evobody itself. It involves the procedures that are applied when an order for a new target is issued up to the finished product that is then send out (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1: Flowchart of the main process
Second is the generation of an Evobody sequence that shows the greatest binding properties to our target. This is achieved with our system. It involves the generation of the library, the system for mutating the sequence of the Evobody and the constant selection for the best binder.
Fig. 2: Flowchart for the generation of an Evobody sequence
Last but not least is the actual process of producing our Evobody, the extraction and cleanup of the Evobody before it can be shipped. It starts with the amplification of the sequence for the best binder that is the result of the second process and ends with the purified and stabilized binding protein. Our Evobody.
Fig. 3: Flowchart for the production of an Evobody
Upscaling Process
In order to transfer our project to an industrial level we had to compare the differences between the scales of processes in production and a research group, respectively. For the process of upscaling we consulted different experts from different fields: Prof. Dr. Karl Friehs (fermentation technology), Prof Dr. Thomas Noll (cell culture technology), Dr. Joe Max Risse (fermentation technology) and Dr. Martin Schleef (Plasmid Factory). Our main concerns are the approval by the government institutions and the efficient production of our Evobody protein. This takes the method of cultivation as well as the materials used into consideration. The most in important thing is the process of creating the best binder, our Evobody, is still rather small and can be done on the level of a single lab. In case of binding protein production, a large scale fermentation process is needed for production in large quantities. We discussed two approaches: a repeated batch and a continuous culture, respectively. The repeated batch is easier and there is no dilution of e.g. antibiotics over time. In the continuous batch we would face a lower m
y
(the rate of growth) which means constant pressure on the cells, it is reproducible and we have constant conditions during the production process . The suggested cultivation time is supposed to be between 10 and 12 generation times. Also adding another carbon source like glucose or glycerin (that does not need autoclavation but sterile filtration) would improve the yield"

I made an electrophoresis and I tried to purify TAdh1·tetO2 and Purg from agarose gel, but TAdh1·tetO2 fragment migrates with bromophenol, so I had to repeat this process again. Then, I proceeded to ligate them o/n while keeping my fingers crossed, and transformed ligation product in DH5α the following day. There appeared colonies in spread petri plates. Colonies cracking didn't work, so I set up inocula to do minipreps next day. After an immeasurable colonies screening, I obtained two positive clones (19 and 35), Tadh1·tetO2·Purg is ready.
Digestion of Tadh1·tetO2·Purg with AscI and PacI is made to introduce the next component of this module, GFP·Tadh1·tetO4. I had the same problem: plasmid was not totally digested and control religation plate was plenty of colonies. Lesson learned: if you don't give enough time to a reaction, you'll be wasting your time.
Week 8 (September, 12-16)
Due to last week result, I made a new ligation reaction of Tadh1·tetO2·Purg plus  GFP·Tadh1·tetO4, but I obtained the same results: the same number of colonies in religation plate and ligation plates.
I kept on trying to clone tetR·CSD and tetR+Swi6 into the pREP41X vector, by digestion, precipitation of DNA, ligation and transformation, but the last step always failed.
Finally, I obtained sir3 gene by PCR, and also swi6, but they were lost in their purification.
Week 9 (September, 19-23)
Colony cracking of pREP41x + tetR-CSD and pREP41x + tetR + Swi6 didn't work, so I set up inocula of all the colonies in the plates to make an screening of them. I have made analytical digestions of the minipreps and, after two electrophoresis, it seems that I have a positive clone of thirty.

In addition to this, we contributed to generate electron microscopy pictures of our clinical isolates. These pictures will be used to educate high school students and contribute to increase knowledge    about biology among high school students. The bacteria was fixed and sent down to the electron microscopy department at UiO. These amazing pictures is made by Antje Hofgaard who works as an senior engineer at the department.

The iGEM competition gives us the opportunity to work in close collaboration with other regional and international institutions in a very interdisciplinary field. This exceptional experience is highly interesting, motivating and rewarding for students and advisors both on scientific and human aspects.
INSTRUCTORS
Yoann Louis (INSA)
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon and coordinator of the 2014 iGEM INSA-LYON Team. Up to now my work was mainly to study trace metals / organic matter behavior in various environment and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. I'm also currently working on metal and biological material interaction in order to find new way to treat human waste. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have an interdisciplinary approach of the project and not only a biological approach.
Corinne Dorel-Flamant (INSA)
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
Agnès Rodrigue (INSA)
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is a unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation to a metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.

Characterization of PcstA
Figure 1: The experimental setup
We sat out to improve the original reporter system – the PcstA-induced transcription of the gene encoding Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP). We wanted to further characterize the PcstA promoter PcstA PromoterPcstA is a carbon stress induced promotor. In absence of glucose the enzyme adenylate cyclase will synthesize cAMP from ATP. cAMP will bind CAP, catabolite activator protein, encoded by crp, and the complex recruit RNA polymerase to the promotor. There is an inverse relationship between cAMP and glucose, and this means that glucose can repress promotor activity., part: BBa_K118011 , by measuring the levels of mRNA through a Northern Blot.
Originally our reporter system was based on the part BBa_K861173 in which the promotor controls transcription of rfp. However, it is challenging to work with RFP, partly due to its relatively long folding time. Therefore we decided to perform the experiments with another brick, which also contained PcstA; BBa_K1135002. In this brick"

Reactions and ODE
A Simplified Model
We employed an ODE model. We defined the input to be AHLout the and the output to be the synthesis rate of mature GFP. In this system,we assumed the concentration of the LuxR was constant.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S2-4), (Recation S2-5) and (Recation S2-6) were considered to be able to get balance in a very short time.
From above equations, we can the change of PoPS respond to the AHLin.
For this system, the value of parameter d, 0.00847, could be estimated based on the measurement of the OD. For instance, when the concentration of AHLout was zero, the value of d was 0.00368 per minute. The values of 4.8E-3 per sec for rmG, 1.8E-3 per sec for a and 0.4 per sec for pG were got from the experiment conducted by Barry Canton and Anna Labno in 2004, click here to the details.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," the GadE on the mechanism.
The central activator is the LuxR-family member GadE (formerly known as YhiE). GadE binds to a 20-bp sequence called the gad box, which is located 63-bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites of gadA and gadBC. (4)GadE and GadBox are an important point for GadA and GadBC. This means that GadE and GadBox are an important for acid resistance. The basis section of acid resistance is GadE’s regulation. At least 10 different regulatory take part in this regulation.
GadE have three main activation mechanisms. The first of these is performed by evgA and ydeO. About GadE activation phase:
1. EvgS (sensor kinase) activate EvgA (response regulator)
2. YdeO and evgA are independently from each other and GadE takes an active role in transcription activation.
The second GadE activation circuit includes CRP,RpoS and two AraC-like regulators, GadXand GadW.
These steps are as follows:
1. GadX and GadW, are located downstream of gadA also GadX and GadW directly activate transcription of gadE
2. GadX and GadW also bind to the gadA and gadBC gad box sequences and seem to repress the gadA and gadBC promoters. (4) GadW inhibits this GadX’s repression  Also GadX and GadW regulate indirectly GadA/BC transcriptional functions.
3. The balance of power in this circuit is influenced by cAMP and CRP,which together inhibit the synthesis of RpoS. Growth under acidic conditions reduces the concentration of cAMP in the cell.  RpoS increases GadX’s transcriptional function  The increase in GadX then stimulates transcription of GadE and also down regulates GadW.
The third activation of GadE contains TrmE and glucose. These steps are as follows:
1. The function of TrmE in the cell is not fully defined but it does have a clear effect on tRNA modification
2. TrmE and glucose increase independently GadE’s transcriptional function
We discourse GadE’s regulation and then now we will discourse GadE’s effect mechanisms. GadA/BC’s effect mechanisms to acid resistance are as follows:
1. The external pH is normally neutral but if external pH turns to acidic pH, internal pH begins to become acidic pH with HCl diffusion.
2. If the external pH=2,5 and internal pH begins pH=4.2 ± 0"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html,"ensus’ variants a RBS B. subtilis. Structures i and ii contain a single operator, whereas structures iii and iv contain a triplicate of operators adjacent to each other. The triplicate repeats of the operator were designed to allow stronger and more reliable repression, in an effort to reduce leakiness of expression. In the interest of characterizing and developing an optimal system, a total of five different operators were chosen, for a total of 20 unique composite regulatory parts.
We continued our efforts to validate the presence of our parts that we have miniprepped. Additionally, we “synthesized” some of the small parts such as promoters, notably pTetR due to the several failed attempts of isolating it. We also received several plasmid vectors for use in B. subtilis from iGEM HQ, which were streaked over the weekend. Unfortunately we had some troubles with contamination, as such we are still trying to obtain the necessary parts.
We spent a few days preparing for our first outreach program at Calgary’s Science Centre. The topic was Food Science. We practiced (and enjoyed) a protocol for the extraction of DNA from strawberries, which ultimately resulted in strawberry daiquiris. We also explained to the public the molecular mechanisms behind certain food-related phenomena such as why banana’s go brown, and why browned meat tastes better as well as the flavor of unami.
Week 6: June 16 - 20
Our ‘synthesized’ parts - pTetR, pC1-lambda, pC1-434, pC2-P22, RBS x2 - were ligated into plasmid vectors, and subsequently validated. We now have all of the parts necessary for the assembly of our constructs. Additionally we prepared constructs for synthesis, a total of 20 distinct reporter genes. The genes will vary with respect to 2 different RBSs, and 5 different operators (repressible promoters). Additionally, we created one set with a single operator, and another set with 3x of each promoter directly adjacent. We would like to be sure that our reporter is tightly regulated, eventually we will perform a quantitative analysis of each.
After further investigation into literature and discussion, the crRNA strategy may not be as viable as initially thought. The upstream ‘cr’ sequence must be complementary to the entire RBS, which is a problem because it must also be complementary to the target DNA sequence - a sequence which we have very little control over. According to the literature, there are multiple parameters in regards to the sequence design which must be considered, including optimization of"

Additionally, our goal was to see a correlation between the mRNA expression levels and the motility of our engineered E. coli on swimming plates. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qrtPCR) as a powerful tool for quantification of gene expression. We used this method to examine the expression rate of the eight different constitutive promoter constructs from the parts registry that were further confirmed by swimming assays. The reported activities of these promoters are given as the relative fluorescence of these plasmids in strain TG1 (parts registry: Part:BBa_J23100 ). The results are depicted in Figure 11. Here, promoter constructs were cloned into the vector pSB1C3 and expressed in E.coli BL21DE3 grown in LB-media (lysogeny broth). The measurements were performed as a triplet for each construct and a house-keeping gene coding for a 16SrRNA (rrsD) as reference. Additionally, we included H2O as negative no template control to predict possible contaminations. For the evaluation of our results, the 2–ΔΔCT (Livak) method was applied. We used the weakest promoter with the lowest expression rate as calibration for the calculations and as reference the housekeeping gene. The data was then compared to the predetermined expression rates from iGEM2006_Berkeley group.
Overall, as shown in Figure 11, each tested promoter construct indicated differences in expression rates in comparison to values from the parts registry. In fact, both data-sets were collected by methods which produce data at different points after gene expression. A common trend was detected for the strongest promoters J23100, J23104, J23105 and J23109 together with the weakest promoters J23112 and J23113. Conspicuously, the promoter J23109 revealed for qrtPCRand for relative fluorescence measurements nearly the same expression rates. The expression rates of J23114 and J23106 indicated massive differences in their expression rates and no common trend with the expression values from the parts registry. We detected comparable positioning in the ranking of expression rates (see characterization of constitutive promoters by qrtPCR ) for six out of our eight promoters. The promoters characterized as relatively strong were also, in our case, responsible for higher expression rates and the other way around.

Models for the gold sensing device (BBa_K1127008)
Solutions to this problem are relatively simple. The law of mass action which is widely used in biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology is one of the straightforward approaches. However, it requires a massive amount of data at different points in time. This is very tricky to maintain accuracy and to spend less resource.  Fitting pre-existing models in our data came to us as a plausible solution. So we measured activities of the device when it reached steady states. Data were collected and fit into the nonlinear models for comparison.
We computed information Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine quality of the models. Regardless of values of the goodness of fit, Logistic is the best model among the three. So model parameters of the Logistic are estimated and shown here.
The model is simulated and compared with the experimental data. As seen in the Figure 1, Logistic is well fit and could be a good reflection of reality.
The model is extended to include diffusion of the gold. 'e' is the diffusion constant. In the other word, it is the permeability of the bacterial envelope for the ion Au(III). We solved the differential equations and produced simulations to predict behaviour of the system in various conditions.
The model predicts multiple steady. As seen in the Figure 2, the system could reach higher steady states with increasing gold concentration.
In Figure 3, the system is fairly robust. It could approach the same steady state despite of differences in the diffusion constants.
For the sake of curiosity, we include expression of the synthetic peptide for gold bio-mineralization. Extension of the model is shown below.
Literature about this peptide is scarce, so we make following assumptions:
1.
is the change in expression of the peptide;
2. Gold bio-mineralization is a linear process with the constant rate 'f';
3. Secretion of the peptide is in the form of standard Hill equation
with Hill coefficient=1;
4. The peptide is degraded through a linear process i[peptide]out.
The model is simulated and shown in Figure 4. It suggests that the system could undergo the decline phase.  The rates of reduction could vary depending on the rates of bio-mineralization.
Our models can't produce precise numerical solutions of the real world problems. However, they have capabilities to describe structures and to generate broad outcomes to what might happen in certain conditions. This qualitative approach is actually advantageous as it provides "

It’s also hard to decide the type of experiment regarding safety, short duration and equipment availability. On the other hand, we started our preparation on the PPT and graphs that are needed for demonstration.
On July 28, we went to Zhejing University where the lab of Worldshaper-XSHS is located. We visited their lab and the team leaders discussed about the usage of Bio Parts sent by the committee as ours seemed have already denatured due to preservation problem. Recently, there were a few technique-related problems in our experiment. The leader and members from experimental group discussed about the possible cause and showed us their colony of fungi， given that we had trouble developing colonies and there were too few of them in each trial. While we were trying to figure out the usage and possible solution for our Bio Parts-problem, we visited the lab of iGEM team at Zhejiang University. Our leader and Worldshaper-XSHS’s team leader talked to the team members of ZJU-China about the problem we had. At about 3 pm that afternoon, we gave a presentation to students and teachers from Yiling Highschool. ASTWS-China talked about synthetic biology, Wordshaper-XSHS talked about “What is iGEM”, Wordshaper-Nanjing and our team introduced our projects to the audiences. The short video made by Worldshaper-XSHS gave us an idea of making short videos teach others about the knowledge and technique we used in the project. (We had thought about making a video but it’s more like a propaganda.)
July 29 to the morning of July 30, the four teams sent their representatives to mathematics modeling class which was told by a professor from Zhejiang University. Other team members had to decide the experiment we are going to do, and the leader of Worldshaper-XSHS helped us bought the equipment we needed.
July 30, we held the activity in the China Zhe Jiang Science and Technology Museum. Short videos about iGEM and the teams’ projects were released. There were fun experiments that attracts kids and their parents. The team members went out to hand out the fans with texts that introduce our projects printed on them. There were parents that felt curious about the competition and our projects. The activity lasted until the museum closed. From this meet up, we learned a lot from our experiences and had a better idea on how to introduce synthetic biology as well as our projects to"

Proteolysis
Inhibition system
Inhibition system
Proteolysis is a very common system to regulate gene expression in all organisms. In bacteria, proteins can be targeted for proteolysis by adding a special degradation tag in their coding sequences. That’s how the Sspb-ClpXP system, which we are going to use, works.
In E.coli, ClpX recognize specific degradation tags – ssrA tags -, unfolds the attached protein and translocates this denatured polypeptide into ClpP for its degradation, which is very fast. The action of this ClpXP protease is enhanced by the SspB adaptator protein. However, it’s impossible to control proteolysis by this mechanism by manipulating SspB availability, as ClpXP protease can recognize and degrade these tagged proteins without Sspb’s aid. The degradation model is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. ClpXP-Sspb proteolysis model. Taken from McGinness et al. (2006)
Different sequences of the ssrA tag are recognized by the protease and the adaptator. As we can see in Figure 2, de AANDENY portion of the tag binds SspB and the LAA portion binds ClpX. McGinness et al. came to the conclusion that if the interaction of the tag with ClpX was decreased, without affecting that with the SspB, the adaptor-dependence would be increased. With this change, it would be possible to control this proteolysis system by regulating the SspB levels.

BUCT-China,2014,Team:BUCT-China_-_-_TEXT.html," be limiting in the environment, requiring active uptake mechanisms to import minimum concentrations of essential metals (Butler 1998; Outten et al. 2000).Bacteria can encounter purely toxic metals, such as Hg, Cd and As, which have no beneficial role in cellular metabolism, and must be avoided, removed or neutralized metal. The key first step in how bacteria respond to varying levels of both toxic and essential metals in the internal environment of the cell is due to the metal sensor and regulator proteins that they encode. There are several known types of prokaryotic metal ion sensing regulators. These include the MerR and Fur families of regulators, the ArsR/SmtB family repressors and several other structural regulator types .
MerR – a mercury sensing gene activator
A key class of prokaryotic metal ion responsive activators is the MerR family, of which the mercuric ion sensing MerR is the archetype. The closely-related 144 amino-acid MerR proteins from the mercuric ion resistance (mer) operons from transposons Tn501 and Tn21 have been the most heavily studied of these proteins (reviewed in Summers 1992, 1986; Hobman & Brown 1997;Outten et al. 2000a; Barkay et al. 2003; Brown et al.2003, and references therein), and the mechanism of Hg(II) resistance is now well known (reviewed most recently by Barkay et al. (2003)). In the mer operon from Tn501, MerR binds to operator DNA within a divergent promoter and regulates both its own expression and  expression of the downstream structural genes. The MerR family of metal-binding, metal-responsive proteins is unique in that they activate transcription from unusual promoters and coordinate metals through cysteine residues. They have conserved primary structures yet can effectively discriminate metals in vivo. Activation of transcription from the PmerT promoter by MerR in response to Hg(II) is hypersensitive (Ralston &O’Halloran 1990; Rouch et al. 1995), with virtually total induction of promoter activity occurring across a very narrow Hg(II) concentration rang. MerR has a strong selectivity for Hg(II) (Ralston & O’Halloran 1990)and Hg(II) has a very high affinity for MerR (Shewchuk et al. 1989b).

Confirmed source found earlier was an explanation of the math behind geodesic domes. We will use the same math for calculating the size and placement of the pieces of the structure that should be made from fungi. Turns out it geodesic domes are based on a icosahedron, split into smaller triangles with corner points projected onto a circle, to ensure a more circular structure which ensures more equal distribution of structural load.

we had a meeting to determine the deadlines and assigned names to each wiki part. Results from the replicated experiment of the best substrates from the pilot study came in and seemingly the lower temperatures of design was too low and so these were changed. Also seemingly pure rice gave the best results with regards to compression strength. The design was carried out once more with the new lower temperature. Also the Ganoderma experiments started using the same DOE as the Aspergillus fungi.

Fully automated calibration using color sensors
Automatic  Interpolation of Physical Location of each well
GUI (Graphical User Interface) to generate DNA Assembly Programs
Batch Scheduling Option with Timing
Additon of a third LegoRoboBrick, called MU (Movement Utility)
Single-Master-Multiple-Slaves synchronization
Support User Defined LegoRoboBricks
Support pipetting between individual tubes and 96-well plates
Support pipetting between two 96-well plates
Support pipetting of 12 tips simultaneously
Fully automated calibration using color sensors
In the current version, the calibration of the ALPHA is semi-automated. During the calibration process, the robot positions the pipette head above 3 well position: A1, H1 and A9. The user then fine-tuned the 3 known positions by adjusting the NXT brick menu.  An improvement of this process would be to use color sensor to detect the grid positions of A1, H1 and A9. We could use color dots or color lines to indicate these positions, and during the calibration phase, the pipette head will move until the sensors detect the pre-specified dots or lines.
Automatic  Interpolation of Physical Location of each well
From the 3 well positions A1, H1 and A9, we will use interpolation to compute the physical location of all the 96 wells. Note that the 96 well plate may not be perfectly horizontal, so the most accurate method would be to interpolate in 3 dimensions. We will need to detect the x, y, and z coordinates of the 3 calibration wells.
GUI to generate DNA Assembly Programs (On PC)
Version 2.0 will have a menu-driven GUI to generate , for example,  the following DNA Assembly Segment.
Move A1, Aspirate
Move D9, Dispense, Clean
Move B1, Aspirate
Move A9, Dispense Clean
The user will be shown the picture of a 96 well plate, and the use can click on well location and select actions. We will also have actions with higher granularity, for example
Transfer A1, D9

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Product Design
TERRA addresses the lack of accessibility of microfluidics to the synthetic biology community by automating the exportation of outputs of microfluidic experiments onto standard lab vessels, such as a 96-well plate. Currently, researchers can either manually collect these outputs and transfer them into plates for later analysis or invest in highly specialized equipment, such as embedded sensors, to run real time, on chip analysis.1 Manual collection disrupts the benefits of automated microfluidic experiments, and implementing sensors requires extensive knowledge which synthetic biologists typically do not have.2 Incorporating sensors and other analytical systems on microfluidic chips requires expertise of microelectronics and fluid dynamics, as well as time for characterization of the devices. TERRA is the accessible and automated solution to incorporate microfluidic technology into the experimental workflow for synthetic biologists.
The Problem and TERRA
Some of the reasons why microfluidic devices are currently inaccessible and not widely used in the field of synthetic biology are as follows:
A lack of standardization across the microfluidic industry - differences in chip sizes, materials, and manufacturing methods
Difficult to integrate sensors into microfluidic devices - requires knowledge of microelectronics and fluid dynamics as well as takes time to fully characterize the system
Difficult to export the output of microfluidic devices in an organized manner - harder to integrate into other workflows
A lack of standardization of synthetic biology protocols - different labs use variations of similar protocols making it harder to design microfluidic chips for a general synthetic biology protocol
High entry costs to begin manufacturing microfluidic chips
TERRA addresses all of these limitations either directly or indirectly.
TERRA is microfluidic agnostic - since TERRA was designed to be compatible with both self-designed and commercial microfluidic chips, TERRA treats the microfluidic chip of interest like a black box system. Through the TERRA Adapter, the user connects their chip of interest to TERRA to facilitate select and redirect outputs.
TERRA is an automated system capable of selectively dispensing the output of a microfluidic chip into common lab vessels - as a system, TERRA consists of an active XY-plane and"

Both genes are to scale. In the real bacteria they both would appear in the same plasmid and completely twisted. They both have a promoter at the beginning and a terminator at the end.
After this, we have RNAP (green circles) which can move freely around the cytoplasm until they find a promoter. Once they do it, they have a given chance of starting to transcribe. When they transcribe, they generate a RNAm molecule. When they finish transcription, this RNA molecule will move till stop in a randomly place in the cytoplasm. Each RNAm molecule remains a given time in the cell before it “dies” and disappears; this time is given by a normal distribution with mean of 5 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute (by default, but you can change this value to experiment with it).
The big yellow circles represent ribosomes, which move freely around the cytoplasm until they find the Shine-Dalgarno of a RNA. At that moment they start the translation. When they finish, they generate a repressor protein. The size of the ribosomes is also to scale, measuring 20 nm of diameter (Kaczanowska M 2007 ).
Repressors1, in red in the plots, represent LacI, which become inactive if they are attached to IPTG. If the user adds IPTG to the cell he will able to inactivate lots of them. The monitors allow you to see online how many repressors are inactive.
Repressors2, in blue, represent c1ts repressors, which become unstable and “die” when the temperature is increased. If the user establishes the temperature at 42 degrees, repressors2 will start to disappear. The temperature effect tells us how many times faster the repressors2 disappear if the temperature is 42.
Repressors1 can attach to kind-2 promoters and repress them, blocking their transcription, and vice-versa. The number of repressor molecules that a promoter can admit can be chosen by the user (0 means no limit)
The amounts of all molecules (except RNA polymerases and ribosomes to simplify the simulation) decrease sharply to the half once the bacterium passes through a cell cycle. All free molecules move following the rules of the Brownian movement.

Worldshaper-Nanjing,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Nanjing#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," of the respondents choose the way that we like to called low-carbon. Although the truth is the number of private cars are still increasing, we can suggest that people are willing to use public transportation and the awareness actually has positive influence on people’s behaviors and renders them to make reasonable choices.
v.Knowledge about Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
Responses to this question demonstrate that respondents are not familiar with scientific carbon sequestration techniques. Conventionally, media emphasizes on reducing emission, blames factories and fossil-burning vehicles, and criticizes commercial lumbering, which is how people commonly learn about means to tackle global warming – namely, by reducing emission and planting more trees. However, methods involving active sequestration of CO2 were largely crippled in news coverage. It is this finding that gives us insight to a broader education on CCS in our schools and beyond.
vi.Perspective on CCS
After we informed respondents on the notion of CCS, we learnt that most of our respondent approve CCS technique, but with reserve. Some of them admit technical problems are non-neglected obstacles. Also, most CCS technique costs a lot and problems may emerge during disposal. Our respondents, in return, helped us realize problems underlying current methods and further incented us to pursue our cause.
2.Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum
On July 30th this summer vacation, we went to Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum to promote our project by presenting them to the visitors of the museum. We had prepared a presentation board and a video in order to introduce our project to the public with some background knowledge and information about our carbon fixer. To attract the visitors, we conducted some interesting experiments together with some children. What’s more, we had a n enjoyable and close collaboration with Worldshaper-XSHS, Worldshaper-Wuhan, and ASTWS-CHINA, including preparing the materials for experiments, performing experiments in front of public together, and communicate with each other about our projects. Not only did our team successfully promote our project that day, but we also attained some useful knowledge from Worldshaper-XSHS and got inspiration from them.
""I believe the important thing is not to show how good our project is, but to reveal the urgency of climate change and everyone's responsibility facing this challenge"" said Yilong after the event.
And we did make some noise – our project and public engagement was covered in local news and magazines.
3.Effort on social media
With the help of the Internet, we were able to let our research heard.

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:
Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the"

The experts talk
We had the opportunity to discuss our research with senior researchers as well as other students. On September 20th, we talked with Prof. Dirk Stemerding, senior researcher at the Rathenau Instituut (NL), and on September 27th, we could discuss our project with Prof. David Kong, Director of the Community Biotechnology Initiative at MIT Media Lab, Boston.
We are very grateful to have had these discussions because they were really helpful in understanding different aspects of our project, and obtaining interesting suggestions. It is also a pleasure they accepted to insert their names in our wiki for Human Practices!
The main aspect we discussed was about the influence our science art project could have on public opinion. According to Prof. Stemerding, we should have as goal to attract public opinion and make it closer to biotechnology, which is often misunderstood and somehow considered a kind of obscure matter. We will try our best to involve common people and to make them aware of biotechnologies using other strategies such as music, which is an international language that can be easily understood by everyone unlike scientific language. Professor Stemerding told us that our approach to genetical engineering could also sensitize common people (and perhaps make them change their minds) on GMOs and the usage of laboratory animals, even though we are working on bacteria. Eventually, when we asked his opinion about the kind of music we should play with the band “Sound of Coli”, whether an existing melody or something new he promptly exclaimed that it will be definitively better a proper music from Coli, so people will be able to listen directly to the sound of life!
Prof. Kong was very positive that our biotechnology project can sensitize common people to science using the international language of music which is innovative with respect to the visual aspect of science, even though the latter is more powerful. He reckoned that our idea was a really cool novel method to make common people closer to science, and he also said that children could play with it in the future! He also gave us another interesting clue: given that we associate science art, which is visible, to music, we could also be able to bring blind people closer to biotechnology"

4)Characterization/ Contribution
a)Took PETase gene from Baltimore 2016 team and realized the sequence was wrong, so we ordered our own and created a new PETase biobrick. This biobrick contains the PETase enzyme on a constitutive promoter and an amilCP reporter gene with a double terminator.
Silver Medal:
1)Validated part/ contribution
a)created a mutant PETase enzyme with amino acid changes to increase reaction rate. We added this enzyme to the same circuit as the wild type PETase to test the reaction rates of each. We were able to characterize that the amilCP reporter gene in the circuits worked properly so the DNA was correct.
b)We created a circuit containing the mutant PETase enzyme and an mHETase enzyme with the same reporter gene as our other circuits. We characterized that the DNA worked because of the reporter gene

Daniel C.:
When did you start working with chlamydia?
Dr. Meyer:
The first time working with chlamydia was in 1990 in the private laboratory, where we developed an in house PCR test for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis. It was one of the first organisms we considered for PCR testing.
Daniel C.:
What is your experience with diagnostic methods for Chlamydia trachomatis? What kind of diagnostics are there at the moment?
Dr. Meyer:
Right now we are using primarily amplification tests for direct detection of the pathogen in different clinical materials and we are also using serology, testing for antibodies. There are certain diseases where serology may be helpful, this is not the acute infection of the global infection but there are some cases of chlamydia infection that may become chronic and result from ascending infections like for example reactive arthritis. And the department of pathology have sometimes questions and they send us samples for Chlamydia trachomatis for the testing of antibodies. So if you have no antibodies the joint disease is definitely not due to chlamydia, if you have antibodies it may be, but it is not definitely proved.
Daniel C.:
What are difficulties in developing chlamydia tests, maybe comparing industrial nations to developing nations.
Dr. Meyer:
First of all these pathogens are absolutely intracellular organisms, if you want to culture them you can not do this with conventional agar plates, you need an eukaryotic cell system. We have done chlamydia culturing in cell cultures in the private laboratory but stopped that in the late 1990ˋs because of the development of commercial PCR test it becomes much faster and more sensitive to detect chlamydia, so cell culture is no longer performed. This is a big problem for diagnostics. Now as amplification tests are quite easy to develop and can be obtained from different companies this is not a big problem but it begins with the development nucleic acid test. Many laboratories are depending on cultures and this is very difficult, it takes a lot of personnel, time and experience.
Daniel C.:
Are amplification tests used in developing countries?
Dr. Meyer:
Sometimes, I think most of them don't use amplification tests. This is a similar situation for HIV testing for example. If you think about a country like Cameroon for example they have very few laboratories that are doing amplification test and that would be the same for chlamydia.

During the conversation between two teams, they put forward their future plan to use a kind of reusable materials to adhere bacteria, which is exactly the same as we tried last year. The adviser of our team realized immediately that they might have chosen the wrong reusable material. Therefore, we gave them suggestions about choices of reusable materials. Students of their team were grateful hearing this useful suggestion. Moreover, we also provided them with materials shown in the picture, which is used for bacteria aggregation in solution. No doubt that we saved them a lot of time choosing the reusable material and building the right equipment.
Establishment of New iGEM Teams
 
1. Southeast University
 
Students from Southeast University are interested to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuit. However, they are not familiar with characteristics of DNA. They are also unaware of iGEM. They came to us for suggestions about how to use DNA to manipulate gate control circuits and expressed their interests in participating iGEM in 2017. Thus we assigned one of our team members, Zhen Li to help them with their project design as well as give them information about the iGEM competition. From then on, we formed intimate collaboration relationship with them and discussed with them every week to track their progress. We even specially designed a brochure containing detailed explanation of iGEM competition to them. ( Click here to get the PDF file. ) The collaboration goes smoothly and they have already formed ideas about the project in next year’s competition. They will establish a new iGEM team next year with our help!
 
 
2. TMMU-China
 
This year we also cooperated with team TMMU-China, which is a team participating in iGEM for the first time. For starters, we offered timely help to them around May on how to establish a team by sending basic plasmids and answering questions through social media. After many rounds of discussions, we invited them to Nanjing University to have a face-to-face communication about each other’s project on June 9th. In return for this little conference, on September 24th, some of our team members and our team leader joined the meeting up with TMMU-China along with a few other teams. It is indeed a wonderful collaboration experience and both of us benefited a lot from each other by regular discussions. We sincerely hope that we can hear good news from each other in Boston!

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the chemical were IPTG we would expect strong colour at the plate’s centre that faded gradually toward the circumference as the IPTG concentration dropped. Below we have described a fast and reliable way for casting the centre well using cylindrical magnets! Figures 3 and 4 show the detailed casting procedure, and a rough calibration method  using a visible dye.
                       
Fig 3. After several false starts using food colouring, we developed the following protocol for making gradient plates: LB agar plates were made using 25 mL of LB agar. A well in each plate was made using two cylindrical neodymium magnets (dimensions 12 mm long x 4mm dia) per well that sandwich the lid at the preferred location, as illustrated. When solidified the magnet is removed by gently lifting off the lid. Gradients were formed by adding 40uL of either 100x IPTG (10mM) or 100x ATC (100mM) to each well and allowing 8 hours at room temperature for diffusion prior to plating. Overnight cultures are diluted to an approximate cell concentration of between 0.5-1.0x105 cells/mL. 1-2x104 cells in 200 uL are plated by swirling 6 ball-bearings (6 mm diameter) on the plate surface until completely wetted. The plates are then dried under a tissue culture cabinet and incubated at 37C overnight. Important! Cell densities that exceed those specified above produce thin transparent lawns with poor colour development.
Figure 4. Diffusion estimation using food colour. 40 uL of undiluted food colouring was placed in the well of a radial gradient plate as described above and allowed to diffuse at room temperature for the indicated times. Based on these results were selected an 8-hour diffusion period for inducer gradient plates.
With a method to make inducer gradients, and strains responding to inducer levels, we were able to make our first colour gradients, shown in Figure 5 below. A lawn of cells from strains inducible with IPTG were plated on gradient plates, and imaged after growth under visible and UV light. Far from the plate center, IPTG levels are too low to generate noticeable RFP expression. Closer in, a region of high RFP expression is visible. As with our previous  induction experiments, peak RFP levels are higher with the weak promoter than the strong promoter. Close to the center of the plate, RFP expression is reduced nearly to zero; a consequence of a lack of colonies near the center. This may be due to toxicity"

Mile High Meetup #1  University of Colorado Boulder 9/25/2016
We had the pleasure of hosting both the Colorado State University and Denver Biolabs iGEM for a meeting and presentation of our projects, which implied formal presentation on their research done and what they plan to do prior to the Jamboree. Collaborations were discussed between the teams and lead to some constructive criticisms of the projects. One major point was to collaborate on further outreach next time in Denver so that we may present to a wider audience. Through this meetup we were introduced to Denver Biolabs, a community lab, who innovate in many interesting ways to cut costs. One plasmid that a past CU team had created was a gene for an EcoRI enzyme attached to an ELP tag for simple purification along with a visible light flourescent protein and methylase, which we provided to Denver Biolabs to help them produce a vital BioBrick enzyme at minimal cost.

Modeling
Bugfixes and Discovery of new bugs. A first set of experiments was designed to adjust the model to the real behaviour of the experiment. Focus lies in the development of the phage titer under different conditions. The numeric PREDCEL model contained a mistake in the binding constant between phage and E. coli, k  and was therefore rerun. Compared to the last results the corrected version has better results for longer time in the lagoons and higher starting concentrations of phage.
A first version of the iGEM goes green page with calculations for the medium consumption went online. This also was the first real application of in line LaTex as well as plotly.js on the wiki.
The numeric model with a fitness distribution instead of a single fitness value for a lagoon was expaneded by adding a mutation model based on normally distributed changes in fitness that is symmetric to the previous value for each value. The next improvement will probabbly be a parameter that allows for assymetric changes, as most mutations decrease fitness.

When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

High School
Recalling our passion and interest in science during high school and our ability to discuss it at length with just about anyone (much to the dismay of our parents we’re sure), we reached out to ProCivitas Privata Gymnasium to host a lecture on the importance of environmental sustainability and microplastic pollution in hopes that our message would trickle down to their friends and family. Additionally, in hopes of inspiring the students to pursue higher education, we discussed our life as university students, the iGEM competition and science research.
Albert and Sofia sharing their conviction of sustainability.
Being the first team to be blessed to represent Lund University in the iGEM competition, we feel a great responsibility to share the story of our journey to show that there are opportunities for students to actively contribute to science. ProCivitas, as a high school well known for nurturing an early passion for science by allowing students to design and conduct their own experiments, was the perfect channel for this endeavour. We scheduled to give the the lecture just before ProCivitas’ allocated time for the student projects, with the intent of encouraging them to pursue projects related to sustainability.
We are glad that so many excited students wanted to attend our lecture.
A considerable part of the lecture was dedicated to discussing how we set out to realize our biosensor both in terms of the underlying hypothesis and through the discussions with experts on microplastics. Our belief was that presenting our systematic strategy would alleviate some of the uncertainty regarding the plausibility of their ideas and instead allow them to more freely brainstorm possible projects. Much to our excitement, it had the intended effect and we received a slew of ideas, questions and thoughts from the students both throughout the lecture and afterwards. We wrote down some of the questions that were posed:
“We would like to work with antibiotics during our project-period, we don’t really know how, but do you have any suggestions how we could implement synthetic biology?”
“Could you tell me more about the abstraction theory behind the biobrick? I thought it was very interesting in how the genetic information was re-packaged.”
“We like the environmental thinking behind your idea, are there any other environmental problems that you’ve heard of that we potentially could look into?”
“Who can participate in iGEM?”

Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”
Second step for building the standardized template was to get the     phylogenic information about the parts development process which includes     the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.

On Saturday we checked our bacteriophage spot test for plaques, but we saw none.  Our bacteriophage lambda purification procedure failed.  Dr. Grose thinks that inducing lambda to lysis by 43 degree heat shock must not have been sufficient stress.  Since we know H202 does induce our phage, we're going to attempt to isolate bacteriophage lambda by doing a top agar plaque assay with a drop of hydrogen peroxide, then bathing the top agar in LB, sucking it all up and then purifying the bacteriophage by chloroform lysis procedure.
Clarice has been working on submitting parts to the registry. She has cloned the Ydiv gene into the iGEM backbone to submit the part; we purified the plasmid for submission.

Clarice, Kelton, Dr. Grose and I discussed our plans for the next two weeks.
Clarice has been working on cloning SdiA into the iGEM backbone vector as well as GFP with a YdiV promoter.  SdiA is the membrane receptor protein that recognizes cholera's AHL, and it controls the YdiV promoter.  We will transform the YdiV plasmid into E.Coli and plate it next to cholera, expecting to see expression of GFP.

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," are many ethical issues that arise when discussing the use of nuclear power.  The impact of its use is felt environmentally, economically and socially.  Proponents of nuclear power argue that it is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and is a viable alternative to fossil fuels.  This reduces the environmental impact of producing power but does not answer the question of who would willingly want to have a nuclear plant in their backyard.  Opposition groups point out that there are threats to people, in the illicit production of nuclear weapons, and the environment, with the problems of processing, transporting and storage of radioactive nuclear waste.  There is currently no method to totally dispose of all the waste so some kind of arrangement is necessary to safely store the refuse. Once again, where would this facility be located and who would want it near their community where they are living?  Economically, because of the capital cost involved, the initial building of a nuclear power plant can be very costly.  As well, the regular expenditure required to store the waste material and the expense of the eventual decommissioning of the plant must all be considered when determining if nuclear power is the most economical method of power generation.
Take Home Message
Whether it is to determine the best alternative source of energy or the discovery of a method to eradicate the leftover refuse from the oil sands, it is imperative to study the ethical issues related to a product or procedure before implementation.  Many disasters can often be prevented through thorough discussions and investigations with knowledgeable people in their respective fields of study.

Conclusion
It has been very enlightening to look at scientific inventions of the past from an ethical point of view.  No matter which area of discovery that the Lethbridge iGEM team researched; cloning, antibiotics, the internet or nuclear power, it was obvious that there were social, environmental, economic and legal implications that always needed to be addressed.  Our synthetic biology project is no different.  What we have learnt from our investigation is that it is important to try to act proactively and anticipate problems that may arise and be a concern for the safety of all living matter.  Information needs to be readily available about synthetic biology so the public is knowledgeable about how it is being used and the discoveries that are being made to improve their well-being.  In all scientific research, a good public perception is vital since it will be the people through their corporate sponsorship and elected officials in government"

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," are few strong points to current biofilm technologies, with little or no industry standards, and a profound lack of awareness by industrial leaders and society in general. Biofilms are so little understood by industry (and society) that the problems they cause are essentially hidden. Without education, the problems will only continue to grow. “
Steffen Eickhardt, Head of Biofilm Test Facility, University of Copenhagen
“Almost all microbiological research is currently based on in vitro models, which have nothing or very little to do with what is observed in clinical samples.”
Steve Diggle, Steve Diggle Research Group, University of Nottingham
“Biofilm research is not really getting anywhere or providing solutions - innovations are more than welcome. Biofilms currently are not representative of reality and the field would benefit from a device mimicking a more realistic environment.”
Another category of answers refers to the importance of reproducibility and closeness to natural conditions for biofilms, characteristics that we identified as lacking in current biofilm formation technologies.
Reproducibility is a laudable goal and the prospects for process and product innovation are good, but only if the biofilm being produced synthetically actually mimics naturally occurring biofilms.
Dr. Jonathan Tyler, CEO, Tyler Advanced Corrosion Technologies (TACT)
Steffen Eickhardt, Head of Biofilm Test Facility, University of Copenhagen
“Our methods of testing are based on the current understanding of in vivo biofilm formation and chronic diseases. We strive to develop methods as close to in vivo as possible, whereas similar companies use methods developed in previous decades, which are primarily based on in vitro settings which are rarely applicable for chronic diseases.”
The last category shows thoughts on how Biolink - 3D printing of biofilms - can help industry and research.
Marko de Jager, Principal Scientist & Thought Leader, Philips Research
“With a 3D printer, there would be the ability to create multiple geometries independent from bioreactor constraints.  Currently used biofilm models allow for flat or simple curved surface areas. With a Biolinker, there arises the opportunity of creating even the more complex geometries.”
“Adhesion to surface/substrate and co-adhesion within the biofilm are essential properties. The possibility to fine tune these parameters in a consistent and predictable way, allows us to find the optimum between safety and efficacy for mechanical removal with either a toothbrush or water jet, depending on case.”

Synbio is just a S-Din away!
SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
During our project “S-Din”, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project and took them into practices to confirm or to overturn our hypothesis. Then we tried to integrate them into our final project in order to improve the project functions and user experience.
At the beginning of our project, in order to get answers to questions about user needs, safety, software regulations and legal issues, we conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. They gave us useful and significant suggestions ( Silver page ). We have considered all comments from professionals and integrated them into our design of S-Din ( Gold Integrated page ). We conducted further user interviews and user needs analysis, promoted S-Din and synthetic biology to the public ( Public Engagement page ).
Please see our human practices highlights during the entire product development on our Gold and Integrated Human Practices page .
Gold
When designing the project we have come up with many fine details for the software. Some came from our original ideas, others came from professionals in different fields. (See Silver )
We tried hard to put these inspirational details into the application of our software ""S-Din"". We tried to make more positive contributions to scientific and societal practices, and reduce and even eliminate the potential negative impacts.
Integrated database
Inspirations we have learned
By communicating with other iGEM teams, and chatting with different bio-lovers, we realized that fragmented data costs a lot of time and energy. We hope to establish such a database in S-Din, in a standard and easy-to-understand format. It will save one's time, which enables one to focus on his project ideas.
Integrated into the project
In S-Din's database, we standardize a new data format"

As a pure software team we are, our materials used for project or final products are not in any biohazard classification. Middle East Technical University complies with all regulations about office health and safety as required by Turkish Office of Safety and Health at Work (OSHA).  Safety and health issues that might be a concern for METU-BIN Team members can be addressed with general precautions for office workers, such as not working long hours in front of the computer screen, taking frequent, short breaks, using ergonomic equipment, changing position and posture to ease the pressure on certain joints and adding an exercise routine into their breaks to strengthen their posture.
Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):
pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity?
threats to environmental quality?
security concerns?
All answers to these questions are “no”. as we are a software team, we are not using BioBricks/devices physically. Therefore, our project is associated with none of the above.
If your response to any of the questions above is yes:
a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
The standard questions in the questionnaire about safety are not applicable to ""software"" projects as our project doesn't require any biological laboratory work and we won't be submitting any parts to the Registry.
Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
METU-BIN Team is supported by the Bioinformatics Program at METU Informatics Institute. Even though we are not a biological or natural sciences department we are doing our best to act within the national biosafety regulations our university has to comply with, which can be found on this page and also this page.
Do you have other ideas on how to deal with safety or security issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Our software tool, Mining for BioBricks (M4B), will be providing in-silico blueprints for new devices that can be built by using DNA constructs in iGEM's 2011 plate distributions. Even though we won't be physically providing the constructs to researchers, we have been brainstorming on how to make Parts Registry safer and secure, which in return can minimize the unintended use of the software we have been developing for efficient use of the parts database.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," genetic test is carried out in E. coli greatly facilitates the screening as well as the characterization of the interacting proteins.  Moreover, it accelerated this assay since E. coli has a much faster growth than S. cerivisiae. Although B2H assays are the easiest and fastest methods to test for interactions nowadays we think that they can be done faster. Using E. coli (which is already faster than using an Y2H system), the assay still needs 24 to 72 hours of incubation. Using V. natriegens, we can accelerate this assay to 8 to 24 hours of incubation.  Paired with one day cloning we can speed up this assay from 7-9 days if your work in E. coli to 3 days if you work in V. natriegens. By this, we create our very own Two-Hybrid Assay: Vibrio Two-Hybrid (V2H).

The Bacterial Two-Hybrid system is based on reconstitution of a signal transduction pathway relying on the adenylate cyclase (CyaA). CyaA is a key regulator in a lot of cells like e.g. E. coli. It catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Figure 2 A)      ( Krupinski, 1991 ).      cAMP binds to the catalytic activator protein (CAP). This interaction effects a conformational change which leads to a higher binding affinity to DNA. The complex binds to the CAP site upstream of the promoter and can interact with the RNA polymerase        ( Kolb et al., 1993 ).      This interaction increases the affinity of the polymerase to the promoter. The positive regulation boosts the expression of the gene by a factor of approximately 50 compared to gene expression without the presence of cAMP (Figure 1). To conclude, the cAMP/CAP complex is a positive regulator of e.g. the mal operon and the lac operon.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#CholeraDetection#Fallexp#Period3#Dailylog_-_-_TEXT.html," Lo Svenningsen. A Quorum-Sensing-Induced Bacteriophage Defense Mechanism. mBio 4(1). 2013) indicated that E.Coli's SOS pathway, which is triggered by H202 and which excites the Lambda prophage to its lytic cycle, is NOT the same pathway by which AHL quorum-sensing lytic induction operates.  We need further testing to characterize what is going on in our SdiA- lysogen.
We have cloned SdiA into the iGEM backbone, performed multiple site-directed mutagenesis, and purified plasmids with (we hope) mutant SdiA from 20 colonies.  We are in the process of testing these mutants.
10/28/13
After many attempts to clone in our parts (YdiV-GFP and FtsQ-GFP) in the the iGEM backbone using the EcoR1 and Pst1 sites and seeing no success we decided to use the Spe1 and Xba1 sites which worked for us before. This proved to be successful. We got only white colonies from our transformation where as before we would have more than a 20:1 ratio of red colonies (incorrect colonies because they still have mCherry in the insertion site) to white colonies. We suggest that the iGEM plasmid needs to go through testing to see what is wrong with the either the EcoR1 or Pst1 site. We are in the process of sequencing these new constructs so that we can have the correct parts for BBa_K1195007 and BBa_K1195008.

N.B. Also, we use a polarimeter to characterize our Curdlan molecule produced.
E. coli CURDLAN PRODUCTION
We produced some Curdlan compared to non transformed strain of DH5α. We analyzed data with a student test to prove our results are significant. The theoretical concentration obtained in the Control condition corresponds to the non significant measure (background signal).
N.B. We realized these figures by doing the average of all production results in each medium.
Figure 5: Quantitative analysis of purified Curdlan with aniline blue
→ Each medium can be used for the Curdlan production. But, we can’t compare these two results and say that produced Curdlan quantity is higher in LB than in M63 medium because productions are not realized at the same time in these cases.
In following results, we have studied production in M63 and LB media started at the same time.
Figure 6: Quantitative analysis of purified Curdlan with aniline blue
→ Now, thanks to a statistic test, we can conclude that Curdlan production is doubled in LB medium compared to M63 medium.
LB medium has an unknown glucose concentration contained in yeast extract whereas in M63 medium we have controled  this parameter. We suppose that LB glucose concentration is higher than in the second medium. That will be explain the difference between these two conditions.
However, compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, our results are very low: about 10 to 20µg/mL for Bacteria to  100µg/mL for Yeast.
We have tried some optimization protocols but without success.
Characterization
Part 1. To verify OsmY promoter is only active in the stationary phase, we realized Curdlan quantitative analysis every hour of a culture in LB medium. The switch of temperature for the culture is linked to the transition in stationary phase.
→ As we can see, Curdlan appears after the switch at 27°C. So, OsmY promoter is active in stationary phase only. (Fig.7)
Figure 7: OsmY promoter characterization
Part 2. To verify produced molecule is Curdlan, we analysed samples with a polarimeter. The reference used was Curdlan bought to do standard range  for the quantitative analysis with aniline blue.
A substance is optically active or has a rotatory power when it deflects polarization plane of light from an α angle. This rotatory power is related to the presence of one or more asymmetric carbon within the molecule. All sugars"

iGEM SUMMER CAMP
Over the summer, we were privileged to have been able to bring in high school students not only into our labs, but our entire working space. These students were either entering Grade 12 or 1st year university and were welcomed into our labs because of their knowledge about the presence of the UofC iGEM team and their interest in our work. The students were here from anywhere from one day to an entire week. The students looked into what iGEM and Synthetic Biology are before coming into the labs, but when they came in, they thought that our team was purely devoted to the wetlab. The students were first able to shadow the lab members while performing experiments and then after some time in the lab, actually got to help out with the project themselves.
Although we explained the wetlab aspect to our project, we also went over the Second Life, Modelling and Outreach initiatives. Our Second Life team helped our visiting students create avatars and explore our island.  They provided useful feedback and thought this tool would be incredibly helpful for being introduced to synthetic biology. Overall, iGEM Summer Camps helped to get the word out about iGEM and to get the students interested in participating. The students are not only interested to see how the UofC iGEM team does at MIT alongside their respective universities.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," immunology of the patient. This is a problem because of the lag phase in antibody response: it takes up to two weeks before a patient’s blood gives detectable levels of Phase I-antibodies. Therefore, these tests can only be used to detect previous Q fever rather than acute Q fever. An alternative test which can be used to detect acute Q fever infection is real-time PCR. During this test, part of Coxiella Burnetti’s genome within the patient’s blood is amplified through PCR. The test is highly specific and very sensitive, but only as long as DNA remains detectable within the patient’s blood. This is a disadvantage since DNA is only detectable for approximately two weeks after the acute infection.
Numerous serological tests have been developed to target Q fever. Whereas a wide range of tests has become available to detect previous Q fever accurately, these tests can only be used to detect previous Q fever. Therefore, these tests are very important to map Q fever epidemics by assessing whether a person should be vaccinated or not. These tests, however, fail to address acute infections of Q fever.
A test which can detect acute infections of Q fever, the real-time PCR test, can provide an early and accurate diagnosis of Q fever. The problem with this test, however, is that it relies on the presence of Coxiella Burnetii’s DNA in the blood of the patient. Since this DNA can only be detected for about two weeks after the patient falls ill, such a real-time PCR test should be conducted shortly after a patient falls ill. This is problematic as Q fever’s clinical polymorphism impedes doctors to rapidly recognize Q fever. Therefore, prevention of Q fever infection is often easier to accomplish than cure.
In 2009 at the peak of the Q fever outbreak, the Dutch government decided to offer risk groups who lived near animal farms vaccines against Q fever. [11] In addition to offering vaccines to risk groups, the Dutch government mandated the culling of pregnant goats at farms which were known to be infected, as pregnant goats presented a major threat to public health. All in all, tens thousands of pregnant goats were killed to stop the Q fever outbreak, even though it was not tested whether the pregnant goats were infected. The decreasing numbers of human cases of Q fever in 2010 might indicate that the measures taken by the Dutch government have been effective at limiting the Q fever epidemic [12] .
In addition to culling of ten thousands of pregnant goats in 2009, the Dutch government imposed numerous regulations on goat farms to limit the outbreak. These measures include a mandatory vaccination of dairy sheep and"

Our iGEM project is the result of seven months of team effort. Every member of our team has different qualities, which lead to division of the tasks. After finishing different subjects everything was discussed plenary, so everybody's point of view was integrated. We decided to do as much as possible with the team and minimally rely help from non-members of the team. The research that we conducted was based on previous findings of the Molecular Microbial Physiology Lab. In the table below the different subject are displayed with the members who were responsible for this and at the bottom of the page are some people we want to thank.
