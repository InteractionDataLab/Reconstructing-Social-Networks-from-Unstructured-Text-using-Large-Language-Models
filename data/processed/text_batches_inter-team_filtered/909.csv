Results
Isolation of Ag43 gene
Samples of E. coli MS427 containing either pBAD (empty vector) or pKKJ143 (Ag43+) were kindly donated by Associate Professor Mark Schembri, of The University of Queensland. [4]
Figure 1 | Plasmid DNA was extracted from cultures, and run on a 1% agarose gel. Bands were observed which corresponded to the expected size of pBAD (4,210bp) and pKKJ143 (7,205bp)
Creation of BBa_I716101 Plasmid Stock, and Restriction Site Checking
Plasmid backbone BBa_I716101 with part BBa_J04450 was obtained from the Spring parts distribution (Plate 1, Well 1C). This plasmid was transformed into E. coli, and red colonies were observed, indicating a positive result. Five clones were cultured further, then plasmid DNA extracted using a miniprep kit.
Figure 2 | DNA of five clones was digested overnight with either XhoI, BamHI, EcoRI or BglII. Only EcoRI appears to have been effective at cutting the plasmid. Lanes 1-5: Clones A->E, EcoRI. Lanes 6-10: Clones A->E, BglII. Lanes 11-15: Clones A->E, XhoI. Lanes 16-19: Clones B->E, BamHI.

Saturday 7th – 8th
It was time to get ready for the SULSA conference next week, where we would be presenting our idea for the first time, and making our first poster. This redefined what we had previously considered a ‘late night’ for iGEM.
Week 3 (9th June – 15th June)
Monday 9th – Tuesday 10th
SULSA! The week kicked off with the two day SULSA conference held here in Edinburgh. This was a really great experience. We got to meet the other three Scottish iGEM teams, Kim de Mora from iGEM HQ, and lots of professionals in the field of Synthetic Biology who presented their work on the second day. We also got to present our idea to the world for the first time.
Wednesday 11th
Today we focused mainly on filling out the kind of overdue safety form, and also started handing out official roles within the group. The wiki was begun today, though nothing was uploaded yet, and we got to see our lab for the very first time.
Thursday 12th
Our first meeting of any real organisation was today, thanks to Chiara. The main outcome of this meeting was the role allocation. Philip is the ‘Trello man,’ Sam and Rikki are responsible for the wiki, Carrie and Charlotte are safety officers, Sam and Charlotte are the tweetsters, Chiara is the secretary, Philip and Elize are in charge of organising collaborations, Yuma is the Google Drive organiser.
We also started looking at organising the scientific aspects of the project. The Biologists broke into three teams to look at finding metabolic wires, creating IPD circuits, and looking at the population control aspect.
Finally, Philip also worked on trying to get funding for the iGEM meetup in Oxford later this month – we may be able to get SULSA funding (is there anything they can’t do?).
Friday 13th
We were given a tour of our lab by Jon today, who wisely advised us not to injure ourselves whilst in the lab. We also continued with experiment plans and started looking into wiki design.
We had two excellent pieces of input from actual professionals today also. First of all, Maryia Trubitsyna came to explain how her now paperclip method of parts assembly works and left us really excellent notes. And secondly, Yuma and Cesar attended an Informatics forum and gave a surprise presentation of the project. The feedback we got from some of the guys over there was to think about using metabolic"
Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," codons will lead to higher expression of proteins is based on the idea that cells have become optimized through evolution to efficiently translate proteins necessary to their survival. Based on this assumption, the most efficient codons will appear more frequently in the overall genome. The fast and slow codon differentiation relies on a very similar analysis. Fast codons are defined as those with a high correlation between frequency and the high TIR regions of the genome, whereas slow codons are those with a high correlation between frequency and the low TIR regions of the genome. This is an extension of the common/rare distinction, but is more specific, as certain parts of the genome with low TIR could possibly code for proteins where high expression (and thus fast translation elongation) is not necessary. By analyzing the codon usage profile of individual regions of the genome with different TIR, it is theorized that the fast and slow codons could be used to artificially control the expression of a particular gene through codon optimization. In some instances, the same codon is used for multiple optimization plans (fast, common, ect) to specify a certain amino acid. Because of this, some genes have instances of similarity, where the same codon is used in the same position.
Result of common/fast optimization is two coding sequences that may be similar, as in some instances a codon may be both common and fast.
The slow insertion time design was based solely on recently designed software which analyzes the biophysical phenomena that underlie translation elongation. Thus, the difference between the slow insertion time GFP and the others is that it is optimized based on the results of biophysical modeling instead of codon usage profile, and thus, on understanding of the physics of translation elongation verses the understanding that evolution optimizes organisms for high efficiency. The overall hypothesis of this research can now be fully understood.
This hypothesis is that the maximum translation rate capacity is due to translation elongation becoming the rate limiting step of protein synthesis, and that it could be controlled by increasing the translation elongation rate, through codon optimization of the CDS. Essentially, the presence of more common or fast codons is hypothesized to raise the maximum translation rate capacity, while the presence of more slow, rare, or slow insertion time codons will lower it.
To test this hypothesis, five variants of the Green Fluorescent Protein gene (GFP), one each of purely fast, slow, rare, and common codons, as well as one with codons having the slowest insertion time, were designed and constructed. The TIR of each variant GFP was then varied by attaching ribosome binding sites"

Collaborations
Nowadays, collaboration between researchers plays a critical role in the process of making important breakthroughs in scientific fields. It is more and more difficult to finish a research project by individual group of researchers. That is why most recent Nobel prizes are shared by 3 different scientists. Similarly, for iGEM projects, the successes of we iGEM teams are also highly rely on the collaboration between different teams, although the level of our projects are far lower than those deserve Nobel prizes.
This year, there are totally 4 iGEM teams, FAFU-CHINA, IngenuityLab_Canada, SCUT-China_A and TMMU_China collaborated with SCU-China, either through one directional help or mutual collaboration between each other. The formats of our collaboration are variable. The details of our collaboration are listed below:
Teams we helped:
1. FAFU-CHINA
In 2016 iGEM competition, iGEM team FAFU-CHINA aimed to use Bt protein family to kill the larva of mosquito, in order to decrease the transition of mosquito borne diseases such as Malaria and Zika. 2A peptide was used to co-express Cry and Cyt toxin (Bt toxin protein family) simultaneously. At the beginning, they cannot express those two proteins, or achieve protein’s function successfully.
After we had a discussion with FAFU-China, we thought it is the 2A peptide residue remained at the end of Cry toxin that affected its function. In order to help them calculate the conservation level of Cry toxin-2A residue protein, our team used Swiss-Model to build a protein model. For Cry4Aa-2A and Cry10Aa-2A, we used homologous model of sequence to predict their functions and activities. Because of the lack of the PDB structure of template Cry11Aa, the homologous model of Cry11Aa-2"

Citrobacter freundii Characterisation:
Lac promoter characterisation
As the lac promoter is often used in synthetic biology, we wanted to test the its activity out in C. freundii by measuring the fluorescence of the RFP gene tied to this promoter. The reason for doing this is because it is not yet known whether our strain of C. freundii has a lacI gene. If the lacI gene is present on the host’s chromosome, we expect the fluorescence to be much lower when the cells are grown in media that contain no IPTG than in the ones that contain IPTG as the promoter will not be on. If there is no lacI gene, or if the C. freundii lacI cannot inhibit the E. coli Lac promoter, we expect the fluorescence in all 3 bottles will fall into a similar range.
Method
Three different sets of E. coli and C. freundii containing the pSB1C3 + Plac-RFP plasmid were grown overnight in LB+chloramphenicol, their OD was measured in order to normalize the number of cells and the normalized dilutions were used to inoculate 2.5ml M9 media that contained chloramphenicol and either no IPTG or 1,"

Start making the resolving gel in a separate flask
The recipe for the resolving/separating gel (10mL, 12%) is as follows:
This will create 10 mL of gel. Around >3.5 mL is needed for each gel.TEMED must be added last and the gel should be casted immediately after its addition.
3.35mL of dH2O (milliQ)
2.5 mL of 1.5 M Tris, pH 6.8
100 uL of 10% SDS
4mL of 30% bis-acrylamide
50 uL of 10% Ammonium persulfate (APS)
5 uL of TEMED
Add gel into the apparatus until it reaches the previously created mark
Remove any air bubbles by adding a layer of isopropanol on top of the gel. Wait until the
resolving gel has polymerized (usually takes 30-45 minutes) and remove the isopropanol by pouring it or by using filter paper.
Start making stacking gel in a separate flask
The recipe for the stacking gel (10mL, 4%) is as follows:
This will create 10 mL of gel. Around 1.2 mL is needed for each gel. TEMED must be added last and the gel should be casted immediately after its addition.
7.3 mL of dH20
1.25 mL of 1.0 M Tris, pH 6.8
100uL of 10% SDS
1.34 mL of 30% bis-acrylamide
50uL of 10% APS
10uL of TEMED
Fill the rest of the apparatus with stacking gel and place the gel comb in. Ensure that there are
no air bubbles. Wait until the gel solidifies (around 30-45 minutes).
Running the SDS-PAGE gel
Take out the gel (with the plates) from the casting apparatus and place it in the gel apparatus.
Make sure that the short plate faces inwards to the apparatus. If only one gel is being run, make
sure to close the other side of the apparatus with a dummy plate.
Once the two plates are secured, insert them into the cassette and lock the apparatus in place.
Insert the cassette into the tank.
Prepare the samples. Add 3uL of 6x sample buffer to 15uL of sample, then boil the samples. This can be done by setting a thermocycler"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," ratio 1:1. The plot shows the successful communication via quorum sensing in the Sensynova device. It is clear that the presence of 1mM C4-HSL is detected by the processor cells which produce the connector 2 (C12-RHL) for the reporter cells to detect. This induction in the reporter cells leads to the expression of sfGFP (Figure 7).
Figure 7: The processor BBa_K2205012 and reporter BBa_K2205015 co-culture test shows increasing fluorescence/time after specific induction with the connecting molecule C12-RHL.
Framework test. The co-culture of the 3 cell types was inoculated at ratio 1:1:1 (detectors:processors:reporters), growth and fluorescence were monitored after induction with IPTG 1mM. The plot shows no significant increasing fluorescence in the induced samples (Figure 8).
Figure 8: Framework ( BBa_K2205009 , BBa_K2205012 , BBa_K2205015 ) test with a co-culture in ratio 1:1:1 in response of IPTG induction.
Results from the multicellular modelling predicted that the traditionally used 1:1:1 ratio is not the optimal combination for the Sensynova device to work. It is in fact suggested to adopt a higher concentration of the reporter culture compare with the detector and processor. Thus, the framework test was repeated incorporating our in silico simulation data and combining the 3 cell types in ratio 1:1:13 (detectors:processors:reporters). The experiment results, shown in the picture below, confirm the modelling data. There is a consistent discrepancy between IPTG induced and non-induced samples in the 1:1:13 co-cultures, in comparison with the 1:1:1 co-cultures which don't show any difference in presence or absence of IPTG (Figure 9).
Figure 9: Framework ( BBa_K2205009 , BBa_K2205012 , BBa_K2205015 )  test with a co-culture in ratio 1:1:13 in response of IPTG induction.
The experimental data validate the model prediction showing that the system worked most optimally when the reporter cells were in excess of both the detector and processor cells. One of the reasons that this configuration was the best may be because of signal amplification at each of the quorum sensing communication stages. The quorum sensing mechanism used here is the acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system in gram negative bacteria."

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," that it is time-consuming. First, you need to clone a plasmid and then horizontal gene transfer from a donor to V. natriegens would be necessary. Additionally, the excision of the plasmid can lead to the pre-insertion genotype.
One of the big advantages of Vibrio species is their ability to take up free DNA from their environment by natural competence (Blokesch et al. 2005) , (Wollenberg et al. 2010) . Using this skill, plasmid independent genomic modification with linear DNA fragments can be performed in V. natriegens as well. To select for clones, which integrated those linear fragments at least one fragment containing an antibiotics resistance cassette is needed (Hayes et al. 2017) .
It would be a big disadvantage to create strains not compatible to some of your plasmids because of the antibiotics resistances incompatibility. The solution is, to design those antibiotics cassettes in a way they can be removed after integration.         It was shown, that genomic modifications using recombinase-based methods like the Cre/Lox system are possible in V. natriegens (Hesek et al. 2016) . A similar method is the FLP/FRT system. FLP is a protein of the integrase family recombinases derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Landy et al. 1986) , (Sadowski 1995) )          . The recombinases of this family are sharing conserved amino acids that are responsible for the mechanisms of strand cleavage and ligation by the integrase members (Chen et al. 1990) , (Pan & Sadowski 1992) .
The FLP recognition target contains an eight bp asymmetric core that is surrounded by two 13-bp symmetric elements (5'GAAGTTCCTATTCtctagaaaGtATAGGAACTTC3'). The recombinase attaches to the top or bottom strand next to the core region, cleaves the DNA and promotes efficient recombination between two FRT recombination sites (Guarascio et al. 1982) .
Figure 1:Four different Flp mediated gene modifications are shown. On the top left side the process of insertion is pictured. On the Bottom left side the process of genomic excision is shown. On the right side at the top of the picture, the inversion is shown and at the bottom the process of translocation. All processes are depending on the orientation of the FRT sites"

PROGRAMMING SILK: CUSTOMIZING ITS PROPERTIES
Spider silk is a remarkable natural material, exhibiting an incredible range of strength and elasticity. Silk-weaving spiders can actually choose from a wide array of silks (such as dragline, capture-spiral, and egg cocoon silk), each having its own unique physical profile and genetic origin. However, one thing that’s common to all silk is that their genes are comprised of highly-repetitive modules. By comparing and the contribution of each type of module to the silk fiber’s physical properties, we can begin to understand how to create a collection of silk modules to build our own gene!
By genetically engineering the repetitive modules, and stringing them together in defined orders and ratios, we can customize the physical properties of the resulting silk fibers. Given the diversity that naturally exists across different types of silk, we can potentially assemble a massive library of silk proteins with an impressive range of strength and elasticity for a variety of applications. We plan on optimizing the compatibility of the iterative capped assembly (ICA) technique for the iGEM competition, creating a standardized method of assembling any highly-repetitive gene fragment in an efficient, user-definable manner. Having a library of silk gene blocks to choose from, and an optimized protocol for assembling them, we can optimize the selection and production of programmable silk with customizable properties.
Our platform for synthesizing silk is a scalable, eco-friendly solution to the needs of booming industries such as medicine and fashion.  Silk is a popular material for tailoring fine garments, and the ability to modify silk to meet any specification would be an extremely useful tool for textile companies. Silk is also of great interest within the medical field since it does not elicit a strong immune response, and is biodegradable.  Consequently, it has been investigated as a material for use in sutures, grafts, and implants.  These surgical procedures require materials with very specific properties, and the ability to easily modify silk would transform the medical field.
Working with silk on the genetic level gives us the freedom to modify the properties of silk fibers.  But why stop there? What if we could functionalize the silk by f"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," are the ethics of synthetic biology?  Perhaps we need to start even further back and really agree on what synthetic biology is, as many, even arguably within the field are still undecided, despite the term being first introduced by Szybalski three and a half decades ago. (Szybalski, 1974 )  While ethics are obviously a matter of personal conviction, to what extent do they feature in the possibilities that may arise from the field?  What ethical considerations do people feel important in considering the future of synthetic biological work?  While not the core of our remit, it is indisputable that our ethics played a role in conceiving and executing a project such as Picoplumber.  In such a cutting edge area of research it is important to gain an understanding of the range of thoughts on synthetic biology in an ethical context;
“Although some form of regulation is needed, state regulation would be of limited use and purpose, as it would be more subject to party politics and party ideologies.  A transnational body could be better placed to ensure maintenance of global standards in a world with evermore multinational industries.  I feel that synthetic biology’s merit will remain context based, work on bacterium or plants in terms of agriculture and relieving famine or poverty will be undoubtedly a good thing, but I don’t believe any eventual cloning of humans would be a good idea, if only due to the overpopulation problem we already face”
Sarah, 29, Immunologist
“I think there are limits on what I would apply Synthetic Biology practises to.  I think extensive modification of mammalian cultures would become a little too ‘Gattaca’ for me.  There are many guidelines already in place, particularly in working with animals that I feel comply well with my own feelings working with them.    Many people are scared of change and unaware of the technicalities involved, but we needn’t dismiss their concerns as merely irrational.  I think the problem has been that a few bad cases have led to people generalizing an entire industry/area of research.  Greater levels of addressing these fears and educating people would be the key, but I feel the media is more negative than positive in this.  Ethics is already a big consideration of any research project currently and an ethics committee rules on a great many studies, particularly those concern with genetic work.  Regulation should be at a national level so the federal taxpayers know that such work is at the consent of the voters”

General conclusion : What about lemon?
To come back to our lemon porject, let's see what is appening when we consider now ""our"" own bacteria and not only a general bacterium species !
In practise, we use the genetically modified E.coli. As the modification that we carried out do not touch to the vital metabolism of bacteria we may assume that the original rates of birth and death for E.coli have not been changed.
So, according to researches of Eric Stewart [Ste ], we have \[ \lambda = 3,6 \times 10^{-2} ~ min^{-1} \] and \[ \mu = 4,6 \times 10^{-4} min"

1.1 Our Problem: We have heavy metals in our environment that can be harmful to the community, but we do not yet know which bodies of water or areas they are in.
1.2 Primary Objective:
1.2.1 Heavy metals, such as arsenic, can be present in seemingly safe water environments. These metals are harmful to people and other organisms when they are exposed to them. Our team's primary objective is to create a device using synthetic biology to detect arsenic in water and give an instant reading to the presence of arsenic. Arsenic is a harmful to organism that use phosphorus in organic molecules because arsenic can replace phosphorus in organic molecules. This can occur because arsenic has similar characteristics as phosphorus.
1.3 Secondary Objective:
1.3.1 Our team's secondary objective is to use our iGEM arsenic biosensor to test different water sources.
1.4 Further Considerations
1.4.1 Ideally, our engineered bacteria would be able to indicate the arsenic levels based on light and odor intensity. When the promoter is activated with the presence of arsenic, RNA polymerase is able to travel down the DNA of the GFP gene or the Wintergreen odor gene. The odor will allow one to immediately detect arsenic, while the creation of Green Flourescent Protein will create light that can be measured quantitatively.

NJU-QIBEBT,2014,Team:NJU-QIBEBT#team#Backgroud_-_-_TEXT.html," the world temperature has changed a lot in these years.
Monthly (thin lines) and 12-month running mean (thick lines or filled colors in case of Nino 3.4 Index) global land-ocean temperature anomaly, global land and sea surface temperature, and El Nino index. All have a base period 1951-1980.(from GISS Surface Temperature Analysis)
Let’s solve the problem!
To meet continuing demand in the face of dwindling petroleum supplies while also curbing the release of greenhouse gases, we have two ways:         1. Emissions cap-and-trade         2. Renewable sources
Renewable sources:
Solar, wind, and biomass lead growth in renewable generation, hydropower remains flat.
In the AEO 2013 Reference case, renewable generation increases from 524 billion kilowatt-hours in 2011 to 858 billion kilowatt-hours in 2040, growing by an average of 1.7 percent per year(Figure 83). Wind, solar, and biomass account for most of the growth. The increase in wind-powered generation from 2011 to2040, at 134 billion kilowatt-hours, or 2.6 percent per year, represents the largest absolute increase in renewable generation. Generation from solar energy grows by 92 billion kilowatt-hours over the same period, representing the highest annual average growth at 9.8 percent per year. Biomass increases by 95 billion kilowatt-hours over the projection period, for an average annual-increase of 4.5 percent.(from Annual Energy Outlook 2013)
What we focus on is biomass!
Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-based materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods.(from Wikipedia)
Cellulosic or lignocellulosic biofuels：
The utilization of plant structural polymer. It has two routes.
Route1: Obtain some versatile intermediate such as 5- hydroxymethylfurfural and γ-valerolactone by a variety of chemical and biological process technologies
Route2: Following various pre-processing and pre-treatment steps, it utilizes enzyme cocktails to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose polymers into sugar monomers or oligomers"

Overview
Humans' reform on nature has always been one part of its construction. Human practice is not only a question of making synthetic biology known to the world; it’s a human right for every person to know what is really going on. As iGEMers, we have the duty to make iGEM known and eliminate misunderstandings about the subject. As the only iGEM team in Shandong Province, OUC-China always puts great emphasis on making iGEM known to more people.

The two valves were then closed (trapping the cells and culture media inside) and the chip removed from the control infrastructure. From there, we observed masses of cells moving in the sealed area of the chip under a standard light microscope at 10x, as shown. Finally, we relocated the chip an incubator to grow the cells. Unfortunately, the device dried out a day after being placed in the incubator. This visit proved our fabrication flow's ability to create microfluidic devices capable of trapping HEK293 mammalian cells, and gave both teams great insight on the other end of the biologist-microfluidics bridge, and sparked ideas for further customization of microfluidics for the lab bench. Highlighting the rapid design and prototyping enabled with Neptune, not a week later we returned with an entirely new design and batch of two chips ready for further testing (while our design and fabrication flow allows for iterations to occur within hours, the schedule of both teams needed about a week). This further collaboration is detailed below.

PART 2
For our second on-site visit to MIT, we redesigned our chip to better observe the HEK293 cells under the microscope. Namely, this iteration replaced the cell traps and valves with a diamond chamber and an equivalently shaped window through the polycarbonate for facilitated microscopy on the otherwise empty control (red) layer. The valves were removed with the hopes of running fluid through the device while it was under the microscope, and not detaching it from its pumping infrastructure like in the previous iteration. The fluids pumped through the device were similar to the first iteration, starting with ethanol solution, then PBS, suspended cells mixed with culture media, and finally culture media alone. Evaporation, which occurred in the previous chip in the incubator, was assumed to not be in effect in the closed system of the microscope. To allow the cells time to adhere to the PDMS, the flow of culture media was disrupted; unfortunately the flow was disrupted for too long, and the fluid again evaporated out of the chip, likely through the viewing window due to the microscope not being an ideal closed system. This second visit gave timelapse evidence that the HEK293 cells were surviving and beginning to multiply in"

Experimental Approach
Based on the previously mentioned informations, we built a strong experimental approach that would allow us to create not only leaky mutants but regulable leaky mutants. We first generated porin mutant libraries and then we used a selection method to select the mutants of interest.
Mutant library construction
Mutagenesis tools are a very efficient mean to generate mutant proteins with new or optimized properties and functions. Not only these methods can help you probe through a construct for structurally or functionally essential residues and thereby help the understanding of proteins but it also is a powerful engineering tool. Through a proper experimental design it can generate mutant proteins with improved, optimized or novel properties and allow any ambitious synthetic biologists to mess around with protein engineering.
In our particular case, we wanted to show the rapid emergence of a new function coupled with a regulatory system through a strong but simple experimental design. And for that our lab had the perfect tool to bring to iGEM. Researcher from the Institute of Life Sciences at UCLouvain have recently developed a new method to build plasmid libraries by seamless cloning of degenerated oligonucleotides, called QuickLib (Galka et al., submitted).
As you can see in figure 1, the QuickLib method is a simple combination of the use of degenerated oligonucleotides to induce randomized mutation through PCR and the Gibson assembly method (Galka et al, sumbitted). We first generate linear fragment with a targeted randomized region and overlapping ends through PCR. Than those linear fragments are circularized back to a plasmid form thanks to the hybridization of the overlapping region and the combined action of the exonuclease, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase as described by Gibson et al. (2009).
We strongly believed that this new tool can find great purpose in synthetic biology as it allows to quickly and easily create synthetic plasmid libraries with high diversity. By including smart use of random mutagenesis and this tool in our experimental design we believed we could outmatch rational design throughput.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#HEARTBEAT database_-_-_TEXT.html," able to predict the functional outcome of the created sequence and it can be used to improve the input sequence, both based on fuzzy logic modeling ( HEARTBEAT fuzzy network (FN) ). For the development of the model understanding of the functionality and composition of a promoter was essential: it consists of a core-promoter comprising one or more subparts which can work as the binding site for the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase, TATA-box and the Inr-element. Transcription factors regulating the transcriptional activity interact preferentially with the proximal promoter [2] . The intensity of the regulation is further defined by the position of the transcription factor binding site (TFBS) relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS), the binding affinity of the TF to a particular binding motive and also by synergistic effects evolving from interactions between the simultaneously binding of multiple Tfs. [3] , [4] In addition the spacer sequences are directly influencing  the promoter strength [5] .
Based on these assumptions the optimal synthetic promoter sequence can be designed using the following parameters (Fig. 1):
all TFBS selected to be in the sequence
auxiliary TFBS, which are supposed to have a synergistic effect
optimal distance of all TFBS to the TSS
maximal spacer sequence quality between the TFBS
optimal distance between TFBSs
In the following articles we propose a standardized strategy to specify these parameters with computerized methods based on HEARTBEAT (Heidelberg Artificial Transcription Factor Binding Site Engineering and Assembly Tool). We will further explain the manual design of promoter sequences using these parameters  for SREBP and VDR . Initital measurements show the potential of HEARTBEAT-designed sequences to function in vivo (see results ). On the basis of our observations, we claim that our way of combining rational generation and experimental validation of synthetic constructs provides a novel and effective strategy in synthetic biology.

Methods
Our promoter sequence was defined to be 1000 bp upstream of the TSS. The UCSC Genome Browser [6] provides reference sequence and working draft assemblies for a large collection of genomes including the human genome. We derived the provided sequences containing the 1000 bases upstream of annotated TSS for each RefSeq gene [7] . Upon this pre-selection, we further narrowed our choice of promoter set by selection of distinct pathways. KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) [8] , [9] , [10] provides a database"

After showing stability of TnrA-pAlst sytem by using the RFP fluorescence protein, Toehold-TEV protease will be replaced with RFP for binding to AND gate system.
QS dependent promoter pLsr
There are two promoters on LsrR’s operon Lsr . these promoters are called LsrA and LsrR, and they are repressed in the absence of AI-2. The location LsrR binds on these promoters(p-lsr-Box)  are shown below. Dark ones indicate the common sequences in both promoters. We preferred to use lsR promoter as it is one of ATOMS Team’s parts in 2013.
FIGURE 5:LsrR-binding site recognition and regulatory characteristics in Escherichia Coli AI-2 quorum sensing (Ting Xue, Liping Zhao, Haipeng Sun, Xianxuan Zhou and Baolin Sun).
We aimed to show repression of LsrR protein on pLsr promoter and dereppession of it in the presence of AI-2. For this purpose, we gathered LsrR protein gene sequence and pLsr sequence on the same biobrick. We put RFP as a reporter in front of pLsr promoter. To produce th repressor protein Lsr in a high amount, we put LsrR-pLsr-RFP gene sequence in front of J23100 constutive promoter .  We added RFC prefix on 3’end , RFC suffix on 5’ end of  LsrR-pLsr-RFP gene sequence.
LsrABCD operon, which makes AI-2 getting into the cell, already present in E.coli; so it is expected to be enough when an AI-2 sensing promoter system placed into E. coli. Thereby under the absence of AI-2, Lsr promoter will be heavily repressed by LsrR protein. If Quorum Sensing molecule sensed successfully AI-2 will be phosphorylated and LsrR’s suppression on pLsr will disappear. Thus RFP expression will occur.
We chose to use the part J23100-LsrR-pLsR-RFP(BBa_K1202108) as 2013 ATOMS IGEM TEAM designed. After showing LsrR-pLsrR system’s stability by using RFP, Trigger RNA will be replaced with RFP to connect the inputs"

Competition
In this day and age the amount of data generated is as important as having good algorithms that employ it. While our competitors might use the best screening assays now available, our invention will allow to move from thousands of mutants in a day to millions of mutants in an hour. A change of this scale matters - large amount of data will allow our AI to evolve into new horizons, including the swift generation of novel enzymatic reactions and multiple enzyme metabolic route optimization.
Risks
The greatest risk we face is a technical one. As our company will be built around cutting edge technology and innovation, every research and development milestone we may miss might be crucial. That said, we have a clear strategy on how we will mitigate this risk in a consistent way – goal oriented development. By focusing on the end goal rather then specific paths leading to it, we can be more flexible on how we will reach it. That means that we can make sure we reach milestones in time by changing the particular approach along the way, and also having multiple parallel approaches to each objective.
Marketing
We believe that presenting our system in the iGEM competition and delivering it to scientists all over the world as an open-source system will help us to make a first strong step and impression. Later, our plan is to build a company network by participating in startup competitions, trade shows and conferences such as JP Morgan or BIO international, which may be an excellent environment to meet potential business partners and customers.
Furthermore, we are planning to prepare educational videos for students, open-source computational tools for scientist and blog articles for general public on various life science topics.
SWOT analysis
1. Strengths
We use and have patented a state of the art system CAT-Seq which allows to precisely screen billions of catalytic biomolecule variants and record their sequence to activity relationship. It is a completely new speed scale of data acquisition.
Together with CAT-Seq system we are utilizing what we believe are the next generation neural networks - Generative Adversarial Networks. Yet, to be accurate they require an enormous amount of sequence to activity data for each sequence, which only the CAT-Seq can provide.
Strong team consisting of people with years of experience in the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology.
2. Weaknesses
Not as experienced in business development and management as competitors might be.

His3 Protein
This essential gene has been knocked out in the strain, meaning that the only way the yeast can survive is if the mating factor response pathway has been activated.
A common auxotrophic marker in yeast is a deletion of the HIS3 gene, which is responsible for the production of the His3 protein (Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase).  Due to the deletion, strains are unable to grow on media lacking a histadine supplement unless they have a way to express the gene or an analog.  By placing the gene in a construct with the appropriate promoter, a group can select for a particular transformed strain by placing it on selective media lacking histadine.  In CUPID, this protein has been linked to the FUS1 promoter, allowing for the selection of yeast being stimulated by mating pheromone. Saccharomyces Genome Database. (1999). Sequence for a region of HIS3/YOR202W. Retrieved from: http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/getSeq?query=YOR202W&seqtype=Coding%20sequence%20(CDS)&format=fasta
Constitutive Yeast Promoter
Promoters can respond to a number of different stimuli, and a number are constantly activated in a cell.  Transcriptional elongation factor is expressed in yeast constitutively and is responsible for the elongation of the RNA transcript.  Since the gene is constitutively expressed, its promoter can be used to constitutively express a gene of interest in yeast. Mumberg D, Müller R, Funk M (1995) Yeast vectors for the controlled expression of heterologous proteins in different genetic backgrounds. Gene 156 (1), 119-122
Lactate Dehydrogenase
It has been observed that yeast expressing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be used to produce lactate in the media they are growing in.  A number of other organisms have promoters that are sensitive to the presence of lactate in growth media.  By having the yeast produce lactate, it could activate a promoter in an organism growing in the same media, thereby having genes only expressed when in the presence of yeast with this gene. Branduardi P, Sauer M, De Gioia L, Zampella G, Valli M, et. al (2006) Lactate production yield from engineered yeasts is dependent on the host background, the lactate dehydrogenase source"

Tryptic digest of gel lanes for analysis with MALDI-TOF
Note:
Make sure to work under a fume hood.
Do not work with protective gloves to prevent contamination of your sample with plasticizers.
Reaction tubes have to be cleaned with 60 % (v/v) CH3CN and 0.1 % (v/v) TFA. Afterwards the solution has to be removed completely followed by evaporation of the tubes under a fume hood. Alternatively microtiter plates from Greiner® (REF 650161) can be used without washing.
Cut out the protein lanes of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using a clean scalpel. Gel parts are transferred to the washed reaction tubes/microtiter plate. If necessary cut the parts to smaller slices.
Gel slices should be washed two times. Therefore add 200 µL 30 % (v/v) acetonitrile in 0,1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate each time and shake lightly for 10 minutes. Remove supernatant and discard to special waste.
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
Rehydrate gel slices in 15 µL Trypsin-solution followed by short centrifugation.
Gel slices have to be incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by incubation at 37 °C over night.
Dry gel slices at least 30 minutes in a Speedvac.
According to the size of the gel slice, add 5 - 20 µL 50 % (v/v) ACN / 0,1 % (v/v) TFA.
Samples can be used for MALDI measurement or stored at -20 °C.
Trypsin-solution: 1 µL Trypsin + 14 µL 10 mM NH4HCO3
Therefore solubilize lyophilized Trypsin in 200 µL of provided buffer and incubate for 15 minutes at 30 °C for activation. For further use it can be stored at -20 °C.

Jiawei Chen,
The 13-19-15 gene sequence is in the appendix.
This lysis gene is bond with a regulatory promoter by overlap PCR and then cloned to pUTat plasmid.
Plasmid pUTat is based on plasmid pUC18, modified according to the requirement of my lab. First, we cut off lac regulatory sequence and multiple cloning site (MCS) in pUC18 using Ndel and pvull, eliminate its influence on the expression of downstream inserted fragment. Second, we insert MCS and a transcription terminator rmBT0T1 from plasmid pBR322, which is an intrinsic terminator, so that we can effectively stop the transcription of upstream gene and promote its transcription efficacy. At the same time, we change plasmid replicator into a low-copy replicator. The modified plasmid is called pUTat.
What you need to do is to design primers according to the 13-19-15 gene sequence, amplify the target gene by PCR and make it cloned into your plasmid vector in your experiment.
Professor Liu
Dear teacher, It’s glad to get your help. Actually, we are participating in IGEM competition, held by MIT. This year our team’s instructor is Professor Yuan, who is in great favor of our plan. But our biggest problem is there’s not much time left for us. The summer vacation is almost over during which we pay a lot of attention to experiments. But the period of cultivation of Synechocystis is very long. And we hope we can make a meticulous plan and build a perfect model as soon as possible. So I want to know when the administrator of strain bank will work. And could you give us your contact information if possible? We’d like to get the plasmid profile and design primers soon. Thanks a lot for your help. Jiawei Chen

Collaboration with TAS Taipei iGEM team
We gave them the part with yebF, a motor protein that brings our product out of the cell. This was essential to their project because it allowed their protein, the granzyme B inhibitor, to be delivered out into the reservoir and to diffuse through the bandage.
Furthermore, NYMU hosted an educational summer camp welcoming members from the 2015 and 2016 TAS_Taipei iGEM teams to join and learn.
We have also been supportive for helping TAS_Taipei iGEM team with research and running the model for diffusion, bandage, and the ACT inhibition model.  We provided them with modeling expertise, literature values for our models and debugging expertise.
In addition to our help on TAS, we also collaborated with TAS
To provide us with the LuxR part which is pivotal for our oscillator. LuxR is essential for our oscillator which is used to report the presence of a malicious spore in the device part of the project.
TAS also helped us by running the initial experiments for our microbial fuel cell prototype. We were provided by TAS_Taipei with initial test results of the prototype for our project so that we found the correct soil to water to bacteria ratios(August 2015).
Three members of TAS (Alvin, Fiona and Huiru) are members of both NYMU and TAS teams. They worked at NYMU over the summer for the NYMU_Taipei team and are presenting with the team at the Giant Jamboree!

Discovery festival
As a national effort, all Dutch iGEM teams cooperated on participating in the Discovery Festival. This is a festival that is held simultaneously in three cities, and is a meeting point for art, science and music. As part of Discovery’s science program, we will educate people about synthetic biology and even let them experience some of it themselves. The Delft team dropped out at the last moment, but all four other teams made an extra effort to fill the gap and hopefully still make this event into a great success! The festival will be held on the 28th of September and the Wageningen team will go to the festival location in Rotterdam to educate the visitors there.
To do actual science here, our team contacted a student of Applied Communication Science. For her Msc thesis, she is investigating how scientists communicate about their project with laymen. She will observe us on the Discovery Festival and so, there will be science within our science.

The Sensitivity Tuner
Introduction Characterisation Data Discussion
Introduction
The Cambridge 2007 iGEM team build 15 ""amplifiers,"" constructs with RFP and GFP reporters that amplified the PoPS output of the promoter pBad/AraC (), as described below:
We re-designed these constructs to be PoPS converters as follows...
...and generated our own set of Sensitivity Tuners:
P2 ogr activator
PSP3 pag activator
phiR73 delta activator
PF promoter
PO promoter
PP promoter
Psid promoter
PLL promoter
In order to characterize these phage activator/promoter constructs, we used the corresponding Cambridge 2007 amplifier as an illustration of how our Sensitivity Tuners alter the behaviour of pBad/AraC.  These parts are very useful for characterisation as they contain fluorescent reporters; the parts we designed, which lack an input promoter and fluorescent reporters, are more useful parts for other iGEM teams to incorporate into their own projects.
Characterisation
For characterisation, we moved the Cambridge 2007 amplifiers onto a low copy plasmid in order to make meaningful comparisons with , the standard promoter. We looked at a few major characteristics relating input (arabinose) to output (GFP) and how they are modified compared to pBad/AraC on its own.
For our characterisation assay, we transformed the E. coli strain BW27783 with the Cambridge 2007 amplifiers (biobricks summarised in the table below):
P2 ogr activator
PSP3 pag activator
phiR73 delta activator
PF promoter
PO promoter
PP promoter
Psid promoter
PLL promoter
The BW27783 strain is ideal for assays using arabinose as it expresses arabinose transporters in the membrane constitutively (rather than in"

Fluorescein Standard Curve
The third measurement of the Protocol was fluorescein standard curve. Because the fluorescein that was supplied by iGEM was                  sensitive to light, we used a black 96 well plate with clear flat bottom. We have payed extreme attention to the sensitivity                  of the fluorescein while constructing the experiment. Thus, we conducted it with minimum light exposure as possible. At first,                  we prepared a fluorescein stock solution with 1x PBS and 10x fluorescein. Then, we began the serial dilutions of fluorescein                  in 96 well plate to measure fluorescein in the plate reader with the settings suggested by iGEM.
CELL Measurement Protocol
After we were finished with all the calibration protocols, we moved on to the Cell Measurement protocol. The calibration                  protocols made us feel certain about the measurement of both fluorescence and OD600. Hence, we immediately began to perform                  our experiments as suggested in iGEM Interlab Plate Reader Protocol. On our first day, we transformed the given plasmids into                  our competent E. coli DH5-α with the help of iGEM Transformation protocol. Therefore, our bacteria were grown perfectly so                  we were able to pick two colonies from each of the transformation plates. We especially payed attention to select the colonies                  which were away from the others. Then, we inoculated our single colonies in LB medium and Chloramphenicol. Our cells were grown                  overnight (16-18h) at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rounds per minute in LB medium and Chloramphenicol. The blur in the broth was                  the assurance that the plasmids were successfully transformed.
The last day was a little confusing and hard but we were able to construct the experiment according to the given protocol.                  At first, we made a 1:10 dilution of our overnight cultures in LB+Chloramphenicol. Then measured the OD600 values of the diluted                  cultures. Thanks to the results, we were able to set the OD600 values to 0.02 in a final volume of 12 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol                  by diluting further in 50 ml falcon tube. In order to be sure that our last diluted colonies had an OD600 of 0.02, we measured them                  and observed that the dilution worked properly. The next step was taking 500 μL samples of the each diluted cultures at 0 hours and                  6 hours"

Edinburgh,2009,Team:Edinburgh#ethics(publicperception)_-_-_TEXT.html," and societal standpoints. The unnatural processes involved, the biological and environmental safety of engineered microorganisms, malicious intent—these are all hot issues surrounding this sphere of research and it is up to us, the synthetic biologists, to address these issues and perhaps to attempt to raise public awareness of what we get up to in the labs and the effects of our scientific endeavours.  Our team designed a questionnaire targeted primarily at friends and family, to see where synthetic biology stands among the circles we mingle in. Furthermore, we believe that much of the negative perception of synthetic biology stems from lack of knowledge about it—for this reason we saw it as our duty to make small, yet significant changes through explaining our work to others either personally, or through our university wiki.
Finally, our team helped to trial and evaluate DEMOCS (deliberative meeting of citizens)—a game designed for the purposes of engaging people in the dialogue of public policy issues, in particular issues of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. DEMOCS is a game which is intended to raise awareness about these issues, in particular among school children, and it presents matters such as commercial interest, ownership and safety of biological activities. Our team designed a small sample of virtual version of DEMOCS and provided ideas for further development, available here , which you can play to see how up-to-date you are in the debates on synthetic biology! Our team is proud to have been able to witness, and even play a small role in ethical history in the making.
Below is the survey our team presented to the public, which was made available online here .
Survey
Our team gathered 100 responses from people of different professional backgrounds and belief systems. First of all, a little about our population samples:
43% of survey takers had a scientific background
37% of survey takers had a humanitarian background
95% had proceeded to, or completed, an undergraduate degree
50% were Christian, 26% atheist and 4% agnostic
Although the sample we have targeted is not strictly representative of the world’s population and with the results we obtained we were able to find out the following (all images are clickable for better resolutions):
Trivia: 75% of people with a humanitarian background answered that they knew about synthetic biology but had not heard the term before
20% of Christians had not heard of synthetic biology
It was encouraging to find out that the great majority of survey takers had heard of synthetic biology; nonetheless, the fact that 21% were unaware of this technology indicates that more efforts need to be made to introduce and explain it to the general public. Our team"

Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio
: Establishing Vibrio natriegens as the new chassis organism for synthetic biology
Abtract
Waiting for cells to grow is an enormous time sink for synthetic biologists. Cloning cycles with the current standard, Escherichia coli, typically take up to three days. In our project Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio, we established the tools to turn Vibrio natriegens into the next generation chassis for synthetic biology, ready to be used reliably. By taking advantage of its unbeaten doubling time of 7 minutes, we substantially reduced waiting time and made one-day-cloning a reality. We built and characterized a flexible golden-gate-based part collection, consisting of more than 100 parts, which enables the creation of complex pathways in a short amount of time. Our engineered V. natriegens strains VibriClone and VibriExpress are designed for cloning and protein expression applications, respectively. Moreover, we established the first synthetic metabolic pathway in this organism by producing the platform chemical 3-Hydroxypropionate and along the way developed an accelerated workflow for metabolic engineering..

As a part of their Human Practices project, they aim to make the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. The iGEM Marburg team sent us a message to participate in the design of an accessible wiki to everyone. Through several emails, we helped each other to write the guide “Accessible webdesign”. We tried to write the guide with easy words and bring examples so that beginners can easily apprehend this wiki concept. The long-term goal is for all iGEM teams to design their wiki without difficulties. We also helped each other improve various parts of our respective wikis. They made a logo to indicate that our wiki is accessible and we put it in the footer of our wiki.

Those parts of the metabolic pathway that have been cloned into our E.coli have been incorporated into our model. For this we assume the intracellular [Chorismate]cell concentrations to be constant.
Furthermore, PABA overexpression can be achieved without upregulating pabC (aminodeoxychorismate lyase). Hence, this step is not rate-determining in PABA formation. Thus pabC has kinetics on a smaller timescale than PabAB such that 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) concentrations are never high - justifying another quasi-stationary-assumption.
This leads to a production term of PABA depending on the produced PabAB concentration and the assumed intracellular [Chorismate]cell concentrations and a first-order outflux term with kout.
Lastly, PabAB is constitutively degraded with kdeg.
We are interested in the effect of PABA on the dissociation of UVR8. As PABA can be regarded as a competitor for UVB in the cell, we model this negative feedback loop with a hill-like term in the dissociation step.
ODEs
With the aforementioned assumptions, the coupled systems boil down to:
Fig. 1: ODEs for the no-inhibition model.
Fig. 2: ODEs for the inhibition model. Notice the hill-like inhibition term highlighted in red.
The parameter khv and kdecay have been determined from gel assays with approximative half-lives. The promoter strength has been optimised such that we get the required enzyme concentrations. Degradation rates have been assumed from a mean half-life of 5 hours. The enzyme kinetical parameters can be found in the literature [Roux1992]. Lastly, the outflux term kout has been selected such that PABA steady-state values are comparatively large - this would involve certain metabolic optimisations in-vivo. n in the hill kinetic term with [PABA] accounts for a more or less sigmoidal behaviour of PABA inhibition.
Find the parameters we used on our parameter page .
Results
Simulations have first been run for 4 hours in the dark (""inside condition""), with another 4 hours under sunny conditions. Notice the time span between first sun exposure and half-maximum of PABA production, the second sigmoidal step: This time is around 1 hour, a satisfactory time scale for the production of protective PABA for the average european caucasian after sun exposure.
Considerations

Collaboration
We collaborated with several teams from around the world, including University of Minnesota and University of Montpellier, France. Check out our Collaborations page to learn more! We also collaborated with a team outside of iGEM called ITESG. Check out our work with them on our Partnership page.
Human Practices (Silver)
We contacted family members, friends, and representatives of the World Health Organization to discuss current issues with birth control. We sent out questionnaires to several grassroot organizations and advocacy groups around the world to gauge their interest in our product and learn about stigma, cost, and access issues. We also presented to local classes to teach them about iGEM and discuss potential ethical issues with our project. For more information, check out our Human Practices page !
Modeling
Check out our modeling team's work on our Modeling page.
Integrated Human Practices
We took what we learned from our questionnaire and other outreach efforts to create a product tailored to our potential users. The women who returned questionnaires encouraged us to consider cost, location, and accessibility. We localized contraceptive production because we were informed that drugstores and hospitals are far away for women in rural areas. We will use discreet packaging for our product because women are worried about being seen using birth control in stigmatized areas. We are also researching ways to get our product to market in several countries by collaborating with Family Planning 2020.

To further validate our design, we also performed the simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to confirm that the field in microfluidic channel satisfies our expectation. FEM is a method for modeling and simulating physics-based problems. It divides a large problem into smaller elements, these smaller elements will be solved separately and then be assembled backed to the original model. A collection of smaller elements is called a “mesh”, the “mesh” is constructed by numerous elements, the smaller the size of the element is, the finer the “mesh” is, and the more accurate will the result be. The final geometry set up can be seen from below (Fig. 8).

Under different pumped inflow rate(5μL/min, 15μL/min and 45μL/min), the velocity magnitude distribution was calculated. The result of maximum velocity and shear force applied on the bottom wall matched with the mathematics perfectly(around 80: 10: 1 in all the conditions, shown in the table below).

Results of mathematical demonstration (1: 9: 81), calibration (13: 100: 978) and simulation (1: 10: 80) are consistent with each other. This shows that the model is feasible for estimating the shear force that generated by microfluidics on cell membrane. In order to obtain the exact shear force, we inputted the experimentally used flow rate as a boundary condition (6.25μL/min,50μL/min) in our model. The shear stress was also calculated.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-E#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  After that, we measure the performance of our sweet pressure part strain 3-4 in a tryptophan addition fashion. The colony from LB agar plate was picked up and cultured in M9 medium with 8g/L glucose for overnight. On the next day, seed medium was transferred to fresh M9 medium in 24 well plate with 2, 4, 6 and 8g/L maltose as single carbon source, respectively. Initial OD600 was set as 0.16. when OD600 of the medium reached 0.6, 0, 0.5 and 1g/L L-arabinose, 0 and 1mM was added as induction. The growth curve was measured and shown in the figure below.
It could be found that for conditions of 4 or 6g/L maltose in M9 medium, when inducer arabinose was added as 1g/L, strains induced by 1mM tryptophan obtained much better growth after 12h than the corresponding negative control without tryptophan addition. In other conditions, this trend was not so significant, which inferred that the condition for our sweet pressure part to work must be finely tuned. What is more, we have proved that in the in vitro tryptophan induction measurement for tetA pathway that tryptophan addition greatly inhibited growth of cells. Therefore, the trend of better growth induced by tryptophan addition was very strong proof to the successful construction of our sweet pressure part. It worked in this particular condition.
Week9(8.22-8.29)
To overcome the inhibition and kinetics problem during the test for our pressure system, we turned to in vivo system in this week. Fortunately, our lab has constructed before some engineered E.coli BL21(DE3) with different tryptophan productivity in fermentation (unpublished data). They were achieved by the combination deletion of several important regulation genes or branch pathway, also the overexpression of engineered tryptophan pathway (also induced by IPTG). After 48h fermentation in 24 well plate with each fermentation volumn as 1.5mL, three strains with the overall productivity as 0, 0.07, 0.15g/L were named after trp000, trp007, trp015, respectively. Thus, we transformed our bitter pressure part 30, 32 and ori into them by chemical transformation, respectively. Hence, engineered strains trp000-30, trp000-32, trp000-ori, trp"

Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed DhaA+P2A+HheC and DhaA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5mM TCP respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The concentration of the products were confirmed using GC column(AC5). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass, 2,3-DCP,  epichlorohydrin, chloropropanol, and glycerol. The result was screened by GC analysis. Above the degradation of TCP and the intermediate product 2,3-DCP indicated that multistep biodegradation was happened. (Fig.1 and Fig.2). When the E.coli carried DhaA+P2A+HheC gene cultivated in medium with 2,3-DCP, the concentration of epichlorohydrin have been detected(Fig.2). 2,3-DCP was degraded to epichlorohydrin. Chloropropanol and glycerol couldn’t be detected by our columns. Since the two active enzymes were in bacteria, if the degradation followed the theoretic pathway (refer to project), TCP would be degraded to glycerol in the end.  In the future, new columns and methods will be used to further proof the result.
Fig.1. E.coli strain MC1061 carried DhaA+P2A+HheC gene incubated in LB medium with TCP(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration of TCP and its mediate product 2,3-DCP were measured by GC. 2,3-DCP was degraded at the same time.

Luna Eresta Jaya
The Teacher. Luna is a great teacher and leader. She’s very organized and quite perfectionist in her work. She is clear about what to do in the next step and focus on how to modify experiments in order to get a more reliable and persuasive result. Every day in the lab becomes smoother and easier because of the Workflow Plan that she initiated for our group. She’s also very good in delegating work for other people while considering their strengths and weaknesses. Besides, she’s secretly a quite sensitive and careless person, but she’s very professional when it comes to work. She also loves to tell jokes (although some of them are not funny) and take good photo of our team so that we can leave behind wonderful memories.

Mike Dorothea
She is a very well organised people and very responsible. She always asks us for the content we need to present before the general meeting and then send the email. It is lucky for us to have her to be our secretary. Also, she is good at using photoshop and other software and is willing to teach us to use it. It helps a lot when we need to design a team logo and t-shirt. And she loves singing, she always sing when she is waiting for the PCR or gel.

Olivia Winata
The Gel Loader. Olivia, or usually called OW, is super helpful and responsible in everything. She is very good in handling any work in the busiest days in the lab, she’s also known as the gel loader due to her talent in it. Her hobby in the lab is filling pipette tips box, while singing. Basically she sings every time there’s any waiting time in doing lab work, even during heat shock or cold shock. Funny thing about her is her panic response. Whenever she suddenly finds out something wrong, she will say “eh.. eh..” with a slightly louder voice.

Safety
Safety is absolutely paramount in the scientific research area.   In conducting scientific experiments, researchers should   always comply to the safety measurements outlined in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, c.37 [1], not only to protect themselves, but also the members of the public and environment from any potential harm.
Scroll to check out the safety measurements we took!
Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
Hazard statements: H302, H330, H341
Risks: Harmful if swallowed and inhaled, highly mutagenic and may be carcinogenic [3].
EtBr is commonly used in laboratories to identify the band sizes of DNA samples under ultraviolet light after being loaded onto agarose gels.
Usage of EtBr has been reduced in our lab by using SYBR Safe as a substitute to minimize the risks as stated above.
SYBR Safe
Hazard statements: H227
Risks: Flammable, may cause mild eye and skin irritation
Similar to EtBr, SYBR Safe enables the visualization of nucleic acid bands using agarose gels.  In comparison, SYBR Safe has been identified to be 4 to 5 times less mutagenic than EtBr [4].  Thus, we substituted EtBr with SYBR Safe for most of our nucleic acid staining procedures.

ABTS
(2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid))
Hazards statements: H315, H319, H335
Risks: May cause skin, eye and respiratory irritation.
ABTS is widely used to detect the binding activity of molecules in presence of a peroxidase enzyme (eg: HRP).
The possibility of causing skin irritation when in direct contact with ABTS indicates that ABTS may not be the best candidate for our actual AlcoPatch.  For future experiments, ABTS should be substituted with other safer redox indicators.

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#Project#Communication#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," our light sensing cell is shown on the right of each group. And the graph below the photos shows the light intensity (blue graph) and the GFP level (green graph) as a function of time.

Movie 2. The time course of the whole system  (Newly inoculated light sensing cells culture was immersed into the light emitting cells when the latter began to glow. Every 20 minutes, 0.5ml light sensing cells culture were taken out from our device and harvested in the bottom of an EP tube. Then GFP expression was observed under blue light excitation.)
As shown in the video, 9 hours later the cells in the flask began to glow, and light sensing cells were then inoculated in the device. 7 hours after that, clear cell pellets could be observed at the bottom of EP tubes (red circle), indicating that the light sensing cell reached a high quantity.
The experiment group (left) with a luminescence pulse lasting 8 hours from light emitting cell, as expected, didn’t express GFP, while the control group (right) in the same device with nonluminous cell, began to express GFP 8 hours after inoculation.
3. Response threshold and regulation through light intensity
As described before, the response threshold value of our Luminesensor was not found simply using blue LED and attenuating filters, because the Luminesensor is so sensitive to dim light, which cannot be detected by the photometer we used. It is difficult to control the intensity of very dim light simply using attenuating filters, so we managed to find the threshold and therefore regulate the response intensity using bio-luminescence as light source based on our light-communication system.
Light emitting cell broth was diluted to create different light intensity, represented by the dilution ratio. (e.g. 0.001 indicates the weakest light intensity) With this method we managed to get closer to the linear area of our sensor’s response. We succeeded in regulating the gene expression level by changing the light intensity.
The photo below shows the GFP level to the dilution ratio of light emitting cell
Figure 4. Serial dilution of light emitting cell gradually inhibited the expression of GFP in receiver cells.
Here are quantitative data of effects of serial dilution of light emitting cell on the expression of GFP in receiver cells

Nanjing-China,2017,Team:Nanjing-China#Model#h2s_-_-_TEXT.html,". Translation involves 3  main stages: initiation, elongation of the polypeptide, and termination. The  key molecular machinery driving this process are ribosomes, who's binding and  movements determine the overall rate of transcription.
Translation rate can be affected by 3 major processes:
a) the binding of the ribosome to the RBS,
b) formation of initiation complexes,
c) speed of the  ribosome across the mRNA transcript.
we will assume that the movement of the  ribosome (in amino acids formed per second) is the rate determining step in the  translation of the proteins, and the average  translation rate of 17.1 amino acids/sec.[4]

Degradation and Dilution
The concentrations of each species in the  model is affected by it’s degradation (inherent to the molecule) and dilution  (due to cell growth). While these processes are completely unrelated, they have  the same net effect: Decreasing the concentration of the species. Therefore, we  represent the two rates as a combined degradation/dilution parameter in our  model. we assume only the degradation/dilution of mrfp mRNA and mrfp.

Since our GFP reporter should only express under the pSac promoter and only in non-heterocyst cells, we would expect the spacing of dark spots to match the spacing of heterocysts identified through alcian blue staining. Alcian blue is a dye that selectively binds to polysaccharide chains on the surface of heterocyst cells. As you can see by comparing the two images, our results appear to match up!
Work to characterize the performance of our cscB sucrose secretion construct is underway. We will assay sucrose levels produced by PowerCell.

Biobricked the urease operon
We successfully PCR cloned a 10.7 kb functional urease cassette from the plasmid pBU11, whose genetic sequence has hitherto never been known before. We ligated it onto a backbone, and successfully made a standard BioBrick , characterizing its function and demonstrating active urease activity. Urease is the catalyst behind the phenomenon known as biocement, which is able to fuse sand into bricks, using nothing more than calcium ions and urea. More about urease.
Biobrick part BBa_K656013 has been submitted to the Registry of Standardized Parts.  The sequence of this cassette is unavailable because it currently does not exist in any known registry. At the time of this writing, it is currently being sequenced in the lab of Dr. Chris Mason at Weill Cornell Medical College. As soon as the sequence is available, we will supplement the directory listing.

Compared with the control, it is seemingly that the BL21 with ribB gene part can product more riboflavin (riboflavin solution looks yellow), seeing Fig 4.
Fig 4 From left to right, respectively, the solution is BL21 control, BL21 with K1755005, BL21 with K1755006, BL21 with K1755009.
Use spectrophotometer to measure the concentration of bacteria and riboflavin at different time. The consequence of the experiment can be seen in Fig 5.

Fig 5-A Bacteria concentration of  K1755005, K1755006, K1755009 bacterial strains vary with time.
Concentration of the microbial strains of  K1755005, K1755006, K1755009 bacterial strains basically don't have difference at the same point in time, and the corresponding statistical analysis also showed that there are no significant differences between the three parts(the results are shown in Table 2). It shows that when bacterial strains are linked with K1755005, K1755006 or K1755009, the influence to the viability of the bacteria is very limited and can even ignore it. That's why the concentration of the microbial strains is basically the same with the different processing at the same time. In the following research we can directly compare the concentration of riboflavin to analyze the ability of riboflavin synthesis in different bacterial strains.

Fig 5-B Riboflavin concentration of  K1755005, K1755006, K1755009 bacterial strains vary with time.
The bacterial strain linked with ribB has a better performance of producing riboflavin and the promoting ability from strong to weak can be easily seen as following: K1755005, K1755009 and K1755006. Moreover, the distinction between K1755009 and K1755006 isn't obvious. The construction of these three parts are familiar and the the statistical analysis also showed that when the bacterial strain linked different parts, the ability of producing riboflavin is totally different with the original BL21 (The analysis result is shown in table 2), which proved that K1755005, K1755009 and K1755006 have all accomplished as we anticipated.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," strong constitutive promoter exhibited the most uniform expression, this was chosen to regulate the expression of the photocontrol device genes. With the modelling results in mind, it was decided that the relB gene should be regulated by a tightly controllable uniform promoter, thereby ruling out the constitutive promoter family members as a possibility.
Expression Level of the Mnt- and Penl-Regulated Promoters
The PenI-regulated promoter was chosen to control the expression of the photocontrol device, as it mediated a stronger expression than the Mnt-regulated promoter.
The cloning of the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , and the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , emerged problematic. For further information about these difficulties, read here.
Consequently, the applicability of two different promoters was studied. These were the PenI-regulated, BBa_R0074 , and the Mnt-regulated promoters, BBa_R0073 , whose repressors are not found in E. coli, making the gene expression constitutive in this organism. The relative expression and noise levels were quantitatively assessed using fluorescence microscopy of YFP reporter systems, BBa_I6103 and BBa_I6104 , expressed on pSB1C3 in MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5. For this purpose, an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used, set to an excitation at 470 nm, emission at 515-560 nm, and exposure time at 20 ms.
Figure 16. Fluorescence microscopy of YFP under the control of PenI-regulated and Mnt-regulated promoters on pSB1C3 in E. coli MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5.
From the data obtained, it was evident that the PenI-regulated promoter mediated a substantially higher level of YFP expression than the Mnt-regulated promoter, as seen in Figure 16. Furthermore, the PenI-regulated promoter displayed a notably lower level of noise. On the basis of these results, the PenI-regulated promoter was chosen to control the expression of the photocontrol device.

The primary question researched by our team was very broad; How can an iGEM project change the real world? This allowed us to explore a huge range of different areas, from safety to intellectual property right to public opinion, all of which contribute to the success of a synthetic biology project outside of the lab. Our team considered these by consulting with parties affected by these issues, including the Environment Agency, iGEM start-up companies, and members of the public (including full attributions to all experts and stake-holders who assisted us) to gain an insight into the problems which might hold back syn bio solutions from implementation in society. We used this information together with our own experiences to think about how these potential road blocks can be successfully navigated, by the syn bio community and by society as a whole.

Final constructs after this cloning are; respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-HNS  and T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-HNST108I. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
As the mutant version of HNS shows us that change of even a single amino acid can be effecting protein expression, we considered His-tag(6 amino acid long) could effect their expression too. So we planned to clone them into PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, which we designed. By doing this, we will have the proteins synthesized in high amounts with the help of T7 but there won’t be any additional amino acids. We expect to have better results from our experiments.
PotB59/PomA
We aimed to increase motility and torque force of E. Coli flagella when we knock-out its natural rotator system proteins MotA and MotB and replace them with PotB59/PomA systems. As we needed these two proteins together, we combined them on the same biobrick when we ordered the gene sequences. In gene designing, we considered producing onlyone RNA for these two genes but having two different proteins when this RNA translated. In addition to this, to have a controllable system, LacI protein attachable Lac operator was added between this sequence and T7promoter sequence. We searched to find a vector which can lay down all those conditions and found out that peT-45 expression vector is useful. When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of PotB59/PomAgene sequence and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning them into peT-45. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequences and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China B#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"The β2-MG nano-antibody modified by the long chain of C18 is larger than that of β2-MG                             nano-antibody. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the effects of ordinary                             β2-MG nano-antibodies and C18 long-chain modified β2-MG                             nano-antibodies on the optical imaging of liquid crystal cells.
2. Result
Under the condition of 500ng/mL of β2-MG, 250ng/mL C18 modified of β2-MG                             nano-antibodies, 250ng/mL and 400ng/mL of β2-MG nano-antibodies were fixed on the                             glass slides, and color and brightness changes of liquid crystal film were compared, as                             shown in Fig. 6.

(a)                                         250ng/mL modified                                         C18 β2-MG nano-antibodies. (b) 250ng/mL β2-MG                                         nano-antibodies.                                         (c) 400ng/mL β2-MG                                         nano-antibodies
From the experimental results, fixed with the same concentration of β2-MG nano                             antibody (both with a concentration of 250ng/mL), the brightness of the liquid crystal cell                             with C18 modified β2-MG nano-antibody is higher than the threshold of normal                             nano-antibody.
3 Comparison of sensitivity between normal β2-MG nano antibody and C18 modified                             β2-MG antibody
From the experimental results, we can find that the C18 modified β2-MG                             nano-antibody has greater disturbance to the liquid crystal molecules, so we can judge that                             the sensitivity of the C18 modified β2-MG nano-antibody is higher.
Conclusion
Through experiments, we finally decided to immobilize 500ng/mL β2-MG on the                             substrate , binding with 400ng/mL β2-MG nano-antibody. In addition, we determined                             that the detection sensitivity of the antibody at β2-MG modified by C18 was                             higher. Therefore, we can detect the concentration of β2-MG in the range of                             100ng/ ml-400ng /mL (a theoretical estimate) by this method, which meets our requirements                             for the early diagnosis of nephropathy patients"

-We learnt some basic concepts of synthetic biology, and the safety rule of laboratory.
-We practiced some basic experimental operation under guidance of Dr. Wang from China Agriculture University.
-We read a lot of literatures, brainstormed and came up with the topic of our project.
Mar. 2017
-After massive literature study and discussion, our group members agreed to design a toxic-free product which could repel mosquitos effectively.
-We visited Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and consulted with the professors about our experimental plans.
-We decided the research plan which is most possible to lead us a successful accomplishment of our research objective.
-We presented our ideas to some teachers from Institute of Agriculture, and gained several useful advice.
Apr. 2017
-Based on group communication, our project aimed on citronellol, because the literature study gave us a clear clue about the incomparable advantages of citronellol in the perspective of repelling mosquitoes.
-We searched more documents about citronello and its effects on mosquito repelling. Finally we found out that OYE and GES are the two key enzymes in citronellol production pathway.
-We designed our unique genetic circuits and selected the appropriate vector which can result in a successful expression of our target proteins.
-We cloned both gene OYE and GES after the primers was designed.
May. 2017
-We visited the College of Life Science in Peking University and asked Prof. Liu for some advice on our plan.
-We Found and chose the appropriate vector for our project which can express our target protein in yeast.
-We Found and chose the appropriate vector for our project which can express our target protein in E.coli.

SRM regions in random colors
Different regions from an SRM run starting at $Q=256$ (top left) and going to $Q=1$ (bottom right). Each region is assigned a random color.
SRM regions (average color)
Different regions from an SRM run starting at $Q=256$ (top left) and going to $Q=1$ (bottom right). Each region is assigned the average color of that region.
SRM Clustering
In our project, we used Statistical Region Merging for clustering. In contrast to other algorithms, such as k-means, this approach is highly deterministic. For our purposes we only have one SRM run for $Q=256$.
In MATLAB, we use the previously mentioned code from MATLAB Fileexchange (Boltz, 2009). For our Qt-based GUI we implemented the SRM method ourselves.
The SRM clustering reduces the amount of different colors in the image and hence eases the recognition of parts belonging together.
Qlevel = 256; [maps,images]=singlesrm(double(image),Qlevel);
Finally, if applied to our test-image, regions are created and homogenoues regions form:
Regions created with SRM clustering
Segmentation
In the segmentation stage all background regions are removed. This task is quite crucial. If one removes too few, the final stage of finding pathogens might get irritated. On the other hand, if one removes too many regions, positive hits might get removed early before detection. This surely must be avoided.
We opted for a simple thresholding step because it showed that while being easy, it is an effective weapon against the uniform background. In fact, the good image quality we wanted to reach with our device allows now less sophisticated methods. Also the less computational intensive the steps are, the better they might even run directly on the Raspberry Pi in our device!
The HSV thresholding is performed on each component seperately. For more information on the HSV color space we refer to Wikipedia . The first component is the hue which we select to be inbetween $0.462$ and $0.520$ to select any blue-greenish color. We will not see bright green due to the filter selection in our device. The saturation value must be high, between $0.99$ and $1.0$. Moreover, the value component of the HSV image has to lie between $0.25$ and $0.32$, which assumes a relatively dark color.
Indeed, these values are not problem specific, but specific for"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

NYMU-Taipei,2011,Team:NYMU-Taipei#synthetic-neurobiology_-_-_TEXT.html,"omagnetic design ) The circuit concepts we come up with combine both physic and biochemical views; we use physical force to drive the circuit hoping to light up the neurons immediately while biochemical reaction usually take much more time.
The Circuit Theory
The circuit we developed might be challenged due to the pioneer design for combining physics and biochemistry together since the current research in synthetic biology mainly based on fundamental biochemistry. However, we have our own defense. The broad definition of circuit is a series of accomplishing work by any means of routing matter through a loop. Since we have met the criteria of synthetic biology, (that we use standardized bioengineering parts, and some design rules for creating the novel biological systems,) the multidiscipline design for our attempt should not be eliminated through the narrow definition of traditional biochemical circuit in synthetic bioengineering.
Future
In the future, we hope our design can successfully function as non-invasive, focal, and portable neuron stimulators. It can be developed to understand the neural network and father enable systematic treatments for neurological disorders, or diseases associated with neuron. Though the methods are different, it’s really our pleasure to know we are on the same path with those remarkable scientists around the world. We will do our best to fulfill our final goal.

Danci-K8,2016,Team:Danci-K8#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," prepare suitable activities for blind people and to have a more accurate explanation about Synthetic Biology.
The blind also came with the question whether it will be possible in the future to change the state of blindness? There is no way of knowing obviously, Synthetic Biology is beyond imagination. We left our day of activities t the Center for the Blind with great satisfaction, however, with a lot of scientific questions. We have a full career ahead to know how to answer the questions we received from the blind.
Here we understood once again how much science can change the lives for young people.
Kibbutz Hagoshrim – “Unbelievable… the children are not surprised
about the power of science, for them it’s child’s play.”
The kibbutz has a unique way of life in Israel. It is a collective farm or settlement in modern Israel. All the profits from the kibbutz businesses are equally divided between the members. They make a living mainly from farming and industrial manufacturing. The children are raised in a “children’s’ house” where they usually live together. We met a group of young children in the children’s house for an activity on the sense of taste and Synthetic Biology
EU- Science Night
Science Night is sponsored by the Tel Hai College as part of the EU's partnership. In the evening more than a thousand teenagers came to experience a scientific community activity. We decided to pass on this knowledge in two ways - Through a scientific booth where participants could get information about the competition, on the field and of course to experience a taste-related activity and synthetic biology. At the same time we gave a presentation of Team Danci-K8 to the city residents. Reactions from the audience were amazing and full of appreciation towards the team. It is important to note that the entire evening is in coordination with the EU as part of the agreement where science is accessible to all ages as part of the Horizon 2020 scientific activities with the entire EU communities simultaneously.
The second Synthetic Biology Convention
Synthetic Biology Convention for Youth from the Periphery The convention was held on the 14/10/2016 in our small city “Kiryat Shmona”. 200 youth from the northern periphery of Israel participated in the event. The convention included top lecturers from Israel in the field, young top of the line lecturers in academics and industry. All Israeli iGEM teams participated: Ben Gurion University, the Technion and us, a team of students from Danciger Darca High School.
200 students listened eagerly to the lectures and were extremely excited by meeting with the Israeli iGEM"

We transformed our inducible ampicillin resistance into a new E. coli strain (JM109) in order to test whether the promotor being leaky is strain specific.
We performed a colony PCR to test the result of our latest cloning experiments for the amilGFP cassette (J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015), the inducible ampicillin resistance and LasR transcription factor cassette (B0015-K091117-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079), the N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL synthase with eforRed reporter cassette (B0032-C0076-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592012) and the N-butyryl-HSL synthase with aeBlue reporter cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K864401-B0015).
The amilGFP cassette (J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015), the N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL synthase LasI with eforRed reporter cassette (B0032-C0076-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592012) and the N-butyryl-HSL synthase RhlI with aeBlue reporter cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K864401-B0015) showed the expected bands on the gel and were prepped. The inducible ampicillin resistance and LasR transcription factor cassette (B0015-K091117-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079) was prepped as well despite a second colony PCR showing no positive results.
We also tested the inducibility of our final Prhl construct in 2xYT liquid culture with ampicillin overnight, which showed normal growth without being induced, indicating that the promotor is still leaky.

Tacoma_RAINmakers,2018,Team:Tacoma RAINmakers#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," make the culture smell like bananas, adding too much will, as one camper put it, “make the bacteria smell like feet”.
The feedback from the campers was incredible. They all took short tests, to assess their understanding of biology, before and after the camp. Scores from the first test, taken at the beginning of the camp, averaged 57.7% with a standard deviation of 22.7%. Scores from the second test, taken at the end of the camp, averaged 93.4% with a standard deviation of 7.3%. This shows that every camper learned the concepts presented throughout the week, regardless of their background knowledge. Many of the students began the week with no interest in science, and very little confidence in their ability. We are so proud to say that every student left the camp feeling excited about science, and feeling like they could have a future in biology.
“While excited to try [the camp], I wasn’t really sure if it was going to be something I’d be interested in.  But from the first day I came here the lab work we’ve been doing and the stuff we’ve been working on has been something that sparks that interest for science.  The mentors and peers here have been unbelievably nice and helpful and I would recommend this camp to anyone interested in science, biology, or engineering.”

“At first I was a little hesitant and scared coming here because of the title ‘bioengineering.’  I thought no way could I ever do that I don’t even know what a cell membrane is. RAIN proved me wrong. I was able to understand what we were taught.”

“I have learned so much over this week that I had no idea about.  I found the lab about PCR screening fascinating. The fact that we can essentially reproduce DNA at mass quantities with just some chemicals and a thermocycler is just so amazing.  Normally biologist learn about this in college but the fact that I got this opportunity so early really made me inspired.”
