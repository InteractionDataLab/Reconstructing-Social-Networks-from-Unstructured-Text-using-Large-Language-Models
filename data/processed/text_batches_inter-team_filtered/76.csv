Shao, Xuze - Captain and Prime art designer
Xuze Shao, from SHSBNU, grade 11. Prime artistic designer of team SHSBNU_China. Xuze has a good sense of doing science research, though not being a biology-focused student. This future architect is here to prove he also has the ability of critical thinking and scientific research. He and Yuanhong designed the team posters and T-shirts. Thought he has some small weaknesses like he is careless sometimes, but he believes that he can overcome these problems in the contest and proof himself. He also hopes that his effort on them SHSBNU_China can help the whole team win a gold price.
Zhang, Chen - Vice Captain, Modelling Researcher, and Programmer
Chen Zhang, from grade 12. As the captain of our 2017 iGEM team, he is the only team member who have experienced iGEM before. Chen decided to offer help in this year in experiment, modeling, wiki, and Jamboree. Also, he decided to manage tasks to other people to make sure that we are on the right way and right time. After iGEM of last year, he read a lot of books that spread from Mathematical modeling, HTML & CSS, to linear algebra and Statistics. These studying experience can let him offer better help to the team.
Li, Chenyu - President of Synthetic Biology club
Chenyu Li, from SHSBNU grade 11. He is a student that who fonds of biology and Psychology. He is the president of synthetic biology club in SHSBNU. In junior high school, he got interested in biology was because of an experiment of tissue culture. Running into synthetic biology field is an unexpected opportunity for him. In high school, he is learning SAT Biology, AP Biology and AP Psychology course. His dream is to become a psychiatrist or genetic consultant. In his spare time, he loves reading biology journals, watching documentaries related to biology and speaking Klingon language.

Adaptation of fum gene codon usage to E. coli KRX
The fumarate reductase Fum from A. succinogenes just as Frd from E. coli is a membrane associated enzyme, which consists of four subunits. Because there was no full genomic DNA available from A. succinogenes, we ordered the Fum gene via custom gene synthesis at gBlocks® Gene Fragments . Before ordering DNA we ensured for optimal codon usage adapted to E. coli by jcat online optimization tool . Furthermore we checked the sequence for illegal restriction sites (EcoRI, PstI, NotI, XbaI) and eliminated them if required.
Because the sequence is too large for synthesis in one part with gBlocks® system , we divided the sequence of fum into two different parts: fumA and fumBCD (also called fumB). FumA includes the coding sequence of the fumarate reductase (Fum) subunit A ( BBa_K1465103 ). However fumB consists of the fumarate reductase subunits B, C and D ( BBa_K1465104 ). The fumarate reductase subunits were designed with their own ribosome binding site respectively.
Cloning fumarate Reductase Fum
Two different subunits of the fumarate reductase Fum from A. succinogenes had to be cloned into the shipping vector pSB1C3 . Several problems occurred during the cloning of the ordered fumA and fumB into pSB1C3 via gibson assembly .
Cloning of fum was not successful for a long time. Unfortunately we could not realize the ligation of fumA and fumB creating an active fumarate reductase (Fum). So there are no characterizations of fumarate reductase (Fum) available.
Mediators
We use different mediators for electron transfer in our electrobiochemical reactor system. The electrochemical behavior of the mediators were analyzed in a H-cell reactor . We characterized the different mediators in combination with different electrode marterials to identifie the best suitable set up for cultivation of our E. coli strain in the electrobiochemical reactor system .

2 - band around 350 bp, 288
3 - no visible band

8 - two bands, one at 300-400 bp and another  at 100-200 bp
9 - two bands, one at 400-500 bp and another  at 100-200 bp
10 - two bands, one at 400-500 bp (longer than the band in well 9) and another  at 100-200 bp
This confirms that we do not have any of our constitutive promoters.  The only promising promoter is pCYC, which has a band in the well with the promoter but not in the control well.  However, the length is not as expected (350 bp on the gel, 288 bp expected).
This gel also confirms that we definitely do have our mZifA and mGliA within expected ranges.  mLexA, however, should only be 244 bp according to the vector map.  That it is about 200 bp different from expected indicates either an unexpected PCR product or that the vector map we are using to predict its length"
SUSTC-Shenzhen-A,2013,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," data from HKUST team. According to the data from HKUST, fluorescence produced in about 5% xylose is more than that in 10% xylose, however what we got is fluorescence produced in 5% xylose more than that in 10% xylose.
Since we didn’t get what we really want using microplate, we tried flow cytometer this time. In 0% xylose culture, we almost got no fluorescence produced and in 0.003% xylose culture we saw obvious fluorescence came out. There was an obvious tendency that the efficiency of the promoter increased as the xylose concentration gathered up. However, with the increase of xylose concentration, the fluorescence increased choppily. What was amazing was that the fluorescence we got was 10 times brighter than the result the HKUST got, which appeared to be great.
Another interesting thing is most of the cell we detected had no fluorescence production. Then we guess that may because the xylose molecules taken in the different cell are different, or may because the plasmid copy number in each cell is different. Maybe it has something to do with epigenetics.
BBa_K774007 : KNO3
Like the BBa_K733018, we were wondering where the transition point is the production of fluorescence from off to on. So we have made more concentrations increasing exponentially to foster bacteria with BBa_K774007 and tested them by microplate.The result came out that with the increasing of nitrate of potash, the fluorescence produced by the cell increases slowly at the beginning but rapidly later. What a pity that we didn't see the obvious turning point between off and on.
BBa_K741002 : glucose
Seeing BBa_K741002’s figure prepared by USTC_China, we were thinking whether we could get it more efficient in decreasing the fluorescence produced by the bacteria. Besides, we though it lacked the data under the low concentration of glucose. So we measured this part by microplate reader in the concentration showing below. The result came out to be very good: in about 10^-2.4M glucose, the fluorescence has left only a half in one cell.With the increasing of glucose, the fluorescence/OD continuously decreases, and at about 0.1M glucose, the fluorescence/OD remains very low.

Conjugation
Today, we made an unbelievable discovery: we found out that the conjugation between two cells with the same plasmids has been proposed before by the Peking team from iGEM 2007 . In conjugation, the Tra family proteins are present on the F plasmid and are responsible for establishing the connection between the conjugating cells. The Peking team took traI out of the F plasmid, and implemented it"

DH5 alpha cells tested in transformation to check their ability. Transformed on DH5 alpha and MG6155. Liquid cultured J23101+B0034+KAN+B0015 and J23101+B0034+Full Cutinase.
Tuesday September 4th
Today, we began our SDM reactions by SOEing on the B0034 + Reductase + B0015, J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, and K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase constructs. We are following the same protocol as before -- PCR then gel extraction and purification to select for the correct fragment lengths. Instead of using Taq and Pfu, we used only Pfu in a 1:1 substitution. We performed PCR screens on the SDM (multiple sets of primers) from yesterday of the J23101/K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, but we saw no bands. Therefore, we did another set of 12 PCR screens to see if there are any properly sized inserts in any of the colonies. We also did a multiple set SDM of the B0034 + Reductase + B0015 and transformed them. We will see how they turn out tomorrow. PCR screen on few successful transformations of mutants. Mutants F125Y, V212 and Y127A showed successful PCR screens. Performed liquid cultures on them. Ran digests on J23101 and B0034+KAN+B0015. Reattempted gibson with new primers.
Wednesday September 5th
We miniprepped some R0010 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 constructs that had the dehydrogenase mutation SDM primers. We will sequence these once our primers are received! Because the previous SOEing PCR did not have bands for every segment, we repeated the reactions in hopes that there are not any pipetting errors. We also used less template DNA -- 50 ng. With the previous SOEing, we tried to SOE together the smaller pieces that have the complementary pieces with. We ran all of the SOEing pieces on a gel, and we saw the correct sized bands for select reactions, but no bands for others. We also PCR screened the multiple set SDMs that we"

You apply this drop to the surface of the agar and streak as if you would streak a solid, moving back and forth horizontally while gradually bringing the loop down.  I've found this method to work especially well when you believe that the cells have a fairly high concentration, such as in a glycerol stock or in an overnight culture.
Note with regard to the transformation that after the 2 hour incubation we were forced to put it in the fridge for about 4.5 hours since other obligations prevented us from finishing the protocol.  Normally, we would have plated the transformations immediately after they came out of the incubator.  Since we had refridgerated them, we stuck the transformed cells into the incubator for about half an hour, but it is possible that all of the DNA had been ejected due to the cooling.  We also plated these cells as described instead, rather than adding all of the liquid to the plates.  We saved the remaining liquid in case we needed it the following day.
6/11/08
Came in to discover wonderful colonies on all plates except J63006.  After putting J63006 in the incubator for several more hours, exactly one colony was discovered later on and used for an overnight culture.
Attempted another transformation with the remaining plasmid DNA from the 2007 parts kit (that we had placed in the fridge yesterday).  Put the plates into the incubator at roughly 7:15 pm, including one positive control (3x flag), one negative control, one transformation from today, and another containing cells from yesterday's transformation that had been in the incubator for the majority of the day.
6/12/08
Came in around 11 am to take tubes out of incubator.  Total time in incubator was 15hr and 48 min.  Found substantial growth in all three test tubes.  Also, took out plates around 11:17 to discover good colonies on both the positive control and the transformation that I had done yesterday.  There were only about a couple dozen colonies on the J63006 plate, so it is apparent that one should use all of the liquid from the transformation steps when plating.  However, the positive control had No growth on the transformation from 6/10, but this was to be expected since the cells had been refridgerated for an entire night and were likely dead or had lost their plasmids.
Made two glycerol stocks of J63006, since it was not glycerol stocked"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#FutureApplication_-_-_TEXT.html,"GFP is a well-known reporter used by many iGEM teams and researchers. Such visual reporters have limited use                 in some context such as soils, because it can only work in the presence of oxygen and the color output can                 be hardly detected under layers of soils.
Recently, Rice University researchers have developed gas biosensors that can track the presence of horizontal                 gene transfer without disturbing the soil matrices. This discovery can further aid the study of soil environment                 and horizontal gene transfer i.e., how hydration affects horizontal gene transfer.
Using our construct as a proof of concept, we can use gas biosensors to detect the release of constitutively                 expressed recombinant products and, at the same time, use our method of recombination to knockout the recombinant                 genes. Moreover, this may also provide additional knowledge about the fitness of genetically modified organism                 comparative to the wild-type bacterium.
When horizontal gene transfer is detected, recombinase can knockout the gene of interest and later knock out                 the reporter gene after enough concentration of reporter is established.
This allows scientists to study bacterial interactions in a selected sample environment, and investigate the                 prevention of gene transfer between engineered and wild-type bacteria.
As extracting products from organisms require many purification steps and it is costly, it may be more favorable                 to be able to use engineered organisms equipped with safeguard system in the field.
3. Reduced allergenic response by immune system for transgenic expression in mammalian cells
Hiroshi Ochiai (2010) reported that positive feedback system provides efficient transgenic expression in Hela                 cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Additional papers regarding gene therapy suggested that using a plasmid that lacks bacterial backbone due to                 deletion by site-specific recombination will improve the efficiency of transgenic expression, because the                 host immune system will most likely reject foreign vectors such as bacterial plasmids. The example of such                 plasmid is the ‘minicircles’.
The recombination of origin of replication and marker gene or antibiotic resistance gene can reduce allergic                 responses in an individual should the application be used in eukaryotic cells such as gene therapy.
4. Reduced GM pollens dissemination
The propagation of GM pollen by GM crops has been a major concern, especially in its effect on undesired gene                 flow. Removal of transgene in pollen prior to its dissemination is, thus, a crucial step to prevent gene                 flow happens.
Our sensing module can be adjusted to detect specific stimuli and temporally produce proteins of interest, necessary                 for plants for a controlled period. Recombinase can later knockout the gene of interest safely.

1. Abstract
 
We aimed at letting a broad range of people know synthetic biology. The people involved in our activities include elementary students to elderly, as well as people without any scientific background to people who majored in Computer Science. During these activities, we did a poster session and presentation using interactive visuals and understandable texts. We explained our projects, what genetic manipulation is, and what benefits synthetic biology can bring to us. The audience gave us many feedbacks about our projects, and opinions about how they think about synthetic biology. We appreciate all the people involved in our activities.
 
This year we participated in the following activities:
・Poster Session Open to the General Public
・Interview with the Science Magazine ""Newton""
・MUSE TALK: Advice from Entrepreneurs
・Visit to Elementary School
・Genetics Society of Japan
Fig. 6-1-1-1. Phase of our Policy and Practice activity
 
First, we took part in a poster session held at the school festival of the University of Tokyo. After communicating with the students who majored in business, we realized that we do not know much about economics.
iGEMers know a lot about synthetic biology, but what about economics? Can we apply our ideas commercially? How can a student who has never studied economics before start to learn?
From these questions, we thought of making an educational tool for economics by using E. coli, which is familiar to iGEMers.
> Jump to  Poster Session Open to the General Public
 
Next, we introduced our Bank E. coli project to businessmen, executives, and technicians engaged in IT company for some professional opinions at MUSE TALK.
They pointed out that economic wave should be introduced into our system for more reality. According to their advice, we improved our system to show more authenticity.
Also, many people asked questions related to safety. It was because the safety problem must be cleared in order to commercialize our ideas. They all thought it would be a big business chance, if genetically engineered E. coli can be released safely in human and nature.
We encountered two questions here: reality and safety.
> Jump to MUSE TALK: Advice from Entrepreneurs
 
Finally, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo Institute of Technology to confirm whether our project would help the understanding of economic system. Most of them said that they almost understood the mechanism of how economy works.
Additionally, we consulted Mr. Tomoya Saito, an expert in biosafety working for National Institute of Public Health."

Anaerobic Ammonia Oxidation
Multistep conversion of ammonia into nitrogen gas, requiring several bacteria species, is not the only route for nitrogen to return to the atmosphere. Instead, anaerobic ammonia oxidation, also known as anammox, combines ammonia and nitrate to generate Nitrogen gas and water. Bacteria such as Kuenenia stuttgartiensis can carry out these reactions alone and without oxygen. In addition, these bacteria can derive metabolic energy from these reactions, which further reduces the need to supply an energy source. While these bacteria do not have the same demanding metabolic requirements as the microbial communities traditionally used, they present their own unique challenges for growth and application in an industrial setting. A few sewage treatment plants, such as the treatment center in Rotterdam (Netherlands), have successfully piloted the use of anammox bacteria. This success is despite difficulty cultivating and growing this particular species of bacteria.
Our Project Goal
The ultimate goal of the Kingsborough Community College team will be to import the enzymes needed for the anammox pathway into a more amenable microbial chassis, such as Escherichia coli. Other teams in the past have attempted to address the issue of biological nitrogen removal, but with limited success. The 2013 DTU Denmark team attempted to import traditional nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes from different species into E. coli. While they demonstrated a certain tolerance of E. coli to ammonia and nitrates, the altered metabolism of their engineered cell produced a toxic side effect.
In contrast, the 2013 AHUT Chinese team attempted to import several different anammox components from K. stuttgartiensis. While this is a more desirable approach, they did not report any expression from their constructs. There are several, potentially solvable technical reasons why this result was obtained.
The Kingsborough iGEM team will build upon the work previously done by both the Danish and Chinese teams. Instead of importing all the K. stuttgartiensis enzymes, we will focus only on successfully engineering a hydrazine synthase in E. coli. This enzyme is a key step in the anammox pathway, and it combines ammonia and nitric oxide to form hydrazine. Hydrazine is an intermediate towards nitrogen gas production, and it is useful on its own as a rocket fuel. Since E. coli can tolerate the presence of the substrates for this reaction, it will not be necessary to import all enzymes"

This part is a codon optimized 6X His tag for E.coli.
Anti-aflatoxin scFv ( BBa_K2382011 )
This is the single chain variable fragment (scFv) of an antibody that have ability of binding aflatoxin. Since bacteria cannot produce the whole antibody, we decide use scFv to replace it. It contains two polypeptide chains linked by a GS linker.
EAAAK rigid linker ( BBa_K2382012 )
A rigid linker that links two proteins to form one fusion protein. It repeats amino acids EAAAK three times to maintain distance of two proteins and preventing from interrupting each other while folding.
RFP with EAAAK linker and His Tag ( BBa_K2382013 )
This is a fragment of BBa_K2382010. We designed a restriction site, BamHI, before EAAAK rigid linker, so future iGEM teams could take advantage of this part to fuse their proteins with RFP as indicator.
This is also an improvement of previous BioBrick Part (BBa_E1010). It encodes an RFP that have the same amino acids as BBa_E1010 and having a His Tag at the end. Therefore, a fusion protein with this part may have red color and the ability to be purified easily.
RFP without barcode ( BBa_K2382014 )
This part encodes a RFP that has the same amino acids as BBa_E1010. The barcode of BBa_E1010 is removed, so this part does not contain stop codon. Therefore, future iGEM teams could fuse"

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," we have identified. These libraries and the dCas9 system will be co-transformed into P. putida construct containing the HMF pathway. These colonies will be grown for the furoic acid assay and we can determine from absorbance measurements whether the HMF pathway is functioning.  We will sequence the genomes of non-functioning strains and identify which genes were turned off via dCas9 knockdown.
The 19 target genes in P. putida were identified through manual genome comparison with the help of graduate student Iman Farasat.  These are genes that are likely involved in furfural catabolism and are present in P. putida but not present in E. coli.  Many of these genes encode cofactors, chaperone proteins, ATPases, and several other possible transport proteins.  Our hypothesis is that a key oxidoreductase in the HMF pathway requires a molybdenum-containing cofactor, which is produced by a separate pathway and inserted with a chaperone protein.   Manual comparison of genomes is time consuming, and another objective of our research is to develop a program that can optimize genome comparison. This program would employ “BLAST”, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, to identify homologs between species and potential target genes that are contained in one genome but not another.  Optimizing genome comparison would allow industrial and academic researchers to identify the likely missing genes in any pathway.
The final objective of this research is to engineer the HMF pathway in E. coli.  This is a late-stage goal, providing the missing ingredients of the HMF pathway are identified.  But if this objective is completed, it could be one step closer to sustainable fuels produced by bacteria.
Our Objectives
1) Validate the gene knockdown strategy using dCas9
This is our first objective.  Once we insert the dCas9 system, HMF pathway, and RFP cassette into the P. putida genome, we will use a crRNA targeting RFP to attempt to knockdown RFP expression. If we see white colonies, we will know that transcription of the RFP gene is blocked and the system works.
2) Validate the functioning of the HMF pathway
Along with our first objective, we will concurrently evaluate the functioning of the HMF pathway inserted into the P. putida genome using a 2-furoic acid assay. We will inoculate LB broth with P. putida colonies that have grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil and add 3 g/L 2-f"

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a transient promotor with a long persistency. Usually, QS-regulated promotors get activated once the ligand threshold is reached (43). This will start the production and secretion of the required bacteriocin. Subsequently, the pathogen concentration should drop. If we do not implement a waiting time, the transcription may be stopped once the concentration falls below the threshold. This may be dangerous as some surviving pathogens could still be present. These surviving bacteria may proliferate in the absence of bacteriocins, contributing to the growth of bacteriocin-resistant species.

Quorum sensing systems for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa
We found quorum sensing systems developed by previous iGEM teams and other scientists which may be used to regulate the secretion of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. As explained above, we would need to adapt them to ensure that the lysostaphin production is not switched off rapidly once the pathogen concentration drops below the threshold. Once we have expanded our bacteriocin collection, we should pair them with suitable QS-regulated systems.
Regulation of lysostaphin
To sense the presence of S. aureus, we may employ the accessory gene regulator (agr) QS system. S. aureus uses this system to switch from an attachment and colonization state at low cell density to the secretion of toxins and proteases at higher cell density (44). The system uses a kinase-response regulator pair (AgrA and AgrC) and an autoinducing peptide (AIP) AgrD. Upon binding of the AIP to AgrC, AgrA gets phosphorylated. Phosphorylated AgrA acts as an inducer to regulatory RNA. Amongst others, it regulates the production of AgrABCD. AgrB transports AgrD to the extracellular space to allow it to act as an autoinducer (44). Several iGEM teams designed constructs based on the agr system. We could for instance replace the pBAD promotor with BBa_I746104 , an AIP-inducible promotor P2 designed by iGEM Cambridge 2007 (figure 6).

Jiangnan_China,2018,Team:Jiangnan China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," ------- Yakult   Location: Wuxi, Jiangsu
    At Yakult, we understand the great benefits of probiotics for human health. Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.
（2）On June 29th ------- Meiji   Location: Suzhou, Jiangsu
    First, we watched the propaganda film of Meiji and learned about the company's products, market and corporate culture. Then, we visited the company's workshop under the guidance of the staff. The streamlined production made us feel the advanced technology of the company. After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.
（3）On July 9th ------- Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd   Location: Zibo, Shandong
    Firstly we went to Xinhua pharmaceutical company. At this company, we learned that most of their current drugs are still relatively common drugs, and they are also used in the traditional way of taking drugs. However, some drugs need to be prepared in the form of coating, and need to control the time and dosage, which is not very convenient. Also, the granules are relatively large. We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.
（4）On July 10th  ------- Shandong Vland Biotechnology Co. Ltd
    Later, we went to Vland biotech company to discuss the problem of frozen stress in the process of microbial fermentation and preservation and transportation. Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lactobacillus lactis in anti-acid and anti-freezing are self-evident. And they raised the issue of safety, not only the safety of the bacteria, but also the emissions of the natural environment, and they encouraged us to add a suicide mechanism, which was consistent with our idea, so we considered the suicide mechanism in the design of subsequent experiments.

SCUT-FSE-CHINA,2017,Team:SCUT-FSE-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". Meanwhile, the use of antibiotics also accounted for 34% as a solution.
Over 60% of the iGEMers admitted that it was quite troublesome to deal with the problems of undesired species in their lab for the reason that these methods were costly and time consuming. It is not surprising that most of the teams showed their expectation and interest in our project for providing them a robust strain.
c)When asked about the opinions to antibiotics, most of them encouraged use with caution, and some even considered the problems of antibiotics resistance and ethics.
d) Almost 90% of them believed these issues were critical in factories, and neatly 70% thought that fermentation process in open culture may contribute to low cost. Therefore, our project should have vast application prospects.
Meeting Up
To further promote our project, we organized and participated in several conferences this year. We are glad to get valuable suggestions and feedbacks.
iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
Time: April 29th    Location: Shenzhen University
We participated in the ""iGEM Southern China Reginal Meeting"" organized by Shenzhen University. Through this meeting, we learned about the projects and progress of other participating teams in South China and exchanged views with them, and the tutor of Shenzhen University iGEM team also provided valuable advice to our project.
The Seminar with Peking University
Time：May 21st    Location：SCUT
We organized and participated in the seminar with the instructor instructor Zhang Hao Qian and advisor Zhang Yihao of 2017 iGEM team from Peking University. Both of them are experienced iGEMers and the teams they led all got excellent results. Mr. Yihao Zhang mainly introduced the projects in Peking University in previous years and shared the story of how he grew into a team leader, and the other interesting things during the competition.
Through this seminar, we knew about the project concept, team building, experimental work and project improvement, as well as the effort of them to transform the iGEM project results into academic achievement. They also gave us valuable advices on organizing team members and allocating tasks effectively, and so on. As a new team, we were inspired a lot and realized that our own project should be improved in many aspects.
Asia-Pacific conference
Time: July 31st–August 5th    Location: NCTU, Taiwan

Interlab Study: The Results
BioBricks used: BBa_I20270 , BBa_R0040 , BBa_J364000 , BBa_J364001 , BBa_J364002 , BBa_J364003 , BBa_J364004 , BBa_J364005
Rationale and Aims
The interlab study investigates the replicability of data by providing all participating iGEM teams with protocols for measuring the fluorescence output of a set of genetic devices that have been designed to provide varying levels of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression. Team Newcastle 2017 followed the Interlab plate reader protocol.
Aim: Carry out the InterLab Study as specified by iGEM.
Background
The iGEM InterLab Study is the currently the largest interlaboratory study in synthetic biology (Beal et al., 2016). The overall goal of the InterLab is to create a reproducible fluorescence assay protocol, of which anyone can follow and produce similar results to another. The published data of the 14/15 InterLab studies identified areas for improvement, with this year's protocol leaving little room for misinterpration/error.
InterLab Measurement Kit
This year, teams were provided with the InterLab Measurement Kit containing fluorescein and LUDOX stocks, along with the devices stored in the Distribution kits. The devices are:
A positive control: BBa_I20270
A negative control: BBa_R0040
Test Device 1: BBa_J364000 (J23101.BCD2.E0040.B0015)

His3 sequencing results:
The sequencing results showed that the His3 (HisB) gene is still present in the strain and without any early stop codons. There is a 2 aa deletion in the middle of the protein, but its purpose is unknown and the gene likely is still fully functional.
Restreak selection strain on plate from glycerol stock--tomorrow we will PCR the His3 locus and sequence again just to be sure.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"Synthetic T-Domains Generated by Consensus and Guided Random Design Method are Functional
The main structurel characteristic of NRPSs is their modular composition on different levels. The indogoidine synthetase indC is a one-module NRPS comprised of the three domains, namely AoxA, T and TE. Since the functionality of this NRPS is detectable by the bare eye, it offers a perfect and simple experimental set-up for proof of principle experiments regarding the interchangeability of domains from different NRPS. Out of the three domains in indC, the T-domain is suppossed to exhibit the least substrate specificity and was thus chosen for first domain shuffeling approaches. For the initial definition of T-domain boundaries of indC, we used PFAM, a web-tool which allows -amongst other functions- for the prediction of NRPS's module and domain boundaries. Following the boundary prediction, we choose a two-pronged domain shuffling approach: First, we transferred native T-domains derived from either different host species and/or NRPSs of entirely different function into the indC indigoidine synthetase. Second, we deviced three methods for the generation of synthetic T-domains based on different NRPS libraries generated by BLAST search against either specific subranges of host organisms or restricting the query sequence to be BLASTed.(link) As depicted in Figure 6, both approaches lead principally to fully functional indCs. The synthetic T-domains 1, 3 and 4 showed the same diecreased growth and indigoidin production on plates as did the native T-domain derived from P. lumninescens. The colonies obtained after co-transformation with supplementary PPTase plasmid were small in size and of dark blue color. Compared to synthetic T-domain 5, indigoidin production started earlier (approximately after 24-30 hours). In contrast to the synthetic domains 1,3 and 4 which were designed by the consensus method and showed medium to high similarity to the sequence of origin, synthetic domain 5 was generated by the guided random method. Remarkably, even though 39 out of the 62 amino acids of the original T-domain were exchange, the indigoidine synthetase with this T-domain was still functional. Closer analysis of the sequence compared to the original indC T-domain sequence  showed, that the characteristics of the amino acid sequence, i. e. for instance polar or charged amino acids, were retained in 72% of the sequence. Also, the GGXS core sequence of the"

Lambda Phage
Lambda phage is a bacteriophage that infects E.coli by recognizing LamB, an integral protein that is embedded in E.coli's outer membrane and is responsible for maltose uptake. The phage exhibits siphoviridae morphology which includes an icosahedral head and a noncontractile tail. The icosahedral head acts somewhat like a nucleus, as it is a compartment where the virus stores its genetic material. The non-contractile tail is used to detect and bind the specific target to inject its genetic material into the host, thereby infecting them [1].
With a genome of about 48500 base pairs, Lambda phage is one of the most studied organisms known to man. It has been utilized as a model to explore biological processes at the molecular level. Lambda phages not only help us better understand the mechanisms behind biological processes, but they also allow us to understand how this virus determines its own fate. Lambda phages are known to be one of the temperate phages that can choose to be either in the lytic or lysogenic state. In the lysogenic phase, the virus is in its prophage state and stays inactivated. In the lytic phase, the phage multiplies and lyses the cell.

Benefits shared out
As we put great effort in the design of our project, we want to share what we can do within and beyond iGEM. No one is an island, hence, we believe that we can change a little around ourselves, which can influence more and more people. Different people have different understanding about science, about biology, what we do can make the basic knowledge closer to ordinary people and help them build a valid view of science.
For students
As we believed students in primary and middle school are the most people in need to receive some basic education about biology and synthetic biology to promote their interests. We did a series of activities to achieve this. The students showed great interest to our educational games, during which they hand-on practiced and smiled after they had completed the tasks. We found their enthusiasm grown after the game and they asked us more questions which becomes more imaginative than before. We could feel their happiness when we said goodbye. We believe that the smile is the seed of science rooted in their heart, which we wish can thrive along with them.
For teachers
Nowadays, many Chinese teachers are bothered by how to make knowledge easier to understand and how to push themselves closer to students. Maybe what we did cannot solve problems essentially, however, we trust that the edutainment is one of the most efficient ways to do something better. The way we convey the knowledge to students, such as the game Bio2048 and plasmid model created by hand, can give an inspiration to teachers.
For ordinary people
Ordinary people are liable to misunderstand biology in our investigation. After our propaganda and popularization of biology science, more than 71% people changed their misunderstanding to biology technology. They acknowledged they did not realize that biology and technology was used so widely in everyday life. Otherwise, more than 84% people held a friendly attitude towards tomorrow’s biology development. An old gentleman expressed giant interest about our project Bio101 after our propaganda and was willing to drop in our lab, which surprised us a lot.

For each filter the corresponding selection elements (max, min or multiple selection) are added underneath each other below the plot of the app. They are grouped as teams success and team composition.
Scraping of BioBrick count
There is an API provided for accessing the registry, but unfortunately it only allows for search of a single specified BioBrick id. The fastest, but still very slow way to connect a team with it's BioBricks is doing an API request for every id in the teams parts range. The only assumption we made in order to speed things up, is that the BioBricks were submitted in a continuous parts range. Thus the matching is aborted when the first BioBrick in the parts rang can't be found.
Implementation of Scoring
In order to solve the very sensitive problem of rating a team's success we started out with a subjective scoring by every one of our team members for the different awards and the medals. This native scoring turned out to be pretty consistent an thus we just calculated mean values and put the on an exponential scale in order to achieve a harsh separation of the highest top scoring teams and those who didn't get that far. For every team the score of the single awards was added up. As the awards rewarded differend every year, we normalised the summarized score of the teams in one year to a scale from 0 to 100%.
The whole analysis was added to the R-script converting the JSON file to the RData file.
Further text analysis and data conversion
In order to do the text analysis for the methods extraction we collected a raw list of methods, which is displayed in table 10.1. They were clustered in Preprocessing, Processing and Analysis. The script doing the analysis in python again stems both the abstract and the methods and matches them.

We created our enzymatic solution - Biotic Blue - to inactivate the persistent antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The basis for Biotic Blue is formed by laccases, which have a high oxidizing power for phenolic compounds such as SMX. However, their applicability is currently limited because of the long time required for the reaction. Therefore, we aimed to engineer this enzyme to degrade SMX with higher affinity in a shorter amount of time.
Figure 1. The original wild-type laccase (PDB: 1GYC).
Designing Our Enzyme
Our enzyme is based on the laccase-2 enzyme from the fungus Trametes versicolor. We chose this laccase for its high redox potential [1], the available crystal structure (PDB: 1GYC) and its availability as a BioBrick (BBa_K500002, designed by iGEM Tianjin 2010). The 1GYC laccase thus acted as an excellent starting point to tackle SMX degradation. While the enzyme has evolved to degrade a wide range of phenolic compounds, our hope is that small, specific changes in the amino acid sequence can drastically improve its specificity and ability to degrade SMX.
A unique aspect of our project is the use of rational enzyme design: by analyzing and understanding how our enzyme works in silico, we can introduce carefully selected mutations in the enzyme's active site. This approach holds several advantages over more conventional methods. Directed evolution is a well-established protein engineering technique, but it is a slow procedure as many clones have to be screened. This is complicated by the fact that laccases require a complex expression system. Moreover, it is likely that sulfamethoxazole would interfere with the process due to its antibiotic effect on the host organism.
Our project thus started with computationally selecting a few promising enzyme variants, followed by expression and testing of the enzymes. After testing the enzyme, we used the experimental data obtained to improve our model and make better suggestions for mutations, forming a continuous cycle (Figure 2).
Throughout the course of our project we also integrated our modeling and experimental results in several other ways. For example, from our modeling we concluded which protein terminus was most suitable for adding polyhistidine tag without disturbing the enzymatic activity. Also, quantum mechanical modeling of the enzyme’s mechanism influenced the experimental design of our activity assays.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," prepared a lot of pSB1C3 cut with E and P.
Parts Submission:
A first load of parts was cloned into pSBX1C3. We only used colony PCR to test whether the cloning was successful, since the parts itself had already been sequenced.
The AsLOV2 domain was chosen as the most promising candidate for photo-activating the splicing reaction of inteins. We met with Dominik Niopek and developed a plan for photocaging inteins in the C-terminal J-alpha helix of the LOV domain.
Caging the C-intein within the J-alpha helix requires very small amino-acid sequences. We discovered artificially split inteins (S11) with extremely small C-inteins (6aa), namely Ssp DnaX, Ssp GyrB and Ter DnaE3 (Xiang-Qin Liu et al. April 2013) during literature research.
The inteins were back-translated from AA-sequences, codon-optimised for E.Coli K12.
A phototoxicity test for E. Coli was planned. Synthetic split inteins were ordered from life-technologies. The outlines for a split fluorescent protein assay was made and constructs were designed for fusing any two split proteins together -> Toolbox Assembly Construct
To determine if illumination had any toxic effect on our E. coli strains of choice we conducted a phototoxicity assay. Cultures were induced for different amounts of time and their ability to grow was deduced from the number of colony forming units (CFUs). The test showed no effect on bacterial growth.
Induction test: HEK 293 cells expressing an mCherry-AsLOV2-NLS construct were illuminated in our chamber and relocalisation was observed under the flourescent microscope to test if photoinduction works using our 470nm LEDs. The images show clear induction-dependent relocalisation of the cytoplasmic LOV-bound mCherry to the nucleus.
Primers for the intein assembly constructs were designed and ordered this week.
Positions for the caging were determined. It seemed clear that a broader screening is necessary, as there is no completely reliable way of predicting the behaviour of the changed J-alpha. Primers arrived and the assembly construct cloning started.
Toolbox Assembly construct cloning made some problems, CPEC doesn’t seem to work as planned. “Backup” primers were designed and ordered to first assemble the inserts via PCA and then add X, S and P restriction sites to gain the constructs with standard cloning.
We selected different reporter proteins from the registry to run simple screening"

Analysis and Results:
Using the model we established with MATLAB, we quantified the peptide concentration accumulation with bacterial proliferation under different type of agr systems as shown in Figure 2. As it’s shown, the higher of the bacterial flora quantity, the higher expression levels of protein of interest. After a period of time, the peptide concentration was in a platform period.
Figure 2. the peptide concentration accumulation with bacterial proliferation
The advantage of our model with Michaelis-Mentin kinetics equation is that we have not had to directly measure data for all of our enzymes, which is a difficult process. The results of our forecasting model matches well with previous relative researches. In addition, we can make the parameters of the equation much closer to the reality with experiment data.

Model 2. The gene expression model of different type of Agr receiver systems
Introduction:
In order to predict the gene expression pattern of the four types of Agr system under different concentration of AIP, we regarded the each S. aureus as isolated unit. We would like to have the receiver part of the Agr-QS system in form of a biobrick. It becomes useful to think about inputs and outputs to and from such a biobrick. We shall use the concentration of AIP as a universal signal to ""connect"" biobricks to each other. The function of AIP to receiver was shown as following in detail.
Figure 3. the gene expression model of agr system.
As shown in figure 3 above, In the Receiver cell,"
Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest SensingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," ( BBa_J23102 ), the production is increased up to five folds.
In graph 1.C., we did not observe any induction  This implies that our customized version of the yenbox fused with the promoter J23113 did not work as intended. It seems like the activator YenR could not recognise nor interact with the yenbox due to the changes made in the last two bases of the yenbox. It should be tested to redesign this part so that the yenbox is not fused to the promoter but just simply put beside it without any overlap. If the induction is not extremely distance dependent, that might work better. Otherwise, you could try to find other promoters, were the first two bases match with the two last bases of the yenbox, so that we don’t have to modify the yenbox.
These kind of constructs were also constructed with a blue fluorescence protein (BFP) that were also transformed into cells already containing one of the YenR constructs J23110-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381005 ), J23102-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381006 ) or J23101-B0034-YenR ( BBa_K1381007 ) on the backbone pSB1K3. They were then plated and restreaked together with a non-fluorescence containing reference and a base level reference without any YenR. These plates were used to see if the induction could be seen in UV light, with the naked eye. Unfortunately, as you can see in fig. 1 below, this was not the case. The color could be seen, but there was barely any difference in the intensity of the different cells.
It should also be mentioned that we did an attempt to create bigger constructs containing the characterisation constructs with the yenbox coupled to GFP and the YenR constructs (yenbox_promoter-B0034-GFP-terminator-promoter-B0034-YenR). But for some reason these assemblies did not work. After some troubleshooting we came to the conclusion that it was too stressful for our bacteria to produce both BFP and YenR on the same high copy plasmid or that these constructs were not stable in E. coli and got rejected or mutated by the cell.

Experimental results
The experimental results for the Self Destructive Plasmid are detailed below. In the process of constructing it, we deviated from the cloning strategy after proving that it didn't work as expected.
I-SceI restriction site
Gel electrophoresis of  in pSB1AK3 backbone. Lane 1: undigested (supercoiled) plasmid. Lane 2: BglI digested part, expected size = 3219bp. Lane 3: BglI and I-SceI restricted part, expected band lenghts are 2275 and 944bp. Expected lenghts correspond to the bands observed in the gel.
Construction of the I-SceI homing endonuclease restriction site was done by primer synthesis. Primers were annealed and ligated into a pSB1AK3 backbone (3189bp without the insert). Together with the 30bp recognition sequence (shown below) this gave a 3219 bp part. The sites where cleavage of the DNA backbone occurs are indicated with ^.

The resulting biobrick () was successfully sequenced and tested for functionality. Sequencing results can be found on the part page. Functionality was assessed using commercially available I-SceI restriciton enzyme. The plasmid was purified and subjected to a digestion with BglI alone and BglI plus I-SceI. The latter would theoretically result in two fragments of 2275 and 944bp.
The results in the adjecent image show that the digestion indeed results in the expected band pattern. This shows that the restriction site works as expected.

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
There were just red colonies on the plates from the transformation the day before. So we didn't do colony PCR and have to do the assembly again.
Our Laccases genes from S. goettingen, S. tuebingen and S. roseochromogenes are around 2kb. The NEB-Phusion has a range of 1kb/30sec so we thought if we set the elongation time higher we might have products for S. tuebingen,S. roseochromogene so we did PCR. But the results showed that it doesn't depend on the elongation time from the Phusion because we haven't had any products.

Subsequent lysis of E. coli to expose the desired proteins was done chemically via ionic and temperature induction. For DT containing His-Tag at the C-terminus of the protein, we managed to do His-Tag purification using magnetic beads. Binding of the DT protein into the beads would be enhanced by adding NaCl 500 mM. Incubation and washing were done 3X to remove any protein debris. Elution of the beads would generate the purified DT protein to be analyzed in the SDS-PAGE.
Part III: DT-HT Binding Assay
Prior to this step, our team expressed HT in transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) with pQE80L-HT by IPTG induction. In addition, we also had to remove outer membrane of the E. coli. The membrane removal would enable the HT receptor (in inner membrane) exposed directly towards extracellular environment, and possibly detecting DT.
Binding assays of DT and HT was conducted within 96-well plates by measuring the absorbance of 600 nm. This absorbance index indicates amounts of E. coli spheroplasts that successfully bound into DT in various environmental conditions (i.e. pH, temperatures, and DT concentration variables). Incubation was done within 60 minutes and purified magnetically using the available His-Tag. The amount of HT receptor binds to DT correlates positively with the amount of spheroplasts available in the eluents. Therefore, OD600 is used as the primary quantification of spheroplasts amounts in the eluents. Specific details regarding methods of binding assays could be accessed via protocol page

How did we design our measurement plan?
When reconstructed in Escherichia coli, KaiABC oscillator showed a periodicity of 24 hours [3] . To best verify our system can function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we planned to measure our system using different reporter at 3-hour intervals for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days respectively.
As for the measurement of fluorescent proteins, we not only used the common detecting instrument, fourescence spectrophotometer, but also make an attempt to record the fluorescent variation via the cutting-edge Leica DMi8 inverted microscope.
Another thing worth mentioning is that, we bought all of the luciferase assay system from company Promega, among them there was a new kind of Nanoluc luciferase system----Nano-Glo® Live Cell Assay System, which allows experimenters to detect live cell luminescent signals without lytic process, suitable for the 3-day assay. Despite there is no reference indicating that this product, a commonly used assay system in mammalian cells, could be used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we decided to take a try and have successfully proved its validity. Consequently, we chose Nluc solely to complete our long time luminescent detection .

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," qualified individuals with sufficient accessibility to public funding for both academic and industrial based pursuit of Synthetic Biology can be achieved. This year’s project involves several components: wetlab, mathematical modelling, Second Life, marketing, fundraising, and outreach activities.
The focus of the wetlab component of the project is to construct a second bacterial cell-to-cell communication system for the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The system that we will be focusing on this year is the Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signalling system. Through completion of this component, there can be countless applications that can potentially benefit many industries. For more details about our signalling system, please see the lab section.
The mathematical modelling component of our project aims to develop differential and non-differential (membrane computing) models for predicting and evaluating the behaviour of our signalling system. This component involves the characterization of the signalling pathway. The Second Life portion of the project aims to create education tools for the training of future synthetic biologists in an accessible, user-friendly, virtual environment. Furthermore, using Second Life as a platform, the profile of Synthetic Biology and our project may be raised through marketing strategies targeted to the general Second Life audience.
Raising the profile of Synthetic Biology within Alberta will be accomplished through our marketing, fundraising and outreach activities. Attracting sponsors to our project will help fund our research and raise the awareness of the iGEM competition as well as to the possibility of investing in present and future synthetic biology-based companies within Alberta. Moreover, our outreach initiatives including holding a weeklong open-house for a high school student and presenting material at public events will provide exposure to Synthetic Biology and arouse interest in future synthetic biologists.

NCTU_Formosa,2009,Team:NCTU Formosa#WetLab#Memory_-_-_TEXT.html," the PcIIP22 (BBa_R0053) promoter, cIIP22 (BBa_C0053) can be produced and repress the PcIIP22 promoter and the Plux/cIIp22 (BBa_K145150) promoter. The Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) ( BBa_E1010) is also not expressed in the medium. The medium is colorless in this stage.
Lactose-accession phase: the medium is green
When lactose is added in medium, lactose binds with lacI (BBa_K091121) repressor and releases the inhibition of B strand, so the PlacI (K091110) promoter starts transcripting cI434-LVA(BBa_C0052) proteins and GFP-LVA(BBa_K145015). Then, the medium are green in this stage and the cI434 repressor inhibits the PcI434 (BBa_R0052) promoter. E strand stops the inhibition to the promoter PcIIP22 (BBa_R0053) of D strand, so the promoter PcIIP22 starts to slowly transcripting cI434-LVA (BBa_C0052)protein to inhibit the promoter PcI434 (BBa_R0056)of E strand. Because transcription effects of D strand are not strong, and the repressor protein cI434-LVA has relatively high degradation rate, it is difficult to inhibit E strand by itself, but fortunately the B strand cI434 proteins provide a another force of strong and lasting inhibition that can help D strand repress of the promoter PcI434 of E strand.
Lactose-consumption phase: the medium is red
When bacteria eat all lactose, lacI (BBa_K091121) repressors start inhibiting the promoter Plac again. B strand stops transcription of cI434 proteins, and D strand has been transcribed a considerable number of cI434-LVA (BBa_C0052) protein in the second stage. The Promoter of PcI434 (BBa_R0052) is still suppressed at this stage. In this stage only the A, D and F strands are working. Therefore, the RFP ( BBa_E1010) is expressed by the Plux/cIIp22 (BBa_K145150) promoter, the medium is red in this stage.
Important concept
Have you noticed? There is no lactose in the first stage and third stage; however, the working DNA strands are different. That is the memory device record"" lactose had been added"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"94205, CAHS). Bands with the expected size for the insert are marked with.
The primers used for the PCR were chosen to anneal upstream the prefix and downstream the suffix of the backbone pSB1C3 to screen for the insert. The expected size of the PCR product without insert was 261 bp, while the inserts carrying the CAHS proteins (1.x, and 3.x) and SAHS (5.x and 6.x) had an expected size of ~1000 bp and ~850 bp, respectively. As shown in Figure 25, bands of approximately 1000 bp were found in the colonies 1.5, 3.2, 3.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9 while bands of ~850 bp were visible in the colonies 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8. Therefore, the assembly was concluded to have yielded properly assembled plasmids for all inserts, except insert 2. However, both assembly of insert 2 and insert 4 were discarded due to time constraints. Finally, the colonies 1.5, 3.5, 5.1 and 6.2 were picked for further sequencing, where all of them were confirmed to contain the exact desired sequence.
Purification of four TDPs
After the sequencing results had corroborated a successful cloning, the next step was to evaluate whether the resulting plasmids would produce the expected proteins. For protein purification, the assembled plasmids were transformed into the protein expression strain BL21 (DE3). Subsequently, the TDP purification protocol was executed and the final protein concentration was measured with a Bradford assay . The concentrations of the resulting protein solutions ranged from 1 to 3 g/L.
We ran SDS-PAGE gels for all four proteins. Additionally, we included a protein solution resulting from the purification of the bacterial strain featuring the same backbone as our BioBricks. As depicted in Figure 26, the samples from the purified TDPs led to a series of additional bands absent in the control, indicating that we successfully produced and isolated all four tardigrade-specific proteins.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#CatherineNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," learned a lot about programming and design in the process.
Tuesday: More brainstorming! After deliberating on the backend and front end elements of our program, we created a paper prototype showing our updated vision of the final product for our application. We then recorded a video of this prototype to show to BU.
Wednesday: Heading home to New Jersey for July 4th weekend!
Thursday: Happy July the Fourth!
Week 7: July 8 - July 12
Monday: Today I finally got a major programming task to accomplish for Eugenie: making the shutter panels that will display the different views of Eugene code. To reach this goal, I have the help of Evan, who has the programming background that I lack. We are also responsible for editing the look and feel of Eugenie. I spent part of the day looking over the code already present in Eugenie in order to familiarize myself with coding practices in C#.
Tuesday: Today was spent figuring out how to make sliding panels snap to specific locations on the screen in positions relative to each other so they don't overlap and obscure the other sliding panels. We have been referencing the code for our team's iGEM project last year, called MoCloPlanner, which also included sliding panels.
Wednesday: Snapping panels work! For now they are hard-coded, so they will not position properly in monitors of different sizes. Today was spent working on making the “tiles” in the tree view snap next to each other so the tiles can connect in an ordered fashion. I spent quite a lot of time figuring out how to do this, but I was determined to program this function from scratch.
Thursday: Snapping tiles finally works! It's based on finding the center point of the tile that the manipulated tile will snap to, and then updating the appropriate center coordinates so the tiles “snap”.
Friday: Starting to figure out how to move snapped tiles as a single entity, i.e. once tiles are snapped, they should be treated as a single unit when the user selects and drags the multiple-tile object. This is so the modular aspect of biological devices can be visualized in our ""tree view"".

Collaborations
Parallel to the development of our project, we have made a series of collaborations with other teams in order to obtain mutual benefit.
Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more kindred and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving the Giant Jamboree.Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the project was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions from the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather, it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night a meeting was also organized in a pub to end a"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

Over the course of this project Ben utilized his talents for the research and development of culture medias for differentiation and selection of the bacteria used throughout the project. Ben shared his knowledge of genetics as a lecturer during the summer camp. He also was a ever-present member in the lab (along with Nick Goldner) so he had ample opportunities to help with many aspects of the project.
Steven Van Alstine
Steven Van Alstine is a junior at Wisconsin Lutheran College pursuing a biochemistry major.  As a founding member of the iGEM team he hopes to continue the iGEM team in future years.  Steve is considering going onto graduate school to further his career in the realm of synthetic biology.  In his free time he enjoys disc golfing and fishing.  Steve’s favorite protocol is the transformation of plasmids into competent cells.  His favorite part is BBa_J04450 since you can always tell when the colonies you have are correctly transformed.  Steve typically likes listening to either epic music or hardstyle while in the lab. Steve is excited about iGEM this year and eager to see the outcome.
Steven Van Alstine was an active participant in the laboratory work throughout the project.  He was also responsible for the safety portion of the project.  This included interviews with two of the professors on campus about safety in academia and industry as well as safety with handling genetically engineered organisms in being conscious of a world that has the potential for biowarfare. Steve corresponded with a nutritionist to gain a better understanding of the use of the project in the context of human gut health.

BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," time interval between droplets and the given flow rate to calculate what the experimental volume is.
After comparing the experimental droplet volume to the theoretical droplet volume value at flow rates of 1 mL/hr, 2.5 mL/hr, 5 mL/hr, 7.5 mL/hr we learned two things:
The theoretical volume from the model was less than the experimental.
This difference, on average, increased with flow rate.
The droplet volumes were expected to be consistent across all flow rates and only change depending on tubing geometry and material. As flow rates increase, the interval between droplets decrease as the volume of the droplets should remain constant. We concluded that the model was not accounting for a series of parameters that would both contribute to the theoretical droplet volume and account for the dependence on flow rate.
A potential reason for the missing parameters is that the model assumed that the fluid is static instead of dynamic, due to the constant flow rate of fluid moving through the chip.1 In a dynamic model, the total droplet volume is characterized by the static volume and the pinching volume.1 The pinching volume is formed during the droplet’s fall when the droplet breaks off the tube.1
However, after researching the physical phenomenon behind dynamic droplets we realized that a complete dynamic model, as described in Zhang et al, requires complicated parameters, such as the fluid interface, making it difficult to implement.1 Therefore, we decided to create our dynamic model empirically by adding a correction factor, which would depend mainly on flow rate.
Zhang et al.
In order to determine the correction factor we ran a series of experiments to calculate experimental droplet sizes at 15 different flow rates, following the data collection method outlined earlier. The flow rates tested are 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 mL/hr. For statistical significance we measured 30 droplet volumes per flow rate by measuring the time interval between droplets, using the same method for droplet volume calculation mentioned above. Finally, the correction factor, C, was isolated in the dynamic model and was calculated using the experimentally calculated droplet volume and other parameters from the dynamic model. These calculations were performed in a MATLAB script. The average correction factor for the 30 droplets for each flow rate was then calculated to obtain a final set of 15 empirically C values to see how they differed between flow rates. The plots"

Synthetic biology is not popular yet in Indonesia and there are many people who do not know about this field. Therefore we decided to hold a workshop entitled “Potential and applications of synthetic biology in Indonesia” which was held on September, 26th - 27th 2014.
ITB iGEM team and UI iGEM team also took part in our activities and make it more fun. The participants not just come from undergraduate student but also from postgraduate student from various university in Indonesia. We got that audience are so enthusiastic through our lecture. The lecture has five parts, including introduction of synthetic biology and its potential for immunology therapy, potential of biology synthetic for health and medicine field, introduction about iGEM, presentation material from ITB iGEM team, project of syntetic biology community of UGM, and presentation material from iGEM-UB.
Synthetic biology is a newly-developing subject. We hope through our event there will be a better understanding about what synthetic biology is, its potential and encouraged people to develop synthetic biology in Indonesia. Beside, we held a workshop about bioinformatics. Why we choose bioinformatics? Because it is needed for molecule prediction before we do some molecular work at laboratory. It also useful and be a basic for developing synthetic biology. Thanks to Synbio community from Gadjah Mada University and student from University State of Malang who took part on our workshop.
Well, hopefully this small step can be the beginning of a big step in the world of synthetic biology in Indonesia. Such as a cell that will develop into tissues and has a function. Go synthetic biology!

“Say Hi to Young Scientist Wannabe!”
Synthetic Biology (Synbio) can not stop on our generation, but must be passed on the generations below us. Therefore, we hold socialization Synbio to students high school in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. Our focus is opening their minds to the real world’s problem and things we can do through science and engineering. We presented it by video animation, power point and brochure.
We hold imaginationclasses, in which students were divided into groups and given the opportunity toimagine bio-machine that can solve the problems in the world. Wow! The results were shocking! They have wild imagination in implantingsynbio concept clearly and precisely. Well, although some ideas seem impossible, but hey, there is nothing impossible in science, isn’t it?

The virtual water aspect and the ways about keeping natural balance for water quality in a mathematical model were presented by G. Bidoglio(EC-JRC IES Ispra, Italy; see figure 4). Realized Projects are the Joint Research Project SMART (integrated Water Resource Management in the Lower Jordan Valley) and the Guanting Project (sustainable water and Agricultural Land use in the Guanting watershed under limited water resources).
In summary the visit of the conference made us realize that water scarcity and water quality are in fact vital problems that already attract much attention in academic circles. In contrast, we did not know that the global water situation is such a multifaceted subject and were stunned by the broad range of subjects that were covered during the conference. As the conference took place at the beginning of our project, the impressions we took from the conference helped us understand what problems we should address when talking to a broader audience in our subsequent human practice efforts. Moreover the presentation of  currently happening innovative projects inspired us in the design of our filter prototypes.

For the planned Cas13a drying assays, 4 µL Cas13a would be dried in a final volume of 100 µL with a given concentration of TDP. From a given TDP concentration and its molar mass, we could then calculate the number of TDPs that needed to be generated to obtain the right ratio of TDPs to Cas13a.
Subsequently, we calculated an average volume occupied by one amino acid of 128,50 Å^3 from the volumes of individual amino acid residues ( Counterman and Clemmer 1999 ) and multiplied this by the number of amino acids in one unit cell to determine its volume. This volume was then used to calculate the lattice dimensions for the model. Since we were investigating a drying process, we opted to study phase separation behaviour at volume fractions of the initial reaction volume. With preliminary runs we determined that a volume fraction of 0.1 was still large enough to reasonably assume that no protein degradation had occurred, but also small enough to allow for efficient simulation.
Interaction Energies
Finally, to be able to model the protein-protein interactions, we also needed to assign energies to different protein conformations. As we were studying both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, we wanted to calculate energy values based on both types. While a variety of hydrophobicity scales exist, they usually only describe relative hydrophobicity between amino acids ( Wimley and White 1996, Wolfenden et al. 1981, Rose et al. 1985 ). While actual free energy values were estimated for hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues ( Miyazawa and Jernigan 1985 ), they are based on the distance between amino acid residues observed in protein x-ray structures. This means that they are not applicable for the units in our models, which contain five amino acid residues each.
For this reason we decided to use the hydrophobic compatibility index (HCI) established by ( Biro 2006 ), along with the charge compatibility index (CCI) described in the same paper for consistency. Both indices give a maximal index of 20 for favourable interactions and a minimal index of 1 for unfavourable interactions. To convert these indices into energies, we subtracted 10 from the indices and multiplied by -1 to assign negative energies (-10 - 0) to favourable and positive energies (0 - 10) to unfavourable interactions. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions have been found to have a slightly higher free energy contributions than hydrophobic interactions, 1.4 kcal/mol ("

Introduction
It’s essential for us to get accurate growth condition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the natural environment to keep the concentration of toxin at a lethal level. But in fact, it is almost impossible to test concentration anywhere due to the lack of equipment and skills. Therefore, building the growth model can help determine the amount of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii they should use and when they need to add more. To build an accurate growth model, BNU-China team members who have much experience in the mathematics helped us to achieve it.
Contacting with data provided by wet laboratory, we can draw the diagram of variation trend of algae population. Then we can get the key point where rate of algae population increment meets the maximal value so that the results can guide to culture of algae in their wet part. To control quantity of aquatic larva of mosquito by applying expression of specific protein in algae. There is an impressive impact of establishing mathematic modeling in population of algae.
They helped us to establish a mathematic model to illustrate the whole temporal change of algae population. In general, it’s an original differential equations based on light intensity, mineral nutrient, organism and carbon dioxide, which are four main parameters in that. As for the temporal changing rate of population of algae growing in ideal conditions, there has been a lot of methods to solve this question. They referred to Huisman model and combined with practice factors. Then we got our deducted model. This model has a few parameters and it’s easy to get the solution.
We provided the data of wet laboratory for us, and they run the model to get result. Finally, these results can help us to complete experiment.
Hypothesis of model
The fundamental way that the algae grow is through photosynthesis, in which the inorganic carbon in the water (carbon dioxide) can be transformed into the organic carbon (carbohydrate). However, the photosynthesis of the algae, which is fixed in the water, is influenced and limited by lots of factor.

Preparation of the constructions
All constructs used were transformed into DH5α strain at 16th July . First of all, we rehydrated the different BioBricks and transformed them into cells. After this step we used the standard assembly protocol to insert BBa_I13504 as suffix. The different DNA fragments containing promoters were cut with SpeI and PstI enzymes, and
BBa_I13504 with SpeI and XbaI. We ligated them using T4 DNA Ligase. The third last wells correspond to our 3 constructs. We observe 2 bands at 2000bp and 900bp corresponding to the expected size for the digested fragments. The identity of our 3 constructs was confirmed by electrophoresis .
Preview
After taking our different colonies from the LB plate, we put them on UV lamp. The construction with BBa_J23101 had the strongest fluorescence, but the construction with BBa_J23117 showed the same fluorescence as the control.
Our bacteria were put in 5mL LB in 25mL glass tube. Kept at 37°C over night with 150rpm (position with angle in Unitron INFORS HT Incubation Shakers. In the morning we dilute our samples to obtain a 0,1 DO (it takes one hour to pass all the controls in the cytometer). For the first test, it appeared that bacteria cultures were overgrown, and we observed two times the DO max so we obtained a duplicate of our sample.
Protocols
Measuring
In first place we used a flux cytometer PARTEC Cyflow CUBE 6 All the controls correspond to the exact constructions without BBa_I13504. The dark color curves correspond to the controls, the light ones to the constructions tested. The blue one corresponds with the other blue and the green with the other.
23rd July : The different samples were analyzed at DO max.
30th July : We tested another biological replicate, with DO:0.6 and DOmax. The black picks are LB tests.
We observe that promoter BBa_J23101 allows a 10 fold induction of fluorescence compared to BBa_J23106. Moreover J23117 has a curve response comparable to the control.

Background
Insertion of many membrane proteins in prokaryotes as well as the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes is facilitated by various translocons. These complexes interact with the ribosome during protein synthesis and direct the newly forming peptide into the translocon pore, or directly into the membrane. However, for the translocon to function properly, it requires many auxiliary components (signalling sequence, chaperones, insertion mechanism), which would be far too many for our system to remain stable. Since we could not simply transfer the entire translocation system into SynDrop, we hypothesized that some of its functionality could be emulated in different ways.
Nickel-chelating lipids and polyhistidine tags as potential solution
Specifically to localize the ribosomes near the membrane and reduce the exposure of MP transmembrane domains to the aqueous environment, we eventually chose a method that has already been successfully used to attach other proteins to membranes - via a his-tag to nickel ions, chelated by specific lipids composing membrane1,2. Our reasoning for this was threefold. Firstly, this"

We test cutted pRECs 201-208 again, and found the same results, which were that a backbone appeared in the gel, but no insert was digested out.
Abha and Jeff ran a gel for the prRECs that they PCRed and found that their results were not promising.

Test cutting Divya’s PO-004 plasmids to see if our EcoRI or Kpn1 or Cutsmart buffer is bad.
Ben said this morning that our sequencing results from pS-9 and pS-11 are very promising!
Our test cut did not work. This means that we do not know whether it is our enzymes or our buffer that is faulty.
PCR of prREC1-36 (1-18 for TP901 and 19-36 for PhiC31)

Test cutting pS-10 and pS-12 pRECs 201-208 with Mlul and AccIII because we may have a bad enzyme in the EcoRI/Kpnl digests of pREC 201-208
Our gel returned the expected results from our test cut. This means that our issue probably lies in the enzymes or buffer and not in the plasmids themselves.
Nanodropped purified prRECS 1-36 and many had low yield

Repurified redone PCRs
Sent 23 tubes for sequencing
pREC 193-196 using BHW100 reverse primer (this is redoing the reverse CIBN sequencing from 06/17/15 because the reverse primer was too far down to show anything in the actual PhiC31 region)
pREC 197 (3 colonies) using BPO0038 forward primer (for some reason these were not sent in the 06/17/15 sequencing; reverse was not sent because we do not have the proper CRY2 reverse primer)

d-AuNPs Generation
In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution"

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

30 Cell cultures of rd29A (pSB1C3)
Minipreped 30 cell cultures expected to have the rd29A (pSB1C3). Concentrations were too low and therefore only 4 colonies were digested.
Digested 4 colonies (labeled as seen on the gel below: #1, #3, #13, #15) suspected to have the rd29A in the iGEM(pSB1C3) Vector
These 4 colonies were ran on a 1.2% Agarose gel for analysis - ""rd29A in iGEM (pSB1C3) Vector""
The ""rd29A in pSB1C3 iGEM Vector"" gel analysis was NOT successful for the expected bands of the rd29A at ~836bp didn't show up on the digested (cut with EcoR1 & Pst 1) samples labeled C1, C3, C13, & C15.
Due to the 30 single colonies that was unsuccessful in having the rd29A in pSB1C3 iGEM Vector, I proceeded to test 45 single colonies by using the colony PCR Technique and made sure I streaked the 45 single colonies on LB-Chloramphenicol plates.
Ran 45 Colony PCR samples expected to have the rd29A in the iGEM(pSB1C3) Vector on 1.2% Agarose gels
The ""Colony PCR # 21 of rd29A in pSB1C3 iGEM Vector"" gel analysis was successful for 1 (colony PCR #21) out of 45 colonies showed an rd29A band at ~836bp.(Band is shown in the Lane labeled #21).
Minipreped 4 samples of the Colony PCR #21 (labeled 21-1, 21-2, 21-3, 21-4) and streaked them on LB-Chloramphenicol plate.
Saved glycerol stocks for 21-3 & 21-4 of the rd29A in pSB1C3 & placed in -80C freezer.
Sequenced Colony PCR #21 at the Nevada Genomics Center.
Minipreped 1 sample of the 1-9 rd29A + RFP in pSB1C3.
Saved 2 glycerol stocks for the 1-9 rd29A + RFP in pSB1C3"

In order to simulate the process of diffusion, we make a diffusion model to guide us. More details. Detailed Model .
Both of those methods could be carried out theoretically. But in the process of experiment, we find the method 2 (Inject chemicals into layer 2) cannot make a stable concentration gradient. Thus, we use method 1 (Inject chemicals into the side of layer1).
3 The Immobilization Chip
After observing worms’ collective behaviors and proving their olfactory neurons are not affected by exogenous genes, we could study their individual behavioral response and live neuron activity under a light stimulus of a specific wavelength. Traditionally, anesthetics and glues are utilized to immobilize worms. However, worms will be damaged in this condition and it will make it difficult to study the live behavioral response of worms. Thus, we designed two kinds of microfluidic chips to allow high-resolution microscopic imaging on chip without damaging for worms. (Fig. 9)
Fig. 9 The Immobilization Chip. The four channels on the top of the figure are called worm clamps. A channel with a diameter tapering from 70um to 20um can trap worms at the L4 stage. The four channels at the bottom of the figure are parallel channels. A channel can restrict worms’ movement in the z direction and worms only could move forwards or backwards after turning off gas valves. When worms go into these channels, gas valves on the entry and exit will be turned off to restrict worms in the channels.
The first kind of channel is trapping worms in the wedge-shaped channel, called worm clamps. It is utilized to observe the contraction and elongation of their heads and study the neuronal activity by detecting calcium indicator GEM-GECO on fluorescence microscope.
The second kind of channel is compressed and rectangular called parallel channel. Worms can be restricted by turning off gas valves in this compressing channel.
Both of these channels can restrict worms. But in case that they go away from channels, we designed gas valves to block their entry and exit by compressing PDMS (a flexible and easily deformed material) under the pressure made by water or air. The principle of gas valves is as below. (Fig. 10) [3]

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," were supposed to be inserted into a shared plasmid via a LV2 Golden Gate ligation. Finally, the Lv2-plasmid and the remaining Lv1 construct were to be co transformed into S. Cerevisiae. Our experiment consisted of illuminating one sample with red light (660nm) while keeping another sample in the dark. Fluorescence microscopy would then be used to check whether the import was successful [3]. If cleavage and subsequent protein import was successful, fluorescence of one protein would be localized to the compartment while that of the other would be observed throughout the cell.
Optogenetically controlled gene expression
This project is based on work done by Weber et Al. [3]. Using the interaction between Phytochrome B and PIF6 they designed an optogenetic switch for enabling and disabling transcription of a chosen gene. It is based on the tetracycline operon and the transcription factor VP16. The tetO operator is located upstream of a minimal promoter which in turn is located upstream of the gene of interest. The tetR repressor binds to the tetO sequence. Fused to it is PIF6. Phytochrome B is fused to the transcription factor VP16. Upon illumination with red light, Phytochrome binds to the tetR-PIF6 complex. VP16 is now located in close proximity to the minimal promoter, which enables the RNA-polymerase-2 to start transcription of the gene of interest.  We designed a promoter part for the Dueber toolbox(LINK) which consists of tetO and the minimal promoter region. This can be used as a promoter in a Lv1-ligation(LINK)for any desired gene of interest (a GFP-taggedPEX 11 in our example).
Lv1 -plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-Pex11 fusion protein with the tetO-pmin promoter
Transformation into S. Cerevisiae is accompanied by co-transformation of a Lv2 plasmid containing both the tetR-PIF6 and PhyB-VP16 constructs:
Lv2 -plasmid containing the sequences coding for the PhyB-VP16 and tetR-PIF6 proteins respectively
