Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Figure 2. These videos are the result of simulating CaCCD2 (leftmost), CsADH2946 (middle) and UGTCs2 (rightmost) for 100 ns in saline water.
The movies all confirmed that our homology models are good in the sense that they are not melting. Along with the movies we received RMSD plots. The RMSD plot describes the distances between the atoms of the initial conformation going into the simulation and the atoms of the different conformational states the enzyme develops over the 100 ns. As can be seen in figure 3, The RMSD curve for each enzyme model converge towards one low, stable value. This shows that the models equilibrate to a stable state with low energy in the solvent and indicates that our homology models are in fact good models to represent our enzymes.
Figure 3. RMSD plot of a 100 ns stability simulation in GROMACS of homology models to the enzymes CaCCD2, CsADH2946 and UGTCs2.
Steered Molecular Dynamics (Pulling) with CsADH2946 and Crocetin Dialdehyde
Since CsADH2946 had great advancements in the lab, has the best homology model score of our enzymes and also has the RMSD which converges fastest at the lowest value showing that it is a stable structure, we decided to focus the rest of our computer power to do Steered Molecular Dynamics (pulling simulations) with this enzyme. A pulling simulation between the protein and a substrate allows us to estimate the dissociation constant Kd which can be compared to KM. This is very useful to compare to the experimentally estimated KM for CsADH2946 in order to validate both the simulation and experiments.
Docking
To be able to execute pulling simulations we had to pick the ligands that were going to be pulled in the simulations. The obvious ligand of choice was crocetin dialdehyde, which is converted to crocetin by CsADH2946. To be able to verify that CsADH2946 specifically binds crocetin dialdehyde, another ligand, the common acetaldehyde was chosen to be able to compare the enzyme's specificity. Acetaldehyde was run in"

Overview
Modeling is usually used to make sense of the experimental discovery in traditional biological studies. In this synthetic biology project, we believe that carefully carried out modeling will be critical for the experiment design and data analysis at different stages of the project. We hope to demonstrate that the modeling is especially helpful to finalize the microfluidics chip design, and determine the absolute shear force in the experiments, as well as characterization and optimization of acoustic stimulation experiments.
Simplified fluidic mechanic theory is sufficient to guide the geometry design of shear force screening microfluidics chip. Together with direct experimental measurement of flow speed, numerical simulation of the flow in the microfluidics chip using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) enable us to derive actual shear force in the chip.
On the other hand, the acoustic stimulation devices are very different from each other. Our empirical is not sufficient to help select and data analysis. We use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to model the force field generated by the acoustic stimulators, with the help of acoustometer measurements.
Force Field
To quantitatively measure the response of MS channel on the cell membrane, we designed our experiment manipulated on microfluidic chip. CHO-K1 cells were cultured adherent on the bottom of PDMS channels. Stable and flexible force field could be formed surrounding cell, which directly controlled by the pumped-inflow rate. Each time when we applied a constant pumped inflow, cells in 3 different observation channels could receive corresponding small, middle, large, 3 level of force magnitude(1: 9: 81). By changing the pumped flow rate, we could measure MS channel response under a series of forces with different magnitude order.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a broad spectrum (see figure below).  Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.
We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.
Test #1: NADH Sensitivities We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices. This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:
Protocol for colorimeter test #1:
All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution. Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.
Test #2:  FabI Inhibition Assays (i.e. functional prototype) In order to illustrate the utility of a device that meets our design requirements. We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.  As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.  The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!
This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI. 100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADH
We are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness (accuracy when tested by multiple users), specificity (substrate and alternative inhibitors), and sensitivity (more detailed inhibition curves and optimization of conditions).  We will also be working with high school students to see if the assay can be used successfully in high schools.

Can we detect enzyme inhibition in waste water?
In order for our show we had a functional prototype, we needed to show enzyme inhibition in waste water. We performed this experiment using triplicates of 15 nM P. falciparum FabI. It appears as if life is a bit slower in waste water…
This shows that our biosensor works in waste water!

NOTEBOOK
We are the inaugural iGEM team from the fair country of Wales, based at Cardiff University. We aim to establish a tradition of synthetic biology amongst the undergraduate students at Cardiff and more widely in our community.
We have had a fantastically varied summer of 'design, test, build', and thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the worldwide community of motivated synthetic biologists at the Giant Jamboree.
Please read on, we hope you enjoy the Wiki as much as we enjoyed designing and implementing our project.
The Challenge: Point-of-care diagnostic testing can significantly affect patient prognosis.
Laboratory-based tests for sexually transmitted infections require specialised infrastructure and equipment for optimal performance [1] . STI testing is often conducted in resource-constrained environments where such resources are unavailable, limiting the use of test results in disease management, potentially impacting on patient prognosis [1] . Point-of-care testing (POCT) is operated outside of laboratories, near the site of and at the time of patient admission [2] . POCT has the potential to significantly reduce the impact of STI under these circumstances [3] .
The Solution: Cas-Find a novel system for POCT utilising Escherichia coli CRISPR/Cas9.
Cardiff_Wales has developed a novel bioluminescence detection system for point-of-care diagnostic testing, termed Cas-Find . In this system a Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 isoform codon optimised for E. coli is fused to the C- or N- terminal fragments of a thermostable pH-tolerant Photinus pyralis luciferase mutant. The coexpression of sgRNA constructs targets these chimeric proteins to adjacent sequences, resulting in the reconstitution of luciferase activity and bioluminescence in the presence of luciferin. This constitutes the positive signal for DNA detection. We aimed to undertake a proof-of-concept study of this system using sgRNA targeted to the E. coli 16S rRNA locus, describing both the activity of this system in vitro, and the optimum distance between sgRNA targets.
The design of the Cas-Find project was significantly influenced by our conversations with experts involved in many areas that are important to consider for this type of diagnostic tool. These included a diagnostic"
BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html," the future, we ought to a) include Dr. Grose as we follow the protocol to ensure we are doing things correctly, and b) probably use more of the E.Coli sample to get more plasmids and hopefully a higher concentration.
KP April 3rd 2013  Today we purified the plasmids and got them ready to be sequenced. We used Dr. Grose’s spectrophotometer. We learned how to analyze the graph in order to know if we just have DNA or if there is something else in our mixture after the purification process. The bump of our graph was right over 260, so we know that we successfully purified our plasmids! The only object of concern, is the fact that we had a very low concentration of plasmids. The instructions in the kit advised 1-3 mL of E. coli potion for high copy DNA. We used 1 mL, so next time we will try 2-3 mL to see if we can get a higher concentration. We are unsure if we did something wrong, if there is something wrong with the kit, or if we just need to use more of the E. coli overnight potion. I need to become more familiar with the sequence of our plasmid, and we need to find out why our E.coli doesn’t glow. When I understand the plasmid sequence, hopefully we can know what is missing or defective in our E. coli that keeps it from glowing.
4/5/13
KP 4/5/13 Today we made a plan of exactly what we need to do in the next week and coming months. Our biggest priority at this time is sequencing the plasmid from last years iGEM team. I was reading in the iGEM registry, and I saw that there is a pIG78 A and B. We tried A, but we haven’t tried B. On Monday we will try to transfer B into E. Coli and see if B works better than A. Next week our goal is to completely sequence the plasmid to see if something is missing or incorrect. I also need to do more research to understand better what last years team did and also the specifics of how we are going to set up our phage and how we are going to induce the lytic cycle in the presence of cholera.
KK 4/5/2013 Today we set out some long-term priorities for what we should do from here on out. Our priorities: 1.    Determine is the QS circuit working? We aren’t getting RFP right now …"
Cambridge,2010,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week2_-_-_TEXT.html," exercise involving tower construction again, but only a few of the towers stayed up at all! A wet walk to La Tasca for dinner in the evening was worth it for the delicious food, and it was nice to meet all the other UK teams.
Wednesday
On the final day of the iGEM get-together we had talks in the morning about practical lab tips, health & safety and human practices.
After another free lunch and an afternoon in Newcastle we headed home keen to get started on lab work the next day. It looked like the other teams were much further along than we were.
Thursday
Barbara gave us a talk about health and safety in the lab so we were now ready and raring to go with lab work.
We also generally carried on researching but felt that we were losing focus on what we needed to do, so had a team meeting over lunch to find out what needed doing and assigning tasks to certain people. Here is our to-do list.
Ben also made a Meccano-like stand for mounting the light sensitive camera, as you can see in the photo.
Friday
In the morning we continued researching and working down the to-do list.
At 3pm we had a meeting with Laura Rowe in the Biotechnology Department, who had previously worked on bioluminescence, to tell her our ideas and ask for her input/advice. The meeting was really helpful and we went away and started researching some of the things she had talked about, including brightness measurement, different coloured luciferases and inclusion bodies. These are our notes from the meeting.
Late in the afternoon, Duncan also showed Peter a paper about a mutant bacterial strain with very bright luminescence, to be investigated further.

BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#EvelynNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," found the concentrations of the ligations and it ended up being almost the same for all of them.  At times the robots concentrations were greater than the manual concentrations.
8/15/2011-8/19/2011
I did restriction digest on BBa_J23100 and BBa_R0040 and combined the 40 ul wells in order to gain greater values between 4.9ng/ul to 21.2ng/ul.  Afterwards, I did restriction mapping on pTet-RBS-luxR-YFPc-pLuxR to check if the robot actually ligated the two pieces properly.  Two of the three robot colonies for the robot trial 1 worked properly and had the right amount of bps.  Robot trial 2 was not as conclusive.  Two of the three seem to be accurate but the image is blurry.  We repeated another ligation with BBa_J23100 and BBa_R0040 in order to check why the colonies did not grow properly.  We did a single volume ligation and then a double volume ligation.  Then we ligated pTet-RBS-luxR-YFPc-pLuxR as a positive control.  We also ligated GFPc-pLuxI-RFPc and RBS-LacI for a separate project.  All the transformations grew however this time around the double volume ligation worked properly for all trials.  The amount of colonies for the manual and robot amount were about equal.  The single ligation did have some discrepancies.

We took advantages of any activities in our university to publicize iGEM and synthetic biology to students in our university. In a scientific exhibition hold by our university school, we presented the previous Tsinghua iGEM projects, and introduced the synthetic biology as well as iGEM competition background knowledge. Even the vice president of our university was attracted by our poster. He listened to our introduction carefully and asked a lot of questions about the potential application of synthetic biology. He said excitedly that the university should encourage more students to participate in the competition to expend their horizons.
Collaboration with other iGEM team is one of our best traditions. We believe that we can all learn from each other via these events, and bring the idea of synthetic biology to a larger population.

2. Tainung NO.1
Tainung NO.1 is bred by Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute. It has light yellow and oval-shaped tubers, shallow tuberogemmas, smooth skin, purple sprout, dark green and glossy leaves and smaller stem and leaves comparing with Kennebec. It has strong resistance to late blight, but is susceptible to common scab. It also has very weak thermo-tolerance, so it can’t be plant under high temperature. The best sowing time in Taiwan is during the bottom of October to the top of November.
The biggest problem for Tainung No.1 is reducing sugar produced by starch reacts with asparagine and produces acrylamide under high temperature. Excessive intake of acrylamide may cause cancer or damage nerves. Tainung No. 1 takes about 120 days to harvest, and can yield about 32 to 39 tons of potatoes per hectare. Because potatoes can’t be process and the farmers aren’t familiar with how to plant Tainung, 80% of the farmers still choose Kennebec over Tainung No. 1.
Growth and harvest of Tainung NO.1:
Preparation:
decide species
selecting seed potatoes
avoid cropping obstacles
organize farm land into furrow
sprouting
Planting period:

Seed
Potatoes are suitable to grow in wet and cool environment with big temperature difference, sufficient sunlight, and fertile soil. Central South in Taiwan is the best location for such conditions. We visited Taichung, Yunlin and Chiayi, the largest three planting areas of potatoes in Taiwan.
The majority of potatoes are asexually produced. Therefore, the source of seed potatoes determines potato production. Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) and Taiwan Seed Improvement and Propagation Station (TSS) are the major agencies responsible for breeding new species and examining healthy seed potatoes.
Healthy seeds potato have to first pass the three-staged certification and production before entering the market. Taiwan Seed Improvement and Prop"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Supporting Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"Summary and Discussion of Qualitative Data
The founding and non-founding teams had many differences and a few similarities between them. First, there is a large difference between the two groups and the amount of knowledge exchange and consultation that occurred. The Founding teams had far more knowledge exchange with experts and entrepreneurship advisors than the non-founding teams.
Second, the time and motivation between teams was highly varied. Some teams did not think the project was worth the time and/or their studies were in the way. Although finishing studies was a concern for both groups, the founding teams had either finished their studies or deferred them to make time for a startup. Some of the founders even went into business studies after finishing their science degrees to help their businesses.
Third, the founding teams’ ambitions pushed them to secure funding/consulting for their projects and business aspirations. Although some of the non-Founding teams did have decent funding, they did not use the resources for business creation.
One similarity among the founders and non-founders was the general lack of business experience or skills. Hardly any of the teams had previous experience in business and only a few had dabbled in the idea of founding before iGEM. This shows that not having previous business skills does not have to be a barrier to business creation. The founding teams sought out entrepreneurship consulting and learned on the way while building their products.
In conclusion, the results of the Founder and non-Founder interviews provide interesting insights into the factors that enable biotechnology entrepreneurship in iGEM. The next section uses a quantitative method approach to assess to which degree these factors truly influence founding a business.
Quantitative Data Approach
The quantitative data survey is based upon the 11 established paradigms of business creation, plus added questions to address the specifics of biotech and iGEM. The survey has 60 questions with 140 responses and was conducted between August 26th, 2016 and October 20th, 2016 with SurveyMonkey via social media and contacting current/past iGEMers via email. The majority of the questions were structured as likert scales (1-7 rating) as well as optional open answer questions.
The survey was pretested in order to check for understandability, clarification needs, and accuracy of the questions as well as the comprehensiveness of the survey and the time needed to answer its questions [3] . The pretest was conducted with academic peers, interview partners of the case study, biotechnology clusters/companies, professors and entrepreneurship consultants. The reviews from academic peers, biotech professionals and consultants also included feedback on phrasing, presentation, and"

Testing
SDS-PAGE
1 OD_600 each from the K322127 in DH5alpha cultures from yesterday was taken. The OD_600 were: 0.835 for the first colony exposed to bright lamp (bright 1); 0.84 for the second colony exposed to bright lamp (bright 2); 1.685 for the first colony incubated with red light (red 1); 1.855 for the second colony incubated with red light (red 2). The cells were centrifuged at 13000 rcf for 8 min. After resuspension in 100 ul loading buffer, the tubes were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. After that, the samples (5 ul and 10 ul) were loaded onto a 10 % SDS-PAGE with stacking gel. Pageruler was used as protein ladder. The gel was run for 2:00 h at 80 V, which was increased to 120 V when the buffer front reaching the separation gel. After that, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue and subsequently destained.
The gel does not show elevated intensities of the band at around 10 kDa for lacZ alpha peptide, which would have been expected.
T7 promoter in vitro assay
As proposed yesterday, a second in vitro assay was performed to find out if the plasmids contain a T7 promoter. This time, a third sample was made for each plasmid (same plasmids as yesterday, see above). In this sample (labeled ""#xi"") the RNase that we assume to be present were inhibited using RNA secure prior to addition of T7 polymerase and incubation. See methods for detailed procedure. The 2% agarose gel was run at 110 V, 400 mA for 1:30 hours.

Visualization
How to let people get to know our thoughts? This has always been a huge question in our mind. This year, we provide a series of visualization methods to let common people to feel, see, touch and get to know us.
First, we made a series of postcards about cancer patients care and fixing mental injury. We chose some famous lines and poems attached with pictures to comfort patients by letting them know people care about them, and encourage them to look forward.

Communication
Communication is about how we meet other teams and how we communicate our designs and thoughts. We hold and participate in several conferences where we tell about our experience and had great experience.
First, we held a seminar with professors, teachers and students. We shared our iGEM project and our lab experience. And we tell about our project’s advantages and disadvantages, its user experience and importance for society.
Seminar
In the afternoon of October 9，about 30 undergraduates in the school of life science and biotechnology discussed our project this year with professor Zhang Dabing and Wang Canhua.He Peixiang, a member of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, introduced this year's project from the Background， Design and the Results.Then the students and teachers have a heated discussion of our work .Most of the students feeled our project extraordinary and significant. Professor Zhang thought highly of our project and he suggested that using the purified gas vesicle protein and medicine directly capsulated in the liposome and modifying it with short peptide may lead to better diagnosis and treatment，which are more effective ,more specific and more harmless. From another point，professor Wang pointed that using what we have learned to benefit human life is the real purpose of learning modern biotechnology.
Introducing our project at seminar
Then we participate in two conferences: 5th Conference of Chinese iGEMer Community (CCiC) and Asia-Pacific Conference. On conference, we did presentations, introduced our project with poster and received suggestions from other teams.

Development on our hydroponics system moved into full swing on the Wednesday, with our 2 engineers beginning work on the general       structure of the system which has been influenced by conversations with plant biologists within the university; working once again       with Vas in order to understand his needs from the system.
Thursday presented our team with the incredible opportunity to speak with Steven Burgess who is currently performing plant research at the University of Illinois in order to discuss our project and identify potential for sharing our work among the wider       scientific community.
Members of the Biology and Engineering teams went to meet with Dr Montero-Calasanz; a Microbiologist whom specialises in plant-microbe       interactions. This gave a valuable opportunity to identify potential protocols which would relate to our chassis organism. The week was       rounded off by talks from Alice Banks and Collette Whitfield concerning sponsorship and outreach.
Week commencing: 02/07/18
The team focused on preparation for the wetware projects by ordering the Pseudomonas chassis, in addition to various free-living      nitrogen-fixing bacteria. A variety of flavonoid chemoattractants were also ordered in order to reduce the wait time before lab work begins.      The human practices and outreach team continued getting their work by in touch with potential sponsors. Some of the team members with prior       experience in programming began working with the OT-2 to design a heat-shock protocol for E. coli using the python-based language within the      Opentrons API.      The whole team received inductions for the Cat2 lab so that we can begin the wetware side of the project and follow all the safety protocols      and rules and regulations set out by the University for safe lab use.      After receiving the lab inductions, we prepared the lab equipment for testing Arabidopsis germination so that we can begin testing the following week.
Week commencing: 09/07/18
The ball started to roll this week, we managed to get access to the labs and plant our first set of seeds in agar as well as                      preparing chemically competent E. coli cells. We began the process of styling our wiki using bootstraps and designing the poster                      for the European Meetup. Towards the end of the week we attended a modelling workshop, ran by Synthetic Biology Masters students,                     this gave us an insight into modelling and tips we can apply to our modelling work. The team was also lucky enough to receive goodie bags                     from Eppendorf! We had previously decided that the naringenin flavonoid would most likely be the most successful,"

On Aug 16th 2016, we were invited by XMU-China to delivered them an article to introduce our project and our experiment results. We are very glad to share our project to iGEMers all around the world, and we wrote our article. On Sep 5th 2016, XMU-China published our article on Newsletter magazine.
9.The iGEM Booklet
To spread public awareness of our project, we completed a iGEM booklet to introduce ""What is Synthetic Biology?"" and ""What is solid tumor and how to treat it"". As an educational booklet, knowledge is carefully summarized. Background information, social situation, and critical learning questions are all included so that people with limited Biology background could easily learn something from the booklet.
We have already shared our booklet with teachers all over the city, the country, and even the world! Here in Jilin University, we joined a TED JLU talk and our booklets were present as a gift to the teachers and students. In addition, we have given our booklet to students, teachers, and people from other walks of life all over the state. In the HUST-Cheering Meeting,we provided our booklet to other iGEM teams and exchanged ideas with them. Two students helped bring some booklets to Los Angeles, America, as well as Stockholm, Sweden. And in Boston, during the Gaint Jamboree, we will hand out our booklet to others as well.
Three Different edited version of the booklet have been printed, better and better. And we are still working on fulfilling the information for our booklet. Currently, we are working on providing the some updated statistics so that people can have a bigger view of tumor.
The information we provided and taught to students and adults will inspire them to look into Synthetic Biology. We have already received many positive responses and we feel certain that this enthusiasm for Synthetic Biology will carry them into the future. Additionally, people learn about tumor and a healthy style of life will be pursued. Our educational synthetic biology activities booklet will be available online for anyone to use for free as soon as we get our final edition.

INSTRUCTOR
Przemysław Nuc
For me iGEM competition is a training in convincing very good students to work as a team, when competitiveness to some extent has to be sacrificed for the cooperation, what in fact is obviously profitable for everyone in a team. Synthetic biology is the most logical way towards understanding  of self-replicating, mistake-making  and self-learning  systems as human beings and bacteria, or in other words: how the evolution does really work. When we collect biological data starting from simple observations of physiologists, molecular biologists’ exaggerated enthusiasm  about a single gene and/or a single protein,  through a global, more and more detailed view of changes in the universe of the cell where let say 30K gene products interact with each other, named ……omics, to the intelligent information selection, processing  and synthesis, finally we obtain the opportunity to formulate an intriguing hypothesis and hopefully a good way to test it."

BostonU,2014,Team:BostonU#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," necessary for developing these tools. After listening to her   presentation, we had the opportunity to talk with her. As a wetlab team interested in bio-design   automation and experimental-computational integration, we thought it   would be valuable to continue collaboration with Dr. Shaer’s lab at Wellesley. Her   lab develops software tools for education and use in the wet lab.
One of the talks at the conference was given by Dr. Jacob Beal from BBN Technologies. He talked about the evolution of the TASBE Tools from when it was introduced to now, when the TASBE Tools is commonly used to predictively design constructs in mammalian cells. The past BU iGEM teams had used the Tools and our adviser, Dr. Haddock was very familiar with it, but that talk made us, the teammates, believe in potential of the TASBE Tools in the testing of constructs in E. Coli and the significance of predictive and accurate design.  The talk was, thus, very influential in strengthening our motivation for the Chimera Workflow.
In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the IWBDA workshop included   discussion sessions amongst all of the attendees. Topics focused on how to   overcome the miscommunications between biologists and computer scientists as   well as how to promote bio-design automation in our education systems. These   discussions allowed us to talk more informally with the presenters and exchange   our opinions and suggestions. We were also able to hear about current problems   that exist between experimental and computational efforts, which gave us ideas   about what needs to be improved.
NEGEM
From this conference, we learned the value of bringing together researchers   from different labs to discuss, learn, and educate each other. Because of this, we   decided to host the Third Annual NEGEM . Several other Northeast iGEM teams (MIT,   Harvard, Tufts, WPI, Rutgers) and Wellesley came to Boston University twice over   the summer to present their projects, discuss, and receive feedback. Each team had   fifteen minutes to present their overall project idea, progress, timeline, and future   goals to the other teams. After each presentation, there would be a Q&A session   where other students could offer troubleshooting advice, ask for clarification, or   offer critiques. During our lunch breaks, we held question led discussions about   technological difficulties each team faced and how bio-design automation (BDA)   could solve these obstacles. Our lunch was sponsored by BDAC. In October, we will   have a final NEGEM meeting. Each team will give a formal presentation,   representative of how they"
ColumbiaU_NYC,2016,Team:ColumbiaU NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," conditions were not      successful on all of the strains.
We planned repeat the bacteria MOI experiment with      different, accurately calculated MOIs knowing the new      information about gentamicin incubation time and      concentration. Because the 4 hour time point was      unsuccessful, we were unsure for how long to incubate the      cells in gentamicin before completing the MTS assay. Thus,      we decided to leave the cells in gentamicin overnight and      concomitantly treat a separate bacterial culture with      gentamicin overnight to compare the bacteria growth.
We encountered another problem with the experiment because      our control cells were contaminated by bacteria. We could      not bring the bacteria into the cell culture hood so we      brought the cells to the bench when we added the bacteria      under flame. Even with these precautions there was      contamination. After discussion, we decided to continue      the experiment by treating with gentamicin overnight,      thinking that the gentamicin will kill the contamination      in the negative control conditions as well. While this      experiment may not yield all the results we wanted      (specifically bacteria intake by the cells), we will be      able to determine if there is a difference in cell      viability given different MOIs.
Transformation of S. epidermidis
We successfully transformed pC194_RhlAB into the shuttle      vector for electroporation, S. Aureus RN4220, however      transformation of pC221_RhlAB into the conjugation vector,      OS2/pGO1, was unsuccessful. We re-tried electroporating      pC221_RhlAB into OS2/pGO1 a couple more times, but we were      unsuccessful. We also conducted the 96-well S. EPidermidis      Experiment, however, the Rhamnolipid blank began to grow      around the 7;12 hr mark, making it necessary for us to      disregard the results.
7/31-8/6
Metabolics Troubleshooting
We have successfully cloned the arabinose inducible RhlAB      backbone and transformed into 10-beta E. Coli strain.  We      have also transformed it into Putida, which gave us      bacterial lawns.  Surprisingly, the lawns were GFP      positive, and we learned that Arabinose isn't really      inducible in Pseudomonas.  We will still compare its      expression level to our original construct.
Keratinocyte Experiments
We conducted more experiments to determine at what      concentration of gentamicin and time point successfully     "

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to Carnegie Mellon.  All members contributed to the powerpoint slides and we helped each other plan out good ways to discuss certain areas of our projects.  On Saturday we travelled to Pittsburgh where we presented at Carnegie Mellon to a few collegiate teams and one high school team.  All went very well and we were pleased with the feedback we got from the students and professionals at the event.
Week 17
Monday, September 8 - Sunday, September 14
- Notebook Entries
Lab move!  Our lab needed to be moved to a new building as the old one was beginning renovations.  This week consisted of organizing and packing up all of our materials and DNA samples.  This was a lengthy process and took up the time we needed to make progress on the projects.
Week 18
Monday, September 15 - Sunday, September 21
- Notebook Entries
Lab move!  This week the lab needed to obtain specific access to our new building for weekends and nights.  We set up and organized the new lab area and got ourselves adjusted to everything.  Research will begin next week!
Week 19
Monday, September 22 - Sunday, September 28

Things are finally up and running in our new lab space.  More efforts have been put into the Codon Optimization project due to the time constraints before the Jamboree and Wiki Freeze.
Week 20
Monday, September 29 - Sunday, October 5
- Notebook Entries
Emily spent time in lab over the weekend plasmid prepping and transforming as well as adding to the Wiki and making things look nicer.  Ashlee aided Sam in his project as he has been extremely busy working on Homecoming events for the University.
Week 21
Monday, October 6 - Sunday, October 12
- Notebook Entries
Things with codon optimization started to pick up again. Ashlee and Emily spent time coordinating with Sam to make sure that adequate process was being made. They helped to fill in the blanks when it was hard for Sam to come in to lab based on classes and work schedule. They were excellent team players and helped to make sure that we had a part available to send to the registry!
Week 22
Monday, October 13 - Sunday, October 19
- Notebook Entries
The wiki has been the most important over the past two weeks.  A lot of work has been done to make it more user friendly and more appealing to the judges.  We will continue working hard on the projects, poster and presentation in the coming weeks until the Jamboree.

UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Rotunda UI. In this social engagement we give free blood pressure check and cholesterol level check. After they get the services, our team will start take a quick survey about how aware they are about diphtheria outbreaks. 50 peoples ages from 20-60 mostly family member who lives near Depok get engagement on this booth. The goal of this event is to give awareness about diphtheria outbreak and warn the people about its symptom. Moreover, we also engage the community to know about genetic engineering through our project. “I’m very interested with this project, if UI team can really find diagnosis devices for diphtheria it would be very helpful for Indonesia” Razak, (56) one of the participants said.
Why we should be chosen as the Best Education and Public Engagement?
The idea of why their project is important and how it should be executed should be developed and answered by teams’ Human Practices activities.
• When engaging stakeholders the teams should demonstrate a two-way dialogue was established throughout the design, execution, and presentation of their project
• Teams should not “proselytize” or “market” iGEM and synthetic biology by telling the community that iGEM is great and will “save the world”.
• Teams should document their work in a way that others could build upon and reference any prior work that informed their approach.
Diphtheria outbreak was being a tragic extraordinary event in developing country, especially Indonesia. It happened comprehensively to whole places and society levels. This condition desperately needs to be tackled. Through human practice, UI IGEM Team is considering how we can educate, reach, and engage the society not for them to know about our project but more than that, to make the society knows that they have a new hope to conquer this diphtheria problem (Point 2).
We have reached from grass-root to top level of the society. Through some studies and discussions such as: biosafety study, ethic study, and health expert study, we reached the expert and the society top level perspective and attention about this issue. We also reached the public opinion and raising their awareness by some projects like A Day with Diphteria, Community Visit, and also Public Discussion Forum (in collaboration with NTU Singapore IGEM Team). Even, we reached the grass-root level by holding a social work for people of Cikidang Village that located in the top of a mountain. Here in the social work, we are not only educate the society and raise their awareness but we also asking their opinion and point of view about diphtheria and our project . In this event"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," This data was mainly taken from very high endemic regions and my role is to make sure that I use all the data and say if the ratio is still the same. Even if we use very high prevalence and combine it with small prevalence we should have the same ratio at a global level. If I find one male then I find 1.8 females. So that was my job and apart from that I should find out why females [are more affected than males][…].
Dominika:
And what was the conclusion?
George:
It is difficult to answer this question. Because I was using secondary data. The data collected contains variables which don’t give a correct answer to the question why females? Because I hadn't planned the variables. I just found the variables in the secondary data and from the collected variables it is difficult to say why females. [...] Because when you come to the villages you find that they are exposed mainly to same things. So do you have water, do you have this, do you have that, and you find that maybe many things are common. [...] But I am thinking of doing another study where I should be conducting it, where I can go into the villages and see why.
Samira:
The ratio of 1.8 female to 1 male patient was similar in all countries you looked at?
George:
The 1.8 is not my [data] [...]. But in all countries you have [a] higher [prevalence] in females than in males. [...] The ratios might be changing but always it will be higher in females than in males, especially in adults. In the young ones [the prevalence in females and males] is almost the same.
Dominika:
So there are differences in the ages too?
George:
Yes. [...] When they are young, maybe because of their activities, they are similar. The prevalences [in females and males] are almost the same. But when they grow it [the prevalence] starts to differentiate to females more than males.
Dominika:
Are there any regional differences too?
George:
Yes. Trachoma is truly a disease of the poor, because it depends of the hygiene and feces. If we go now in the villages, before we examine we can say we will find trachoma in that child. [...] When you’re moving around and they [the people] look clean and you’re examine usually you don’t find [trachoma]. But those children [...] where you say Ah this one! This one is too dirty, maybe it is everyday like that. Many times you find [trachoma]. So It is more in"

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html," In our 2-d model tumbling of bacteria due to collisions and stopping of overlap are included. However if we implement this effect and count how many bacterial collisions occur, the frequency is surprisingly low. The model which detects collisions and changes the behaviour is extremely computationally intensive for MATLAB when dealing with thousands of bacteria and has little impact on the behaviour. The model is mostly concerned with how long it takes E. Coli to travel through mostly empty space to our target source of chemoattractant, and not how inter-bacterial collisions affect a tight quorum of bacteria.

iGEM Uppsala: Ethics webinar
iGEM team Uppsala organized a series of three online webinars where five iGEM teams discussed ethical topics live on YouTube. We collaborated by participating in the Online Ethics Discussion about ‘Social Responsibility‘ in relation to ethics. The following topics were discussed:
Responsible communication to the general public
Choice of target audience
Responsible choice of media to reach this target audience
We learned that although it is more profitable to show your project in a one-sided positive way, it is more important to be honest about the goal and means of your project. In this way, the end-user can develop a fairer opinion on your product and their trust in the study increases. Through consultation with experts on the technical and human aspects of your project, you can find out what matters most about your project, and adapt your communication to the problems and needs of your target audience. This results in a more effective end product.
The webinar can be watched on YouTube .

iGEM Cologne-Duesseldorf: Postcard campaign
We collaborated with iGEM Cologne-Duesseldorf in their postcard campaign. This is a worldwide campaign where iGEM teams designed their own postcards, which are then distributed by the organizing iGEM team all over the world. The ultimate goal was to promote synthetic biology to raise public awareness. We distributed the postcard both on Campus and at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). This way, both students, scientists, as well as children and their parents, got to take these interesting cards home.
Surveys
We helped other iGEM teams in improving their project by filling in surveys, covering a wide variety of fields. We filled in surveys from iGEM BIT , Munich , Sydney_Australia , Vilnius-Lithuania , Washington and Waterloo . We hoped this helped their project a step further into the right direction.

They encourage discussions about synthetic biology and the latest developments in the field. This is related to the impact of synthetic biology on their fields of specialization. Part of this is a collaboration with Dutch iGEM teams with the potential to obtain funding.

Here, we need to state that the linear fit of the parameter is done in logarithmic scale as the log10 of the parameter is directly proportional to the perceived light intensity. We hypothesize the fluorescence of the blinking light will be on the same level as the fluorescence under a constant blue light with half of the maximum intensity of the blinking light. That is, we suggest the effect to be proportional to the average intensity and that the blinking would not affect to the results.
In this experiment, we had three black microtiter plates for three different sets of samples. On each microtiter plate, we had two positive and two negative control samples in wells without a LED. In addition, we had 20 light response element samples where 8 samples were incubated under constant light, 8 incubated under blinking LEDs and 4 samples which were without a LED. Each plate had the same order of samples. We defined different conditions for each plate. One plate (called light) was incubated in 37 Celsius degrees and constant lab environment lightning. The second plate (called dark-LED) was first incubated in complete darkness under an aluminum foil cover and after one hour, it was placed in the LED rig. The third plate (called LED-dark) was placed in the LED rig in the beginning of the experiment and after one hour it was placed in darkness under an aluminum foil cover. This installation was set to examine the dynamics of the light response element. In case of dark-LED, we can observe how bacteria will respond to different intensities of light, that is, how fast they are able to repress the production and what is the half-life of GFP-LVA. And vice versa: LED-dark will show us how fast the bacteria will be able to initiate the production when they are brought to darkness. To measure this dynamics properly, we must have much more frequent measurements compared to two previous experiments. All the plates were incubated at 37 Celsius degrees and 220 rpm.

Go to Demonstration
Sensing Circuit
Sensing Circuit converts the productivity (cellular concentration) of D-psicose to the expression level of downstream genes. This circuit is based on the repressor and inducible promoter contributed by Evry_Paris-Saclay team, which are annotated as PsiR and pPsi in the circuit schematics. Various regulatory elements are designed in order to achieve robust biosensing. This circuit (composite part) is meant to be a universal one, which the repressor, inducible promoter and the downstream part are flanked by different enzyme recognition sites The repressor and the inducible promoter adopts two different Golden Gate recognition sites to achieve seamless ligation required in a regulatory system, and the latter one uses standard BioBrick assembly, in order to adopt a spectrum of iGEM standard parts readily.
It is our design philosophy to build reusable biological devices. Our implementation of this circuit to evolve DTE, D-tagatose 3-epimerase can be considered as a proof-of-work. The operons in this circuit is alternatively forward and reverse, in order to minimize read through of terminators and to prevent homologous recombination of the plasmid itself. As this circuit will be present in chassis cells under severe growth pressure, cells could use extreme methods to maximize its survival. This design is meant to prevent such things from happening.
Selecting Circuit
We have explored the potential to use a series of antibiotic resistance genes as quantitative reporter, which their expression levels are converted into different growth rates of chassis organisms. In order to make the characterization data reusable, we have substituted pPsi promoter to pLac. pLac is a more characterized promoter than D-psicose induced one. We hope later iGEM teams could be inspired or refer to our data when they are designing their own directed evolution system or implementing their own growth pressure. Three antibiotic resistance protein for kanamycin, streptomycin and ampicillin are characterized. In summary, kanamycin achieves overall best performance owing to a wider dynamic range. Streptomycin has similar mechanisms as kanamycin, which the antibiotics bind to bacterial ribosome, but SmrR, the corresponding resistance gene, is less efficient in fighting against streptomycin, thus its linear range is limited. For ampicillin, its mechanism differs from the above two by blocking cell wall (peptidoglycan, in specific) formation. In opposite to SmrR, the resistance protein, AmpR, is too strong so that very low level of expression"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Why is the MircoBeagle a useful device?
There could be many different possible uses for our device, as the pathogen detection mechanism we are using is modular and can easily be tailored to individual needs. This is achieved by swapping out the gene coding the cell surface-displayed binding domain to suit your needs. We envision the MircoBeagle being used for testing blood samples, detection of heavy metals and, in the application that is our main inspiration, detection of pathogens in water samples.
Why Water Testing is so important
Detecting pathogens in water is a really important application as 3.4 million people a year die from water related diseases [1] , [2] .
768 million people in the world do not have access to safe water [3] . This is roughly one in ten of the world's population, the majority of which is caused by faecal contamination: poor sewage systems that flow back into the water supply [4] .
The issue is actually more complex and subtle than just direct health problems, as the knock on economic problems that result from poor sanitation are also damaging. Lack of water, sanitation and hygiene costs Sub-Saharan African countries more in lost GDP than the entire continent gets in development aid [5] . The figures are shocking and we as a team want to create something that may, in the future, help to reduce those numbers.
While many organizations are creating new, appropriate water purification devices and systems, we realize these will only be as good as the measurement technologies available to test their performance will allow. This measurement bottleneck is particularly critical in infrastructure-poor areas with no or limited access to the molecular biology labs typically used to assay for water-borne pathogens.
While many teams around the world are seeking new ways of transporting chassis and bio-devices in facile, safe, and reliable manners (e.g., through capsules or spores), we felt that efforts to develop modular pathogen detection systems were lacking. Once effective transport strategies are established, we hope to have a detection system ready-to-go for on-site water testing and diagnostics.
To address this issue using a novel synthetic biological approach, the MircoBeagle was born!
Below is a summary of our Device development strategy...
Phase I
We split our project into self-contained phases, to help better organise ourselves, but also lay out a road map for our own future work within iGEM and beyond. Our two devices include a device for activating a reporter in response to membrane stress (Device 1) and a device for binding to a physical target at the cell surface and thereby activate the membrane-stress-reporter (Device 2).

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 virus between ferrets’ by Herfst et al., 2012
A critical publication from 2012 caused a disturbing sensation at this time: A research group examined which part of the genomic information of a mutated A/H5N1 virus was in charge of its previously non-present air transmissibility (Herfst et al., 2012). In addition to the critical content of the publication, communication was also a major problem here. The worrying title “Airborne transmission of influenza A/H5N1 virus between ferrets” alone quickly drew the attention of the media to this publication which led to concerns and much public criticism of scientists. Such cases can rapidly lead to panic to which the government can respond with stricter regulation of science. The limitation of free science poses a real danger in the Internet age as information and panic can spread around the world in seconds. That is why we appeal to you as responsible scientists:
Ask yourselves: How does the public perceive you as scientists?
It is important to communicate to the public that every scientist is aware of their research and has carried out risk assessment. The one who works on research must be the one who can best assess the risks of the research and moreover communicate them properly. This is a fundamental part of generating public trust and supporting free research.
Self-Regulation vs. Foreign-Regulation of Science
""Researchers are now facing a dilemma: If they refrained from research whose results could possibly be misused, the scientific progress in medicine and technology would be done for. On the other hand, researchers are due to their expertise responsible for weighing up the risks and the opportunities of their work: “Scientists have the duty to minimize the risks of dual use in their work” says the Robert Koch Institute."" – Dr. Manuela Lenzen, Philosophy and Science Journalism
There are two obvious ways of regulating science:
Regulation through politics
Self-regulation by the scientists themselves
Regulation by politics includes the problem that politicians do not necessarily possess enough expertise on science-relevant topics to correctly interpret concrete situations. This could lead to overregulation and restriction of free science as they could overrate dangers and risks due to wrong assessment. In addition, they have to represent the view of the public which can be easily influenced by panic. As they must secure their voters, they speak out more willingly against free science in order to calm the public and gain trust.
The scientist himself can best assess the risks of his own research.
This is why self-regulation by scientists acting as their own experts might be the better solution. But self-regulation only works if every scientist is aware of DUR"

Fungal Sensing
When we designed BananaGuard, we wanted it to be effective, safe and specific in fighting Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (foc). This part describes how our product is specific in only targeting this fungus and not affecting other soil fungi.
The pathogenic fungus F. oxysporum secretes fusaric acid, a toxin needed to invade the banana plant via the roots. Pseudomonas putida, which serves us as a platform for the development of our biological control agent. Here the engineered Pseudomonas putida needs to be able to sense fusaric acid and activate gene expression accordingly. Resistance to fusaric acid is also crucial in this process and we found that Pseudomonas putida already possesses a good base level of resistance [1]. To be able to transfer our system to different platforms, we aim to introduce fusaric acid resistance in Escherichia coli.
Fusaric Acid Sensing
Overview
Resistance to fusaric acid is found in several microorganisms, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [3] and Pseudomonas putida [4]. This resistance to the toxic compound is due to a fusaric acid efflux pump, which pumps the acid out of the cell. After doing a literature search, we found out that there are a few proteins encoded in the genome of P. putida KT2440 which should confer fusaric acid resistance based on in silico prediction. The corresponding genes"

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," market research company Allied Market Research[15]. Governments all around the world, from the United States to China, are increasingly acknowledging the immense potential of biotechnology, and are increasing investments in an effort to develop biotechnology and its related fields. China, for example, has identified synthetic biology as one of the priority research areas of the country, and its Ministry of Sciences and Technology has invested heavily in funding schemes and initiatives concerning synthetic biology. Perhaps more convincingly the importance the Chinese government places on synthetic biology development, synthetic biology was recently identified as a key industry for China’s Five-Year Plan (which was recently published in 2016)[16].
Singapore (a notably different country from China) has similarly invested $25 million (about USD 18.2 million) in its recently-launched “Synthetic Biology Research and Development Programme”, which includes groundbreaking projects ranging from exploring uncharted biosynthetic pathways for the production of medical cannabinoids, to engineering microorganisms that are able to convert readily available and renewable substrates into valuable organic compounds. In 2015, Singapore set-up its first research centre dedicated to synthetic biology, SynCTI, at the National University of Singapore with the aim of anchoring Singapore as a leading Synthetic Biology Hub in the world. In 2016, the Singapore Consortium for Synthetic Biology, SINERGY, was launched in order to create a vibrant and globally connected bio-based economy in Singapore [17].
Likewise in Australia, where the Australian Council of Learned Academies recently published a outlook report on the prospects, opportunities, and issues associated with synthetic biology [18]. Synthetic biology was identified as critical to Australian economic development - from complementing and supporting the continuous growth of industries in which Australia has been traditionally strong in, i.e. agriculture, to providing new opportunities for further research and development, in the fields of health and medicine, and the environment. The focus on synthetic biology has been welcomed by the Australian government, whose Research Infrastructure Investment Plan supports research initiatives and studies into synthetic biology.
Compared to chemically synthesized products, bio-manufacturing offers a competitive advantage for producing products that are both economically viable and ecologically sustainable. An appealing option nowadays, as both consumers and governments are changing consumption patterns and policy regulations to take into account the negative externality that is environmental pollution. An example of the competitive advantage in environmental sustainability that synthetic biology can offer is optogenetic regulation. This new tool in synthetic biology provides the potential to eliminate chemical-dependent control, removing the carbon footprint from chemical production and waste treatment and further enhancing its environmental sustainability.
Synthetic biology is an emerging market with many techniques and tools that have yet to mature"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"

The protocols for fabricating microfluidic devices with the Neptune workflow are as follows:  Specify:
1.) Come up with a microfluidic chip idea!
2.) Write the idea out in terms of Liquid Flow Relations using the provided library of microfluidic components in the form of the User Constraints File.
[**optional**] Adjust the parameters of microfluidic components the UCF to fit the needs of the experiment. This enables rapid prototyping in that if one component needs to be edited, a change in one number can adjust all instances of a component on all subsequent designs!
3.) Let μShroomMapper convert the LFR to the more descriptive microfluidic language, MINT.
Design:
[**optional**] If necessary, make any precise edits to the MINT file (similar to editing parameters on the UCF, this is a method of rapidly prototyping designs; changing one number here will change the specifications of one specific instance of the microfluidic component of the design)
1.) Let Fluigi convert the MINT to the blueprint files depicting your microfluidic chip!
Build:
1.) Specify the volume you'd like to pull/push fluids with your controlling servo-syringe pumps
2.) Specify the precision with which you'd like to pull/push fluids with your controlling servo-syringe pumps
3.) Select and map which provided combinations of servos and syringe go to the pumps on your microfluidic design
4.) Use the provided ordering list to order the parts required to build the control infrastructure
Assembly:
1.) Follow the instructions on the Assembly user interface page to assemble the control infrastructure of your microfluidic device, using a 3D printer
2.) Follow the instructions on the Assembly user interface page to assemble your microfluidic device, using a CNC mill
3.) Follow the instructions on the Assembly user interface page to connect the control infrastructure to"
SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour11_-_-_TEXT.html,"-tours do a great job at introducing the reader to the project. However, users who want details are left to fend for themselves in a jungle of pages. Our fix: Allowing our readers the freedom to choose between a quick and a detailed tour by including all pages in our tour. The result is an interactive wiki tour, which sets up a choice between digging deeper to detailed pages or fast-forward to the next major chapter. The two buttons (on the bottom of the screen) even have a small text explaining what you can expect to read on the coming pages. Also, take the time to click on our photos; this brings forward a detailed figure description.
Quicker navigation: Tour buttons and menu always visible
Additional ease of navigation was created by ensuring that tour-buttons and menu are always available - even when scrolling through the text! While searching for a topic of interest, a traditional menu as a means of a shortcut may be desirable. Such a menu allows users to access a specific page that they might wish to revisit. Perhaps a certain page sprung to mind after completing the tour, perhaps a user accesses our wiki looking for a particular subject. The menu makes such personalized experiences easier and more user-friendly.
Tooltips: Simplifying the text
To reach broader audiences, we wanted our wiki articles to be easily understandable without compromising the scientific aspect. To solve this, we added tooltips TooltipsAll tooltips are marked with bold, blue text to draw attention. to many of our pages. The tooltips enable us to maintain short and precise texts with great scientific value, while explaining some of the more exotic words and abbreviations. We also use tooltips when quoting a source without cluttering the text. Source: A reference to our source will be placed here
Stay on track: Many external sites are shown as in-page dialogs
Sometimes we link to external content, such as our submitted parts. These links will open inside the page using a dialog box, which can be easily closed by clicking the escape button in the top right corner. This helps users stay on track when browsing our wiki.
The best part
As with everything else in iGEM regi, the entire structure and underlying HTML code for this website is open source and easy to access for everyone. Just press 'View source' in the top of the page or hit F12 to access the source codes. This is a great way for future iGEM teams to get inspiration and the tools to build great wikis, and was one of our main goals with this wiki, to give the community some tools to make good looking, easy to navigate wikis.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 4: On and off-target effects of Munich crRNAs on different bacterial targets. On and off-target effects of designed crRNAs on different bacterial targets. A) crRNA 1-3 yield 7 on-target hits (blue) on the E. coli DH5α genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in 10 million per site. B) crRNA 1-3 yield off-target probabilities below 1 in 10 million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome. C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the E. coli DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the E. coli DH5α genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ (the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output, for the four simulations (Figure 5). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however, is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.

Postcards (dusseldorf)
Team Dusseldorf suggested an artistic collaboration which was sharing postcards with other teams.
So, we decided to participate with a pharaohnic design so the world can see the beauty of the old Egyptian arts.
Comic books (ouc–China)
Team ouc –china made a wonderful comic book about synthetic biology
that deserved to be translated into Arabic language and to be shared with our collegues.
Video (iGEM TEC CEM 2018)
Instead of shooting our own video for the jamboree
we found it easier to take part in team IGEM TEC CEM 2018’s collaboration to shoot a part of a song in our lab and integrate the videos of the collaborating teams to make a universal clip for the songs they chose.

Alternatively, the repressor could be in the form of a protein that is not a transcription factor.  Rather, this repressor protein could be designed to target the gene product of G, thus blocking its activity, or even the activator A by inhibiting its regulatory effects on gene G.  Such regulation would thus occur on the level of protein-protein interactions.  Along this train of thought, it is even possible to devise regulatory systems that affect gene G on multiple levels for enhanced regulation.

Overview
In our project we aimed to construct a biofilm which will convert CO to CO2 biologically. Biofilms can be defined as the group of cells firmly united with the help of lipids, protein, DNA and polysaccharides and they can be used for beneficial applications [1] but the main obstacle in the case of biofilm formation is to keep the cell growth under control. We wanted our biofilm to work as a CO filter, due to that reason we designed a quorum sensing (QS) system to control the number of cells and to characterize the activity of biofilm better.
Cell population density changes as the bacteria grow and divide in the biofilm and QS can be defined as the regulation of gene expression during this change. As the cell density increases bacteria starts to release molecules named as autoinducers and according to the concentration of autoinducers gene expression is altered[2]. Eventually bacterial growth will be controlled. In our project we aimed to modify E.coli to synthesize its own QS signals, detect the cell density and prevent the cell division.
How The System Works ?
At the beginning of our QS system there is a constitutive promoter J23116 which is used for the constitutive production of LuxI, an autoinducer synthetase for AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone). Function of LuxI is to synthesize 3OC6HSL (3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone).  When 3OC6HSL is produced, it will form a complex with LuxR which is synthesized according to the activity of LuxPL promoter. After that point we aimed LuxR-3OC6HSL complex to increase the activity of LuxPR promoter.  Finally LuxPR activity determines the amount of LasR and when PLasR promoter is activated MinC, a cell division inhibitor can be synthesized. Eventually, cell division stops after MinC reaches its critical concentration.

Wearing Lab Coats
The IIT Delhi iGEM team whole-heartedly collaborated with Berlin team. Berlin team was working on the affordable, practical and effective diagnostic of the widespread third world parasitic disease -Tapeworm Infection. Since India is one of the countries where millions of people are infected by this parasite, IIT Delhi directed Berlin team to a suitable site. It was a hospital in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh where many cases of tapeworm were reported. After the successful extraction and lysis of the Tapeworm eggs, Berlin team obtained RNA molecules of the T. Solium species of the Tapeworm. IIT Delhi further assisted them by providing our own lab as -20 and -80 degrees centigrade refrigerators and other required lab apparatus were not available in the above-mentioned hospital. Sequencing of the RNA was also done and all the samples were shipped to them.
This was not only constricted to iGEM collaboration as we further plan to adopt this technology for affordable diagnostic of tapeworm infection which is otherwise done using fecal inspection using a microscope. This would help in timely detection of infection and thus would save lives of many people. Following this, Berlin team provided us the protease stains without Degradation Tags required by us to generate oscillations in the form of a square.

What is the iGEM competetion?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is a world wide annual event in synthetic biology. Students start, fund and conduct their own research project. In September, the teams will meet at the Giant iGEM Jamboree at MIT, Boston, and present their work. Apart from the experimental work, the teams have to consider ethical issues of their project and do outreach activities.

What is Project SpaceMoss?
Project SpaceMoss conducts research on the possibility of sending genetically modified moss to Mars.
How Did Team SpaceMoss Start?
Team SpaceMoss started with posters that popped up at Copenhagen University saying only one thing: ""SpaceMoss"" and a meeting place. We were all intrigued and showed up to the information meeting where we realized that this could be the potential to be involved in a fascinating project that could change the way people view Synthetic Biology and Astrophysics. The original idea for SpaceMoss was made by members from the Copenhagen 2013 iGEM team. Their wiki can be found here: 2013 Team's wiki . We were then told to send in our CVs, a letter of motivation and to fill out a personality test. These were reviewed and a team of 8 people was put together based on our capabilities and talents. We were then divided into three sub groups of those responsible for lab, project management and outreach.
Why Moss?
Moss is a very sturdy plant that can already handle rough conditions. Therefore, it has a higher change of surviving harsh conditions on Mars. Research in transformation of moss has been on-going for years at Center for Synthetic Biology whereas other teams and institutes often use E.coli or Yeast - one benefit of using moss it that it consumes carbondioxide and creates oxygen.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Description#Specificity_-_-_TEXT.html,"fluorescein into the BBMV's the presence of an active Cry toxin can principally be detected as followed: the Cry toxins will bind to their highly specific receptors 5 and consequently create holes into the phospholipid double membrane layer, see Figure 1b. After this event, the fluorophores leak out of the vesicles due to diffusion, which can be measured as an increase in fluorescence, see Figure 1c. This method has been proven to work for the activity of Cry3Aa on Leptinotarsa decemlineata 6 . Rausell et al. only demonstrated how the magnitude of the fluorescence increase links to toxicity, but this method has its limitations. BBMV's have the disadvantage of being unstable and undergoing degradation 7 . In other words, measurements on BBMV's can be influenced by spontaneous breaking of the vesicles. In our project, we took this into account by relating toxicity activity to a kinetic value.
The increase of fluorescence due to fluorophore leaking can be attributed to dequenching Dequenching refers to any process which increases the fluorescence intensity of a given substance. . 6-Carboxyfluorescein is a self-quenching fluorophore. At a high concentration 6-carboxyfluorescein forms dimers. Because of dimer-dimer and dimer-monomer interactions, the fluorescence of a carboxyfluorescein molecule decreases drastically 8 . The vesicles created in our study contain a high concentration of fluorophores, which results in self-quenching behavior. When the fluorophores leak out of the vesicles, the local concentration of fluorophores decreases. Hence, dequenching occurs and the fluorescence increases.
Analysis of Brush Border Membrane Vesicles
To visualize the presence of BBMV's, images were made with the use of TEMTransmission Electron Microscopy . This was done in collaboration with the iGEM team from Delft

Figure 2 shows the vesicles - round shapes with sizes between the 100 nm and 300 nm. To gain more information about the composition of the samples that are visualized above, dynamic light scattering was performed. The dynamic light scattering results (Figure 3) give information about the size distribution of the particles that are present in the solution.

Al snel werden de vrij beschikbare organische bouwstenen gering en de steeds complexere structuren begonnen actief met elkaar te concurreren voor bronnen en plaats. Leven ontstond en daarmee ook de Darwiniaanse evolutie. Het concept van leven bleek krachtig te zijn en transformeerde onze planeet snel in wat ET gemakkelijk zou kunnen beschrijven als een enorme bioreactor. Talloze rondes van mutatie en selectie over miljarden jaren hebben geleid tot de prachtige biologische diversiteit en complexiteit die wij vandaag kunnen bewonderen. Leven lijkt probleemloos te kunnen aanpassen aan zelfs de meest onvriendelijke en barre omstandigheden door slimme oplossingen te vinden, toch indien het genoeg tijd heeft om dit te doen. Dit is waar ons project begint. Dit jaar streeft het iGEM team van Heidelberg ernaar de enorme kracht van Darwiniaanse evolutie te benutten om de ontwikkeling van biomoleculen te vergemakkelijken ten voordele van de mens. Hiervoor zullen we bouwen op de PACE (phage-assisted continuous evolution) methode die evolutie mianturiseert en versnelt en het leidt naar een vooropgesteld doel. PACE koppelt de overleving van snel muterende fagen die een scaffold eiwit dragen aan gerichte selectie onder E. coli gastheren. Hierdoor kunnen proteïnen met gewenste eigenschappen ontwikkeld worden in uren in plaats van in eeuwen. Om het enorme potentieel te benutten, willen we een uitgebreide en gestandaardiseerde toolbox ontwikkelen met bijhorende software die het mogelijk maakt PACE te gebruiken voor diverse klassen van proteïnen, waaronder enzymen voor farmaceutische en biomateriaal productie.

In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping"

Cornell iGEM benefits from the contributions of 21 undergraduates, three graduate advisers, one post-doctoral adviser, four Cornell faculty advisers, and one outside faculty adviser—Dr. Jeff Gralnick of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Our diverse team of undergraduates represents eight majors and three colleges within Cornell University. By building a team with varied and complementary expertise, we are able to design and carry out projects that extend beyond the Petri dish, into the machine shop—and even get a touch of solder.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to commonly used specific antibiotic drugs exceeded 50% in many countries. Furthermore, there are limitations in effective oral treatment options for some common community-acquired infections in several countries, and that there remain few, if any, treatment options for some common severe and health-care associated infections in many places.
High rates of MRSA imply that treatment for suspected or  verified severe S. aureus infections, such as common skin and wound infections, must rely on secondline drugs in many countries, and that standard prophylaxis with first-line drugs for orthopaedic and other surgical procedures will have limited effect in many settings. Second-line drugs for S. aureus are more expensive; also, they have severe side-effects for which monitoring during treatment is advisable, increasing costs even further.
Unfortunately, there is at present no global consensus on methodology and data collection for Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria surveillance. Routine surveillance in most countries is often based on samples taken from patients with severe infections – particularly infections associated with health care, and those in which first-line treatment has failed. Community-acquired infections are almost certainly underrepresented among samples, leading to gaps in coverage of important patient groups.
It is urgent to develop effective implementation strategies in  order to curtail the emergence and spread of AR, and to evaluate the effect of interventions.
Antibiotic resistance has a significant adverse impact on clinical  outcomes and leads to higher costs due to consumption of  health-care resources. Patients with infections caused by bacteria resistant to a specific antibacterial drug generally have an increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and death, and consume more healthcare resources, than patients infected with the same bacteria not demonstrating the resistance pattern in question.
Although surveillance on antibiotic resistant bacteria has been undertaken for many years in a number of high-income countries, there are still large gaps in knowledge about the status of surveillance capacities worldwide, particularly in resource-limited settings.
Available data are insufficient to estimate the wider societal impact and economic implications when effective treatment for an infection is completely lost as a result of resistance to all available drugs. The overall health and economic burden resulting from acquired antibiotic resistant bacteria cannot be fully assessed with the presently available data; new methodologies are needed to more precisely assess the total impact of resistance, to better inform health policies and to prioritize the deployment of resources. However, even admitting the lack of reliable information on the financials, the overall cost is highly burden to all nations, even further to the less developed countries. For example, the yearly cost to the US health system alone has been estimated at US $21 to $34 billion dollars, accompanied by more than 8 million additional days in hospital. Because antibiotic"

Expert Interview with Sherryl Broverman
“You get your blood pressure tested every time you go to the doctor: height, weight, blood pressure, body temperature. Why not HIV?” -Sherryl Broverman Ph.D
We asked a professor who has done work with young women in Muhuru Bay, a small lake town in Kenya on Lake Victoria, to sit down and talk with us about how an RDT might be beneficial for the region, and how it may not be. Overall, Dr. Broverman was excited at the prospect of cheap reliable diagnostic tests that don’t require refrigeration being introduced to the region and offered some serious insight into how the test may need to be modified to help the most people.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz"
