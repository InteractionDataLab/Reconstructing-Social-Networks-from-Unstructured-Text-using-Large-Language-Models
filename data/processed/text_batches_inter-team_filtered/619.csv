KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Internal#Ultra#Test5_-_-_TEXT.html," amount of Polymerases that passes through a given position in the DNA per time unit and is essentially the transcription rate at a particular location on the DNA (open wetware http://openwetware.org/wiki/PoPS). It remained difficult to measure in vivo but Kelly et al have introduced a way to measure the activity of promoters using an in vivo standard, promoter J23101. This gave rise to a new unit: Relative activity of promoter (RPU)$=\frac{PoPS_{phi}}{PoPS_{J23101}}$. By using relative units, the variability due to equipment and conditions was drastically decreased. The PoPS of J23101 was found to be 0.03.
As our constitutive promoter, we used J23114. On the iGEM website we found that the J constitutive promoter family had been characterized using RFP and we found that J23101 had a strength of 1791 au and J23114 had a strength of 256 au with J23112 as standard in this measurement. We conclude that J23114 has a PoPS of 0.00429. The iGEM team of UNIPV-Pavia 2010 also measured the activity of J23114 in E. coli in LB with a high copy number. The RPU is equal to around 0.05. This means that J23114 has a PoPS of 0.0015. The two values are of the same magnitude but we take the smaller one, since we can not find the references of the first measurement and to play on safe.
The strength of the pLuxPR promoter has been measured relatively to pLacIQ by iGEM Tokyo_Tech 2010. They found a value for pLuxPR of 550 and for pLacIQ of 390. pLacIQ has also been measured by iGEM Upssala university 2012 and was found to have a RPU of 0.04 giving it a PoPS of 0.0012. From these values we calculate the PoPS of pLuxPR to be 550/390 * 0.0012 =0.00169 PoPS. We can also find a leak term in their measurements. Without AHL and LuxR, the pLuxPR was active and had a RPU of 10. This means that the leaking promoter has a PoPS of $\frac{10}{390} {\cdot} 0.040 {\cdot} 0.03 = 3.077 {\cdot} 10^{-5} PoPS$.

What we can do in our project should follow the rules they permit, and they manage all instruments and chemicals, especially for dangerous and toxic ones, in all labs. The ESC is to be informed on the basis of our project and on what we are doing and plan to do. Therefore, the ESC has permitted our project at first.    In addition, we do our wetlab activities in Common Instrument Rooms where are in charge of Biomedical Engineering Lab of Dr. Chih-Sheng Lin and Applied Microbiology & Biochemistry Lab of Dr. Ching-Ping Tseng. They would check whether the rules are followed or not everyday, and every time someone starts to work in these rooms, he or she should take down his or her student numbers in a log. Besides, when someone uses a common instrument, he or she should record the purpose for the instrument.    Briefly, under these requirements, the progress for our project would not raise any possible safety issues.
Safety Issues for Researcher, Public and Environment
As above we mentioned, we did our work under the control, so in fact, we did not get hurt during working. Our work also is harmless to the public and the environment. Since after we had finished our progress for a day or a step, we always dealt with the contaminated trash carefully. This is the most important in our work.    We only worked with non-hazardous, non-infectious, commonly used and accepted bacteria strains. All work was conducted in a biosafety level S1 laboratory. Rules of best microbiological practices were applied.Almost Biobricks we used are from MIT, and only somethings new we made and modified from previous Biobricks in 2009 iGEM works ourselves. Actually, these new and old Biobricks are very safe.

We aim to solve both problems by bringing the price of the device as low as possible while still maintaining high sensitivity and accuracy. About 44% of the survey participants indicated that they would pay between $50-70 USD for this device. By optimising the materials and size of the device, we have currently reduced the price to $50 USD, with an additional $13 USD for the biological reagents needed to run the 5 reactions contained on each chip.

Award: Silver medal
In many developing countries, people depend on reasonably priced and conveniently available street food. However, lack of action taken by governments to regulate street food vendors has led to the prevalence of severe street food-related illnesses. One of the primary microbial contaminants in street food is E. coli O157:H7, which acts by secreting the Shiga-like toxin (SLT). Currently, there is no detection method for SLT outside of a lab setting, thus putting the consumers of foods at risk. Our project aims to develop a device that would be used by street vendors and restaurant owners to verify the safety of their products. Through our device, we exploit the binding of Gb3 to subunit B of the Shiga toxin, and compare the migration pattern of the bound Gb3-subunit B complex to a non bound subunit B. A shift in the migration pattern on a PAGE gel will occur when Gb3 is bound, indicating the presence of the toxin in the food sample. If no shift occurs in the SLT migration pattern, this implies the absence of the toxin within the sample, and reflects the safety status of the food.7
Our improvements
Shiga toxin is an exotoxin that consists of two subunits. Subunit B binds to Gb3 receptor expressed in the surface of target cells and permits the entry of subunit A, which inhibits protein synthesis.4 2016 Team NYU Abu Dhabi exploited the binding of Gb3 to subunit                 B to detect for the presence of STEC. Their prototype compared the migration pattern of a bound Gb3-subunit                 B complex to that of free subunit B using a PAGE gel. Their device was estimated to take 45 minutes and their                 prototyping process ran into several issues that negatively impacted the specificity, affordability, and accessibility of the product. However, based on feedback from food vendors, we discovered that very few individuals would wait for so long to obtain results. Since they also"

so by taking
$$t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{d_{GFP}}$$
from experimental curves, we are able to retrieve
$$d_{GFP} = 4.9 . 10^{-3} min^{-1}$$. For very low initial concentrations of initial AHL and considering degradation, we have
$$ \frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}][AHLi]^2e^{-2d_{AHL}t}}{K_{d4}K_{d3}}-d_{GFP}[GFP].$$
We find
$$ [GFP]=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}][AHLi]^2}{K_{d4}K_{d3}(d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL})}(e^{-2d_{AHL}t}-e^{-d_{GFP}t}).$$
This curve has a maximum at
$$ t_{max}=\frac{1}{d_{GFP}-2d_{AHL}}ln\big(\frac{d_{GFP}}{2d_{AHL}}\big).$$
This way we can find from experimental curves $$d_{AHL}=4,0.10^{-3} min^{-1}$$
This AHL degradation rate is alumped parameter between internal and external degradation rates, equivalent to
$$d_{AHLext}+\alpha d_{AHLint}$$
where α is the fraction of the volume occupied by cells in the whole culture. From that on we could find reasonable values for internal and external AHL degradation rates.
Finally the curves simulated by our model with these parameters fit the experiments quite well:

Wild-type yeast strains BY4741 and BY4743 can barely grow on this growth media, while synX cannot grow, which means that synX is unable to survive such high concentration of cadmium ions. The results clearly demonstrate that these mutated yeast strains have an improved phenotype-increased resistance to cadmium ions.
Another assay was conducted on SC solid media containing 4.8 mM copper ions. Results are shown in the picture below.
Fig.3-3 Experimental groups: S5, S6, S7, and S8; control groups: synX, BY4741, and BY4743. Yeast cells were picked up from single colonies on solid growth media and diluted by 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 times.
The experimental groups also have a survival advantage over control groups. From this picture, S5, S6, and S8 are able to develop a large single colony after diluted to 100000 times on SC solid media containing 4.8 mM copper ions. S7 is not as tough as the other three experimental groups, but it still shows higher resistance to copper ions compared with BY4741 when diluted to 100 times. BY4743 can hardly grow on this media, while synX cannot grow, which means that synX is unable to tolerate such high concentration of copper ions. The results clearly showcase that the mutated yeast strains have an improved phenotype-increased resistance to copper ions.
Survival Rate Experiments
This experiment aims to quantify mutated yeast strains’ ability to survive in copper or cadmium ions solution. Same amount of yeast cells are added to the copper or cadmium ions solution at the beginning; after that, a certain amount of this solution is taken out at regular intervals, namely 10min, 30min, 1h, and 2h, then diluted and plated on YPD solid media. After yeast colonies emerge from the growth media, the number of the colonies are counted and recorded to calculate the survival rate of this strain in this solution.
We choose the seemingly best strain, S1, as the experimental strain to test its ability to survive high concentration of cadmium compared with the control strain, synX. Results are shown in the pictures and tables below.
Fig.3-4 The left: Colony numbers of synX and S1. Experiments were repeated for three times. Cadmium concentration: 5mM for the first and the third experiments; "

Why deal with cadmium?
The BacMan project is focused mainly on sequestering the heavy metal cadmium from contaminated soils, however with the many other heavy metals known to contaminate agricultural land, such as Mercury or Arsenic, it is necessary for us to justify our decision.
Cadmium Exposure
Cadmium is one of the most toxic heavy metals to which the environment can be exposed.  Smoking is a major source of cadmium exposure to humans, however the main source of contamination to food is the usage of cadmium containing fertilisers and sewage sludge on agricultural land used for crops and vegetables (Jarup and Akesson. 2009).
The level of human exposure is dependent on factors such as dietary habits, and contamination of agricultural land. Exposure is significantly higher in China and Japan than in Europe and the US due to the high intake of rice grown on soil contaminated by local polluting industries (Nordberg et al. 2007).  As well as food, water from rivers and wells can also be seriously contaminated. Cadmium is present in most foods however is particularly concentrated in molluscs, crabs and other shellfish, as well as tubular plants and root vegetables; cadmium is also concentrated in offal products such as kidney and liver.
As well as humans, cadmium exposure has implications for other species, with recent studies revealing cadmium exposure has serious effects on embryonic development of grazing animals (Nandi et al. 2009).
Cadmium can cause renal damage

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Brad_-_-_TEXT.html," a readout signal showing if the biosensor is working when not in use, i.e that the cells are still alive and have not lost their biosensor phenotypes. This can make them difficult to use, as well as market, since their viability comes into question as well as leading to false negatives/positives. Biosensors which rely on expression of a reporter signal may also suffer from unobserved activation due to weak or inconstant induction. For this section of the project, as an improvement on a part by the Tokyo Tech team, we aim to produce a biobrick compatible part which is able to constitutively express a reporter signal prior to activation (to show that it is functioning) and to amplify a weak or inconsistent induction signal by permanently switching from an [OFF] to [ON] state after induction.
Background Information
Expression of the E. coli type 1 fimbriae gene is tightly regulated and phase dependent, i.e expression is either completely [ON] or [OFF] >>FimB FimE fimbrae control - Klemm 1986<<. This change in expression is controlled by the action of two proteins FimB and FimE which independently act upon a 300bp promoter region upstream of the fimbriae gene. The 300bp promoter region is inverted to either activate or suppress expression >> Roles of FimB FimE in site specific inversion - McClain 1991<<. Typical gene regulation mechanisms rely on up or down regulation of a promoter from a baseline expression, the fimbriae mechanism of ‘ALL’ or ‘NONE’ makes it a useful tool for synthetic biology applications. While the FimB protein inverts the promoter back and forth between [ON] and [OFF] states the FimE protein permanently inverts the promoter from [ON] to [OFF]. This inversion can be used to amplify weak or inconsistent induction signals. The part we are producing is a combination of the 2015 Tokyo Tech part (BBa_K1632013, BBa_K1632007) and the Voight lab 2007 part (BBa_J64718) quorum sensing RhlI an autoinducer synthesis protein which produces C4-HSL. The part by Tokyo Tech used FimE in combination with GFP to switch from an [ON] to [OFF] state, we have produced a construct where in the [ON] state the non-fluorescense based reporter protein eforRed (Uppsala 2011 BBa_K592012) is expressed. In the [OFF] state"

Solution
In order to combat excess fluoridation of water in third world countries, we envision solutions that utilize the recently discovered fluoride riboswitch, a structured piece of RNA that kind interact with fluoride and regulate the expression of a downstream gene. We envision technologies utilizing fluoride riboswitches that can be used to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in water. We think these strategies can be used in cell-free and cell based systems. However, before we can work on developing these technologies we first needed to better characterize the responsiveness of fluoride riboswitches and develop a way to select for riboswitches with a higher responsiveness to fluoride.
Introduction
The Impacts of Excess Fluoride:
Fluoride is present in all bodies of water. Within the oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater, the mineral is existent and the extent to which fluoride is present depends on the amount of sediments or volcanic rocks being eroded in the area. It is when fluoride concentrations are at the toxic level when health concerns can arise. The FDA recommends that fluoride concentrations in water do not exceed 0.7mg/mL, while the World Health Organization (WHO) limit is 1.5mg/L, and the Environmental Protection Agency designation for contaminated water is 4 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations at or above 1 mg/kg of body weight are deemed poisonous. Ingesting this amount in one sitting requires immediate medical attention. While constantly being exposed to 10 mg/L to 6 mg of fluoride everyday can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, in which the teeth and bones decay and deform. More severely, doses above 4.5 mg/kg body weight can cause developmental and reproductive concerns. Therefore fluoride concentrations can affect the growth and the IQ of people. In countries like China, India, and Sri Lanka, water sources are decentralized and residents in some areas experience concentrations of fluoride as high as 30 mg/L (Figure 1).

First
In our days, science alienation is still a big problem that transcends borders. Japan suffers of a similar alienation that poses a barrier towards further advancement of science and technology. In biology, genetic modification epitomizes the magnitude of this problem among people who regard synthetic technologies and sciences as “something strange”, or “something dangerous” in general. Whereas genetically modified foods are sold on the counter, consumers don't pick or choose food with labels. This results from the scarcity or lack of information on genetic modification on the part of the general public. Since a more rapid advancement of the field of life sciences is expected in the near future leading to more complicated technologies, information and communication will also become critical.  Moreover, while we benefit from technology, this is increasingly becoming “a black box”. Unknown technology is not familiar any longer.
Accordingly, to let people in Japan and in the world know about more information of genetic modification, we tried activities below.
A briefing for high school students
1.At the open campus in August (2010/08/10)
For high school students and their parents, we held a booth at KIT-Kyoto. In this booth, we introduced iGEM and our activities. To make the lecture simple, we tried to avoid using technical terms.
Besides, we displayed model organisms genetically modified, for example, Yeast, Silkworm, Drosophila and E.coli.  Students could touch the silkworms and see Drosophila mutants, both organisms were genetically modified. We aimed to make their understanding clear, and make them have a feeling of familiarity for genetic modification.
There were about 200 students who came to our booth. They told us that their ideas and conceptions about biology were broadened by looking closely at the model organisms.

Place the pipet tip into a 5 mL LB media tube. If needed add appropriate antibiotic to the solution. Amp was used for our construct. Incubate tubes at 37°C overnight but ensure that it doesn’t stay too long or the antibiotic can become deactivated leading to contamination.
Restriction Digest
In a 1.5 mL tube add the following components and make alterations based on DNA concentrations so that the tube can have a final volume of 30 uL. Add approximately 1 ug of DNA, 1 uL of each Restriction Enzyme, 3 uL of 10x Cut buffer. Incubate tube at appropriate temperature (usually 37 °C) for 1 hour. Then if using this DNA right away deactivate the enzymes by bringing the temperature up to 70°C for 15 minutes or longer.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the polysilicate layer, the nutrient supply becomes limited by diffusion, which can eventually result in cell death. When we can guarantee that cell death occurs as a result of the polysilicate layer, further sterilization methods become unnecessary.
Based on the results, it appears that after an hour most of the cells with a coating of polysilicate are not viable anymore. Our hypothesis could be correct therefore and diffusion could become limiting because of the polysilicate layer. However, more research is necessary to be fully sure about this.
The coating can form an easy and cheap solution to sterilize the biolenses. Furthermore, the microlenses will remain intact, which is crucial to be able to use them in applications, such as in solar panels and microscopes. However, there are major drawbacks to this method. First of all, there is still a minor chance that cells are able to survive with the coating. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the cells are not entirely coated with polysilicate and can therefore survive. Also, no research has been done into what happens to the cells when the coating breaks. For example, it might be possible that the cells can start growing again.
Autoclave
Autoclaving is used to sterilize surgical equipment, laboratory instruments, pharmaceutical items, and other materials. It can sterilize solids, liquids, hollows, and instruments of various shapes and sizes. Steam and/or pressure is used to kill the bacteria, spores, etc.
In the second method, we have this process to sterilize the biolenses. As mentioned before, autoclaving is often used in laboratory settings. For example, equipment and supplies can be sterilized by subjecting them to high-pressure saturated steam for a certain period, depending on the size of the load and the contents.
By autoclaving the microlenses it is almost sure that the micro-organism are not viable afterwards. Therefore, we considered this to be a relatively easy and reliable solution. However, based on the SEM-images (Figure 1), we have to conclude that the microlenses did not remain intact after autoclaving them.

Abstract
To enhance the effects of decontamination in various fields, we use the Alkaline Cellulase as detergent additive. An Alkaline Cellulase was introduced into the Escherichia coli and controled by P43 promoter, thus the target enzyme can be highly produced with the help of Kil, which is one of the core elements of our project. What’s more, MdfA , a proton pump across the cell membrane, is added to transport the proton into the cytoplasma, and release Na+/K+ at the same time, resulting in cell survival in alkaline industry wastewaters as high as pH 10. Another highight of our project is that we also added a ccdAB suicide system to our e-machine, by this we could remove the biological machine whenever we need for biological safety.
The Kil  element
The protein Kil can promote the secretion of periplasmic protein, with no limitation of the molecular weight of protein. When the Kil gene is expressed, bacteria can produce more proteins than that in periplasmic cavity, inducing the host bacterium to synthesis even more proteins. Besides, in E. coli natural plasmid contains the genes of colicin and related substance, which can increase the permeability of outer membrane. Thus the colicin can be moved to the outside to kill other bacteria.
The CcdB Suicide System
The CcdB system is a toxin-antitoxin system, which codes CcdB as a kind of toxin protein. CcdB can interfere with DNA synthesis to kill the host cell. The engineered E. coli is created for industrial using, so the suicide system needs to be controlled freely. The channel is closed by a repressor under normal conditions, with no CcdB produced. When adding IPTG, the repressor’s structure is changed and the channel would be opened. The CcdB forms and starts to kill the host cell.
Future Application
In papermaking industry
Alkaline Cellulase is widely used in papermaking. One of the important fibrous materials is daily waste papers. Compared with chemical method, enzymatic process has many advantages, for example, the drainage properties of pulp is improved a lot, and the whiteness of paper is significantly improved.

Background
In our project we developed a system to fight pathogens in the gut, which is not a unique idea. Except we wanted our systems key attribute to be specificity. To do so, we needed to find a unique quorum sensing language that we could hijack and utilize. We found the Yen system, from Yersinia enterocolitica. A homologous sytem to the well known Lux system, from Vibrio fischeri.
System design
From the Yen system we stole the activator YenR and the recognition region, the yenbox, fused with a wild type promoter. YenR was synthesized with the RBS B0034 and codon optimized for E. coli. A customized version of the yenbox-promoter was also created.
Result
We managed to get a five-fold induction relative to the base level of expression. The cells that were used during the measurements were double transformed with the yenbox-promoter complex with GFP and a plasmid producing the activator YenR.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.
Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of"
Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyandPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," science synthetic biology has the opportunity to  model the public awareness. Synthetic biology has the potential to change the life of people and to solve important problems. It is crucial to include the public to achieve these prime goals.
Changes always begin with a small step. We asked ourselves how to make a difference in the public perception of our project. Even though we are confident about the safety of our projects, people hearing about viral vectors create horror scenarios in their minds. Often when explaining the safety of our project to the public we did not realize using certain terms that might be obvious for us but swamped the public. Therefore we created a spreadsheet explaining safety aspects of our project and viral vectors in general to inform the public. We wanted to make it understandable for not only scientists but for everybody.
As a conclusion we want to once more accent our goals we want to achieve by creating LINK-IT. In our opinion it is very important to link policy and practice with safety. It is or strong believe that after careful investigation these two belong together and safety should always be a part of policy and practice. This is the only way to create a public acceptance of synthetic biology and it is also a great opportunity to bring synthetic biology to the center of society. You cannot change the world if you are not aiming to achieve understanding.

Saturday Balloon Fever
In Germany and many other parts of the western world there is a huge negative public opinion about genetic engineering. Especially reports in mass media often stoke further prejudices. Sadly, these reports are mostly unqualified and unscientific. Due to the reports and a general lack of education about molecular biology, many people indeed reject genetic engineering, but have no idea, what genetic engineering is about. This leads to an ambivalent public opinion. On the one hand, biofuel production (“green” energy) via (usually genetically modified) algae or bacteria is widely supported, on the other hand especially synthetic engineered plants are hardly condemned.
According to that ambivalence in media and educational system, many people do not know that genetic engineering and synthetic biology are indeed part of our everyday life and have many different promising approaches to help our society or even safe life. As iGEMers it is our duty to change something about this deficiency. Our contribution was the Saturday Balloon Fever.
“Have you ever heard about synthetic biology?” – “Did you know that…?” were the two main questions we asked to passengers at this special event, which took place at august the 16th. We wanted to know, what people know about synthetic biology and also show examples for products of synthetic biology in everyday life"

The team not only hopes that we inspire other state schools from across the country to enter this competition, but also students in the younger years at our school. The posters are a brilliant illustration of the hard work which is required for a successful project but more importantly how the competition allows young scientists to have a taste of what research and innovation is really like.

Firstly, the social media aspect our work has acted as a brief log showing our gradual progress from the projects infancy all the way up to the Giant Jamboree. However, this was not the main aim of the blog or twitter handle. We have primarily used has been to educate and advertise. Throughout the last 7 months, our team have posted about every aspect of our project and by doing so have raised awareness about synthetic biology and IGEM. Furthermore, by posting about our involvement in events such as the march for science and young scientists journal conference, we hope we have encouraged young people to learn more about these events.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

German Meetup in Marburg
As a newly established team we were excited to get in contact with the other teams at the German meetup in Marburg. Especially, we exchanged some ideas about the different projects and talked about problems we had to face in the wet lab. This exchange of experience resulted in a huge benefit for our project in the following weeks.
We were introduced to team Marburg’s project for the first time. Later we established a collaboration with team Marburg by participating in their Vibrio natriegens InterLab Study. Moreover, we learned much more about the iGEM competition itself and got contacts to students more familiar to the iGEM competition who provided us with advice later on.

For the first time we presented our poster to a greater audience and                  were excited by all the positive comments and helpful advice we received.                  We are thankful for the opportunity to get an insight into the other amazing projects.                  Not only did we get to hear stunning talks about synthetic biology in current science issues,                  but we also received important information by attending many workshops.                  In the end we left a bit wistfully, but we also took home so many amazing impressions.

Collaborations for our laboratory work
Genomic DNA of cultured Plasmodia
Our primers were first established with synthetic DNA templates. Apart from that we urged to figure out if our primers work for the detection of real Plasmodium DNA. We did not want to work with the parasite itself to exclude the risk of infection. This is why we reached out to laboratories who work with cultured Plasmodium who could provide us extracted DNA that we could use for our experiments. This led to collaborations with the Center of Infectiology and Parasitology in Heidelberg (AG Portugal) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Tuebingen (AG Kreidenweiss) who provided us genomic DNA of their cultured Plasmodium strains."

HebrewU,2018,Team:HebrewU#Global aspects_-_-_TEXT.html," when stricter legislation and the implementation of more efficient treatment mechanisms led to the decrease of emissions to minimal values. Other industrialized countries like Poland, where less strict legislation is applied, have not shown the same progression.
Asia
As by European countries, combustion activities, metal industries, and waste incineration are the main sources of dioxin emissions in Asia. Concentrations can differ depending on the dioxin-producing process, legislation for the area, and the social awareness of the population.  Furthermore, China, as a singular country, has been identified as the largest dioxin emitter in the world. Annual dioxin emission in China from 10 source groups was up to 10.2 kg TEQ in 2004, accounting for about 30% of the total global emissions 14,15. Due to technical difficulties in dioxin monitoring and laboratory analysis, information on dioxin contaminations in food supplies (in China) is limited.
Africa
Dioxin contaminations in Africa are mostly not a result of processes that occur on the continent itself, but rather a result of the airborne travel of Dioxin emissions that originate from Europe, among other sources. Africa is one of the continents that are most influenced by this type of secondary contamination, altering the correlation between the ratio of dioxin accumulation and the ratio of dioxin production per country.
America:
TThe United States is the highest generator of dioxins in both North and South America. According to the study of the National Dioxin Air Monitoring Network (NDAMN), which measured the distribution of atmospheric pollution from 1999 to 2004 in the United States, higher ambient concentrations of airborne dioxins were found in the eastern part of the country.
Furthermore, based on analyses from 1987 to 2000 release of dioxin-like compounds from regulated industrial sources significantly dropped. he annual releases to the U.S. environment over the three reference years were:
14,000 g in 1987,
3,400 g in 1995,
1,400 g in 2000.
Antarctica, Oceania and the seas:
The lowest concentration levels are found in the Antarctic and Oceania, while Europe presents the highest concentrations in soils. On the other hand, the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean, the High Seas, and the Mediterranean Sea show the highest levels of dioxins in water.
Severe contamination events of dioxins:

Regulations for Synthetic Biology
In South Korea there is no specific set of regulations designated just for synthetic biology. There is, however, an act called the “Biotechnology Support Act” that can promote the lawful development of synthetic biology in Korea. The purpose of this Act is to effectively support biotechnology in Korea by laying the foundation of biotechnology research ultimately to contribute to the sound development of the national economy. This Act states that the Korean government will make efforts to promote international cooperation in biotechnology researches, promote joint researches within Korea, take policy measures to support biotechnology research, and collect information for  technology development(""Biotechnology support act,"" 2008).
There is also a law called “Transfer of Living Modified Organisms Law (LMO Law) that can partially regulate the bio-safety aspect of synthetic biology. LMO Law was first written in 2001 by the Department of Knowledge and Economy under the Korean government. The term Living Modified Organism defined in the Law is very comprehensive and can cover organisms made in synthetic biology research. This law states that before an extensive application of a research, the possible environmental effect of the LMO need to be predicted. Because synthetic biology, however, often produces novel synthetic microorganisms, the environmental effects of the novel microorganism are hard to predict. Modification of LMO Law or a new law, therefore, is required to encompass the whole aspect of synthetic biology (Kim, 2010).
Also, Korea does not have a method for estimating the environmental effects that the LMO can cause and therefore, rely largely on foreign investigations. Such a method will be needed if South Korea begins to develop more drastically altered LMOs (Kim, 2010).
Perception of Synthetic Biology
Scientists
Academic synthetic biology projects are gaining serious traction in Korea, with only 2 such projects in 2009 increasing to around 200 project in 2013. More scientists are also being involved in synthetic biology research(""National science and,"" ).
Government
The Korean government has regularly supported new technologies that integrate different disciplines. As an example of this kind of technology, synthetic biology has received extensive support and promotion by the government as outlined by the Bio-Vision 2016 plan. Korea’s government will continue to increase investments in biotechnology and expand the technology and its market (Kim, 2010).

No study specifically regarding the perception of synthetic biology by the public has been conducted in Korea. It is therefore hard to judge how"

Reflexivity
iGEM projects do meet societal goals. Most of them wants to address a major challenge of our time and solve it by synthetic biology. However, the definition of a societal need is very different from teams to teams.
The main question is: how to define a societal need? There is a lot of different projects, and a few ways to define the societal need the team wants to address: news report, questionnaire survey, meeting stakeholders, research in scientific papers. Other teams defined their project by their own knowledge but then meet stakeholders to build it.
Defining a societal need comes along with the question of the project itself: how did the team find the problem they want to address? Most of the teams looked around them: local problem of flu, Lascaux cave, problem of small and local research center, or major problems making the news, like Zika viruses or life on Mars, or just a desire to improve synthetic biology. A good example: iGEM Costa Rica decided to tackle prostate cancer because it is the second cause of mortality in their country.
In order to answer a societal need the teams need to identify to whom the project will apply, who will use it. Some teams like iGEM Istanbul Tech or iGEM Pasteur gives a really complete scenario of who will use it and how. Despite this teams, the users of the project are not always defined. The definition of the potential impacts is also a problem, because most of the team didn’t try to define it. We could think of a solution: we know Synenergene asks each year some teams to define a techno-moral scenario about their project. Techno-moral scenario could be spread in order to think about concrete applications. Moreover, an other work could be to think about a scenario of the worst application possible of the innovation. It would be a difficult but interesting exercise.
Anticipation
The answers of the test show the anticipation part is not well developed among iGEM teams. Most of the team admits they are waiting for the results to build an anticipation. This lack of anticipation is quite normal because the iGEM competition does not call projects to go beyond the competition. However, we think iGEM could play an important part for the spread of a principle of anticipation among researchers.
Teams which tried to anticipate want to make a new firm, in order to sell their new product. Other teams wants beyond iGEM to pursue the project by extending it to new fields (iGEM Manchester), or help other scientists (iGEM Istanbul Tech).

5).Assume that the concentrations of DBT and HBP stay the same in all the three different phrases as the stirring rate of bioreactors reaches certain degree.
Hypothesis:
1).Because DszA and DszB are both inhibited by HBP, the catalytic rates of these two enzymes fit the models as below respectively:
In the equation, kAcat,kBcat are the conversion coefficients of enzymes A and B respectively, and Km,A,Km,B are the Michaellis constant of enzymes A and B respectively, and IC50,A,IC50,B are the concentrations of inhibitors that lead to a 50% reduction in the enzymes’ activities respectively.
2).Because enzyme DszC is inhibited noncompetitively by HBP, and it is also inhibited by catalytic substrates HBP, the catalytic rate of enzyme DszC is:
In the equation，kCcat is the conversion coefficient of enzyme C ,and Km,C are the Michaelis constant of the enzyme C, respectively, and KI is the inhibition constant of HBPs to DzsC enzymes,  shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.

2.4 Result Analysis
1).The optimal proportion of DszA, DszB and DszC..
Using MATLAB, we simulate different components’ concentration change with different DszA, DszB and DszC’s concentrations.
Using Matlab2015a, we found that:
when the proportion of three enzymes is A:B:C=1:2:4 or A:B:C=2:1:4, the decreasing rate of DBT is well suited, showing that DBT is well degraded. However, with the proportion of A:B:C=1:4:2 or A:B:C=4:1:2, the effect is not so obvious as the previous one.
In addition, taking HBP into consideration, methods with the proportions A:B:C=1:4:2 and A:B:C=1:2:4 will achieve better results;
However, intermediates are produced with greater amount in the conditions of A:B:C=1:2:4 and A:B:C=2:1:4. Because of the molecular movement effect, the reaction is harder to control.
In conclusions, we decided to multiple the proportion of enzymes, then we have:

“How many years do you think it will take for such a legislation and what is the right time?”
That is indeed a hard question and even for those at the forefront of synthetic biology research it is tough to make a fair estimate.  Even for people with a minor background in molecular biology this can be a quite daunting assessment to make.
Can a contest like iGEM exist for students? Luckily it’s between universities, so we have people looking out for us, but competition exists between students, so regardless of the university it can already be something between students in the backyard?
That is true and indeed it might be possible that in the course of the iGEM competition some regulations are not properly addressed or respected, not so much out of bad intention but out of unawareness. The bigger question is how to implement such a thing? You can have the rules and policies in the legal system but how can you make sure that its implemented in day-to-day life? It is at least clear at the moment that for such a new dynamic development, which in theory can affect so many individuals, that a formal legislation will not be very effective and efficient. The best approach of dealing with such an ever-changing community would indeed be to focus on raising the awareness and to focus on self-governance. It is necessary to have role models like Drew Endy. The students of the iGEM competition must be aware that the competition does not take place in vacuum but they are doing this in society where there is a potential for certain risk and they have a certain responsibility to avoid potential hazards from occurring.
The K.U.Leuven iGEM team commented that the students are stimulated to work on Human Practices and there are special prizes for teams that took bio-safety issues into account in their designs. However, the concern was that students from the third year bachelor are carrying out synthetic biology experiments, as even professionals do not have a complete idea about this discipline. Institutionalizing courses in all science and engineering curricula that reflect on the positive and negative ramifications of science, its implicit value and impact on society could solve this. It would be very interesting to take the interdisciplinary approach of synthetic biology a step further by including specialists from ethics, law, philosophy and governance.
A hurdle of implementing such a practice in the iGEM competition is that it’s hard for the instructors, who are scientists themselves, to realize the impact of the specific projects on society. They are not trained specialists in the other aspects, therefore"
Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State_-_-_TEXT.html," photosynthesis using the BCHM gene or to engineer a serotonin sensor. We thought about making a bacterial fuel cell by using Geobacter as a sacrificial anode. We also liked the idea of using bacteria to perform intelligent tasks, like mathematical arithmetic. The last idea we developed was to engineer a bacteria that would be able to detect radiation. The team spent a few days researching these topics to determine how plausible they would be and after a few days of background research unanimously agreed upon the bacterial radiation detector. As we dug deeper into our topic we narrowed our focus. We discovered that the Penn State 2007 iGEM team had used the lambda phage system to also develop a bacteria that would test for radiation and thought this would be a great area to expand. They were not able to fully assemble their device or test it so we came to the conclusion that we could  build upon their initial foundation and develop a great project.
.
Research
After deciding to follow up on the bacterial dosimeter idea for our project, we as a team we had to first do some research on the effects of ionizing radiation in order to better determine what exactly we would be detecting. Currently all living organisms are exposed to a relatively low dose of radiation; this amount is so negligible that the negative effects are unnoticeable. The problem with ionizing radiation occurs when one is exposed to a high dose for a short period and/or low doses over an extended period of time. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends nuclear industry employees to limit ones yearly exposer to 50 mSv, or 100 mSv over 5 years.1 One international study, composing 15 countries and encompassing 598,068 nuclear industry workers, found that an increased risk of cancer exists. Specifically, 99% of those tested were exposed to less than 50 mSv of radiation per year, and 1-2% of these cancer related deaths may be attributable to this exposer. It’s also estimated that 100 mSv of cumulative radiation exposer would result to a 5.9% increase chance of mortality. Therefore it is important to be aware of exposure to radiation especially when working in a nuclear facility or when exposed unintentionally.2 1. Cardis, E.

WETLAB WEEK 1 (12 September 2012)
After months of planning we are finally in the lab!
Wednesday
AIM: The primers for     amplification of the ALDH promoter sequences have arrived. These primers have     the Biobrick overhangs. Primers were diluted to 100mM     and working concentrations of primers was made up at 10mM. The first set of     primers to amplify the four ALDH isoforms was set up.
PCR was set up using Pfu polymerase. Template used was whole cells (mammalian). Cells were thawed, spun     down and the supernatant removed and re-suspended in 50uL DMSO. We attempted to     amplify the following promoter sequences: ALDH1A1, ALDH2, ALDH1A3, ALDH3A1 (1)     and ALDH3A1(2).
The cycle conditions were as follows:
Initial denaturation at 980C for 30 seconds then     30 cycles with 980C for 10 seconds, 540C for 30 seconds     (annealing) and 720C for 30 seconds. Final extension was at 720C     for 10 minutes and then PCR was held at 40C.
RESULTS: No bands were seen     on the gel.
ANALYSIS: It is possible that     the DNA template (addition of whole cells) did not become available in the     reaction. Other cellular components during lysis of     the cells may also have had an impact on the efficiency of the PCR reaction. We     have located a protocol for crude extraction"

Day 4:
We had our bi-weekly meeting today. The Baclight dye also arrived today. Sam made a ligation today and the team continued to update the wiki. David, a member of the St Andrews iGEM team 2010 came over to the lab to help with our ligation. He took the ligation made by Sam as well as a plate with colonies and a miniprep to Dundee, which is where he is based. He performed a digestion on the ligation which yielded very faint bands at the right location on a gel and overnights made of the colonies.
Day 5:
The team continued to update the wiki. Ogaga and Lamya carried out a transformation on supercompetent cells of the ligation made on Thursday. Charlie performed a new characterisation experiment using Baclight dye and a microplate reader while Sam carried out another ligation and ran a gel on it. By evening, the transformed cells appeared pink indicating RFP synthesis. David, still based in Dundee, ran a digestion of the DNA 2.0 synthesis product miniprep (our AMP gene). This was run on a gel and a faint band was found at approx. the right position. This band was cut out and purified. The DNA concentration following the gel extraction was very low (<5ng/ul), but a ligation was put on using the backbone made by Richard, David’s brother a member of the Dundee iGEM team 2011.
Day 6:
Charlie ran another characterisation experiment using Baclight dye and a microplate reader. David transformed the ligated DNA into supercompetent cells. Sam and David in St Andrews, ran a PCR on the backbone (J04450) and insert (AMP gene) using the iGEM primer design. This was then purified and digested with EcoR1 and Pst1. This was then ligated and transformed into super competent cells.
Day 7:
Charlie ran another characterisation experiment today using Baclight dye and a microplate reader but with a different protocol.  David brought the transformed cells he made along with Richard over to St Andrews. These cells were white indicating that a problem occurred in the PCR, causing it to fail to remove RFP. A colony PCR was carried out on the successfully transformed cells. This was run on a gel and bands were seen at 370bp which is about the size of our insert. Overnights of these colonies were made.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," induction of transcription of endogenous genes in the presence of blue light.
This light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector (LACE) system can easily be modified by changing the gRNA that is expressed inside the cell and therefore allows dynamic on- and off-switching of genes. Nihongaki et al. 2015 modified the LACE system by using the transactivation domain of NFκB, called p65, instead of VP64 and activated endogenous and exogenous genes in a spatiotemporally confined manner.
However, these LACE systems are limited by the exposure time to blue light and require widefield illumination of the entire cell in order to activate both components, the dCas-CIB1 and the CRY2-TF. Gene activation in these systems requires constant blue light exposure for at least 2-3 hours for measurable results.
In the context of controlling cells to form tissues, this dependence on widefield illumination presents a major problem. All cells in the tissue would be illuminated at the same time and no specificity could be achieved. It is therefore necessary to reduce the required exposure time for the activation of the LACE system and render the activation mechanism independent of widefield illumination.
Design
Our solution is a LACE system that does not depend on heterodimerizing proteins from plants but instead on post-translational control exerted through a photocleavable linker.
The system consists of four essential units: a transmembrane domain, a photocleavable linker, dCas9 and a transactivation domain (p65, VP64, VP16).
Based on these prerequisite we designed BioBrick BBa_K2332317, a single-illumination light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector (siLACE) system localised to the plasma membrane of the cell via the photocleavable linker PhoCl. By localising the system to the plasma membrane the dCas9 fused to the transactivation domain is preprogrammed to not enter the nucleus and can therefore not activate any target gene inside the nucleus.
However, a single laser beam of 400 nm, violet light has been shown to be able to cleave PhoCl. After cleavage, the dCas9-TF is able to enter the nucleus, directed by attached nuclear localisation sequences. Inside the nucleus the system uses gRNAs to find the endogenous target gene and induce transcription.
The illumination radius of such the laser is many magnitudes below the dimensions of a standard mammalian cell (diameter: 10-15 µm ; volume: ~4,"

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM perpetuates. It is important to know if synthetic biology, being a relatively new field of study, is similar or different to other STEM disciplines in terms of their lack of diversity and representation of minorities. Future studies could also focus more closely on language and its effect on personal experience regarding inclusivity within iGEM and synthetic biology: the Trump administration’s 2017 ban on certain words within CDC documents is one blatant example of where identities are stigmatized by restricting language, language being arguably the most fundamental part of communication and open dialogue. By looking more into microaggressions and more subtle forms of discrimination through language, we can better gauge how to foster diversity, equity and inclusion within iGEM.
Attached is the report.
Activity 5: Addressing a gap in entrepreneurial literacy
People: Although synthetic biology as a discipline is research-focused and iGEM is, at its core, a research competition, our team felt that a well-balanced team will include individuals with a business focus, and that it would be helpful for individuals to have a well-rounded approach to their time during iGEM. Although our team relied on a system of generalists and specialists, we also analyzed past projects that attempted entrepreneurship and felt the need to provide foundational knowledge.
Design and Dialogue: Although several members of our team were fortunate to have a background in entrepreneurial activities, we recognized that not all teams would have such individuals. To get a baseline understanding of what past teams had accomplished, we cataloged all the projects from 2015-2017 since iGEM made Entrepreneurship a special prize. This database analyzed teams across 6 axes within their Entrepreneurship portion of their wiki:
Performing a SWOT analysis
Implementation of a Business Model Canvas
Filing of provisional patent
Interactions with VC
Demonstration of MVP, minimum viable product
Winners of the Special Award
Following the compilation of our database, we talked to experts at two on-campus incubators, including the Basement and BLUE LINC. The Basement specializes in helping commercialize undergraduates’ work and providing mentoring; talking to Ms. Christine Liou at the Basement made us realize that for teams in synthetic biology, there was an additional layer of knowledge that we needed to expose. We learned about the basic concepts of ideation and market validation. We also turned to BLUE LINC, a unique on-campus biomedical project incubator that is modeled after the Stanford BioDesign process and is open to graduate students. Talking to the president, Nick Forsch, helped us identify key factors that teams should be cognizant of when structuring their value proposition and subsequent business"

Sam made Chloramphenicol plates for use later on.Redesigned leader sequence to be a full 60 bp, redesigned rescue primers again. Sequencing primers designed. MATLAB program updated to optimize for slow insertion time GFP. Script also created to total the insertion times of each GFP. Primers updated again as enzymes were re chosen, due to the presence of one of them in the CDS of slow insertion time GFP.

We conducted PCR Rescue to amplify the kanamycin resistance cassette (specifically the neomycin cassette, which also confers resistance to kanamycin) from pSEVA251 KanR plasmid. Two different sets of primers for kanamycin were tested, and the first set was successful - all 4 PCR's were correct. The second set of primers all failed. However, Emily had her first PCR success! Kanamycin cassette was gel purified.
Project Plan updated. Five GFPs will be ligated into pFTV separately, then dRBS will be ligated in. Data will be collected and sequencing will show which RBS was used by each colony. Cryogenic stock of cells harboring pFTV grown.

Conducted colony PCR using P. putida KT2440 strain as the DNA template to construct 1 kb overlaps for homologous recombination. All four of the first genome overlaps with gene PP_0747 were successful; only 2 overlaps with upp gene were successful. These were gel purified. We learned Gibson Chew-Back Annealing Assembly (CBA) protocol.
Gblocks arrived. Rescue PCR conducted to increase stocks of gblocks. Samples run in gel and purified. Plasmids harvested from cells harboring pFTV. Clay left early to rebuild the deck at his house. Bastard.

1. Goals for the week
Our two main goals for this week were to determine the mutagen concentration to use during mutagenesis, and to amplify the T7 minor capsid protein with PCR.
2.Experiments and results
5.9 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test #2
We infected E. coli BL21 with different concentrations (1ul, 10ul, and 100ul) of phage to see which would yield the highest titer.  Plaques formed up to -8 on all the spot tests, showing that the concentration difference had no effect on the titer.  However, the plates were badly contaminated.
5.13 Determining E. coli Concentration With Spectrophotometer
To check if we could determine E. coli concentration with a spectrophotometer, we created a 7/5 dilution series of E. coli.  We then measured the absorption at 600nm of each E. coli dilution.  When plotted, these measurements showed a linear relationship between E. coli concentration and the absorption reading.
5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock
Created a 1:10 dilution series with 5.3 T7 stock.  We then created titers of -5, -6, -7, and -8.  -5, -6, and -7 plates all had overlapping plaques.  However, the -8 plate had 7 plaques, giving us an estimated phage concentration of 7E8 particles/20ul.
5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment"
Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Collaborations#Darmstadt_-_-_TEXT.html," availabe in Germany, as for chemistry, biology and microcontroller based programming, there is none for biotechnology. Therefore the 15 members with various backgrounds like educators, computer scientists, biologists and even one master brewer gathered to perform their own experiments. As Fabian told us and our first research revealed, the few other Community labs in Germany and some more in Europe mainly consist of non-specialist or non-academic people who like to engange in the hobby of performing some biological experiments.
Public opinion: In our previous perception, the fact that everybody who wants to experiment with microorganisms could potentially do so in a community lab scares many people. The main stated concerns were whether these labs are monitored and audited properly. Comtaminations within the lab have to be avoided and even more important GMOs, under any circumstances, may not leave to lab alive!
In digging a little deeper, we listed and discussed some more potential risks and possible solutions:
Risks & Solutions
Neglected risk assessment: If non-specialists only aquire a superficial knowledge about biology, chemistry and genetic engineering but start working with GMOs and dangerous substances, this can lead to an  insufficient estimation of risks potentially followed by harmful consequences.
If antibiotic resistances are introduced into mocroorganisms and they somehow leave the lab, this could contribute to spreading new resistences to wild type strains. If then pathogens aquire these resistances they possess an increased risk to the population.
If samples from the environment are collected, biohackers could unintentionally cultivate or even select for pathogens.
Some Community Labs strive to teach persons to perform DIY Biology ""in their own kitchen"". If this comes true, there will be rooms of multiple uses, which harbor safety issues. People who are not meant to get in touch with GMOs or pathogens are in danger of exposure. These rooms have to be safe for children, pregnant women and pets.
Insufficient prevention against criminal acts: Community Labs have to be secure regarding sabotage or theft, to prevent GMOs from leaving the lab alive. Here, RFID tags  could serve as theft protection. In addition, they have to be protected against abuse of biological material/samples. For instance, analysing DNA samples from people without their consent/knowledge should be prevented. Especially employers, insurances and other companies would be very interested in getting access to the genetic information and consequent further private or personal health information. This threat to privacy is currently not clearly regulated by law! Indeed, not only analysing but also copying DNA samples from unsuspecting citizens could be used for criminal acts. Theoretically, you could copy and put specf"

Three tanks were set up: biofilm + distilled water (right), biofilm + AuNP (middle), and AuNP solution alone (left). After about 30 hours of mixing, the color of the AuNP solution started to change from purple to clear in the cylinder containing biofilm. In contrast, the cylinder containing only AuNP solution did not change at all. Timelapse video shows the tanks 36 hours after the start. Experiment & Video: Yvonne W.

We began another growth assay because the previous ones showed no results. The cells may bave been dead by the time the cells reached them. This method of spreading the afp1 culture like an antibiotic and plating mycelium smoothie on the top should give more consistent results. We retried electroporation with pAK13CS and it sadly arced again… We also ran a Q5 PCR for the insert in pAK13CR. We prepared and autoclaved CYM + agar, for making plates.
We will start a new growth assay to test afp1. We ran a Q5 PCR for pAK13CR.

We ran a Gibson of the DpnI digest of pC13AI PCRs. In terms of characterization, we ran a huge Q5 PCR on pC13BQ with pC13AT, pC13BQ with pC13AU, pC13BR with pC13AU, pC13BR with pC13AT, and pAK13AO with pC13F using standard biobrick forward and reverse primers 23 and 24. We set up the PCR to append KpnI and BamHI cut sites to pC13F again with different annealing temperatures and ran a gel to test the PCRs. We ran a gel for the PCR products--insert of pAK13CR--from yesterday, and then we did a PCR clean up of the inserts of pAK13CR and pC13I. We then did electroporation for pC13DJ and pC13BD.

The videos include the following topics: PCR, Transformation, Digestion & Ligation, Miniprep, Gel Electrophoresis. These are all laboratory techniques that our project required we familiarize ourselves with. Coming into the summer, our team’s greatest weakness was our lack of experience in the lab, and as a result we spent a lot of time learning basic techniques. Looking back, it would have helped us a lot if there were online resources all in one spot that explained different lab techniques in an easy to understand, succinct manner. We made these videos to help any future iGEM teams or just anyone working in a lab become comfortable with them. They are aimed at someone with basic lab experience but without an extensive background in biological techniques. The iGEM club at Georgia Tech plans on expanding the scope of these videos and covering more techniques in the future so that eventually we will have a large enough database of videos to cover most any technique needed in synthetic biology.
Discussion with Zak Costello
On June 25th, our team met with a Georgia Tech PhD candidate, Zak Costello, who is currently studying electrical and computer engineering (ECE).  Zak works in the Georgia Robotics and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (GRITS), and is looking to switch to synthetic biology while also utilizing his experience with ECE. In our meeting, he discussed his current research in theoretical controls, which has applications including self-driving cars and auto-correcting spacecrafts, but also expressed his enthusiasm for the field of synthetic biology. We shared our knowledge of biotechnology to help him prepare for his postgraduate work. At the end of our meeting, we discussed the exciting future in store for synthetic biology, including completely synthetic bacteria and yeast chromosomes.
Zak entered Georgia Tech as a biomedical engineering (BME) student but realized he did not enjoy his BME classes. Instead, he found greater interested working in an applied mathematics lab and “fell down the rabbit hole,” (Costello, 2015) leading him further away from synthetic biology. Zak would like to combine his expertise in theoretical controls with his enthusiasm for synthetic systems.
Many years and sleepless nights later, he aspires to return to his original interest in biology. After a Google search on synthetic biology, he found the Georgia Tech iGEM Team and set up a meeting with us to find out more about the field and the tools of synthetic biology. We recommend reading material, including textbooks in general biology and genetics, as well as iGEM Wiki pages from previous years. We thought"

Denitrification
We started off this week by determining the DNA concentration of our genomic prep samples from last week using the nanodrop. DNA concentration for all three putida strains was at least 1000 ng/microlitre, well above what was needed for PCR. 1/2 and 1/3 dilutions were prepared for all three strains so as not to have an excess of template DNA in PCR reactions. PCR was performed on all 3 strains using primers for CarAc, CarAd, AntA, AntB, and AntC using 6 replicates per gene. The only successful amplification appeared to be AntB and CarAc, both from strain 28 (with weaker bands in strain 29). We then performed another PCR, just on those two genes with an increased amount of Taq polymerase to hopefully get enough amplified DNA to move forward with. This resulted in strong bands for both at the expected size. We then performed PCR purification using the Qiaquick kit and obtained samples containing 33.5 ng/microlitre of AntB DNA and 129 ng/microlitre of CarAc DNA. These concentrations were both sufficient to begin a restriction digest and ligation of these parts into vector PSB1C3. Next week we hope to verify the results of the restriction digest, continue to amplify CarAc and AntB from strain 28, and hopefully submit a biobrick for sequencing.
Desulfurization
In order to confirm the hpaC biobrick construction, two sets of colony PCR were performed, choosing white colonies from the 3 plates we grew last week (white colonies indicate a loss of the RFP generator in the pSB1C3 backbone, and therefore allow for weeding out of the colonies which are simply the original plasmid vector). These reactions were carried out both with hpaC primers and with stanndard biobrick primers designed against the plasmid backbone. After running them on the gel we saw equal bands for the PCR reactions performed using hpaC primers FIRST PIC(However, a PCR using biobrick primers was performed later and the same results were obtained). Colonies 1(-) and 5(-) were used to make overnight cultures, which were then miniprepped the following day to obtain the plasmid DNA of the put"

Survey
Today, fish provides more than one billion people with most of their daily animal protein. Fish provides nutrients and micronutrients which are essential to the cognitive and physical development of people, especially of children. It is also an important part of a healthy diet. But heavy metals in water have become a threat to both fish and public health. The EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) announced that women living on the East and West Coasts had twice as much mercury in their blood (5.9 parts per billion, or ppb) than inland women (2.4 ppb). Levels higher than 3.5 ppb may pose a threat to the woman or fetus.
We designed two kinds of questionnaires including a Chinese questionnaire and an English questionnaire, in order to enlarge the region of our investigation.The Chinese questionnaire and English questionnaire are basically similar.
We totally acquired 544 questionnaire responses. The survey in China was carried out both online and offline. We used an online survey website and collected 526 effective questionnaires. We also got 18 effective paper questionnaires. As to the English questionnaire, we put it on the website and promoted it. Finally, we recycled 12 effective questionnaires from 5 different countries (German, Canada, USA, UK and Netherlands).

Tsinghua-A,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#pr_-_-_TEXT.html," The biological networks are complex, but growing evidence shows that some core topology structures are capable of robustly executing functions, which are known as motifs. And some of them may be more efficient under certain parameter combinations. After observing the relatively functional network topologies, we are inspired to traverse all functional networks and marked the most commonly appeared motifs. We did some analysis aiming at motifs such as Mutual-Inhibition, Self-Activation, Feedforward with buffer node, Feedback with buffer node and Strong Inhibition and Strong Activation. And we found that the most common motifs in adaptive networks exactly make up the 2 core optimal networks we obtained from previous results.
3. Results and Application
Results After complex screening and testing work, we finally got 2 optimal networks. These 2 networks are reliably functional to sense input difference and show great adaptation to DNA template abundance (copy number variation). So these networks meet our needs and goals.
Besides, we summarized the topologies of functional networks and obtained  Feedforward with a buffer node and Mutual_inhibition motifs that are significant to adaptation. Application According to our conclusion, we in fact realized a biomachine for sensing signal and effectively switching between high-low states. This function is also the very basis of an automatic sorting machine, which could robustly distinguish two kinds of cells. And the most important thing is that this simple sorter is stable and reliable enough in face with DNA template fluctuation. So our project can be adopted in the future to:  Sense signals and realize a robust bio-switch in gene circuit.  Distinguish cancer cells from normal cells and kill cancer cells with specificity.  Refine a network construction method to synthetize adaptive networks with the intuitionistic impression of regulatory motifs.   …

Background facts and information
The field of synthetic biology combines different disciplines, like molecular biology, engineering, mathematics and physics to improve the knowledge of existing biological systems or to design and manipulate genes, pathways and entire genomes of organisms, for them to fulfill a certain purpose. Synthetic Biology is applied in various fields and disciplines. For biomedical applications it can be used to design ...

Abstract
In our first approach, we utilize the DNA-binding function of deadCas9 (dCas9) to bind two enzymes of the Indoleacetic acid (IAA) pathway on a DNA-scaffold, which we introduce into E.coli. By binding the enzymes on DNA, we decrease the distance the substrates have to travel in the cytoplasm and thereby hope to achieve a higher output of Indoleacetic acid....

Research work & Protocols
Finding a suitable topic was very challenging and time consuming. Initially, we looked through projects of prior teams and assembled a list of possible topics.  A big influence was a new method for assembling genes in a manufacturing manner which was being developed by a research group on our university. Based on the quick and easy synthesis of proteins a first idea was the creation of enzymes that could convert blood groups....

Urban agriculture is an underutilized public resource, and therefore promoting community focus farming may sow the seeds for community self sufficiency while also engaging the youth in these living areas.
Key Takeaways
Urban agriculture and science education truly go hand in hand.
OxyPonics is an avenue for experimental farming, and when woven into community gardening, has the potential to become a pedagogical tool in the context of gardening to teach students about synthetic biology and its many possibilities.
JUNE 10, 2017
Rasheed Hislop
To run with this potential avenue of innovation, we talked to Rasheed Hislop of GreenThumb NYC, a gardening program sponsored by New York City Department of Parks & Recreation.   We learned about citywide initiatives such as New York City’s “Grow to Learn” program in the schools, which uses the garden and the greenhouse as the classroom. Mr. Hislop told us this education program encompassed a variety of hands on skills, such as urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting, composting, pest control pests without using chemicals and pesticides, and mulching. The program puts a large emphasis on reducing and reusing with its partnership with the Climate Justice Organization. It gives students the opportunity to take up extensive service projects in improving the gardens while also providing teachers and parents workshops and trainings in the field of environmental education.
Mr. Hislop also mentioned that gardens with hydroponics are increasingly popular, and that they provide educators who lack green spaces and land to grow produce conventionally with a portable hydroponic gardening classroom. This take on bigger picture of environmental education gave us much to think about with respect to hydroponics and our project.
AUGUST 29, 2017
Dr. Marianne Krasny
Professor Marianne Krasny, a research extension associate who teaches teachers with the Cornell Cooperative Extension, which aims to translate research done in academic institution to the people, told us that the farms provide a unique and visceral learning environment that can't be replicated in the classroom. Unlike lectures, these situations have a “learn as you go” atmosphere. Community and school gardens in the cities therefore offer an “incredibly rich learning experience,” especially to underserved and low income urban areas. Professor Krasny gave us a unique take on this “formal, but informal” education that also has the potential to combine culture, science, and community engagement. Community farms allow students to connect with the culture capital of a neighborhood, for example with farming traditions and knowledge of elders and immigrants.

Meet Arashk Gasroddashti
Hi! My name is Arashk Ghasroddashti and I'm currently in my grade 11 year at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I joined iGEM so that I could experience the amazing opportunities that synthetic biology has to offer, first hand. In addition, getting a chance to work with a team in all sorts of different environments (lab, planning meets, work groups, etc.) has been absolutely invaluable! I plan to eventually move onto university where I will study a field with a strong focus in biology and (hopefully), in the end become some sort of surgeon. Things I enjoy include Judo, computer work, business, movies and of course, learning about the sciences.
When I saw you, it was dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin at first sight ;)

In my free time I enjoy seeing friends or playing games. I have been playing hockey all my life and have been skating for almost as long as I could walk. I joined IGEM because I wanted to see the power that synthetic biology has to change the world for the better. I am still unsure of what career I will pursue in the future, but I am sure that it will involve science.
You must be awfully cool because you're 0K in my books ;)

Total concentration of buffer:
(1.2)
By definition:
(1.3)
Combining (1.2) and (1.3):
(1.4)
Combining this with (1.1) and the water auto-ionisation constant definition, K_W=[H^+ ][〖OH〗^-], give the moles of strong acid added:
(1.5)
Differentiating with respect to the pH gives the buffer capacity:
(1.6)
(1.7)
(1.8)
Which can be generalized for multi-buffer systems:
(1.9) Van Slyke equation
β = buffer capacity
n = number of equivalents of strong acid added (per L solution) – we have this as a function of t: approximately addition at a constant rate.
K_(A_i) = K_A of component buffer i
K_W = ionic product of water, 10^(-14)
C_i  = concentration of component buffer i
Taking the reciprocal, and substituting the definition:
(1.10)
gives:
(1.11)
(1.12)
For a single buffer system:
Numerically solving this ODE in MATLAB, for pH(n, C) and hence pH(t, C) gives:   Upon solving the equation in Matlab, it was clear that only a relatively low concentration (0.05 M) of buffer was needed to significantly reduce the pH change of the solution:
The numerical solution to this differential equation was confirmed by reducing the n interval by a factor of 100, which gave the same result.
Derivation shown is based on Adam Hulanicki book Reakcje kwasów i zasad w chemii analitycznej, 2nd ed., PWN, Warszawa 1980 (English edition: Reactions of acids and bases in analytical chemistry; Chichester, West Sussex, England: E. Horwood; New York: Halsted Press, 1987).
Another possibility of reducing the overall pH change is adding a lot more water to the system. This is the easier method and could be used for single-use DCM disposal kits. However, it is impractical in large scale applications because of the very large amount of water that would have to be added.
How does the amount of water added affect the output?

3. GadC is a transmembrane protein. The external pH begins to change from neutral pH to acidic pH, C-plug (is GadC’s subunit) will open. Then glutamate will take inside.
4. Glutamate in cells convert to GABA by GadB/C that’s glutamate decarboxylase isozymes These steps are as follows:
*This step contains pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes that replace the α-carboxyl groups of their amino acid substrates with a proton that is recruited from the cytoplasm.
*HCl that diffusion from outside dissociates H+ and Cl-. This H+ is used and CO² is released by the agency of GadA/B isozymes than this is the last stage of glutamate changes to GABA. Besides this is the most important and the last step for acid resistance
5. If H+ leaves HCl it is staying back Cl and it will be export from the transport of chlorine channel.
6. The emitted CO² is taken out by diffusion.

In this section, our aim is to synthesize the TlpB protein in our E.coli so that It can penetrate the stomach mucus layer, where our pathogenic bacteria, H.pylori, resides.
Tobenhance the production of our protein TIpB, we aim to assemble our TIpB gene with T7 promoter which is a fast and strong promoter whilst designing our parts.
To control the system, we decided to add a Lac Operator, where LacI protein can bind, between TIpB gene sequence and promoter. We searched for an expression vector which includes Lac Operon and found that peT45-b has the properties.
When ordering our genes we added RFC10 prefix site to 3’ end and RFC10 suffix site to the 5’ end of TlpB gene and also added BamHI and XhoI restriction site sequence on the Pet45-b for cloning.
We planned to clone TlpB gene we ordered as described above to the Pet45-b vector with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes.
When this cloning is achieved succesfully, there will be a construct which has the order T7 Promoter-Lac Operon (LacO)- HisTag-TlpB and also there are Lac"

Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.

This is hydrolyzed by an attack of the water molecule activated by a basic amino acid residue of the enzyme. Alternatively, water is activated by a catalytic base of the enzyme and directly attacks the a-carbon of L-3-haloalkan6ic acid to displace the halogen atom (Fig. 2B). 2

Cytochrome P450
Collectively, the involvement of P450s has been proven in the metabolism of aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic molecules in reactions resulting in hydroxylation, epoxidation, dealkylation, sulfoxydation, deamination, desulphuration, dehalogenation, and N-oxide reduction. The majority of P450s catalyze the reactions after interacting with one or more protein components which transfer electrons from NADH or NADPH to the P450s, while some of them do not require any additional protein components to achieve the reductive activation of oxygen. While bacterial CYPs are water-soluble, mammalian CYPs are bound to either ER or mitochondrial membranes. 1,2

UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Notebook#Anne's Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," have written (WOAA and Optimal Assembly), but it can be extended to include algorithms that have nothing to do with assembly.  Extending it in this way, also allows for easier integration into Clotho.  Basically, with a few lines of code anyone can add their own algorithm.
This flexibility is achieved through the implementation of an abstract Algorithm class.  This class currently contains three different abstract methods which all subclasses of “Algorithm” must implement: getInput(String), getOutputToString(), and run().  Basically, in order for an algorithm to be workable in Clotho it must be able to take a String input that is retrieved from the text area in the GUI, process that data with run(), and return the result in the form of a String to be displayed in the output text area.  In reality, the algorithm in not required to take any input or return any output, but for interfacing with the GUI these are the requirements.
We are hoping this flexibility will allow us to implement different types of algorithms in the future.
Week Four: July 7th
After generalizing my tool to be an Algorithm Manager, I have also made it dynamic in the sense that now instead of selecting algorithms from different radio buttons, a JComboBox is populated with whatever algorithms are integrated in the tool at that time.    I have also added another dynamic aspect in that the possible outputs for each algorithm are also dynamically populated upon choosing that algorithm.  This feature is achieved by adding an additional abstract method to the Algorithm class that requires each algorithm to tell what types of outputs it supports.  For example, the Optimal Algorithm supports JGraph, Excel, Dot, and Text, while WOAA supports Excel and Dot.  When you select “Optimal Algorithm” from the algorithms combo box the outputs combo box is dynamically populated with the corresponding outputs.
The last dynamic feature I have added is a set of instructions associated with each algorithm.  Again, an abstract method called “getInstructions()” was added to the Algorithm class requiring each subclass to set a set of instructions for its algorithm.  This feature was designed to give the user information about the specified algorithm and what type of format you should enter your input in. Depending upon the algorithm you have chosen a different set of instructions will pop up when you select the “Get Instructions for Input” button.
I am happy with the new product, and think it is an improvement over our more limiting, original tool.  The basics of the tool seem to be done at this point, although I have a few features in mind that I would like to implement, namely a connection to databases.

Answers to Questions
None of our project ideas or materials raise safety issues since we did not use any biological materials, only proof-of-principle colored dyes to demonstrate that the robot works. In the future, this would change since DNA and possibly cells would be used. There is a biosafety group at our university, but since we only used Lego parts and other non-biological materials, safety was not an issue.
