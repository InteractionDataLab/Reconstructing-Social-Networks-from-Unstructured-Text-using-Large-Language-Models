Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"Results of ultramer touchdown PCR
We ran an e-gel on the product of our touchdown PCR. Once again we have our band at 344 bp. It is still slighly streaky, but much less than our earlier PCR reaction . There are some faint bands smaller than our expected product, which are likely the ultramers we used in the reaction. We'll use the product for our isothermal assembly later today.
Gel of our ultramer touchdown PCR product
Isothermal assembly and transformation of expression plasmids
We followed our protocol for isothermal assembly, using the following recipe:
0.63 ul backbone (at 157.4 ng/ul to get 100 ng)
0.13 ul omega+linker (at 120.5 ng/ul)
0.50 ul ultramer (~30 ng/ul)
1.24 ul water
7.5 ul isothermal assembly solution
The sizes of the pieces we put together were the following:
Backbone: 2.2 kb
omega+linker: 352 bp
ultramer: 344 bp
Note: We also made a negative control of the isothermal assembly, only putting in the spec backbone without omega+linker or ultramer.
We then performed transformations to insert our isothermal assembly products into E. coli, following our usual protocol . However, we ran out of electrocompetent cells, so only samples 78 - 82 were done with electroporation while 77, 83-85, and the negative control were done with chemical transformation, using these protocols (the samples are named after the reverse ultramer ID in the primer index that were used to generate the ultramer sequences).
We then plated 1 ul of the cells on spec plates and left them overnight at 37*. Because we ran out of our own spec plates, we also had to use LB plates that had spec added to it, and spec plates that were made in April.

∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ+pSR01 growth results:
When no IPTG was present, the bacteria grew in LB+amp, NM+his, and NM, showing that the plasmid rescues the selection stain's growth phenotype! This implies that our strain had the right genotype all along. However, when IPTG was added to the media, the strain only grew well in LB.  This is very odd, since IPTG was supposed to induce zif268 and thus His3 expression. We will try a couple things to make sure nothing went wrong:

ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Wetlab#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,":
Is in vivo restriction and religation possible without killing the cell?
Does in vivo restriction and religation lead to the exclusion of chromosomal fragments?
Method:
For our proof of concept we ordered the above construct. Only if in vivo restriction by the endonuclease SceI and religation by the T4 ligase leads to the exclusion of the sacB sensitivity gene and the terminator, RFP will be synthesized. RFP-synthesizing cells can then be detected. Unfortunately, the construct has not arrived until today. Therefore, we are working on an alternative construct, which contains an RFP flanked by two SceI restriction sites. In this case, successful in vivo restriction and religation will lead to the loss of the RFP, which can also easily be detected.
Results:
We cloned a lac-inducible promoter in front of SceI and various inducible and constitutive promoters in front of the T4 ligase. During our attempts to design the construct coding for RFP flanked by SceI restriction sites, we managed to insert both restriction sites in front of and following the RFP by annealing oligonucleotide duplexes.
2) Chemostat selection
Questions:
Do E. coli strains carrying differently sized genomes differ in growth rates?
Can the growth rate of thymidylate synthase knockout strains be modified by regulating the external thymidine supply?
Do thymidylate synthase knockout strains containing a reduced genome grow faster than strains carrying a larger genome under limiting thymidine concentrations?
Method:
In order to be able to examine the growth behaviors of E. coli strains carrying differently sized genomes, we ordered an E. coli strain (MDS42) whose genome had been reduced by 15 % using a targeted deletion approach. Also, we ordered the wild-type strain which the MDS42 had been derived from. In order to be able to keep track of the individual growth rates of the wild-type and MDS42 strains if grown in a mixed culture, we wanted to label these two strains. Finally, for knocking out the thymidylate synthase, we decided to use phage transduction.
Results:
We successfully knocked out the thymidylate synthase, both in the wild-type and the MDS42 E. coli strains. Also, we managed to label the wild-type and the MDS42 E. coli strains by transformation of low-copy plasmids encoding different reporter proteins. Finally, we successfully performed growth experiments showing that the growth rate of thymidylate synthase knockout strains can be"

•7 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate
•5 g of sodium sulfite
All chemicals are weighted with analytic balance in the weighing boats, which must not be wet during the weighting. Add a few milliliters of MQ to dissolve the chemicals and then fill the flask to the begging of narrow neck.  First prepare the flask with pH=5, then repeat the procedure for pH = 6, pH=7, pH=8.
Media G5-G68 are prepared following these instructions:
•Put the beaker with the empty Falcon centrifuge tube on the balance and press TARE
•Weigh 35 g of solution from the flask and pour the chemicals in it. Always wash the weighing boats with water and pour the water in the Falcon centrifuge tube
•Add the media from the flask up to 39 g and regulate the pH value with appropriate NaOH or HCl solution
•Place the tube on the Vortex machine for 20 seconds
•Check the pH value again and if it is not suitable, regulate it again!
•Fill the Falcon centrifugate tube up to 40,00 g and close it.
Inoculation of genetically modified E.coli:
Bacteria were inoculated on the new LB plate in laminar:
•One colony is taken from the previous plate with inoculation loop
•Gently draw a new plate with inoculation loop (6-times left and right, one down and another left to right)
•Wrap the LB plate with the parafilm
•Date and name of the bacteria were written on each sample and medium were put in the incubator set on 37°C.
Instructions for an autoclave:
Autoclave is filled with laboratory equipment for disengagement, closed with the lid and the lid is tighten with screws. The level of water is checked; if not in the blue area, you open the valve and add distilled water through the funnel and close the valve. Then, close the steam conduit and turn on the autoclave with the switch on the wall so that the red light lits. When the pressure reaches the value of 1 bar, the green light turns on and the autoclaving begins. Gently open the steam conduit. After the autoclaving is over, the autoclave must be turn off, the filtration of air is turned on and the steam conduit is completely opened. Wait until the autoclave is completely cooled down to open the lid.

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," Dr. Pleiss group. So the system has a constant number of atoms, same volume and the same temperature (NVT), so called a canonical ensemble. Furthermore the simulation, in which the temperature and pressure is constant, is started on the bwHP Cluster using a modified script provided by the group of Prof. Dr. Pleiss. The bwHPC is a high performance computing cluster of the state of Baden-Württemberg.  We used the Tier 3 bwHPC clusters of Karlsruhe ( bwUniCluster ) shown in figure 6 and Tübingen ( bwForCluster BinAC ). The trajectory was analyzed using a script (modified from the IBTB bioinformatics group ). RMSD, radius of gyration and SASA were calculated and plotted using xmgrace [3] in linux.
Enzymes
An analysis of the three different proteins CALB, PLE and FSC was performed. CALB was chosen since it was reported to accept a broad range of substrates [4] , [5] . The other two enzymes were chosen because they show a similar reaction mechanism with a comparable catalytic triad but a more open conformation. Therefore, we suggested that bigger substrates as chitosan and dirhamnolipids may be accepted better when less steric hindrance occurs.
For CALB, a tetrahedral intermediate can be observed when the carboxy group from one of the substrates is attacked by Ser 105 leading to an acylated intermediate. This intermediate can be further processed when the second substrate enters the active site leading to an ester bond formation between both substrates. In our case, dirhamnolipid provides the carboxy group while chitosan carries a hydroxy group for the second reaction step under water-free conditions (compare to Figure 2). PLE and FSC show a similar reaction mechanism since their catalytic triad also consists of a Serine (Ser), a Histidine and an acidic residue such as Glutamic acid or Asparagic acid.

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#Project#Explore the Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," the research environment – safety takes priority over getting cool scientists.
Arguments:
1.Social Consequences:
a) Respecting Societal Values: Lots of people think that life is God given. There are three criteria for when we allow human intervention in life: i) necessary, ii) safe, iii) understood consequences.
b) Animal Rights: people feel empathy for animals and kinship with them – we are not just out to be the best species. Experiments on animals must be necessary and reduce harms to humans. Unfettered experimentation does not fit this criteria.
c) What is human? Experiments like growing human organs in pigs make us question what it means to be human. This is a question society may not be ready to address.
Third Proposition Speaker
Competitor at the World Debate Championships 2009
Top Novice Speaker and Top Novice Team at the National Championships 2009
Refutation:
Re: what is human: humans are genetic code and that’s it.
Re: criteria for when meddling with life is acceptable:
i) necessary: see argument 1
ii) safe: this was addressed by the first two speakers – there would still be consequences to deter harmful creations, ex: the FDA looks for toxic side effects.
iii) understandable – science never is, and that hasn’t stopped us, because science is necessary.
Re: respecting the natural order: why should we?
Re: cross breeding organisms is more reliable: genetics is just moving a gene from one organism to another, there are only a few possible effects. Often, genetic engineering isn’t actually introducing genes, but knocking them out to study their relationships.
Argument:
1)What is science? There are two kinds of science – methodical science and leaps-and-bounds science, and the latter has lead to many great discoveries (ex: PCR). We need faster scientific progress now, as through leaps-and-bounds. The need for faster science is due in part to population growth – we expanded our food supply once through developing fertilizers and pesticides, but we need to expand its gain by developing better plants. As genetic technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, we also need research to progress quickly to stay a step ahead of people using science for malicious purposes. Moreover, we need science to stay ahead of pest and bacterial evolution, to speed up seasonal flu vaccine production, etc.

iGEM Team Düsseldorf
iGEM Team Düsseldorf for iGEM Team Aachen
Our teams met for the first time at the German iGEM meetup in Marburg held in the beginning of August. There we exchanged our project ideas. We found out that both our projects are dealing with light activation. We discussed different ideas to irradiate our samples. iGEM Team Düsseldorf uses a so called light box, where the LED is fixed at the top and can be used to irradiate the samples with light of a specific wavelength. This seemed to be a good device for our activation process too.
iGEM Düsseldorf offered to build such a light box for our project as well. Because we need a specific wavelength for the activation of our non-canonical amino acid, we sent them one of our LEDs. They integrated this LED in their device and created a similar device for our purpose.
We used the device to study the activation of O-(2-Nitrobenzyl)-L-tyrosine (ONB-Y). ONB-Y was exposed to UV light for different exposure times. The activated ONB-Y samples were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results reveal that when the exposure time was increased the cleavage of ONB-Y was higher. This was confirmed by the presence of a peak corresponding to 2-nitroso benzaldehyde i.e. the cleaved product.

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEMers’ online communication this year:
In this way, most of the common problems can be solved as quickly as possible, and the members can get inspiration from these communication.
b) Make it more convenient for the following iGEM teams:
Excepting for presenting every team’s project, most of the members shares their experiences on this platform,                                 during the preparation process of competition. Based on these resources, the following iGEM teams can get many information at their beginning and avoid many mistakes.
c) To publics
We think that every iGEMer has the duty to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to public. So that’s what we do, giving relative courses to anyone interested in it. With this union, we also introduce the idea of iGEM competition, and what we gained in the challenging process to attract more people to participat in iGEM competition.
To achieve these goal, we tried hard.
The first step is to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other                                 teams and propagandize to the public. This way, all the followers can get to know the member teams and communicate with them. For us, it makes investigating and getting feedback from the public more easily.
We led the HP union and started the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan, Jilin-China, Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.
We shared some articles about issues containing biological safety, ethics, iGEM                                 competition and other controversial topics which are concerned by public.
Besides, we plan to provide new teams or the potential participating teams with resources including union members’ project introduction and team members’ personal contact information                                 attached with attribution.
This way, it can facilitate the communication among students.
We truly hope, in the coming future, more and more iGEM teams can                                 join our iGEM Union, more and more students can participate in iGEM competition.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."
Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html," from the phage genome, so that it would be incapable of integrating into the host genome.
Cloning work with the lambda phage genome is tricky, because it contains few single-cutter restriction sites. Therefore we had to cut out one fragment containing the int, the xis and another gene, gam. Xis and int can and shall be discarded, but the gam gene codes for a protein that prevents the overhanging single strains at the cos sites from being degraded by host enzymes. So we would need the gam gene in our engineered phage. This is why we designed an insert for the phage to put in the remaining genome after cutting out the fragment containing xis, int and gam. This insert contains gam, and an antibiotic selection marker to be able to select those bacterial clones that contain the lambda genome.
We also added a GFP gene for visualizing and measurement purposes. To be able to later modify this phage insert again, we added special restriction sites to only cut out the non-phage genes.

When designing the probiotic bacterium to kill pathogens, we had one problem to solve: the probiotic bacteria should not be lysed by the release of the phages, but the phages had to get into the target bacteria. Therefore we decided to use conjugation for this task. Conjugation is the most important bacterial tool to transfer genetic information between and across species. It enables them to adapt very fast to environmental conditions - antibiotic resistances are also spread via conjugation. Our project aims at fighting infectious diseases which cannot be treated with antibiotics any more because of these resistances. We decided to fight pathogens using their own weapon!
In general, conjugation is the unidirectional transfer of genetic information from a donor cell to a recipient. This genetic information can be a conjugative or mobilizable plasmid or a transposon. Normally, conjugation needs direct cell contact and the formation of a plasma bridge between the cells.
A conjugative plasmid of gram negative bacteria contains a characteristic set of genes and sequences. The tra locus includes the genes for the sex pili and for proteins that carry out synthesis, replication and transfer of the DNA during mating.

The sex pili are formed by pilin and regulatory proteins. These are polymeric structures that extend into the periphery from the surface of the donor cell and can attach to the surface of other bacteria and initiate conjug"

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Properties of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is known as a model organism, the first strains were isolated about 60 years ago (1). The algae diverged from land plants over one billion years ago and comes from a linage of Viridiplantae. C. reinhardtii is built up by a basal body with two connected anterior flagella used for environmental sensing, mating and swimming. It is approximately 10 μm in size and has a chloroplast containing its photosynthetic apparatus as well as metabolic pathways (2). The algae occurs in two genetically mating types, + and – alleles of a mating type complex. Mixing the two types will rapidly form a diploid cell that turns into a heavy walled zygospore.
Why this model organism?
C. reinhardtii is used as a model organism for several reasons. Firstly, it is very easy to culture in many different environments as long as there is access to fresh water or soil and carbon dioxide. It is also possible to grow the algae in dark if a carbon source is provided. Secondly, this microalgae has a very short generation time and is easy to manipulate genetically since its entire genome has been sequenced.
Saftey
According to previous research, C. reinhardtii poses no human health risk at all (3). As a precaution however one should treat it as a biosafety class 1 when it has been genetically modified (4).
Previous research
There has been a study, with an aim to see if it worked to modify the algae CRISPR-Cas9 where they have successfully modified C. reinhardtii using this system. The study was however unsuccessful to retrieve any transformants with Cas9. Since the promoter of Cas9 was constitutively activated, the research group concluded that the cells did not grow fast enough due to Cas9 being toxic to the algae. They speculated that this was probably due to the Cas9 interfering with the survival of the C. reinhardtii, although they did not speculate as to how Cas9 interfered with cell growth. (5). In that study they also suggested as a future change,"

The samples were labelled ""Nuc"" and the negative control was labelled ""Neg"". Only one volume of negative control was used.
Figure 12. Absorbance  measured for different treatments of Nuc using P. aeruginosa as biofilm-producer.
The figure illustrates how Nuc dispersed biofilm produced by P. aeruginosa. There is a significant difference between the negative control and each of the three volumes of Nuc. As the volume of Nuc increases, the absorbance at 595 nm tends to decrease. This implicates that Nuc significantly dispersed biofilm compared to the negative control.

The figure illustrates how Nuc dispersed biofilm produced by S. aureus. There is a significant difference between the negative control and each of the three volumes of Nuc. This implicates that Nuc significantly dispersed biofilm compared to the negative control.
Demonstrating bacteriolytic activity of Nuc
A Kirby-Bauer test is suitable to perform to test the bacteriolytic activity. For this particular test, the E. coli TOB1 strain is used. The bacteria are streaked on antibiotic-free agar plates onto which small circular filter papers impregnated with the bactericide are placed. Additionally to the cell lysate samples containing the combat protein, a positive control in the form of an antibiotic are applied as a reference. The bactericidal activity can then be measured by measuring the “halo” around the impregnated Whatman paper. The larger halo, the higher bactericidal activity.
Kirby-Bauer: First attempt [❌]
The growth of the bacteria was unevenly distributed on the agar plates which made it difficult to observe any clear results from most of the impregnated filter papers. The filter papers that were actually surrounded with cells did not show any signs of impeding growth.
Troubleshooting
A higher concentration of the initial liquid culture of TOB1 cells will be used for the test to make sure that the entire area of the agar plate will be covered with sufficient amount of cells. Also, the filter paper used were not optimal for the experiment, which could have affected the dispersion of the nuclease.

Initial Interviews
Talking with Suncor's Christine Daly on Biology in the Oil Sands
We spoke with Christine Daly, an Aquatic Reclamation Research Coordinator at Suncor Energy Inc. Christine expressed an interest in our project in 2011 and was willing to discuss this year’s project design with us. One major point that was brought up early on was that engineered organisms might outcompete existing tailings ponds bacteria, and Christine had similar reservations. To address these concerns, we created our bioreactor system, which would physically contain our bacteria, and also a genetic killswitch mechanism . Another interesting point brought up in this discussion was how the oil industry is currently looking into biology as one of many potential alternative methods to remediate the toxic components of tailings ponds and the oil sands in general. There is research using other systems such as algal bioremediation, but practical implementations of biology in the oil sands are rare. Oil industries do, however, appear to show an increased interest in biology (and in turn, synthetic biology) as a possible solution to various problems, a sentiment reflected in our dialogue with the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative .
The full interview can be viewed below.
BioAlberta's Ryan Radke on Biology in the Oil Sands
We were also able to consult with BioAlberta president Ryan Radke on the viability of using biologically based systems in the petroleum industry. He believed that bioremediation technologies will be critical to the future of the oil sands in the next 10-15 years, however he raised the concern of how we could sell biotechnology to an industry that is already very successful from a profit point of view. He emphasized the social welfare benefits that the industry, under heavy environmental criticism, could gain from this technology as a major selling point and stressed the need to educate the oil industry about the benefits of synthetic biology. This would involve putting aspects of our system into large-scale, comprehensive terms to sell to those without a biology background. For example, quantifying the amount of toxins that the system can process per unit time and the value of hydrocarbons produced is something that could potentially appeal to investors. We feel as though the synthetic biology dialogue with the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative was a great start to bridging the gap between the petroleum industry and synthetic biology. From a public perspective point of view we discussed the need to stress the fact our system is simply a modification of ""natural"" processes - that is we"

For next week, after meeting with Cesar, we had agreed to focus on animation for now. The physics and details can be added later as we gain experience and insight with the molecules we working on.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
Justin kept working on animating TALE binding to DNA, except this time he will also add ferritin, coils and linkers. The result is ferritin sphere + 12 TALE's + 24 coils and linkers + 1 DNA. Unfortunately the computer he is working on is not powerful enough to smoothly handle this, as a result of the slow response from the computer his progress has been slow. For me the work is to animate immobilized TALE binding to DNA. The difficulty lies in finding out how TALE should deform such that it can bind to DNA while one end of it is immobilized. For this Justin and I actually spend some time playing with wires that represent TALE and DNA to figure out the proper motion. Moreover Maya just behaves oddly on our computers; sometimes we can't generate DNA using the ePMV plug-in, sometimes the button on the Maya shelf will disappear. As a result we have accumulated a lot of technical questions that we were hoping to address.
We spent a lot this weeks meeting with Cesar talking about the big pictures and the approach he would like to see. He advised us to abandon the way we had been doing animation, which is by key framing, and switch to Nucleus engine. We are going to hold off on these adjustments until after our meeting with Merry, the expert on Maya, has taken place.
Week 16: August 12 - August 16
The computer Justin was using for his animation work complained about the depletion of RAM. As a result he couldn't work effectively in the lab, so we agreed to let him work at home for he has a much powerful desktop. This means that except Monday he was not here with the rest of the lab, but he will show up on the group meeting next Monday to report upon his progress.
Our meeting with Cesar on Monday resulted in division of labour between Justin and me. From that time I will be working on the quantitative modelling (on what problem is yet determined) while Justin will be responsible for the animation (that is, the entire story telling). This supports the decision of letting him work at home, for now there is no need of cooperation between the two of us. For now I studied nDynamics per request of Cesar in case"
Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," have genes.  Genes determine how these living things, also known as organisms, look, what they do, and how they function.  In synthetic biology, genes can be taken from one type of organism and put into another.  This allows the modified organism to exhibit traits that it would not exhibit in nature.  For instance, by putting a gene from a firefly into bacteria, you can make the bacteria glow.
They were given a scale from ‘strongly negative’ to ‘strongly positive.’  We then converted the responses to a Likert scale with a maximum value of 5 and a minimum value of 0. Participants were later asked:
Would you drink water that is purified by bacteria if there are no bacteria in the water when you drink it, and the water is shown to be safe?
They were able to select either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as responses.  This map displays the percentage of ‘yes’ responses, leaving out either blank or ‘no’ responses.  The maximum value is 10, and the minimum value is 0.
Comparing these maps shows a possible discrepancy between feelings towards synthetic biology in the abstract and applications of synthetic biology.  Feelings toward synthetic biology appear to be, on average, neutral, but, for every region, at least 50% of participants responded that they would drink water cleaned through synthetic biological means, provided assured safety.
This shows promise that, with increased awareness of potential applications for synthetic biology, views may improve.
Figure 1. Comparison of percentage of people who would eat rice genetically modified to produce vitamins and percentage of people who would drink water filtered by bacteria if assured there were no bacteria in the water at the time of consumption.  Bubbles are sized by general opinion towards synthetic biology (based on a Likert scale from ‘strongly negative’ to ‘strongly positive’).
There seems to be a slight positive correlation between willingness to eat GMO rice and drink bacterially purified water.  However, in all regions, more participants were willing to drink the bacterially purified water than eat the modified rice.  There does not seem to be any relations between feelings towards synthetic biology (shown by the size of the bubbles, larger being more positive feelings) and willingness to consume either the rice or the water.
In general, the public had positive feelings towards synthetic biology and genetic modification. Throughout the survey, we   placed questions to see if semantics affected the public’s perception of topics. When asked if they would consume GMOs,   there were many responses for both ‘yes’ and ‘no.’ However, when asked about eating specific genetically"

Furthermore, we remove all traces of GMA after the synthesis and confirmed this with H-NMR.                             The final product is thus completely safe. DMAP is a base that acts as a catalyst for the                             coupling of GMA to the dextran molecules. It is toxic if swallowed and fatal in contact with                             skin. In the absence of a catalyst, no GMA incorporation could be detected (5). However, we                             researched alternatives to catalyse the reaction. Triethylamine and pyridine are no reasonable                             alternatives due to the associated high conversion times (5).  Another alternative for DMAP                             could be tri-ethylenediamine, also known as DABCO. DABCO is like DMAP an organic base and                             therefore it can theoretically catalyse the methacrylation reaction. However, unlike DMAP,                             DABCO possesses less toxic properties and DABCO is much safer to handle than DMAP. DABCO is                             from an economical point of view also a better choice as its commercially available for a lower                             price. A downside to using DABCO as a catalyst for this methacrylation reaction is that it is                             less basic than DMAP (6). As the deprotonation of hydroxyl groups by a base is the driving force                             for the reaction, the reaction time will most likely increase when DABCO is employed as a                             catalyst instead of DMAP. A comparison of the performance of DABCO in our reaction is required                             to make an informed choice between DMAP and DABCO.
Methacrylation of the non-hazardous dextran results in molecules with very toxic and carcinogenic                             properties due to the reactive methacryl groups (7).  No material safety data sheet exist for                             methacrylated dextran. To safely handle this toxic viscous oil, it is kept in the fume hood at                             all times and only handled using piston pipettes or syringes. To purify the methacrylated                             dextran from the organic mixture, we dialyse it against demineralized water . To verify the                             complete removal of the DMSO, DMAP and GMA, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the                             dialyzed reaction product was compared with the spectra of pure DMAP and GMA. After 72 hours of                             dialysis, trace amounts of unidentified by-products could be observed in the NMR spectrum. After                             one week of dialysis, no"

After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Different sample gel preparation conditions. 12% SDS PAGE of Tn5 (expected size 53.3kDa)  Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 950C 30min, lane 3 950C 15min, lane 4 750C 7min, lane 5 No boiling.
A double band for Tn5 observed for all conditions, both bands from the 12% gel were excised and sent for mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands were full length Tn5 with both the N and C terminal intact. This concluded that there was not any protease digestion and that the results are potentially due to a gel artifact. As a result, the purification will continue.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.

Latest Updates
We reinforced and optimized the search database server. So, now you can get search results faster.
We added the currently available data of 2012 teams to the search database server. So you can get search results including 2012 teams.
Overview
Past project search is a search tool for past project wikis. It is a web based tool so there is no bother with platform. You merely input words that represent your interest and hit the search button. This tool searches all team wikis and abstracts throughout the years and displays the results with user-friendly UI.
Background
Until today we could not search for past projects across different years. This is unfortunate for all iGEM participants that they were not able to get knowledge about past teams easily. You had to reach team wikis using only tracks, regions, and team names from a list that does not contain any specific information about the project. Or you can search using the upper right search box on the iGEM official top page of each year. But this result depends on team projects at only one year. Using this Past Project Search, you can obtain these team information at once.
Methods
Past team wiki pages were retrieved using python scripts and Mediawiki API (http://20**.igem.org/wiki/api.php). Team information such as region, team track, abstract, and so on, was retrieved using python scripts (from https://igem.org/Team.cgi?id=***). These data were combined, converted to JSON format and stored in our own server. Regarding the search engine, open source software called ""elasticsearch"" (elasticsearch.org) was used as a backend search engine.
Results
Now, you can search for past projects across multiple years. You can narrow down search results according to track, medal, year, award and region. You can also get easy access to a team’s information from the search results page; for example their project title, project abstract, and school details. In addition, you can access past team presentation slides, video, and posters from this page, which in the past had"

Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," University of Florida, we developed an effective electroporation protocol. Our attempts at electroporation were based on protocol used successfully on other organisms. We evaluated parameters such as cell washing number and solutions, DNA concentration, pre- and post-electroporation incubation, and voltage of electroporation.
Goal 4: Clone or synthesize an ACC deaminase from bacterial or fungal sources
Dr. Gregory Bonito’s Lab at Michigan State University maintains a culture collection of fungi and bacteria isolated from plants and soil. Several of these isolates have confirmed or suspected acdS genes (coding for ACC deaminase), including Fusarium oxysporum, Trichoderma sp., Ralstonia picketii, and Burkholderia sp. From our own culturing, we isolated Pseudomonas and Burkholderia cultures which expressed ACC deaminase activity. We were successfully able to clone acdS from Pseudomonas sp. 1C2P-04, isolated from a wild grass species.
Goal 5: Transform the bacteria to allow for fluorescent labeling and ACC deaminase expression
We first attempted to transform the bacteria using a simple fluorescent expression vector, and we used BBa_K608011 for this purpose. After many attempts were were unable to see expression with this vector, and we attempted to express acds in bacteria and detect its expression by plating on DF-ACC agar. These trials were unsuccessful, and we transitioned back to proof-of-concept using fluorescent markers. After finally observing fluorescent colonies, we proceeded to construct the fusion protein acdS-eGFP in the part BBa_K2633000 . This part was first built using cloned sequences and was not restriction legal. A later synthesized version was constructed. While our transformed bacteria have been observed to be fluorescent, we have not observed ACC deaminase activity in the transformed bacteria.
Goal 6: Demonstrate that the transformed bacteria could reinfect a grass and persist in roots
Multiple attempts were made to infect Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species, with our transformed bacteria. Early on we experienced poor germination rates, likely because the seeds were of poor quality. After our first plants had grown to maturity and produced seeds, we then had high quality seed for growing plants. We then inoculated plants with wild-type, eGFP expressing, and acdS-eGFP expressing FCP2-01, using seed soaking. Seed soaking was used instead of addition to soil to address concerns about transfer between plants and the spraying of transformed bacteria. We observed these plants each week for "

The aim of the project of iGEM Eindhoven is to create a living material: a new type of hybrid material with integrated living organisms.                      Using the power of synthetic biology, new genetic circuits can be engineered to yield smart, responsive                      and adaptive materials and devices capable of performing                      advanced functions. Our organism of choice for such a material is E. coli,                      the workhorse of synthetic biology. In designing and realizing such a complex material,                      we applied the following universal engineering principles:
Modularity: Our design consists out of separate parts that                      we individually characterize and optimize before integrating them into a coherent system
Reproducibility: Our design must yield reproducible results & behaviour in our experiments
Prototyping: To test the performance of our design, we create prototypes which we can rapidly test to adapt our design
Safe-by-Design: During the design process, we consider safety in an integrative way right from                     the start. Please also see our Safe-by-Design page for more information on how we implemented                     this engineering principle during our project.
No concept is convincing without a concrete application scenario. Therefore, we divided ourselves                   in two groups, one group working on the living material itself and one working on the application                   scenario necessary to illustrate the potential of living materials to the general public.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.

Living Materials as Platform for New Technological Innovations
Current challenges impeding the successful realization of living materials are the demanding requirements for a viable environment for living                          organisms and biosafety concerns regarding the escape of genetically modified organisms into the environment (1) . These issues led to design requirements,                          preferences and constraints that apply to our living material. These are general concepts, since the living material we propose can be used for many different applications. For each application, more specific criteria would apply. We go into more detail in our application scenario of a living material as a patch for burn & chronic wound healing (see below).
Requirements:

For detailed information, take a look at our Lab notebook → E. 2 HIS-Tagging of mmo genes .
Scheme of our His-tagged constructs flanked by a weak RBS and a double terminator under control of the inducible LacI+pL promoter.
3. Expression of His-construct
Plasmids containing the  final His-tagged constructs were then transformed into chemo-competent E. coli cells and the single tagged subunits were expressed by induction with IPTG. To isolate the soluble and inclusion protein fractions,  the cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE followed by an immunostain via His-tag was performed in order to verify the expression of  the subunits. Unfortunately, only two subunits were detectable (MMOC and MMOX).  For the purpose of producing all of the MMO subunits efficiently we tested the coexpression of different combinations of known chaperone proteins. With their help the E. coli cells were able to express each of the six MMO subunits in soluble form. Hence, we are the first to efficiently produce all of these MMO subunits in the heterologous organism E.coli.
For detailed information, take a look at our Lab notebook → E. 5 Expression of HIS-constructs .
4. Assembly of the sMMO gene construct
After ensuring that all the subunits of the MMO were producible in E. coli using the right combination of chaperones, we decided to assemble all of them in one construct, thus creating our methane degrading E. cowli! To allow a subsequent induction of our final construct containing all six of the MMO subunit genes we again used the lac-promotor in combination with a weak RBS and a double terminator. To make sure that every subunit-encoding gene is translated, a single RBS is inserted upstream of every gene.

"
Pittsburgh,2018,Team:Pittsburgh#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to converge on correct estimates, especially when tracking highly non-linear systems. An intuitive way to reason why this error occurs is to think of a line tangent to a function of very high curvature. Even after small deviations from the intersection point, the tangent line diverges sharply from the function. This error translates to deformed distributions in the case of the extended Kalman filter.
Particle Filter:
After discussion with Dr. Ahmed Dallal of the University of Pittsburgh’s ECE department, our team decided to also explore another type of sequential bayesian filter called a particle filter. Just like the kalman filter, this method has a predict and update step, but instead of using covariances to track the shape of the distribution, this method uses a number of points scattered throughout the state space. Each of these points transition to the next time step based on the prediction function, forming the a priori distribution. Next the update process happens in two parts: Each particle is assigned a weight corresponding to its distance from the measurement, and then this weighted distribution is sampled to form a new posterior distribution. There exist a variety of resampling methods available, but we chose to use systematic resampling in accordance with results from Hol, Schon, and Gustafsson [Hol et. al]. This helps the filter to converge faster and to prevent sample degeneracy, in which particles collapse to a single state and fail to represent the correct distribution.
While more demanding computationally, the particle filter is able to consistently track arbitrary distributions with non-linear dynamics. Simulations using thousands of particles could still be conducted on the scale of a minute using a standard laptop.
Example of 1000 particles going through the predict/update cycle
Filter Testing:
To ensure that our parameter estimation methods could produce unique and identifiable results, we put them through two tests. First, we first tested them on a toy example in which parameters were known. Afterwards we moved on to the more complex set of equations believed to be governing the base editor reactions, but simulating data with literature values of parameters.
In the toy example, we established the equations for a simple binding model, where two components A and B combine to form C. We chose 1 min-1*M-1 for the forward rate constant and 0.1 for the reverse, and then simulated the results using a stiff ode solver (matlab ode15s). We then added artificial measurement noise (gaussian, variance of 1 nM at about 10% of the total range).

Why iGEM:
The first time I herd about iGEM was though a friend who attended one of the information sessions from the year before, I was curious so I decided to check it out.  I was astonished with the creativity, freedom, and quality of the projects and I told myself that I need to be a part of this experience
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I would love to work on my wet lab skills and learn the in’s and out’s of designing biological systems. Since this is my first experience with iGEM and synthetic biology I am excited to soak in as much information as I can.
What inspires you:
To put it simply, good music, good friends, and good cheer.
Desired Impact on the World:
I think microbes are fascinating and for the time being I see myself transforming the world through creative research. But who knows, I’m sure iGEM will allow me to open my mind to new possibilities within science, business, and policy alike.
Hobbies:
I love beer, craft beer to be precise, and I love to share it with friends.

Fisal Elstone
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences, Graduated May 2014!
Why iGEM:
I joined IGEM last year because it remains a unique undergraduate experience that forces teams of students try to solve problems in a multidimensional, collaborative manner. This multidimensional approach seems reflective of how problems are solved in the working world and there are few opportunities to work on projects like this in an undergraduate degree. I was also drawn in by the incredible imagination and success of past teams! Needless to say, I really enjoyed the IGEM experience and hence I decided to return.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain an appreciation and a broader sense of what is possible as a undergrad in todays scientific community. From the project itself I hope to improve my wetlab skills as well as gain more exposure to the academic/industry interface.
What inspires you:
Honestly IGEM really inspires me; it’s quite remarkable to see passionate young scientists working towards ambitious projects and collaborating with other students from around the globe. I am a big fan of the Jamboree in particular.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to help people and to this day it"

In our human practice section, we have demonstrate how we gain the idea of S-Din and how we enhanced it during the summer. We will do the same job for future improvement of S-Din, to make S-Din more popular and well-featured.
4. Dynamic data flow for synthetic biology.
During the brain storm, we want to add the feature that can provide dynamic data (news, latest paper) which can automatically upgraded everyday. Due to the limitation of time, we didn't merge this function into our software. In the future, these feature will be also added.
5. System optimization of the whole genome with the inserted circuits.
As a software team in synthetic biology, we felt responsible to build a software that can truly utilize the power of computer and algorithm to manage synthetic biologists  to accomplish important and complexed tasks. After circuits getting used seamlessly from search results, an consideration of the genome level are going into our sight. As the electronic system, performance and connection can be optimized to a most efficient or robustest way.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
Motivation
As described in the project section, our vision is to provide a platform that allows to connect BioBricks.
Although we  have not yet been able to create a reliable and robust switch in the lab, we still want to demonstrate the power and simplicity of our approach: The following program (written in Java) allows the user to put together a network of logic gates and BioBricks as input and output. Here, we give the user the choice between a few input and ouput BioBricks. In principle, any (of at least 200) transcription-regulating BioBrick can be used as an input, and any gene can serve as an output. After entering the network, the software uses our current designs for AND, OR and NOT gates to generate one single DNA plasmid that contains the custom network - including all logical elements.
Our vision: Put in your logical network and get out your DNA implementation!
Program

TecMonterrey_GDA,2017,Team:TecMonterrey GDA#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the first step by removing lignocellulose from the bagasse (Trejo, Oriol, López, Reoussos, Viniegra y Raimba, 1991). In this process there are used effluents from the dairy industry as a growth medium, nutrient solutions, and inductor components such as hydrolases and sucrose. At the end of the process, the treated bagasse is stabilized to obtain a neutral pH.
It is important to add that the effluents from the dairy industry are highly polluting, and in its majority they are fluids with high concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins (Munavalli y Saler, 2009., Kushwaha, Srivastava  y Mall, 2011), that also contain a low concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen (Rocha, Tenorio y Cortes,  2015), which means that can be used as a growth medium for microorganisms, and for the enhancement of PHA production given that our recombinant bacteria produces more PHA in stress conditions. However, in order to use these compounds as a growth medium they must go through a pretreatment that includes a procedure to remove grease from the effluents by using a grease trap. After this process, the sedimentable solids have to be removed from the crude effluent the sedimentable solids, so that these can’t cause future problems with PHA extraction. To achieve the removal, sedimentation and filtration processes are needed to  actually remove all the solids.
At the end of these proceedings, the crude effluent that has been pretreated can now be used inside an aerobic reactor for PHA production. Before entering the bioreactor for PHA production, the effluent is mixed with the pretreated bagasse. The variation in the chemical composition of the effluents of the dairy industry are not high enough, which means that we can actually have a concentration pattern of chemical compounds used in our processes.
By using the aerobic bioreactor with the previously processed effluent from the dairy industry and the bagasse, it is expected that our recombinant bacteria actually has the capacity to produce PHA. Escherichia coli BL21 was the bacteria selected to be transformed with PHA production genes from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 because it is not only cheaper and easier to grow and maintain, but also because higher yields of PHA can be obtained.
The next step after the production of PHA inside the reactor is the extraction of PHA. It was decided that the process should begin with the lysis of our bacteria."

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," model meant adding millions, maybe even billions of new interactions.
The equilibration phase decreases the temperature of the protein and its solvent to allow it to settle back down into a local medium, usually a lower one than the previous minimum attained.
5 Na+ ions were also added to neutralise the protein.
This model represents the full Cerberus system. It features the unnatural amino acid incorporated into the C-terminal linker, functions added onto the two binding sites that we wished to explore and characterise and a complete simulation environment containing water molecules and sodium ions. We were then ready to prepare it for the molecular dynamics phase.
Molecular Dynamics
Preparation of molecular dynamics simulations consisted of initial minimization steps (steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods) where atomic positions of solute were first restrained using a harmonic potential. The force constant was then progressively diminished throughout the minimization procedure until a final unrestrained minimization step. We first minimised our system over 5,000 steps with restraints on the whole protein to minimise the solvent and ions, then reduced the restraints gradually over five minimisation cycles, for 1,000 steps each cycle. One final minimisation was performed with no restraints for 10,000 steps.
The minimization procedure was then followed by a slow heating to 310 K over a period of 0.1ns, with a moderate restraint placed on the protein. At the final required temperature, the system was equilibrated for 100 ps using constant temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 bar) conditions via the Berendsen algorithm with a coupling constant of 0.2 ps for both parameters.  Along the equilibration, the restraints on the protein were gradually diminished. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle-mesh Ewald method with a nonbonded cutoff of 10 A. All bonds involving hydrogen were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm, allowing the use of 2 fs time steps to integrate the equations of motion.
Next came the production phase, where we can observe how the model behaves over a large period of time.  Depending on the size of the system and the resources available, this phase can last from a few nanoseconds up to a few hundred ns. Due to the explicit solvent in our model and the size of our platform, we needed vast amounts of processing power to simulate it for a long time.
Thanks to CALMIP, a regional high performance calculation mesocentre, we were able to model our platform for a sufficient period and obtain useable results. We used 100,000 CPU hours on their servers for our simulations,"

I wanted to be in the Judd iGEM team because it was a unique opportunity to get involved in an exciting field of biology that is not normally accessible to high school students. Being a part of the team has given me a great appreciation for the scientific process and the boundless potential of synthetic biology. iGEM is a wonderful way to get involved in current scientific research outside of the curriculum and as co-leader of human practices I have been able to explore the potential of our project and how developments in synthetic biology can have an impact on the global community. In the future, I hope to study medicine.

When the iGEM team was first advertised around our school, I knew nothing about synthetic biology and so it caught my attention. After being part of the Judd iGEM team, my understanding of synthetic biology has grown immensely, as well as my interest in the subject. Although I wish to read Classics at university, taking part in this competition has helped me as I have worked within a team to create such a brilliant project. Research, human practices and fundraising are the sub teams I have worked in the most, but allowing me to understand the science behind the lab work has been eye-opening and has improved my understanding of A Level Biology.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to take part in iGEM (or to understand lab work at least!). We attained knowledge on the biobrick assembly, the different ways to clone and also primer design. After the lecture, we were able to pitch our ideas to Dr Vitor who raised some key issues with some of our ideas and things that we didn’t think about before. We then had a chance to have some further discussions about the project as a team and came to the conclusion that we needed to narrow our ideas down more.
Sunday 26th June (2pm) - Team meeting
All team members met to decide on the aspects within our project that we want to explore in detail (post discussion from the meeting on Friday with Vitor). We also discussed ideas related to funding and sponsorship
Monday 27th June - Team meeting
Discussed our idea in depth and started to work as a team on the different biobricks we wanted to order. We decided to get every biobrick ready to order by Wednesday. It was a very productive day!
Tuesday 28th June - Meeting with Kim Morgan
Amandeep, Michelle, Abbie and Dale had a chance to meet with Kim Morgan (UCL communications and outreach coordinator at UCL) about possible outreach opportunities. We discussed that we needed to develop an action plan of exactly what we wanted to achieve. Further to this, we found out that we can be featured in an article (Which we were able to get published on the UCL outreach website)! Great kickstart to our human practices! Other team members focused on developing the documentation of each biobrick and also updating our wiki page and contacting people!
Wednesday 29th June - Team meeting
Team members met up to meet internal deadlines! We finally were able to order some DNA today which was exciting! We also started to build our logo today.
In the evening, we were given a wiki training session from Lewis Moffat, a member of UCL's 2014 team.
Thursday 30th June - Some team members attended the ISMB Symposium
Some team members were able to get a huge insight to what researchers around the world are working on when it comes to senescence. A very interesting talk that stimulated some really interesting thoughts on how we can potentially tackle ageing through senescence. We all had a chance to talk to Maximina after the talk who answered some of our questions about how we could incorporate this interesting research with our project. After the talk, Abbie, Amandeep and Kamil were able to start to work on meeting some deadlines (such as the proposal for the CRIS"

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," start-up and entrepreneurship within iGEM made a particular impact on the trajectory of our project. Having heard from Dr. Ben Reeve, a previous iGEM participant who has now established his own biotechnology company, we decided that we would attempt the Entrepreneurship track alongside work on our therapeutic. We have now met with a researcher to discuss patent law and the steps required for drug development and approval in the US, EU and other potential markets. We also attended workshops that encouraged a better understanding of organisation and planning and an iGEM troubleshooting session which helped us to understand the tasks we had to accomplish in the time we had remaining. In addition, the principal supervisor of the Imperial 2016 team, Dr. Karen Polizzi, gave a talk on the roles of individuals within the team and how to best utilise the expertise offered by each member. Our team is made up of biochemists, engineers, a chemist, medic and biologist and the diversity in subjects offers different areas of specialism to contribute to the project.
We also had the opportunity to give a short introduction to the work we have been doing this summer and listen to presentations from other teams. This allowed us to identify common elements between our project and those of other teams, which, in turn, led to the opportunity for collaboration. We also saw the vast number of ways in which synthetic biology can be used to solve real-world problems, for example, using RNAi to target crop pest such as aphids, a detection system for Listeria or the development of synthetic spiders’ silk in bacteria. This event was a good opportunity to meet with other UK based iGEM teams as well as chance to form important collaborations that we were able to work on over the rest of the summer.
Social Media
Reaching out to the public domain via social media platforms was an essential part to our project. Our regular posting included details of our project and our progress in the lab, as well as promoting both our online and lesson-style outreach work. The social media accounts were successful at engaging the public to complete surveys, as well as serving as a vital tool for communication and collaboration between different iGEM teams. We concentrated on promoting our team as being approachable and open to collaboration with the public and other research groups."

Applied
Considering the designing of an end product that can track down illegal drug laboratories.
Full Summary
Integration of human practices into our project
The input of the stakeholders, experts and public considerably influenced our project, altering the application of our sensor from a biosensor introduced in the environment to a handheld-device. Safety, low-costs and rapidly available quantified data were leading values in both project and product design processes. All requirements and difficulties emanating from the interactions were considered and integrated into the project, which is summarized below.
Finding a suitable application
We commenced with a method detecting botulism toxin in surface water, a serious issue for both wild animals and humans. In this case, quick demonstration of botulism presence and finding its source is important. However, upon discussing the topic with experts of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), we decided that introduction of GMO into the environment would not be feasible. Therefore, we shifted our attention to the application of the sensor as a lab tool to measure the presence of a certain compound.
Since our system was not specifically aimed at botulism toxins, the decision was made to detect toxins in food. However, after a literature search we concluded that the size of toxins would be too large to be able to be detected by our system. This lead us to focus on the detection of small molecules in food. Jos van der Vosse from the Netherlands Organisation for applied scientific research (TNO) advised us to focus on the detection of small molecules in water, since in this area measured concentrations are supposedly lower. Furthermore, he recommended us to assure the quantification of the signal and preferentially the concentrations as well.
Onno Epema from Rijkswaterstaat (part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management) pointed out the importance of pharmaceutical waste products in water, for which our system could improve the detection.
Surface water contaminants contain a wide variety of compounds, all with a different ecological impact. The meeting with Martin van den Berg, Deputy Director of the Institute Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), guided us to focus on one of the forthcoming most hazardous emerging contaminants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). These hormone mimicking compounds are used as antidepressant, and include pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. Even in low concentrations SSRIs are pharmacological active in vertebrates and have an ecological impact.
The interactions with both stakeholders and experts provided us with a number of applications for our biosensor, such as a pre-check for the chemical analysis and local sampling. To enable the use of DeTaXion to"

Bacterial Two Hybrid System
We managed to successfully overexpress Human haptoglobin and haemoglobin B in E. coli and purify both proteins. Unfortunately haemoglobin A subunit proved more difficult to overexpress.
Overexpression and Purification of Haemoglobin B
Overexpression of haemoglobin B.
Initial experiments were carried out to optimize expression of haemoglobin B within our E.coli chassis. We found the following conditions to be optimum: we subcultured 50µl of an overnight culture into fresh LB containing the appropriate antibiotics and grew the cells at 37°C until an OD600 of ~0.6 was reached. The production of protein was then induced by adding 1mM (final concentration) of IPTG then the cells were grown for a further 3 hours at 37°C. Next, 1ml of this culture was then taken for analysis by western immunoblot which showed that haemoglobin B was successfully overexpressed. The results from this are illustrated below in Figure 2.
Figure 1 - Overexpression of haemoglobin B. Single colonies of M15[pREP4] E. coli containing pQE80-L encoding hHBB were used to inoculate 5ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. These overnight cultures were then subcultured and grown at 37°C. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, they were induced with a range of IPTG concentrations. They were left to grow for a further three hours at 37°C, after which 1ml aliquots were pelleted, re-suspended in 100µl of Laemmli buffer and 20µl of these samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). This was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-his antibody. Western analysis shows production of of Human Haemoglobin B in E. coli (expected size - 16kDa).
Purification of haemoglobin beta.
This was then scaled up and 4 litres of E. coli containing pQE80-L hHBB was grown for purification of haemoglobin B by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC).  The optimum conditions for this were as follows: 4 x 1L of fresh LB growth medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin was inoculated with 50ml of haemoglobin beta overnight"

The Future of our Method
The Dutch Doping Authority has shown interest in the implementation of our method and the Delft Sport Engineering Institute is interested in further support of our research. More on this can be read on the Entrepreneurship page .  On top of this, we identified another market interested in our gene doping detection method: horse racing. Gene doping lately receives huge interest in the horse racing world. Earlier this year, the 37th Asian Racing Conference in Seoul specifically focussed on gene doping ( Bloodhorse, 17 May 2018 ), illustrating the imminent threat of gene doping in this world.
“Argentinian scientists have started performing gene editing on horses, and it is speculated that the first super-horse is likely to be produced by them as early as 2019.”
Dr. Teruaki Tozaki, technical advisor for the Laboratory of Racing Chemistry in Japan ( Bloodhorse, 17 May 2018 )
This year the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine even received $300.000 dollar towards the development of a gene doping detection system according to Kim Yuhl in the Online Pennsylvania Play Magazine ( Yuhl et al.

LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#chz project_-_-_TEXT.html," special and vital transcription factor, which can bound to either of marO's two promoter sites rs1 and rs2(rs means repressor binding site). And MarR repressor is homodimer. And it can form tetramer once there is copper for its special structure(Fig 3). Copper(II) oxidizes a cysteine residue (Cys80) on MarR to generate disulfide bonds between two MarR dimers, thereby inducing tetramer formation and the dissociation of MarR from its cognate promoter DNA, two sites of marO(Fig 4)[1]. Some experiments firmed the explanation(Fig 5)[1].
So we chose promoter marO as the copper sensor. Cu2+ can oxidize Cys80 and make MarR apart from marO to derepress the MarR dimer. Than the promoter marO will start the following genes' transcription. In our part BBa_K1755301, the report gene is riboflavin. So we associated the copper concentration with the output of riboflavin.
During our experiments, it is a big surprise for us to find that the marO is able to respond to Cr6+ as well though it is not so strong as Cu2+.

This year she also helped with contacting potential sponsors and raising awareness of iGEM within the University of Guelph. Maayan also assisted with laboratory experiments as she learned about the basics of molecular cloning.
In what little free time Maayan has as a biochemistry student she enjoys playing D&D.
Dry Lab Member: Julia Harvie
Julia is in her third year of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Guelph, and because one of her greatest joys in life is math (but no one tell her grade 12 functions teacher she is finally admitting that) she is also perusing a minor in Statistics. She is currently employed by the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario as a student researcher and works heavily with the BOLD System. Her career plan to take advantage of the niche that is being created due to next generation sequencing and other similar techniques that produce large data sets which require the skills of both a biologist and a statistician to analyze. Her goal is to remain employed by universities and other similar research based institutions for the rest of her life and never have to venture out into the real world. She was a late addition to the iGEM team, recruited due to her preference for science outside of the “wet lab”. She worked directly with the BioBricks, analyzing their provided information, performing literature reviews and designing an experiment to help categorize them. She was also actively involved in implementing the club component of iGEM at the University of Guelph.
With all the free time Julia has, she can be"

The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).

VioA generates an IPA imine from L-tryptophan and VioB converts the IPA imine into a dimer. VioE then acts by transforming the dimer into protodexyviolaceinic acid (PVA), which can be spontaneously converted into a green pigment called deoxychromoviridans. VioD and VioC hydroxylate PVA to form violacein.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," resistant to several antibiotics, which made it unfeasible to insert multiple plasmids containing the dCas9 and HMF pathway. It is resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol and carbenicillin was tested and had no effect on growth. Most recently, we are trying to insert the dCas9 system into the genome using homologous recombination, but that has also proved difficult. We decided to suspend this project until after the Jamboree and focus on the Codon Optimization project, which was also experiencing cloning difficulties.
What We Have Accomplished
Ashlee and Emily have managed to construct the first plasmid, termed plasmid 1.2, as shown below. This plasmid contains the dCas9 system (5.5 kb), the Lambda Red Recombinase system (3 kb) and the Kanamycin resistance marker (1 kb). It also contains two 1 kb genome overlaps with the P. putida upp gene. This gene encodes for the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase), which is sensitive to 5-fluorouracil. This would allow us to use a counterselection method to insert our second plasmid containing the HMF pathway. However, to construct the second plasmid, we needed the Kanamycin resistance marker to be inserted into the genome. Since this has not happened, we could not continue making plasmids.
The figure below displays the plan to insert the dCas9 and HMF gene cluster into the genome of Pseudomonas putida.
Insert the dCas9 system and HMF pathway into the P. putida genome
Note: Genes not to scale
We prepared a plasmid containing the dCas9 system, kanamycin resistance marker, and Lambda Red Recombinase system. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli due to its greater cloning efficiency, and was excised using restriction enzymes AflII and PacI in order to attempt homologous recombination.
First, we created what we termed ""Plasmid 1"" via Gibson Chew-Back Assembly. The individual parts contained in this plasmid are approximately 1 kb genome overlaps ""Overlap 1"" and ""Overlap 2"", ColE1 replication origin so the plasmid can be replicated in E. coli, and the kanamycin resistance marker ""KanR"" to select for cells that have the correct plasmid.
Next, we added dCas9 system via an overnight ligation. Using the restriction sites"

1. CHARACTERISATION OF NEW PARTS
Our pTAC with RFP BBa_K301001 reporter was characterised at lab scale by carrying out a successful transformation with a control.
 
IPTG induction of the reporter device BBa_K301001 was demonstrated in a lacI host strain with 0.1mM IPTG (panel B). A lac promoter device was tested as positive control (panel C).
As predicted, IPTG induction was not observed when our new device resided in a lacI negative host strain (panel A)  or when the pTac biobrick was omitted (panel D).
The following is the manual for the construction of BBa_K301000

These simulations are made in Simbiology.We use the same actions.
Time=0, temp=0     IPTG=2e3. We start the simulation adding IPTG.
Time=70000, temp=1    IPTG=0. We remove all the IPTG and simulate the increasing of temperature making the degradation sontant get higher following an exponential rate.
Time=140000, temp=0    IPTG=2e3. We add IPTG and decrease the temperature.
The simulation shows that the toggle switch continues showing the same behavior. It should be mention that the levels of the Repressor proteins on the steady state of the system are not equals due to the different repressions’ strength.
But to confirm the robustness we use a stochastic solver.
To assert the effect pointed out we build the same simulation based on Euler method:

The SAMS girls that we experimented Creature Feature with were working on different projects on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). Using newly acquired laboratory techniques and skills, they were tasked to analyze a favorite food or snack across different brands and test for labeling “truths.” For example, labels such as “organic” or “non-GMO project certified” were tested for validity against the same product with no label, and therefore assumed to be genetically modified. Using gel electrophoresis, the girls were able to tell whether or not the product had been genetically modified in comparison to a control and had to present their results. The CMU iGEM Team were asked to come in as a panel and audience to ask questions and further help them analyze the results. Since these projects were individual, each SAMS girl had to confidently present what the results were and any error that may have occurred in the procedure. Knowing the nature of laboratory techniques and mistakes made, the CMU iGEM team learned from the presentations, gave feedback, and gained insight on how complex the food biotech world really is. Overall, it was a great experience to be apart of and helped both the SAMS girls and the CMU iGEM team to foster intellectual conversation on the topics of label definitions and genetically modified organisms.

As the other experiments did not provide information about possible mutations, we also sent our constructs for sequencing, using VR and VF2 iGEM primers but also another forward primer we designed ourselves. The sequencing results were good, the protein is well inserted and there is no frame shift. You can see the sequencing results using the following iGEM registry links: results_ISA ; results_ISD ; results_ISI .
So up to now, with the previous information we had on our constructs, we could simply conclude that our basic cloning strategy worked.
Then moving on, we needed to test if the protein was expressed, if it was well localized at the outer membrane and that it was functional. We thus designed immunostaining assays to verify localization at the outer membrane and biotin-staining assay for the protein functionality ( see protocols ). Then we visualized the samples using a NIKON Eclipse TI inverted microscope [1] and also a Confocal microscope [2] , which is one of the most powerful microscopes nowadays. Unfortunately for all these assays, we didn't have an appropriate positive control as our constructs were newly designed by ourselves.
Confocal Microscopy
Focusing on the biotin assays, we did the confocal experiment to better characterize this observed phenomena. You can observe the results below (Figure 1 to 4).
Figure 1: confocal microscopy image showing ISA cells incubated 1hr with biotin conjugated to FITC reporter

Figure 3:  confocal microscopy image showing Competent cells incubated 1hr with biotin conjugated to FITC reporter
Figure 4: confocal microscopy image showing streptavidin coated magnetic beads incubated 1hr with biotin conjugated to FITC reporter
With the confocal microscopy, we were not able to distinguish weather the biotin molecules were inside or on the outside of the cells. And also we can see that some cells in the negative control are fluorescent. But these results were promising so we decided to repeat the experiments, trying to optimize the biotin staining protocols we were using.

Brochure designing and propagating
In order to allow more diabetic patients to realize the dangers of the development of chronic                         kidney disease in the later stage, and to help the middle-aged and the elderly to improve their                         awareness of prevention, our team members have carefully designed the Kidney Diseases Brochure.                         The brochure includes four aspects including the causes of kidney disease, how to detect kidney                         disease, warning signs of kidney disease and how to prevent kidney disease.
In July 2018, the team members came to the Jianshan Community in Dalian to hold a knowledge                         lecture on early prevention of kidney disease. At the Community Activity Center, we distributed the brochures to everyone to let them learn about the dangers of kidney disease, the causes of                         kidney disease and ways to prevent early kidney disease. After our explanation, residents’                         awareness of CKD has been significantly raised. During the promotion process, the residents                         asked many questions about diabetic nephropathy. The team members have answered them one by                         one.
Through this event, growing number of people were aware of the importance of regular medical                         examinations and have a deeper understanding of kidney disease. They also learned about the                         prevention of diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephropathy through this opportunity.

Publicity on the Campus Day
In May 2018, on the Campus Day of Dalian University of Technology, the DLUT_China_B team carried                         out a series of activities to expand the influence of synthetic biology and iGEM competition at                         Dalian University of Technology. Them designed the “Prize-giving Quiz” game to give the guests a                         general knowledge of biology. “Understanding Micro-World” provides visitors with microscopes and                         some samples made by the team members which let them to observe and understand the microbes we                         can't see. This part attracted many primary and middle school students.
This exhibition not only introduced synthetic biology and iGEM competitions, but also promoted                         our Dr. Familict project to let more people know the seriousness of kidney disease. We also got                         some valuable market research data. The public has given considerable attention to the project,                         which also makes our project more meaningful.

Therefore primers were designed to change the wobble position of the codon within the corresponding restriction site. The success of the QC-PCR was checked by digestion with the previously unwanted restriction enzyme and agarose gel electrophoresis (fig.13+14).

--Luojun Wang, author of USTC_SOFTWARE human practice
Human Practice,""the C project""
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong (in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang (in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Risk Group 1, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and CFIA recommends containment level 1 (CL1) safety guidelines, however no requirements are specified. Risk group 1 includes any biological materials that are potentially pathogenic to humans or animals, but are very unlikely to be so, or are not pathogenic at all. Some recommendations for CL1 facilities outlined in the Canadian Biosafety Standard are as follows:
1. The designated areas for handling biological materials should be separated from public areas and administrative work areas.
2. There should be designated hand and eye wash stations appropriate for facility operations.
3. Appropriate personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses, lab coats and, footwear covering the feet, must be worn.
4. Only authorized personnel and visitors should be allowed in the facility.
5. Waste materials must be disposed in the proper containers and wastes that came into contact with biological materials must be decontaminated before disposal.
6. Proper hand washing techniques must be employed after coming into contact with biological materials.
7. Procedures must incorporate proper aseptic technique and minimizes contamination and the formation of aerosols.
8. Food and drinks should be prohibited from the lab.
9. Personnel must be trained for the safe handling and storing of biological materials to protect them.
10. Safety guidelines must be kept up-to-date.
To work with biological materials in higher risk groups (2, 3, and 4), in addition to adopting the appropriate containment level, a Pathogen and Toxin Licence must be obtained from PHAC. Although CL1 provides the foundational biosafety guidelines for these containment levels, further requirements must be followed to minimize contamination and hazards to personnel working with high risk group pathogens. Additional information for the operations of these controlled facilities are discussed in the Canadian Biosafety Standard Second Edition handbook.

1.5 Conclusion
Thermoinduction system activity variation with temperature
Background
We are using the thermoinduction promoter system BBa_K098995 to activate module 3 (genome deletion) when the temperature is raised to 42 degrees.
We have ligated the thermoinduction promoter system BBa_K098995 to the GFP reporter to form our own testing construct BBa_K200022 .  This allows us to follow thermoinduction of the promoter by changes in GFP fluorescence
This analysis also serves to characterise the subpart BBa_K098995 submitted by Harvard 08.
Aim
To investigate the behaviour of the lamda-cI thermoinducible promoter and show repression at the low temperature of 28°C and activation when the temperature is raised to 42°C.
Experimental method
Cells were grown at the 2 different temperatures of 28°C and 42°C.  There was in addition a set of cells that were shifted from 28°C to 42°C so that we could characterise the change in GFP fluorescence during the transition between temperatures.
In order to characterize the thermoinducible promoter properly, we have used 2 sets of control cells:
Positive control cells: Containing the BBa_I13522 , acting as a baseline comparison by constitutively expressing GFP.
Negative control cells: These contain the thermoinducible promoter on its own ( BBa_K098995 ) with no GFP attached to it. These serve as cells without any fluorescence.
Results
Variation in the blank
The level of variation in the blank absorbance and fluorescence is within a narrow range.  However, we cannot immediately assume that it is constant, given that we are dealing with relatively low baseline values.
In order to take into account this variation, the growth rate and fluorescence output of the curves was computed for different values within the range, and the purpose was to decide if this variation had a significant impact.

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#3G_-_-_TEXT.html," specific part types are distinguished by their sticky ends. After being cut, each type of part reveals a distinct sticky end on either side. The standard parts used in most synthetic circuits are promoters, 5’ untranslated regions, coding sequences, and terminators. Their MoClo sticky ends are shown in the image below:
Figure 2: Schematic of MoClo Sticky Ends of promoters, 5' UTRs, CDSs and terminators
The unique sticky ends allow for the parts to line up in the correct sequence before being ligated together. In this way, a full transcriptional unit can be created. Unique nucleotide sequences (UNS) are attached to both ends of the transcriptional unit. The UNS on the 5’ end of the transcriptional unit must have a sticky end A so that it can anneal to the promoter’s sticky end. The UNS on the 3’ end has a sticky end E so that it can anneal to the terminator’s sticky end. These sequences serve as a landing pad for primers in the next stage of PCR. They will also be used when combining the transcriptional units on to a backbone in the final stage of 3G assembly.
There are multiple 5’ UNSs and multiple 3’ UNSs, denoted by numbers (e.g., UNS 1, UNS 3, UNS 10). This allows us to combine multiple fragments in the Gibson step.
Figure 3: UNSs attached to transcriptional unit at sticky end A and sticky end E
Amplification
Next, Golden-Gate products are amplified by PCR. The forward primer will anneal to the 5’ UNS and the reverse primer will anneal to the 3’ UNS. The PCR products are then gel extracted.
Gibson Stage
In the final step, a Gibson assembly is performed. Here, multiple transcriptional units are combined on to a backbone. The backbone must have UNS 1 on the 5’ end and UNS 10 on the 3’ end. This can easily be achieved by PCRing your vector with primers that add the the UNSs.
Figure 4: Backbone with UNS 1 and UNS 10 adapters
In Gibson assembly, areas of homology are connected to form a circular plasmid. An exonuclease chews at the 5’ end of every fragment, creating compatible sticky ends that allow DNA fragments to align. DNA polymerase fills in the gaps and DNA ligase seals the bases together.
In 3G, the homologous regions between the vector and the transcriptional unit are the UNS"

Modelling & Prototype Journal
Week 1: May 5th - May 9th
Modelling team formed. The big idea discussed during the week was to digitalize the proposed diagnostic test using an Arduino Uno microcontroller or Raspberry Pi. The idea was based on glucose meters for diabetics with the potential for disposable strips with the device to reduce cost per test.  As we brainstorm ideas it is important for us to remember that we are designing this for developing nations often with less resources.  We looked into the advantages and disadvantages of Arduino Uno vs Raspberry Pi and how they operate. Currently, the Arduino Uno seems to be a more suitable choice for our purposes as it works well with simple programs and has many applicable functions. We looked into how to program an Arduino Uno microcontroller and started writing simple programs to familiarize ourselves with microcontroller. As part of the digital reporter circuit that will be designed and wired, we are looking into using a sensor to detect a change from the biological reaction. We researched different sensors that are compatible with the microcontroller and we found that there are Arduino Uno sensors that for light, colour, current, methane, ethanol, carbon dioxide, propane, butane, and H2.   We also researched the basics of microfluidics and the potential application this could have with our designs for the project. Additionally, everyone on the team participated in workshops on DNA and cell biology, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and PCR optimization, DNA extraction, cloning and transformation, bioinformatics, theory of proteins, protein purification, and protein optimization to get everyone familiar with basic lab techniques and biology theory"

Fluorescence
Test the expression of Pfus+mRFP+cyc1t+pRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2, △sst2.
We research the impacts acted by various concentrations of α factor to the amount of expression of mRFP as well as the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2、△far1+△sst2+△ste2，△sst2 containing the detection circuit.
Plan and method
We set the concentrations of α factor as 0umol/L，1 umol/L， 2.5 umol/L， 5 umol/L，10 umol/L，15 umol/L. We sampled 5ml culture liquid of each of them at 0、4、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22、24、26、28、30h respectively after shake culture. Afterwards, the red fluorescence intensity was measured in microplate reader (584/607) which was calibrated by pure liquid medium. We set red fluorescence intensity/OD600 as Y-axis and time as X- axis for the coordinate system.
Results and discussion
Fig.6 fuorescense curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
Fig.7 fuorescense curve of Δsst2+Δfar1 under different concentrations of α factor.
Fig.8 fuorescense curve of Δsst2+Δfar1+Δste2 under different concentrations of α factor.
For the strains △far1+△sst2 and CEN.PK2-1C, the red fluorescence intensity increased with the concentrations of α factor increasing, and almost none of the red fluorescence of the strain CEN.PK2-1C was detected. Moreover, the red fluorescence intensity of △far1+△sst2 is stronger than that of △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and CEN.PK2-1C.
Conclusion：According to the results above, the expression intensity of mRFP was induced increasingly by the increasing concentration of α factor. Because of the genes sst2, far1 knockout the strains △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and △far1+△sst2 could amplify the"

Students are personally supervised at all times during iGEM work by an immediate project supervisor to reduce such events. It’s important to note however that risk assessments focus on the danger of the task as opposed to the skill level of the person carrying out the task (e.g. a postgraduate is less likely to injure themselves than an undergraduate). This means risk assessments on students need to be suitably adjusted. for our project a Project Risk assessment was completed for all students undertaking the work and students were educated in this practice and made to read MSDS and risk assessment documents before undertaking the work.
6. Does your project require the exposure or release of the engineered organism to people or the environment (e.g. as medicine, for bioremediation)?
This project involves the creation of new technology to produce peptides with high purity with a significantly lower cost. If the experiment is successful, the next step in this experiment would be testing the effect of these peptides in assays and perhaps in animal models. The bacterium itself would not be released or gene circuits, but the product created by it may and so would undergo standard FDA/other testing.
