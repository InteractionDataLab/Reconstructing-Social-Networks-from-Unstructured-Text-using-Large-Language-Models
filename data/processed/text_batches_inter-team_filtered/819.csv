TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," side effects on the environment. The iGEM team of Paris Bettencourt took up a similar idea, and Wageningen 2014 incorporated a kill-switch in their BananaGuard. The team designed a Pseudomonas putida that could detect and destroy a pathogen that threaten banana plants (Fusarium oxysporum). The genetic system of the BananaGuard becomes active when it senses fusaric acid, the compound secreted by the pathogen. After the pathogen is removed from the banana plant, the BananaGuard will kill and remove itself by producing toxins (iGEM Wageningen, 2014).
Biosecurity and Intellectual Property Rights
Another issue in SynBio is biosecurity and proprietorship. The BioBricksTM we are developing during our iGEM project are meant to simplify the engineering of organisms with new properties and make a standardized process possible (Vriend, 2006). All the BioBricksTM designed will become part of the so-called Registry of Standard Biological Parts, an open source database of genetic building blocks. However, we must consider possible vulnerabilities of this system. Simplification of the building process and the open source system makes biotechnology more accessible to non-experts. Therefore, there is a threat that people will use biological elements in harmful ways, escalating even to bioterrorism; This is what the issue of biosecurity discusses.
From the biosecurity discussion arises a novel term: biohacking. Biohacking involves designing and manufacturing biological systems freely, but with hardly any regulatory oversight or enforcement in place (Schmidt, 2008). For example, on YouTube you can find tutorials on how to make your own biofuel.  Moreover, there is a ‘DO-IT-YOURSELF’ society (DIY Biologists) who support the following statement: “Central to our mission is the belief that biotechnology and the greater public understanding about it, has the potential to benefit everyone” (DIY Bio, 2008). This mentality can cut both ways. On the one hand, the DIY biologist society may have experts that can teach people how to work safely in a lab, spreading the benefits of Biotechnology. On the other hand, practically anybody is free (and has the means) to create novel organisms in their basement, unchecked by regulation and without adherence to any professional and moral code.
Apart from biosecurity, open source can raise the issue of intellectual property rights.  As in the case of DIY Biologists, there are two conflicting views that both have pros and cons. Supporters of an open source system for Synthetic Biology claim that innovation can"

We found the thermal conductivity of LB and M9 to be similar to that of water,    at 605 $\pm$ 20 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ and 570 $\pm$ 30 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ respectively.   A linear fit of a $T$ vs. $ln(t)$ plot following only the reading from the liquid medium thermocouple      will yield the conductivity (Fig. 2).

Software: Purdue
The Purdue team, for part of their human practices, aimed to create a user friendly database of past iGEM projects, making it easier for future iGEM teams to search through relevant projects and develop their own ideas. Through a series of Skype calls, we were able to set up a collaboration between our two teams. We would be writing summaries for Purdue’s database, and in return, Purdue would run a continuous culture of a kill switch and send us the resulting data.
Our team helped Purdue with this by logging data for the 46 iGEM projects, and critiquing ease of use and effectiveness of the database.  Purdue told us we were instrumental in getting up the 2015 section of their database due to our contributions to writing up the project summaries.
For each team we produced a description of what their project was about (including anything that was particularly notable about the project), the project track, the number of team members, the chassis used (if relevant), any research benchmarks, a list of submitted parts with part numbers, descriptions and links, the medal achieved, and any awards and nominations.

Safety Questions
Background
April 16 2013, a postgraduate student named Huang Yang from Fudan University died of poisoning in Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital. According to the report of the police's investigation, a toxic chemical compound was found in the drinking water dispenser in Huang's dormitory room, and this toxic chemical compoud is taken out of a laboratory.
This terrible incident is not a mere coincidence and it reminds us college students of the importance of lab-safety. Our iGEM team believe that apart from ensuring the safety of our lab, we should also appeal to more people to join us in ensuring lab-safety. Under our advocation, Tianjin University started the “ Lab-Safety Month of Tianjin University”, and a number of activities were held, in which our iGEM team played important roles.

Figure 1. The ""Lab-Safety Month of Tianjin University""
Under our advocation, Tianjin University started the "" Lab-Safety Month of Tianjin University"", and a number of activities were held, in which our iGEM team played important roles.
The"" Lab-Safety Month of Tianjin University"" campaign was a successful safe work practice, and we hope that we can seize this opportunity to take the initiative to start the lab-safety campaign among the universities in Tianjin city.
This campaign was the first specific campain focusing on lab-safety in China, and was composed of various activities such as lab-safety lectures, lab escape drills, lab-safety checks, top 10 safe labs selection and filming videos about lab-safety. Our iGEM team was responsible for organizing and propagating some of the activities.
Tianjin University made and revised three regulations in Dec, 2012-Tianjin University Lab Management Regulation, Tianjin University Lab-Safety Management Regulation and Tianjin University Lab-Safety Responsibility Regulation. These regulations perfected the regulations related with lab-safety, and"

Colon Cancer Detection Questions
Can isopeptags be used to detect a cancer biomarker and then create a response inside the cell? If not, what other transmembrane proteins can?
Heat Production
Diagram of proposed mechanism
What's a good ""cold switch"" - a riboswitch that would stop transcription at a specific temperature?
Does the UCP1 create enough heat, fast enough, to make a difference?
Does activation of UCP1 harmfully inhibit ATP production? Or can we overproduce ATP to compensate?
CO Detection
Can E. coli be altered to survive in CO long enough to detect it?
7 January 2011
Heat Production
We discovered that the yeast heating project was originally done by an iGEM team from Valencia. If we continue with it, our original contribution would be linking it to a riboswitch, and optimizing the heating mechanism. Addison also suggested optimizing it in E. coli because they grow in denser colonies (it has already been shown not to be lethal in E. coli, but we aren't sure if it produces heat).
Furthermore, there is a better chance of E. coli heating its environment more efficiently as the"

UT-Tokyo,2013,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," just next to AHL.
UV-susceptible cI repressors (E233K) were used in toggle switch of iGEM MIT 2010. However, MIT 2010[3] made only the composite toggle parts. Thus, we made a new BioBrick part of single UV-susceptible cI repressor (E233K) through site-directed mutagenesis. This standard basic part will be useful for future registry members.
The full system
“Gear”, “Clock hand”, and UV reset device make the full genetic circuit ( BBa_K1124100
) (Fig. 18).The circle of E. coli population on agar plate with BBa_K1124100 works as the Multicellular Analog Clock.
Figure 18
Applicaton
In this project, we constructed an analog clock of E.coli for which quorum sensing was utilized. The system is simple because it has only one hand. So other functions can be easily adopted. For example, if particular smell or light is given out every regular time, it becomes an alarm clock. Some past iGEM projects such as MIT2006 and NCBS2009 referred to how to produce scent. In addition, the fine adjustment device could be constructed which is based on the velocity of the hand of it changing by external input. For instance, it is possible to precisely control the clock device by employing promoterAHL which promotes transcription according to the density of AHL and constructing the sequences, such as promoterAHL-luxI and promoterAHL-(tetR, aiiA, sRNAs). While UV reset device resets the clock by decomposition of c1 repressor (E233K), it resets the clock by increase or decrease in AHL.
As another use of clock device, there is a quantity measuring device. The outline is as follows. First, we move the hand by means of the clock device, and then stop the movement of it after a fixed period of time by such as irradiation of UV. As a result, quantity can be visibly measured. For example, we could measure the density of a material by using this device.  The material to be measured defines “S”, we make a construction, promoterS-RBS-luxI-d.term-(clock-device)-(UV reset device). PromoterS promotes transcription in response to the existence of S. Then, because the velocity of the hand changes according to the density of S, we could conclude that if it swung longer, the density is higher and that if it swung shorter, the density is lower.(Fig.1)

In order to restore RecA1 to RecA and to reduce its recombinant activity while maintaining its proteolytic activity, a series of mutations were made. One such mutation was made at amino acid 160, this adenine residue needed to be mutated to guanine to change RecA1 to RecA and restore its functions. In order to use the standard bio-bricking techniques we also had to remove naturally occurring enzymatic restriction sites. The Pst1 site CTGCAG needed to be converted to CTGCAA. Then the EcoR1 site GAATTC needed to be converted to GAATTT. We also focused on how to mutate RecA so that it would be deficient in recombinant activity.  After literature research we identified two amino acids in the RecA sequence that were known to affect RecA’s ability to perform homologous recombination.  These sites were Arginine 243 and Lysine 286.  Research suggested that changing Arginine 243 to Glutamine and Lysine 286 to Asparagine would remove recombinant activity from RecA.

Dosimeter Design
After genetically modifying Escherichia coli to perform the task of acting as a bacterial dosimeter, we started looking into designs for building the actual device. After taking a tour of our Nuclear Reactor Facilities on campus, we were introduced to a wide variety of dosimeters already in use in the building. We designed our device to focus on three main points: portability, durability, and reliability. The dosimeter was designed in an octagonal shape for aesthetics with a shear 5 cm diameter and a width of 1 cm. These parameters allow for a light, portable device. Another idea we used in designing the device with the belief that it should be reusable. For this reason, the device is designed in a camera and film pairing. The hollow case made out of a hard plastic, or in case of the analogy the “camera”, is designed to be durable and reusable, while the tray will be for one-time use.
After use the tray will be developed in catechol, etc. to show the different levels of radiation present. The dosimeter tray will have a thin layer a gellan gum, as developed by BCCS Bristol’s iGEM team in 2010, but instead of being made into balls we will use a thin sheet of gellan gum instead. Our modified Escherichia coli living in this gel will be tested by exposing it to gamma radiation at our nuclear reactor on campus. The trays"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," was in April when we discussed the generation of Evobodies with scientific staff of Bielefeld Unniversity.             Already in this early stage, we experienced major issues when explaining the complex structure of our high speed evolution.             Due to these difficulties, we established dialogue with the cultural anthropologist Florian Helfer from Frankfurt, Germany.              After a video conference,             we were sure that the language barrier between regular language and scientific terminology is THE major issue when communicating scientific topics. That is why             we started several follow-up projects to breach this barrier:
We created a dictionary on synthetic biology to translate scientific language and especially everything about Evobodies into regular English phrasing.             We collected over 500 terms from a lot of different scientific fields such as genome analysis and biotechnology, as well as topics like ""biosafety"" and others.             This tool should support non-scientific people to understand science related media and give scientists the chance to find              simple words when explaining their research to a public audience.
Another highlight of our summer was the 5th annual CeBiTec students academy . Every year 20                  ambitious high school students stay for one week at the CeBiTec to learn about recent research and collect                 practical experience what it means to work in a molecular biology laboratory. We instructed                 experiments in the field of synthetic biology and organized a barbecue for recreation in the evening.                 Once again we learned the difficulties to summarize our complex evolution system in a few sentences and learned a lot about communicating                  scientific methods and techniques. This led to our third approach.
We transported the idea of directed evolution to human practice and started a series of presentations at high             schools. After each session, we reflected on our presentation style and comprehensibility of certain parts              in our construction. The results were quite surprising but gradually we were able to improve our presentation to enhance the             general understanding of Evobodies without prior scientific knowledge.
To involve the public in our fundraising campaign we started a crowdfunding project on Startnext.de.                 The videoclip we created received very positive feedback and guaranteed the success of the campaign. Furthermore it explained                 in a very grafical way how our system works and where it can be applied. By showing how we are able to encounter natural evolution                 we wanted to retrieve public participation in our project.                 We received almost instantly feedback through financial support and comments through social media. Our initial aim on                 opening our project to a broader audience was just as successfully achieved as our monetary goal.
Expert consultation
To analyze our project on a scientific level we further did our best to search for potential flaws or improvement            "

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," kids and more detailed questions by adults, we got a head start with flaws and gaps we would have to seal to have a strong project.
The Copenhagen High School Symbiotes Project
It was our PhD. supervisor Kyle who got the idea to expand the iGEM participation in Denmark and include a high school team of students at ages between 16-19. There has been a growing interest in the High school track around the world ( see Fig 1 ). Philip, from last year’s DTU team, Tenna and Jacob, therefore, set out to establish a high school team in the greater Copenhagen area to compete in iGEM; and so, the project ‘Copenhagen High School Symbiotes’, CHSS for short, was born.
Fig. 1: High school teams competing in iGEM (1)
Since it would be the very first high school team from Denmark to enter iGEM, a lot of regulations and rules had to be checked with the proper authorities to make sure it was feasible. With the green light given, CHSS started to take shape.
Firstly, by the suggestion of Philip, we got in contact with the non-profit organization Biotech Academy, located at DTU, to plan a collaboration with them as they have relevant expertise with high school projects. The project could be modeled after the Biosensor project , which is another collaboration between Biotech Academy and DTU Biobuilders.
As past and present participants of the DTU iGEM team, they could contribute with the structure of the process, planning, gathering the necessary information and having the required knowledge regarding the competition to sell it to the teachers of the different high schools. Biotech Academy, on the other hand, offered experience with teaching biotechnology, engaging the students and what is necessary to be allowed to work in the lab with high schoolers.
Moving forward with the project, we realized many more benefits of the CHSS team becoming a reality. Not only would it spark an interest in synthetic biology, which is currently not widely taught in high schools, but it would also make a great chance for a collaboration with future teams from DTU and hopefully inspire more teams from Denmark.
The next step was getting the faculty to confirm the project as well as the necessary budget. The three of them all spent weeks researching, corresponding through emails and having meetings with Biotech Academy and the DTU faculty to make the plans reasonable and feasible.
However, to make sure the project stood solidly when going to the faculty to get approved, and also for when sending out funding applications, we needed to have the high schools behind"
Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#EvanNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," considered art school and/or a studio art major, I thought I'd enjoy the design process a lot more, but to be honest, it's beginning to get draining. There's a huge gap between ""traditional"" art (painting, charcoal, the stuff I like to do for fun) and interface/web design, which is a lot more...impersonal. Don't get me wrong; I'm not one of those artists that create art solely for themselves. I really don't like those. I think artists should keep self-indulgent, impermeable art to themselves. But even permeable, communicative art is about self-expression rather than utility (most of the time), and this interface design stuff is definitely entirely about utility and about the user. It makes sense--user-centered design and all that; after all, I'm not even remotely a biologist--but it's still draining.
The new, revamped design
Anyway, we finally got to the preliminary coding stage, and I'm very excited about it. I know absolutely nothing about html, css, or javascript/jquery, but I'm sure I'll learn quickly.
Tue, June 18: Tiffany and I went to BU today to meet up with their Eugene team and ask some questions about what they want in the interface. The trip actually ended up being pretty pointless; we traveled and waited around for public transportation for approximately 4 hours in order to attend a 30-minute meeting at BU. Not to mention, Traci, BU's mentor/leader, was sick, and most of our questions were meant for her. The rest of the Eugene team was productive, though: while Tiffany and I were gone, and with Consuelo's help, Sravanti and Catherine revamped our design to accomodate higher-level rule-making.
Wed, June 19: Today, Sravanti and I finally started to understand the drag and drop functionality in JQuery. It's extremely rough, but we were able to create and show a ""droppable"" canvas with ""draggable"" pictures.

At this point, there are a lot of bugs, and this isn't even remotely how we want our interface to look, but it's at least a start. To ease the painfully slow JQuery learning curve, we decided to use cute pictures of various animals to drag and drop. :) In addition, Tiffany and Catherine, with Diana's help, have been working on the home (log in) page of our web application.

The Toxin-Antitoxin System
The Toxin-antitoxin system can be looked at as a classical poison and an antidote - that is one protein will kill the cell, but the presence of the other protein will counteract it.
Why?
The toxin-antitoxin system that we are using was biobricked by Team Washington (iGEM 2010) and consists of the Tsi2 antitoxin and the Tse2 toxin and was isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Internal expression of Tse2 causes death in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes - however when co-expressed with Tsi2 a complex is formed that prevents this [1].  In P. aeruginosa, the toxin is a substrate for the Type VI secretion system and can be secreted into gram-negative cells. Meanwhile, Tsi2 cannot be secreted and remains inside the bacteria. This allows production of an otherwise toxic metabolite. E. coli does not contain the Type VI secretion system, and hence both the toxin and antitoxin remain inside the cell. [2,3]
Typically both the toxin and antitoxin are expressed on the same plasmid and the longer half life of the toxin will lead to cell death if the plasmid is lost. We have instead taken an innovative and novel approach with the toxin and antitoxin under different promoters on different plasmids.
The pHlow plasmid contains contains a constitutively expressed Tse2 toxin (under the CP44 promoter) and a secondary plasmid contains the IPTG- inducible antitoxin, Tsi2.
There is a twofold benefit to this toxin-antitoxin system:
It prevents the escape of the recombinant bacteria from the lab. If the bacteria escapes there will be no IPTG present in its external environment, leading to no expression of Tsi2 and ultimately bacterial death. This ensures that the bacteria can only grow in the laboratory environment.
Additionally this also prevents horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria. If a bacteria receives the pHlow plasmid (either by conjugation or uptake of the naked"

The sources of these 5’ UTR sequences are heat shock proteins from e.g. Bradirhizobium japonicum [4] , transcription factors from pathogenic bacteria [5] [6] and designed temperature sensitive sequences [8] . We will screen different varieties on the designed RNA thermometer sequences. Furthermore, we want to make an inducible system, so all influences except temperature can be kept constant. How an RNA thermometer works in vivo is depicted in figure 1.
Figure 1. An RNA thermometer designed to switch at 37ºC.
For the output on the system we want to obtain visibly colored E. coli colonies. To achieve this, we will introduce enzymes that originate from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and overexpress other E. coli enzymes in E. coli. These enzymes have been shown to be able to produce Farnesyl Pyrophosphate (FPP) in E. coli [7] .  FPP is a precursor for pathways that lead to color production. When production of FPP in E. coli is achieved, the production of color will be the next goal. To obtain colored cells we could use the standardized pathway that is already made available by another iGEM-team (Edinburgh 2007).
Labwork
During this project we will work with E. coli K12 derived strains. For both the thermometer and the FPP pathway, E. coli will be transformed. In order to do this, vectors containing the relevant (c)DNA of the genes or temperature sensitive RNAs will be cloned into vectors provided by iGEM. Protocols available on the OpenWetWare (OWW) website will be followed in the laboratory. If no protocols are available on the OWW website, supplier’s protocol will be followed or we will make our own protocols.
An inducible system will be made in order to keep environmental conditions as equal as possible in all tests. All cells will be grown at 37oC, induced, and placed at different temperatures to investigate the temperature sensitive RNA structures. The lac operon will be in place before the RNA structures and after that the luciferase protein.
The lac operon can be induced by the presence of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), a molecular mimic of allolactose, a metabolite of lactose. By spraying IPTG on dishes, a concentration between 100 µM and 1.5 mM of IPTG should be reached in order to induce the system"

Overview
The expression of interacting genes depends on the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN). In order to figure out optimal biological networks that can function reliably when faced with fluctuation of DNA template amount (copy number), it is important to do some simulations in advance to narrow the screening scope and theoretically discuss certain functional regulatory motifs that are significant in showing adaptation. Therefore, it would be easier for us to search for and verify adaptive and robust networks in wet lab. In our project, we abstractly analyzed gene regulatory network topologies and computed all possible three-node network structures by enumeration. We modeled, calculated, tested and made comparisons, and finally screened 2 core optimal network structures out of 19683 network structures, which show great adaptation to DNA copy number. In order to verify the correctness of our screening result, we introduced an optimal testing case and simulated. Based on our screening results, we analyzed and concluded 9 key motifs that may be essential to adaptation. We respectively simulated these motifs and tried to explain their characters with mathematical proof. Finally we figured out that these key motifs can be combined to obtain better effects.
Construction of Networks And Mathematical Description -- ODE Equations
We based on the Michealis-Menten Equation and Hill Equation to describe the kinetics of gene regulatory networks. The M-M Equation and Hill Equation describe the relationship between the production rate of products and the concentration of substrate. M-M Equations of activation (monotone-increasing) and inhibition (monotone-decreasing) are defined as:
Hill Equations of activation (monotone-increasing) and inhibition (monotone-decreasing) are defined as:
(C is a constant, K is called half maximal effective concentration and n is called hill coefficient.) In our project, we aimed at all three-node network structures, and each contains 4 nodes (1 input node, 2 regulatory nodes and 1 output node) and vast possible regulatory edges among them.
So we formed ODE equation sets to describe the mutual relationships and form networks. The ODE equation sets involve two 4*4 matrices to respectively bring in the activating effect and inhibitive effect, and a column vector for self-decomposition.

Author：Liu Tian
4.1.1 Experimental Background
The iGEM encourages us to communicate and help with each other. So, when we heard HUST-China has something wrong with their promoter, we decided to give a hand. The one problem they met was the failure in sequencing their promoters in pET28a, and another was that they put mRFP under the promoter to do a promoter test but without result. So we got A&B promoters with mRFP from them.

Sequencing
We designed the 5’-agatcgggctcgccacttcg-3’ as the reverse primer to sequence the promoters. And Tsing Ke Biology Technology Company helped us to synthesize the primer and sequence those plasmid. (You can get the sequencing results of two samples at supplement 1.) After analyzing the sequencing result for sample pCusC , we found that the T7 promoter had't been digested, and no pCusC sequence in the plasmid. But mRFP had been successfully ligated. So we can observed the red fluorescence due to the expression of mRFP driven by T7 promoter. Therefore, in the subsequent promoter test, we abandoned samples of the pCusC. As for the PpcoA, we successfully found PpcoA and mRFP. However, at the end of PpcoA's sequencing result"

Xiamen
Xiamen, also known as Amoy to the west, is a cozy city located in the southeastern part of China, and has a relaxing coastal charm with a population of 1.3 million. It's a historical harbor city which was founded in the mid-14 century, in the early years of the Ming Dynasty. In the early 1980's, Xiamen was declared as one of China's first Special Economic Zone, taking advantages of the city's heritage as a trading center and the proximity to Taiwan. In 2004 the city won the finals of the world's Human Settlements and Environment Award, ""Nations in Bloom"". Xiamen is one of China's most attractive and best-maintained resort city, and attracts a large number of foreign and local tourists. The city is easily accessible by air, and there are direct flights from Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo. Within China, Xiamen airport is linked to more than 30 domestic airports.

However, for pC13CB, PtrpC and nptII BB re-ligated back to itself pA13DB colony 1 and pA13DB colony 4, pA13DC colony 3 and pA13DC colony 4 all failed to sequence. We discarded all of our pC13CG glycerol stocks except for the successful pC13CG 3, and met with members of Professor Turgeon's lab. We also blended our 25 mL culture from 2 days prior, and made new 100ml cultures with (75 mL and 25 mL, again.) We prepared pAK13AB and pC13AG for glycerol stock.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#results#Copenhagen_-_-_TEXT.html," the human CYP's, which unfortunately delayed their cool project. Furthermore, the elimination of the illegal restriction sites by site-directed mutagenesis caused a lot of trouble because of the number and positions of the restriction sites. When we met mid-July, Copenhagen had spent a lot of time trying mutate the illegal restriction sites, and they still had to eliminate a lot more.
Fortunately, the assembly standard that we have designed is easily adapted to any molecular biology research project, and in this system there is no need to eliminate restriction sites. By using our system they would be able to save some time, which would allow them to proceed with other parts of their project. This was a great opportunity for us to test, if our system really could be customized and applied to a random research project. It was also a fine opportunity to test our assembly system and the expression of the Plug 'n' Play plasmids in bacteria.
In the beginning of the project we planned to construct a plasmid from scratch with both the Plug 'n' Play with DNA and the Standard Assembly of BioBricks, so we could compare the two systems. Due to our late entry into the iGEM competition we did not have time to compare the two system ourselves. However, the Copenhagen team tried out both systems and compared them for us. Another part of our collaboration has been practicing our presentations and giving each other constructive criticism as well as testing each others wiki pages.
The figure below illustrates the process that the Copenhagen team had to go trough with the Standard Assembly of BioBricks compared to assembly with our Plug 'n' Play with DNA standard.
When more than one illegal restriction site is present at a certain distance of each other, more than one round of site-directed mutagenesis by PCR has to be performed. A circular arrow in the figure below illustrates this.
Work conducted for the Copenhagen Team
We in total created seven BioBricks for the Copenhagen team; these parts and our standard backbone plasmid were intended for assembly four different plasmids. Two with human the human CYP's A2 and C9 as well as two with the plant CYP's 79-A1 and 79-B1. All pre-produced parts for the assembly were delivered to the Copenhagen team for them to assemble according to the Plug 'n' Play standard. The two plant CYP's were assembled without problems. The human CYP project was however put on halt. The two constructed plasmids with CYP79-A2 BBa_K527001 and CYP79-B1 BBa_K527002 are illustrated below.

I performed six reactions using the appropriate primer in each case (CB top, CB bottom, FH top, FH bottom, Myc 981, Myc 198). I used the following recipe for the PCR (total volume 200 ul):
100 ul Sybr Green master mix
200 nm primer (4 ul each of 10 um primer)
2 ul chip
90 ul water
I ran the reactions on the thermocycler, while standing by to see the graphs being produced, using the following program:
95* for 1 minute
Initially, the reactions occur at an exponential rate. During this period:
95* for 10 seconds
62* for 30 seconds
Once the reaction began to plateau, I stopped the reaction. Prior to this point all the oligos were being amplified equally. Once the plateau occurs, amplication occurs at varying rates. This took about 12 cycles total.
FH Top samples had slightly less volume, and plateaued earlier. This may have occurred due to too little water or master mix being added.
I performed a PCR purification on the PCR product at got the following yields:
Name        Conc. 260/280   CB Top:     18.2         1.83  CB Bottom:  25.1         1.78  FH Top:     20.3         20.3  FH Bottom:  21.4         21.4  Myc 981     26.1         1.73  Myc 198     19.7         1.84
In order to confirm the nanodrop readings, I ran 1 ul of each sample on a 4% e-gel. We ran a low range quanitative DNA ladder, at varying dilutions.

When comparing the intensity of the bands to the ladder, it does indeed look like there is approximately 20 ng/ul DNA in the products.

The plates of transformed bacteria yesterday were uneven in their efficiencies because some of the plates had a low time constant for the electroporation (around 4.8) when a good time constant was around 5.8.  We got excellent efficiency in the transformation for Zif268 alone, but for the plasmid mixes that included the negative control library, we got poor time constants.  We still got colonies, but instead of getting a lawn of bacteria there were approximately 150 discrete colonies on"

As the way of presenting laboratory work routine and synthetic biology, we were especially excited to receive a positive feedback from people, who have not heard of synthetic biology field before!
Workshop at Heureka Science Centre, Finland
After contacting Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team we came up with an idea to organize a workshop at event of Heureka’s Science Centre! We enjoyed interacting with the centre’s visitors, teaching them synthetic biology principles  and explaining the project idea through our board games. We were happy to meet Aalto-Helsinki team members, exchange experience and work progress!
Researchers’ Night Festival at Ahhaa Science Centre in Tartu, Estonia
In the end of September our team participated in the Researchers’ Night Festival held in Ahhaa Science Centre! As a part of the collaboration Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team travelled all the way to Tartu to join us at the event. We were glad to welcome them in Estonia and help them with translation and explanation of their experiments to local visitors, including kids, teenagers and adults! During the workshop in addition to our board games we carried out a DIY edible gel electrophoresis experiment in order to simulate the real gel electrophoresis.

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitin synthase_-_-_TEXT.html," the NodC enzyme is, the more UDP is set free. This could be verified by employing a higher concentration of NodC in the assay (see Figure 12).
Figure 12.  Activity assay of NodC with higher NodC concentrations. The concentration of NodC starts with 1600 ng and was then titrated in 1X glycosyltransferase reaction buffer the presence of 100 μM of UDP-N-acetylglcosamine and 10 mM N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as an acceptor substrate. The higher concentration was used to show a higher turnover of the substrate. The reaction was performed as described before and the luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a Tecan200 Infinite Pro plate reader. Each point is an average of two experiments (N = 2), and the error bars represent the standard deviations. RLU = relative light units.
Discussion and Outlook
In our research, we show that the nodC gene can successfully be expressed in E. coli and the functional enzyme can produce chitin oligomers. This is a great chance to synthesize chitin oligomers in an environment-friendly way. Biosynthetical production of chitin oligomers forms the basis for the specific synthesis of chitosan (deacetylated chitin) and therefore is also highly relevant to all biotechnological and medical applications of chitosan.  The specific qualities of chitin or chitosan, the non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, are supportive for application in medicine. In addition the bioactivities, like the promotion of wound healing, hemostatic activity or antimicrobial activity indicate an implementation in the field of wound management [1] . These beneficial properties improve by decreasing the length of chitosan. Hence, the oligomeric chitin produced by NodC is a great precursor for medicinal chitosan production. For our project we will use chitosan to manufacture a hydrogel for treating burn wounds.
The production of chitin is the first step in generating a chitosan hydrogel band-aid ecologically. Further modifications of the chitin are the deacetylation to chitosan ( see Deacetylase ) and linking with a fluorophore ( see Chemistry ).  The production of chitin in E. coli is not only beneficial for our project but for a variety of applications, like a fungus control agent in agricultural applications. Some of the applications of chitin or chitosan are quite promising,"

Reaching Out to the Community
One of the challenges facing synthetic biology is the negative stigma surroungind genetically engineered or modified organisms. Therefore, it's important that we reach out to the community as a part of iGEM to discuss synthetic biology and advocate for their use by presenting a case where synthetic biology can be used to solve an issue.
Farmer's Market
As a result of talking with Ravdeep from Beyond the Peel, we found that one of the reasons why the Cavendish is the most popular banana is due to the lack of consumer demand. If people are not willing to buy these bananas, there will be no need for an infrastructure to be built around it. We were also interested to see if there was another banana candidate that would be able to replace the Cavendish, and if people would buy it as a result. Genetic diversity is important in protecting the population of Cavendish bananas. Crops that are more resistant will prevent the fungi from spreading more rapidly, and isolate populations where there the disease is present.
Different varities of bananas (left to right): Cavendish, Manzano, Thai, Burro, and Red
We found from specialty grocery stores four other types of bananas that are available to be purchased, and we had participants test them out. We had bought in addition to the Cavendish: burro, manzano, thai, and red bananas. They were all ready to be eaten when ripe, which is different from the cooking bananas such as plantains. They have different flavor profiles and textures compared to the Cavendish. The flavor profiles of each banana are determined by the starch, sugar, and nutritional composition. The bitter, dry taste of unripe banana is due to the high starch content of the non-Cavendish bananas. Starch is also responsible for the crunch / hard taste. When ripening, starch breaks down into the sugars fructose, sucrose, and glucose, which give bananas their sweet taste and creamy texture. Red bananas in particular have a different color and taste due to their higher beta carotene (Vitamin A) content. Cooking the bananas (akin to plantains) helps to break down the starch.
We asked the following questions:
How do each type of bananas taste? How does it compare to the Cavendish?
If ripening the bananas mean that they turn completely black, would you eat a black banana?
Would you buy one if you saw them in the grocery store?
Some of the bananas are dual-purpose, bringing out a different flavor profile when cooked."

UCSD’s iGEM team will join over 200 teams from across the country for a chance to compete for the BioBrick trophy.
UCSD’s computational iGEM team will focus on recruiting a team from a wide range of academic disciplines in order to expose students to interdisciplinary research. iGEM team members will have a chance to work closely with mentors during the summer, fostering a diverse skillset necessary for interdisciplinary fields such as Systems Biology. In addition to acquiring technical skills while working on the iGEM project, students in iGEM will also refine their presentation skills – typically iGEM students present their work in: an oral presentation at the iGEM World Jamboree, on a research poster, online wiki, and ocassionally, a submission to an academic journal. Participation in UCSD’s iGEM team will raise not only students’ confidence in their research abilities, but also their awareness of opportunities in emerging fields including Systems Biology.

Collaboration was the theme of this past spring, summer, and this fall.
We have created a computational synthetic biology tool, SBiDer, that fosters collaboration among the global synthetic biology community. SBiDer also has a potential to bridge between other fields of biology and the field of synthetic biology by enabling ontological interpretations of biochemical reactions as well as genetic interactions. Furthermore, SBiDer database can become the first universal database for the field of synthetic biology. Lastly, we have minimized the barriers for collaborative development of SBiDer by modularly engineering SBiDer on an open source platform. We encourage the global community to extend,"

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"onczewski, 2005) . The pH of attractants showed below (Fig.5) is at the range of pH 1.0 – 6.4. The highest concentration of 0.1M is pH 1.0 of malate and 2.0 of succinate, which leads to weakest chemotaxis, for oxidative stress induces its protective responses more than chemotaixs genes expression; while the curves reach maximum at concentration of 0.01M because of the opposite reason.
Fig.5 The pH of the concentration gradients of malate and succinate. The pH of  malate is lower than succinate at high concentration (10-1 and 10-2 M), and is equal with succinate at lower concentration. Both of them remain pH 6.4 at low concentration(10-5, 10-7 and 0 M).
On the other hand, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is influenced by reversible McpS methylation and related proteins phosphorylation (Fig. 6). McpS, in response to chemoeffector stimuli, transfer the signals and make CheA autophosphorylated via the adapter protein CheW. Then phospho-CheA molecules serve as donors that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB. Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity that helps to change the CW rotation to CCW rotation, and they will be inactive because of loss of phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY. The signaling activities of chemoreceptors have two-state corresponding to two movement patterns separately (Fig. 6).  Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels of phospho-CheY.  Receptors in the CCW signaling state deactivate CheA, resulting in low levels of phospho-CheY. Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor signaling complexes in the kinase-on and kinase-off conformations. For example, attractant ligands drive receptors toward the kinase-off state; subsequent addition of methyl groups shift receptors toward the kinase-on state, reestablishing the steady-state (adapted) balance between the two states and restoring random walk movements.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Germination Stop#Knockout_-_-_TEXT.html,".
Germination: On its inner spore membrane, the spore has germinant receptors. The spore coats are believed to be semipermeable or porous, in order to permit the passage of germinants to the receptors. When germinants such as amino acids and sugars reach the receptors, the spore begins the biophysical process of germination (see Fig. 2).  Initially, the spore replaces its DPA with water (Stages I and II in Fig. 2), shifts its pH (Stage I), and swells (Stage II). Lytic enzymes break down the rigid spore coat layers encapsulating the spore's core (Stage II), allowing the spore core to swell further and begin the outgrowth process into a vegetative cell (Outgrowth). When the spore coat is broken down by lytic enzymes, the spore's environmental resistance is lost. For our project, we wish to prevent this germination process.
Fig. 2: The germination process in Bacillus spores. Taken from Setlow 2003 .
How do Germination Gene Knockouts Work?
Our idea of how to prevent germination from occurring is to knock out genes encoding functions involved in the germination process. There are a huge number of genes which play a role in germination, but our goal was to select a few very essential genes to knock out.
Based on the research of others, the genes we chose were cwlJ, sleB, cwlB, gerD, and cwlD. Past works of J. Kim and W. Schumann (2009) and B. Setlow et al. (2001) showed:
cwlJ and sleB: when knocked out together, germination frequency was reduced by 5 orders of magnitude. Both genes code for lytic enzymes which are active in the process of germination.
gerD and cwlB: When knocked out together, germination frequency was reduced by 5 orders of magnitude.  The gerD product plays an unknown role in nutrient germination; the product of cwlB plays a role in cell wall turnover & cell lysis. Note: after several attempts to knock out cwlB, and yielding cells unable to grow or cells growing at a very slow rate, we decided that knocking out cwlB would not be prudent for the production of Sporobeads , as it would delay all experiments in the GerminationSTOP module.
cwlD: When knocked out, germination occurred at a rate of "

spin–spin relaxation"
Uppsala-Sweden,2009,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Ethanol_-_-_TEXT.html,". Hence we build a construct that encodes for ethanol production in our host organism.
The Pathway
Light energy is used in the Calvin cycle to transform water and carbon dioxide into organic compounds, among those is Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, which immediately splits into two 3-Phosphoglycerate molecules. [2] These two molecules can now be converted to 2-Phosphoglycerate. Enolase and pyruvatekinase finally catalyze the reaction over phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. [3] The resulting pyruvate molecule can be now used as a substrate for ethanol production. A schematic view can be found further down .
Our first BioBrick for ethanol production  is the pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis which decarboxylates pyruvate to form acetaldehyde (ethanal). [4] [5] Ethanal is then further catalyzed with a alcohol dehydrogenase to ethanol. [6] Initially we intended to use the adh2 from Z. mobilis but during the project we encountered some problems with our Z. mobilis strain, which made us change our plans as you will see further below.
The Constructs
We designed multiple constructs as we ran into some unexpected restriction site problem during the assembling process. The Z. mobilis strain which was source of the pdc and adh, most probably had a mutation inside the adh2 gene, which lead to a novel EcoRI restriction site. Thus we decided to build a back up construct using the adh2 from S. cerevisiae.
We build as well versions for testing purposes in E. Coli.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Modeling#Tutorial_-_-_TEXT.html," These methods may lead to the constants \(K_{max}\) and \(K_{half}\) being defined differently.
Stochastic gene expression models
In our project we experimented with stochastic models to evaluate gene expression parameters, much like the deterministic models above. We ran the model here but found that it was not directly insightful to the project, so the tutorial has been left to help future iGEM teams.
The simplest way to add an element of 'randomness' into an equation is to add a random term into the differential equation. This turns it into a stochastic differential equation, such as:
\[\dfrac{dx}{dt}=c+r\]
Stochastic simulation of the movement of a physical particle.
which determines the evolution of a particle travelling at a speed \(c\), with a random number \(r\) added into the mix just for fun. We choose \(r\) to be normally distributed with a mean value of 0 and a variance of, say, 1. We evaluate the position of the particle at multiple timesteps (with some small time \(dt\) separating them) and plot our solution in the Figure below.
We can actually find an exact stochastic simulation that produces a trajectory that is an exact sample from the probability mass function that is the solution to the chemical master equation. The Gillespie algorithm tells us:
The time taken between reactions
The reaction that took place in that time.
Sampling method to find the time taken between reactions. Take a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 and read off a time value from the graph.
1) To find the time taken, we make an assumption about the form of the probability distribution that the time between reactions holds. Wait times for Poisson processes follow an exponential distribution, so we are lead to the form
\[P(t)=e^{-\alpha_{0}t}\]
where \(P(t)\) is the probability of any reaction occuring in time \(t\), and \(\alpha_{0}\) tells us something about the likelihood of the reaction. We plot this in the Figure. In fact we call \(\alpha_{0}\) the sum of the propensities \(\alpha_{i}\) (where the dummy variable \(i\) runs from 1 to the number of possible reactions, \(N\), that could occur). In the case of our example system, the propensity for the reaction \(A\) to \(B\) would be \(k_{+}A\) and the propensity for the reaction \(B\) to \(A\) is \(k_{-}B\) so in this case \(\alpha"

Symposium
We had the great pleasure of collaborating with the Uppsala and Stockholm iGEM teams of 2018 in the intersection of our human practices efforts. Their topic of choice aligned itself perfectly with ours in terms of both objective and essence. The opportunity to join forces arose organically following a series of fruitful video conferences outlining the aim and plan of action of each team. All agreed to host a symposium regarding stress in academia and the exciting topic of biohacking and its ethical implications.
After nearly 3 months of logistics planning and contacting potential speakers, we made the travel up to University of Uppsala to organize event. Prior to the event Uppsala had finished their handbook on stress management, outlining stress management strategies on an individual level. We had the privilege of contributing to the final product with a small essay on the importance of an authentic work environment. Authenticity is a concept of convergence between action and personal values or beliefs and lack there of has been directly linked to higher levels of occupational stress. The essay will be made available as part of our work on management for human practices [LINK] or as an edited version in Uppsala’s handbook. Our team and Uppsala chose to inquire into prevalence and nature of occupational psychological distress in academia and, in particular, as related to iGEM. In addition, different approaches to stress management were investigated in hopes of developing a set of tools for stress alleviation. While team Lund decided to focus on proactive strategies implemented at the organizational level, Uppsala emphasized interventions on an individual level.
The symposium consisted of several lectures on different topics related to occupational stress as well as a moderated panel discussion on bioethics. In addition, Uppsala hosted a mindfulness session consisting of breathing exercises designed to alleviate stress and arousal. The entire event, titled Limits of Life, was open to the public and oriented in a popular scientific manner.
After a short introduction by the teams, Will Wright of the iGEM Foundation took the stage to briefly outline the iGEM competition and discuss his experience with iGEM teams, their organization and common issues experienced by participants related to their project. The presentation was then followed by a lecture on the science behind stress and burn-out by the distinguished psychiatrist and professor Marie Åsberg. Prof. Åsberg discussed her research on occupational well-being and the emergence of fatigue syndrome"

The credits for accomplishment of this project goes to the dedication, commitment and enthusiasm shown by a large number of people and parties from multiple disciplines. It gives us immense pleasure and gratification to acknowledge their support and assistance towards the execution of the project.
School Workshops (2017, July-October):
iGEM IIT Delhi conducted seminars and lab workshops on synthetic biology in various high schools of Delhi. These workshops were aimed at informally introducing the students to this field. ‘Just like you join together Lego blocks to create structures, you can join together genes to create new biological systems’ was the main theme behind most of our workshops.
The session began with the basics of synthetic biology, iGEM, our projects. This was followed by a compendious presentation on ‘Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology’, which involved discussion on Ethical issues like Bioterrorism, Patenting and Creation of Monopolies, Uncontrolled release, Creating Artificial Life etc.
In order to give students a flavor of lab work, we conducted an experimental workshop in their lab. The experimental workshop consisted of simple illustrations and some hands-on experience for them such as Plasmid isolation, Gel electrophoresis, Inoculation, streaking, etc. We further encouraged the school students to make a team of their own and participate in iGEM and assured full support from our side. Finally, we took the feedback and conducted a small survey based on general awareness. The workshops were successful as we could see students really getting excited about the entire idea of iGEM and seemed to be enthusiastic for the competition. In Fact, we received a letter of Appreciation from one of the school (DAV Public School Sector-14, Gurgaon, Delhi).
Feedback obtained from the students: 9.35/10 (Total No of students:196)
9.3/10

BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," same as each other. These two tubulin monomers are named α tubulin monomer and β tubulin monomer. Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments aggregated by tubulin dimers end to end. And microtubule can be the hollow tube with 13 protofilaments coiled into helix with each other, water in hollow part. The tube wall is 4～5nm thick.  Tubulin dimers are incorporated into the growing lattice in the GTP-bound form and stochastically hydrolyze to GDP-tubulin, thus forming a GTP-cap. It is thought that the switching from growth to shrinkage occurs due to the loss of the GTP-cap.
Caplow M [1] research shows that when the cap structure of microtubule plus end subunit containing GDP- beta tubulin instead of GTP- beta tubulin, microtubule becomes unstable and will quickly disaggregate.
Fig.2 Microtubule dynamic instability
As is shown in the figure, there are two kinds of Dimer, called GDP and GTP, with blue and red two connected to the circular. These dimers have close relationship with each other, and there are three important modes of their action.
GTP-tubulin dimer in endpoint can aggregate new GTP to make the single protofilament grow, and microtubules extend.
At the same time, the endpoint GTP may also be made off, thereby protofilaments shorter.
Any place of GTP (in addition to the right endpoints of the GTP) made made random hydrolyzed to GDP have a chance.
Fig.3 Parameters of GTP-tubulin dimer hydrolysis
In order to verify and test the degree of the taxol’s influence on microtubule’s length.
We treated tubulin with taxol of different concentrations, measured their intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength.
First, we use the boxplot to conduct the descriptive statistical analysis. Then, we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data given by the experiment.
1.0 - Descriptive statistical analysis
Before we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data, we need to conduct some simple descriptive statistical analysis. This analysis can help us gain the overall understanding of the data, find the abnormal data, and then guide our next work.
We summarized tubulin-inflorescence fusion protein’s intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength under different taxol’s concentration treatments. The shape of experimental group emission"

Functional Prototype
The functional prototype of our facilitated microfluidic workflow follows a fictitious researcher in synthetic biology, Dr. Ali. Dr. Ali is looking to automate and parallelize his ability to characterize a novel genetic part in terms of how cells express his reporter gene when various levels of inducer are present. The video below follows Dr. Ali through the entire process of creating a microfluidic device using the Neptune workflow, as well as controlling the chip with Neptune's parametric control hardware. This video demonstrates each portion of entire user-interface driven design flow and also how our control interface works in real time in conjunction with our servo-syringe control infrastructure.
{Disclaimer: The microfluidic device seen in this video is demonstrating the ability to perform biological experiments, but actual biological components are not used. Instead, colored water is used as a model for the inducer and suspended cell media.}

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," and its expression is positively influenced by a feedback loop by binding in front of PesaS which facilitates polymerase recruitment. However, EsaR binds to the corresponding homoserine lactone (HSL) 3OC6-HSL (Fig.4, red), which is produced by the synthase EsaI. The transcription of the mRNAEsaR_EsaI_CepR decreases after binding of EsaR to 3OC6-HSL (Fig. 6), turning off the positive feedback loop. Simultaneously, repression of PesaRC is stopped. Thus, free DNA, not bound to protein, leads to a fast transcription of CFP and CepI, whereas the binding to EsaR represses its transcription. The second gene of interest (mRFP) gets expressed first with a small basal level of expression, but after the DNA binds to CepRHSL2 the transcription gets induced (Fig. 6).
Figure 6 mRNA transcription over time.
Expression
Figure 7 Expression of the genes of interests over time.
Expression of the gene of interest is also observed over time (Fig. 7, 8). We can see the expression of the second gene of interest (mRFP) starts ~12min later than the expression of the first gene of interest (CFP). At first, the expression is shifted ~30min to reach the same amount of molecules, but after ~2.5 hours the expression of mRFP is increasing and reaching the same level as CFP (Fig. 8). After 3 hours, mRFP is expressed more than CFP and is increasing strongly. This is due to the stronger transcription rate of mRNARFP, which is way shorter than mRNACFP_CepI.
The model showed that our planned system is capable to handle the expression of various pathways and is flexible if the length of mRNAs or proteins differ.
Figure 8Long term observation of the expression of the two genes of interest.
Incorporation of the Dopamine/L-DOPA pathway
The Dopamine and L-DOPA pathway is a good example to test the expression system, because it consists of three enzymes: Tyrosine hydroxylase, CYP2D6 (Cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6) and the AADC (Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase). With these enzymes, tyrosine is converted intracellular into dopamine (Fig. 9).

There's less than a month until the wiki freeze now; we need to put is as much time as humanly possible.
to do, molecular biology
-Clone everything into submission vectors and submit them. cyc1 is already in it's vector. Now we need to do the same for nmt1 and sfGFP as well.
-New batch of composite part arrives this week (hopefully). In the meantime we're transforming the yeast at Sandra's lab with an existing protein. Dejana fixing this later today. Need someone at the lab pretty much every day.
- We'll likely get some stuff from NTNU relatively soon, as well. They'll send protocols. This is a pretty important point for collaboration.
- What Eirik said.
to do, physics
- Worked on the wiki on Sunday, Thorlabs is sending the mirrors and filters now so we will hopefully have the setup ready for when the yeast is ready.
wiki-workshop(s)
-We're having a workshop this Wednesday, but we'll probably need to do these pretty often going forwards, maybe even once a week. We just need to write stuff now.
- Agreed, at least once a week.

Craig Venter unveils a man-made viral genome. Synthetic biology is born.
2003
Tom Knight publishes a paper establishing fundamentals of Biobricks. These standardised gene sequences form plug-and play DNA-based biological circuits.
2004
The first iGEM competition is held. Biobricks are submitted to the Registry of Biological Parts, maintained by MIT.
2008
Mackenzie Cowell is inspired to set up DIYbio.org after working at iGEM to groom amateur biologists & citizen scientists.
Origins of DIYbio
In 2003, Craig Venter ushered in a new approach to genetic engineering when he unveiled a man-made viral genome and promised the world artificially designed zombie cells. Thus, synthetic biology was born, and it became conceivable to make living machines that could be programmed to carry out desired tasks.
Shortly after, Tom Knight, a big name in Silicon Valley, turned his attention to genetics. Bringing his programming approach to synthetic biology, he proposed a novel idea to introduce a drag-and-drop philosophy to working with gene sequences. These Biobricks treat verified and standardized gene sequences as blackboxes, that will function as they are intended to, independently of upstream and downstream gene sequences. By joining together different combinations of Biobricks, biological organisms can be programmed into machines with different objectives.
Since the reservoir of gene sequences is constantly growing, it is impossible for one person or one team to progressively catalog all possible Biobricks. So, the MIT Registry of Biological Parts was set up, to build up a public domain database of standardised Biobricks. New sequences are contributed annually by undergraduate teams working on"

This is a plasmid providing selection pressure for the evolution and enrichment of  tryptophan overproduction microorganism phenotype by defending the toxicity of  tetracycline. This selection pressure was based on the tryptophan dependent tetracycline  antiporterexpression which functioned in tetracycline culture condition.It is  achieved by cloning E.

Review and forecast
We think our model applies to the situation where bacteria swim freely without casualty. However, for the model has many statements, we could expect nuances from the real complex world. The differences in condition are listed in Table 1.
Table 1 The difference between conditions in the real world and those assumed in our model. Shown in red are factors that could significantly alter the eventual result.
Viscid layers around root could potentially boost the system’s performance.
We can probably improve the performance by triggering suicide with a threshold concentration, instead of time. But since we lack corresponding element for such function, and with certain biosafety concerns (to prevent gene pollution), we stick to time trigger.
Still, the modeling, albeit simple, provides us with an otherwise infeasible evaluation of the whole project. The Prometheus has certain potential to work as we wished.

Results
While we successfully extract violacein from the original strain we received from the University of Washington’s DAWGMA group, we were not successful in producing a strain with our desired promoters. There are a few possible sources of this difficulty. We may have been unable to elute properly during purification due to either issues with DNA length or procedural inaccuracies. Primer design may have room for improvement. If the length of the primers were too long, spontaneous formation of hairpins could have formed along the length of the primer due to a high ΔG. Conversely, if the length of the primers were too short, the primers may have nonspecific binding.
We assembled the four fragments used to make the plasmid: Cup1+VioC, Gal1+VioD, VioABE, and our vector component. However the final plasmid size was 16 kilobases. A four part, 16 kbp Gibson Assembly proved challenging and consistently had low yields and unsuccessful transformations. Although the assembly of this plasmid was unsuccessful, the violacein genes used to make the plasmid came from the biobrick part BBa_K274002, which was built using the well characterized pPSX vio+ plasmid from the Pemberton Group at the University of Queensland. The results of pPSX vio+ plasmid indicated stability without antibiotics for a hundred generations or more (Sarovich 2007). Furthermore, additional characterization of pPSX vio+ performed by the 2009 Cambridge iGEM Team indicated further stability as the violacein pigments remained in the bacteria and did not bleed into the media even after prolonged periods of time (Violacein 2009). Therefore, based on these two prior characterizations we have a firm belief that our plasmid, as a derivative of pPSX vio+, would have shown promising results in pigment stability. We continue to work towards the production of a suitable Violacein strain using our three-plasmid strategy.
Conclusions
Our team’s original goal was to reconstruct the violacein plasmid with inducible promoters to replace the current constituent promoters that are naturally present. We did this so that we could establish the parameters of two inputs with four color signal outputs needed to automate our system. The plasmid we were building was quite large and therefore the Gibson Assemblies repeatedly turned out unsuccessful. Our team then changed our plasmid building methods and decided to make three smaller plasmids and then do a double/tripple transformation. Since our"

Public Outreach
For our public outreach, we first wanted to understand the public’s opinion on the use of genetically modifying plants to produce medicines. We initially created a survey to learn whether the public approved of the use of plants, bacteria and animals to produce medicines, and how the approval changed when the medicines were produced by genetic modification. We were very pleased by the 275 responses we obtained.
As well as our survey, we also were interested in speaking to the public and engaging with them face to face to find out their views. We also saw iGEM as a way to teach the public, mostly children and teenagers, more about genetics, and the future of genetic modification.
Fascination of Plant Science Day: 20/5/2017
Our iGEM team went to Dyffryn Gardens National Trust outside of Cardiff for the Fascination of Plant Science Day, along with some other plant scientists from Cardiff University. In hopes to encourage people, especially children to have an interest in plant science, by teaching them more about plants than what is on the curriculum. We set up a stand on how to extract DNA from strawberries to learn about DNA and genetics.
As well as bringing along some of our tobacco plants to demonstrate how we infiltrate plants with DNA to genetically modify the plant, although we were using water and food colouring instead of agrobacterium. We had a lot of interest in these stalls, with some of the children infiltrating the plants better than the iGEM team members! While we were there, as it was not only Fascination of Plants Day, it was also Orchid Day at Dyffryn Gardens; we were also able to talk to some of the other visitors about their views on genetic modification of plants to produce medicines, with most of them having a positive response to the use of GM. We explained how plants have recently been used to produce vaccines, like with the Ebola and Zika virus, which the public agreed was important and worth the use of genetic modification.

ABM
Compared to traditional modeling methods, such as ODE, PDE and many others, the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is based on the modeling of individual behaviors.
In ABM, the agent chooses his next step based on the surrounding circumstance. The most intriguing part of ABM is that the overall phenomenon emerges from a large collection of agents. This gives us the opportunity to discover something beyond the scope of traditional modeling methods.
So In our ABM part, we aimed at:
Give a comprehensive analysis of the artificial system
Discover fresh new characteristics
Visualize the collective behaviors of many cells
NetLogo Prototype
We have constructed a agent-based model based on NetLogo, and conducted two experiments in computer.

Agent: C.crescentus
Environment:

Light: effecting the cell's movement ability
Behavior: The agent cell have two life-stages: swimmer and attached. In the previous state, the cell will move around the plate in a nearly random way; when it gets near to the solid surface, its holdfast will be attached to the surface so it can intake the nutrition from surface.

Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," to generate higher quality gels to determine which fraction the expressed proteins occur and to determine whether smaller degradation fragments of the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct become soluble.
Figure 1 depicts the soluble vs. insoluble fractions of CR2 Gag-Prot-RT induced at 28°C and 35°C. The putative 90 kDa full sized CR2 Gag-Prot-RT construct, 75 kDa CR2 Gag-Prot degradation fragment, and 50 kDa CR2 Gag degradation fragment occur in the insoluble fraction. Another interesting finding to note is the difference in intensity of the 75 and 50 kDa bands between the 28°C and 35°C inductions. It is possible that the protease is more active at lower temperatures and is there for able to cleave the 75 kDa intermediate into the 50 kDa fragment at a higher rate leading to the loss of the 75 kDa band and gain of a more intense 50 kDa band at 28°C. These findings suggest that a lower temperature induction should be conducted to screen for the smaller fragments of the construct corresponding to protease, RT tail, capsid, spacer, and nucleocapsid. In future insoluble purifications to screen for these smaller fragments, lysozyme should be avoided as it generates a very intense band in the 10-15 kDa region. We believe that the RT tail, protease, and nucleocapsid proteins are roughly this size. Protease, nucleocapsid, and spacer by themselves are not histidine tagged and so, would likely be found in the washes of a purification whereas the capsid and RT tail would be found in the elutions.
Figure 2 depicts the purification performed on the soluble fraction of the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT 28°C and 35°C cultures. Small amounts of the full-sized fragment do occur in the soluble fraction; however, the yield is very low and it is inadvisable to attempt future purifications form the soluble fraction. Washes were performed with wash buffer containing no imidazole. Future purifications will utilize 10mM and 30mM wash buffers to optimize the removal of non-histidine tagged proteins form the nickel resin.

Safety Concerns for iGEM Competition:
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
use other selection forms like auxotrophic mutants for amino acids, not antibiotic resistance, to prevent release of resistant strains into the environment. However, because we wanted to try MFC with wastewater, this method would not be useful as in addition we would need to add amino acid, which would affect the metabolism.
usually the antibiotics that are used in the lab are different from medically common antibiotics and would potentially cause no influence towards MRSA and similar

Biocompatible Elastic Artificial Muscle
Beam me up!
Abstract
The development of artificial muscles attracts wide interest for industrial and medical    applications. Regarding manufacturing, robotic devices with synthetic muscles are able to    handle complex-shaped materials more precisely. Moreover, artificial musculatures in medical    prostheses can improve the wearing comfort while conveying a rather natural feeling.    Currently, muscle-like contractions can be obtained by capacitor systems or by molecular    machines incorporating tissue. This project aims to replace the common materials in both    branches by biological tissue. While increasing ecological friendliness and the compatibility    with human tissue, those fabricated composites can compete with human biological    material.

In a first set of experiments,    the elastomer layers in the capacitor-based muscle need to be replaced by appropriate protein    structures. P-Pili with their excellent elastic properties and proteins with high amounts of    helical secondary architecture are to be tested for this approach. In a next step, the currently    used light weighted graphene or carbon nanotube layers need to be replaced by the Pili to    provide conductivity and flexibility comparable to the carbon nanotubes. Both fibril types can    be easily expressed in Geobacter sulflurreducens and Escherichia coli in a large scale, which    makes the overall system extremely feasible since one organism can provide the whole    material.
Another tissue with muscle-like contractions will be fabricated through polymers with    integrated molecular machines. Herein, the latter are based on azo dyes capable of having    their entire network contracted by light irradiation"

Furthermore a substrate concentrations against OD curve was measured, so that the substrate concentration can be calculated from OD curves. In this week we also set up the list of linkers to be tested in the lysozyme assay. Also for DNMT1 the software gave out completely software-predicted linkers.
Linkersoftwarewise many bugfixes were made and it was tested to run it on our distributed computing system.The Golden Gate assembly to get circular lambda lysozyme with a flexible linker was successfully repeated. However, the plasmid could not be cloned into Bl21 (DE3), our expression strain. We could never really figure out the reason, but something must be wrong with pSBX4C5.
The amino acid sequences of 20 new linkers generated by the linker software were backtranslated, split into shorter oligos and ordered.
In this week we mainly focused on how to analyse the data from the lysozyme assays, different modelling approaches were taken and lots of refinements to the existing assays were discussed. We now want to try whether lysozyme is able to recover within a night and want to test, whether it would help if we add protease inhibitors to the protein mix. We started to set up an enzyme kinetics system to have a better modelling of the data achieved in multiple experiments.
Softwarewise we have made several bugfixes and worked a lot on running-stability of the software, so now we will try to distribute it, when the servers run again.
Some of the linkers that arrived earlier than the rest were cloned into pSBX4C5-2Zv2Npu:Lalys+ccdb by Golden Gate assembly. Again, the cloning and sequencing was successful for most of the plasmids, but they could not be transformed into Bl21 (DE3).
Everything was repeated using pSBX1K3-... instead. We also conducted the Golden gate assemblies for the remaining 15 linkers. We changed our Golden gate protocol to 50 cycles as recommended by the team Freiburg 2012
The sequencing was successful for the linkers may1, sgt2, sho1, sho2 and flex. bad1 and sgt1 had mutations. Transformation into Bl21 (DE3) was successful.
The sequencing results for the other 15 linkers were disastrous. Only 2 of 15 linkers, ord1 and ord3 were ok. In most of the"

Part Collection
1.Parts Collection One (Engineered Biofilm Subunit CsgA with SpyCatcher and HisTag)
a) In order to realize covalent link of two proteins, we make use of SpyTag and SpyCatcher system (see our Linkage System on Biofilm Page). The SpyTag is fused to HydA of the hydrogenase system, thus a SpyCatcher on CsgA would enable Spy-tagged Hydrogenase to be covalently attached to CsgA In the meantime, to endow biofilm CsgA protein with additional functionalities (such as specific binding to QDs or Nanorods in our case), we append one or two HisTag  at the N- or/and C-terminus of the CsgA-spycatcher protein.  This lead to two new constructs, HisTag-CsgA-SpyCatcher-HisTag ( BBa_K2132001 ) and HisTag-CsgA-SpyCatcher (the former being sequence confirmed and submitted).
➤ CsgASpyCatcherHisTag (E. coli) - BBa_K2132001
➤ mCherry-SpyTag (E. coli) - BBa_K2132003
b) To determine if  expression of the two proteins is successful, we constructed mCherry-SpyTag to test the activity of the SpyCatcher on the CsgA. mCherry-SpyTag is thus submitted as BBa_K2132003 , sequence confirmed.
2.Parts Collection Two (Hydrogenase gene clusters)
We optimized [FeFe] Hydrogenases originally from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum (optimized coding sequence: hydA, BBa_K2132004 & BBa_K2132005 ) to accept electrons and therefor enable catalytic production of hydrogen in our project. Synthesis of heterologous [FeFe] hydrogenase in E. coli requires co-expression of HydE (optimized coding sequence: hydE, BBa_K2132006 ), HydF (optimized coding sequence: hydF, BBa_K2132007 ), and HydG (optimized coding sequence: hydG, BBa_K2132008 ).

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test999999_-_-_TEXT.html," providing a better diagnostic tool, farmers will be able to know when to treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.
Methods of Detection
Currently the only method for detection and counting of how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires timely shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing and treat their horses regardless of need, contributing to the problem of resistance [10].
Resistance development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,5]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance[2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [15,16].
Due to all of these facts, we aim to develop a diagnostic tool to give horse owners a better estimation of the amount of worms in the horse. This would allow them to adapt the deworming treatment based on the level of infection.

Prevention
Large Strongyles
The small strongyles larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested[4]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle[4,11]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals[8]. The large strongyle therefore needs to be detected in pasture in order to prevent infection.

BioBricks used: BBa_J33201(Edinburgh ) , BBa_K2205022 (New)
Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three E. coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by replacing the IPTG detector part of the Sensynova design with different detecting parts. In particular, an Arsenic sensing part will be used.
Background Information
The part BBa_J33201 was made by the Edinburgh team in 2006.
Figure 1: BBa_J33201 design.
This part consists of the promoter of the E. coli JM109 chromosomal arsenic detoxification operon (ars operon), including the ArsR repressor binding site and the arsR gene encoding the arsR repressor protein, together with its ribosome binding site. Addition of any other genes to the 3' end of this part will result in their expression being dependent on the presence of sodium arsenate or sodium arsenite. Arsenite or arsenite anion binds to the repressor protein ArsR, resulting in inability to repress the promoter. Based on Edinburgh's 2006 team experiments, a concentration of 1 micromolar sodium arsenate in LB is sufficient for essentially full expression, though this will vary according to conditions.
Design Stage
In order to introduce the Arsenic sensing part in the Sensinova framework, the part BBa_K2205008 containing the RBS B0034, the lasI coding sequence and the double terminator B0015 has been included in the design. The new part BBa_K2205022 presents biobrickable suffix and prefix and has been designed to have specific overhangs to be assembled in the plasmid pSB1C3 by Gibson assembly method.
Figure 2: The new part BBa_K2205022 based on the previous Arsenic detector design BBa_J33201 , implemented by the Sensynova part coding for the connector 1, BBa_K2205008 .

B. The nitrate sensing promoter BBa_K381001 can detect a gradient of NO3- concentrations and its activities were reported in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU).
Nitrate is an essential nutrient which plays multiple roles in plant growth and reproduction.
This biosensor BBa_K381001 monitors NO3- concentration.
Activity of NO3- sensing promoter ( BBa_K216005 ) was re-characterized to further investigate on the behavior of it.
An effort to make iGEM a better community
Nitrate is an essential nutrient which plays multiple roles in plant growth and reproduction. For example, it provides nitrogen that plants need for producing amino acids and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Also, it is a component of chlorophyll and is therefore essential for photosynthesis.
PyeaR is first characterized and BioBricked by Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team and then further characterized by BCCS-Bristol 2010 iGEM team. To provide more characterization data on such a devices, we further characterize this promoter.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do"

Law Initiative
Copenhagen Play
Manuals
Conferences
Movie Projection
For human practices we have done a variety of things, mostly dedicated to the dissemination of science within our University, locally in the city of Puebla and nationally through collaborations with other high schools
Law Initiative
During the length of our project, we found that importing chemicals reagents and biological agents that we needed were difficult to pass through customs. In coordination with other Mexican teams, specially Tec-Monterrey Team we propose to a local Deputy Patricia Leal Islas a change in customs law, to make it easier for future iGEMers and other scientists to continue with their investigations. Trough this Virtus-Parva shows as a team it's compromise to help the development of science in Mexico.
The proposal consists in the reformulation of the classification of biological agents and biomaterials, such as DNA, enzymes and bacteria. We recommended to the authority to employ experts in biology for a better and efficient process in customs
Copenhagen Play
Of course we wanted information about science to reach as far and wide as we possibly could, beyond the small talk we gave before our movie projection. Because of this, we formed an alliance with a couple of art majors and we decided to stage the play “Copenhaguen”. This play stages the visit of German physicist and Nobel laureate Werner Heisenberg into Copenhaguen to visit his friend, Niels Bohr; conflict arises when, after that mysterious visit, both colleagues rupture their 20 year society, and a pivoting point during the Second Great War takes place. The staging of the play was to be intertwined with informative capsules on the topics of the play.
Manuals
We also found that being the first iGEM team from our university was not an easy task, advice from a past iGEMer would have been very helpful. Other teams noticed this as well, in particular, ITESM-CEM Team. In cooperation with them, we decided to write an extensive handbook for future iGEM teams that need to consult on the mechanics of the contest and need a little push to continue teams in their own universities.

This type of an approach where you lyse then refold is well-documented with something long-known like insulin (I think this is actually how it's industrially produced), but refolding would probably be pretty tedious to work out for something like Keratinase where it hasn't been done before. Possibly doable though, just might take a while to figure out. 4. Express in other organisms: there's expression in a yeast that's been reported (we didn't look very much into it- I forget which one off the top of my head), but I think it might have a similar problem as B. subtilis in terms of growth rate. 5. Other approaches we haven't thought of. That's a possibility too. It's probably important to understand mechanistically how the enzyme works. Not much is known (after much searching by us), but we found that most Keratinases are simply just serine proteases. They can't actually cleave the disulfide bonds of feathers which make feathers so mechanically strong- it requires the presence of a strongly reducing environment or (speculated) reductases to get the job done. There's also an incredible number of Keratinases that have been identified that differ in mechanism (while most are serine proteases, some are metalloproteases I think), and optimal functional environment- pH, temperature, etc. For us, if we were to do the project, we would have chosen a Keratinase that functions at a high temperature due to the high temperatures at which industrial processes like these usually function at and possibly at a lower pH (instead of KerA). I probably have a reference paper somewhere with a big list of known Keratinases. It might be that it doesn't matter which one you choose and you might just choose a well known one like KerA or KerBL, but this is something that should definitely be considered. The main reasons we didn't pursue this project is because it didn't seem like there was anything novel we could do with it when looking at the literature/what had been done with the past, as well as the fact we got discouraged by the various disadvantages we'd listed above and didn't think it was possible to accomplish the goal we'd want to aim for of production at industrially relevant levels.
