Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.
Jiang WU
Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.
Making a plan, doing experiments and fail and planning again. Following this circle and eventually gained payback.
He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final goal"

For PotD, it is clear from the gel that it is being successfully overexpressed since there is an intense band present at the 37kDa marker which corresponds to the expected size of PotD in the induced culture sample. For SBP, there is no band present which suggests SBP is being overexpressed.

Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, one was induced with 1mM IPTG and one was left uninduced as a control. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#GRAS_-_-_TEXT.html," the GAF protein in B.subtilis is successful, our goal is to express multiple GAF domains in this organism and quantify whether expression is comparable to that of E.coli.
If our future transformations and subsequent expression of the GAF protein in B.subtilis is unsuccessful, our goal is to first learn why and then try other GRAS organisms until we establish that GAF domains can be expressed in a GRAS organism and brought into the human food system.

Day 5:
We got further responses from our sponsors. BioSilta gave us a voucher worth £500 so we could order anything below that value from their catalogue. The modelling team met with Chris Hooley and decided that their system . They also concluded that adding another set of equations relating the pBAD repressor (AraC) and pBAD promoter concentrations will be needed. They still have to find the production/degradation/dissociation rates for the relevant reactions and may brute force the data to tell us which values, in specific ranges, will optimize for protegrin-1 production.
Week 6 - 15/07/11
Day 1:
We had our bi-weekly meeting with our supervisors. We responded to Biosilta with a list of the things we may need in the lab, including more supercompetent E. coli and various reaction reagents. The modelling team looked at compiling the last set of equations on pBAD inducer and pBAD promoter but found extremely limited information in this area. There were discussions and the team decided to e-mail Dr Roger Griffiths, an expert on enzyme kinetics, a contact obtained from Sarah. The database was also completed today, a huge success for the human practices team. Chris sent out emails to some statisticians to help in the analysis of our data.
Day 2:
The modelling team found an error in the original set of equations. They discovered that the repressor wasn't separated from the promoter, although it’s concentration does change. Also, the Arabinose+AraC complex concentration linked to the promoter ‘strength’, and by extension, the transcription rate. Ogaga and Sam performed a miniprep and digestion of our Biobrick extracted from E. coli, while Charlie looked at primer construction for use in creating our Drug Delivery Proof. The team also worked on the WSDC presentation and started collating quotes and ideas for the cons of synthetic biology (as Dundee was assigned the pros of synthetic biology).
Day 3:
The modelling team had a meeting with Chris and John to discuss the current state of modelling and realised that they have a few constants but need to work on the arabinose system/equilibrium inside the cell. They also decided to use the MATLAB platform to perform simulations. In all, they have a general setup with a variety of ‘ranges’ for constants.

Modelling Training
Today we continued learning about stochastic and deterministic modelling and looked at converting the rate parameters in RuleBender. We made the logo more detailed and narrowed it down to two ideas.
GUS cloning strategy
We began work on the GUS cloning strategy which we plan to use to create Beta-glucuronidase producing L-forms to grow and visualise L-forms in plants.  The β-glucuronidase produced by the L-forms will cleave the colourless substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide (X-Gluc) to produce a blue product allowing the L-form distribution in plant tissue to be observed. This would involve inserting part:BBa_K330002 into our bacteria. We also started a rough design of the BioBrick, selecting a promoter, Ribosome binding site and antibiotic marker.

Basic Lab Skills
Before we started work in the lab, we were briefed on various lab health and safety policies to ensure we maintained a safe working environment. We were then given a tour around the lab to inform us of the layout including waste disposal procedures, location of chemicals and use of equipment.
We were then taught how to calibrate pipettes and learned how to operate them. We are also shown how to inoculate bacteria to a liquid culture and how to prepare bacteria streak plates.

NortheasternU-Boston,2017,Team:NortheasternU-Boston#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"inium may have contributed to cell death. Another factor that contribute to this discrepancy was the evaporation of the liquid cell cultures. This evaporation could have led to cell death in some reactions early on in the time-course, creating the appearance of a toxic AMP. In addition, the first assay did not have replicates for the AMP reactions, furthering the uncertainty in the effectiveness of the AMPs. In the second assay, all AMP reactions were performed in triplicate and were consistently within 95% confidence interval of all other reactions, save the cells only control. Once again, this points to a lack of sufficient expression of the AMP and a small toxic effect due to cell-free buffer conditions.
AMP expressed via PURExpress Plate Based Killing Assay
In order to determine whether or not it was the AMPs or the cell free expression reaction that was ineffective we expressed BP100 ( BBa_K2431002 ) and Micrococcin C7 ( BBa_K2431000 ) using NEBs PURExpress cell-free protein expression kit using long and short promoters. These reactions were then applied to a BL21 E. coli bacterial lawn on LB plates at reaction concentration and at a 1:4 dilution. Plates were left to grow overnight at 37C. Pictures below show that under both promoters and typically at both dilutions both BP100 and Micrococcin C7 are effecitve at killing BL21 E. coli. 11L and 11S indicate BP100 expressed with the long and short promoters respectively. 12L and 12S indicate Micrococcin C7 expressed with the long and short promoters respectively. “N” indicates the normal undiluted reaction concentration and “D” indicates the diluted reaction mixture. No Temp plates were plates dosed with control PURExpress reaction without any DNA template added.The success of the AMPs in killing bacteria in this assay once again indicates that the expression of AMP in the cell free reaction used in the liquid culture killing assay was not sufficient. However, this plate based assay shows the antimicrobial effects of both Micrococcin and BP100.

British_Columbia,2018,Team:British Columbia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," an idea of science and how this leads to pseudoscience. Dr. Heine explained to us that it is natural human habit to categorize everything. Thus, when categories begin to merge together we are uneasy about the essence of the thought and examples of this is transgenic vs cisgenic modification. Our next big discussion was about how we can stray people away from believing in this certain idea of genetics and he informed us that people think of genes as having a different influence on your behavior as your experiences. Interestingly, he claims that the general public have this preconceived notion that that genes are unavoidable thus should not be altered with and is a detrimental impact to society. Heine suggested that if we wanted people to leave this old mentality and support synthetic biology that we should target the public using the same medium that targets the public and feeds it negative information. This would be through social media. He told us that we should make videos, advertisements and common posters that serve to correctly and directly to the public rather than incorrectly and subconsciously be served.
A: Using this information we will write our journal article keeping in mind that there are preconceived notions about synthetic biology therefore when trying to attract readers we should allow time beforehand to advertise and inform the public with correct information and introduce the benefits of this science field. Additionally, we will be talking to James Vogl, a science editor so we are able to get a different perspective on how to construct an article."
NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," to be an efficient and effective method for the assembly of plasmids, and molecular biologists now use this method extensively. T5 Exonuclease - creates single-strand DNA 3’ overhangs by chewing back from the DNA 5’ end. Complementary DNA fragments can subsequently anneal to each other. Phusion DNA Polymerase - incorporates nucleotides to “fill in” the gaps in the annealed DNA fragments. Taq DNA Ligase - covalently joins the annealed complementary DNA fragments, removing any nicks and creating a contiguous DNA fragment.
Experimental Procedure:
●Design the primers (see figure below). Adjacent segments should have identical sequences on the ends (sequences A and B in the figures). One strategy is to design primers that are 60 bp long, with 30 bp matching the end of the adjacent fragment and 30 bp annealing to the target sequence. Avoid Hairpins in this region, which can significantly reduce the efficiency of two homologous ends annealing.
●Generate DNA segments by PCR. ●Combine segments in Gibson Assembly Reaction and incubate the mix for 1 hour at 50°C. Note: Yields will be best when the DNA fragments are present in equimolar concentrations. The Gibson Cloning Master Mix (purchased from NEB) consists of three different enzymes within a single buffer. ●Transform the recombinant plasmid into bacteria and screen for the correct plasmid Product by Restriction Digest. ●Sequence the important regions of your final plasmid, particularly the seams between the assembled parts.
3. Conjugative transfer for the introduction of plasmids into FY-07:
Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. It is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact. During conjugation, the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon. Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element.

The biotechnology industry in the Baltic region was being developed probably at fastest rates in whole Europe in recent years. Although life sciences in our region are very popular among high-school and university students, surprisingly up until this year only one iGEM team - Vilnius-Lithuania - existed in the Baltics. So when we heard that our neighbors from the University of Tartu, Institute of Technology had formed a fresh iGEM team, we did not hesitate and immediately offered our guidance to help them with the initial steps to set up a project. During our visit at the University of Tartu, Institute of Technology we:
Gave lectures on key components of successful iGEM projects:
marketing and fundraising,
public relations,
human practices,
project development.
Through our three-year participation in the iGEM history, we have developed some good strategies to raise funds in a rather narrow potential-sponsor field in our region. Knowing that good projects require sufficient finance, we explained the best fundraising strategies which we personally applied for our projects. Next, as synthetic biology is a rather unknown scientific field in local Baltic communities, we taught efficient strategies of public relations: how to approach the public through mass media, how to build your social networks' communication strategy.

Experiment is performed as follows, bacteria are added into the plate on one side, and the attractant to the other. Result is then the shape of the formed colony which grows into distorted elipse shape within the agar if the attractant is present, however colony shape remains circular if no attractant was added.
In our experiment we have used 5-α Escherichia coli cells. Cells used as positive control were transformed with pSB1C3 plasmid backbone, which conferred chloramphenicol resistance. These cells have not been modified in any other way and were used to show 5-α E. coli are capable of chemotaxis, using serine as attractant, which acts as a ligand for Tsr, an endogenous chemoreceptor. 5-α Escherichia coli competent cells were also transformed with pRK415 a working plasmid with mcpS gene and tetracycline resistance. These cells express mcpS gene from P. putida KT2440, which is chemoreceptor with malate as its ligand, and therefore malate was used as attractant for these cells during agar plug in assay. As a negative control, no attractant was added into the plate.
Amount of attractant added contributes greatly towards the result, as too little attractant added will not stimulate bacteria to move towards source, however too much attractant will result in the saturation of the medium and the bacteria will not chemotax towards source. Values (concentration of attractant, distance between colony and attractant at start etc.), necessary to perform this experiment have been worked out using modelling.
These are the values of attractant concentration we have used, when 5µl sample was added into the plate:

Note: Concentration values for 4 & 5 were not obtained from models. They were overestimations to show possible saturation of the medium with attractant.

Figure 11: The columns of the Western blot correspond to the following samples,0-9:marker,ΔFimB_1His pellet, Top10_1His pellet,BL21(DE3)_1His pellet,BL21(DE3)_1His pellet,BL21(DE3)_1His supernatant, ΔFimH_1His supernatant, ΔFimB_1His supernatant, Top10_1His supernatant and marker. The bands present here demonstrate the affinity of protein with the same molecular weight as FimH with anti-His antibodies. This would imply that FimH_1His is being expressed.
The images of the SDS-PAGE gels demonstrate that the cells were successfully disrupted as protein bands were seen in both soluble and insoluble fractions. However, due to the fact that the samples were crude protein extracts, the gel images do not definitively show whether FimH-1His is expressed. The Western Blot image shows bands at the corresponding molecular weights for the FimH_1His protein with (32 kDa) and without (30 kDa) the signal peptide. In the ΔFimH culture, a band is seen in the soluble fraction corresponding to the molecular weight of the un-cleaved signal peptide-FimH_1His protein. This indicates that the protein is expressed but remains in the cytoplasm of the cell. In the BL21(DE3), Top10 and ΔFimB cultures, bands are seen in the insoluble fraction corresponding to the molecular weight of the cleaved FimH_1His protein. The lack of signal peptide demonstrates that the protein has been exported from the cytoplasm and the fact that the bands only appear in the insoluble fraction suggests that FimH-1His is somehow associated with the cell membrane. It is unclear as to why export should not occur in the ΔFimH strain.

Though most participants agree the need for POPS and RBS information     , they are concerned about the workload it would bring to individual     labs.
“To do this, the Registry need to define a reliable and easy method     of determining the PoPS for teams to use. However, I would say that     there are better systems for quantifying promoter output than PoPS,     and they should be used instead, if possible”.
67% of participants have thought that entering POPS      information should not be mandatory while submitting new parts.      Similarly, 65% of participants disagree that entering RIBS information      should be mandatory while submitting new parts
Even though the researchers feeling the need for this information     they are shying away from requesting it as a mandatory title for parts     registry as it would be difficult for underfunded and inexperienced     groups to perform these measurements.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would be even better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately.
82% of participants have thought that information on      working conditions of the parts should be mandatory while submitting      new parts. Most find submiting the detailed experimental      information and working conditions is crucial and even easier than      submitting measurements of POPS or RBS.

Michael Masika:
Just to add to what you said. So what we did is that, when you look at this. This is a simple register. This is a village known as Namila. This is the number of the household. Number of household members. These are four in total. The name of the household members. So this is the registration. This is for the trachoma MDA register. So we give this one to each one of the heads of surveillance assistance to register. So what we are doing here, we are actually doing registration. So in this household there are four people. And this is the date of their births, this is the sex. Of course we put the year, so 2016, 2017. So whatˋs happening during the actual mass drug administration, if Alina Caseinje shows up, then he is measured. His height is measured and the dosage is indicated here. So when he has finished during mop up, what he does is he goes to the register. He checks who has not taken the drug. So he follows them up on the server. So we actually make sure, that everyone takes the drug. Basically thatˋs what is happening here and additionally we are also coming to check which villages they can visit. Because we have been told that they shouldn’t be too far away from the district. But otherwise we would have taken them very far away so that they appreciate what is happening. So basically when they are coming, they observe the mass drug administration and they also observe surgeries. Trachomatous trichiasis surgeries which will take place at the district hospital and then from there they will be going back. So as BICO we are a partner that is coordinating the program. Now as a ministry, they are the beneficials of the program. Now the ITI is coming as a guest of the ministry. So the ministry representative has to see where the visitors are taken. You don’t take a visitor where you don’t even know...
Daniel C.:
So now you register and the next week you come back and you do the mass drug administration. Who does the mass drug administration?
David Chinyanya:
The head of surveillance assistant. Because they do a lot of work in the community. The organisation and the drugs, they are giving it to the people. So thatˋs the registration.

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Enzymes_-_-_TEXT.html," characterize a promoter system inhibited by the NahR protein, which is  induced by salicylate. We decided to test the expression of the NahR/Psal promoter system with different salicylate concentrations. Among the existing approaches for measuring the strength of a promoter, we chose to use fluorometry with the RFP dTomato as a reporter gene. A fluorometer was not available to us at the time, so we decided to create our own cheap fluorometer. You can read more about our fluorometer here .
Degradation
We chose to use two different types of enzymes for degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; laccases and dioxygenases. Laccases (originally from Chinese lacquer tree sap) are multicopper oxidases, that are employed in various industries, where they take part in beer maturation, textile dyeing, and enzymatic biofuel cells. Due to their broad specificity and ability to oxidize aromatic compounds, their application in bioremediation is a topic under investigation. The laccases we chose were three bacterial laccases: CueO - a laccase from E. coli, CotA - a laccase from Bacillus pumilus, and also a modified version of CueO.
We acquired the sequence for a modified CueO from Kunishige Kataoka. The modified laccase is a multicopper oxidase with a double mutation where aspartic acid has been changed with alanine and methionine with leucine (D439A/M510L). The mutation has been proved to have more efficiency to degrade ABTS than the unmodified one. We choose to work with D439A/M510L due to its efficiency and the supposed impact it would have on our constructs degradation time (Kataoka, K et al. 2012).
Dioxygenase is a type of enzyme that uses dioxygen to catalyze the oxidation of hydrocarbons. This type of enzyme is used to catalyze cleavage of the aromatic rings in our degradation pathway. We chose to use a catechol dioxygenase which is an important part of bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds. There are two main types of catechol dioxygenase; intradiol and extradiol dioxygenase. The end product in the intradiol degradation pathway is a carboxylic acid which is unharmful to the cell and can be used in the bacteria's metabolism. The end product in the extradiol degradation pathway is an aldehyde which is much more harmful to the cell than a carboxylic acid"

Week 1: May 1 - May 3
This week we attended the appropriate safety courses required by our University to work in the lab. Besides that, the undergraduate supervisors presented about the principles of Genetics and Synthetic Biology to the new team members.
Week 2: May 6 - May 10
This week we participated in a general molecular biology workshop to refresh our memory of techniques used in molecular biology.
Week 3: May 13 - May 17
We continued the molecular biology workshop. This week we also divided up into our respective groups for the project and decided research priorities.
Week 4: May 20 - May 24
We examined three problems related to ferritin. Firstly, we investigated protein isolation of ferritin. We are considering the protocols created by Santambrogio et al. (1993), as they have been used by multiple other authors as well. This paper uses precipitation followed by column chromatography, and verification with spectroscopy, PAGE and SDS-PAGE (Levi 1994). Alternatively, we may consider using his-tags for Ni-NTA column purification.
Secondly, we examined the feasibility of using magnetism to manipulate ferritin. Commercial horse spleen ferritin was tested on a magnetic Dynabead rack, and as expected, it did not move, as the core should not be magnetic. We must thus synthesize magnetoferritin wherein the native ferrihydrite core is converted to magnetite--a paramagnetic material which can be attracted to magnetic fields (Jordan et al. 2010, Wong et al. 1998). We were able to attain some general knowledge of"
Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," plating method described above requires that samples first be plated onto either Mannitol  Salt Agar in order to obtain yellow colonies, or Blood Agar to obtain zones of clearance. This will aid in picking out Staphilococcus aureus apart from other species which may have grown. Only after this initial growth can we plate on antibiotic plates containing β-lactam class of antibiotics (methicilin, penicillin and a few others). This would normally take up another, at the very least, 18-24 hours. Using StaphiScope, we could speed up the first step of this process, by picking out the Staphilococcus aureus from all other species without the requirement of growing them up on solid media overnight first. With StaphiScope, the bacterial population from the samples would be grown into liquid culture, and the presence of RFP will be evaluated. The following will be involved in using the StaphiScope method commercially:
1.Obtain sample from patient on cotton swab. This will, for example, be from a wound.
2.Obtain liquid LB culture and inoculate into it a colony (from a plate containing many) of StaphiScope E. coli. These are E. coli species containing BioBrick K359009 – final construct. These plates could be kept in stock for quick access.
3.Inoculate sample from patient into liquid media containing StaphiScope and place at 37°C for 3 – 4 hrs. In our experience this is sufficient to show color of RFP is it has been activated. In addition, it would be useful to spin the cells down through a centrifuge (2 min at 13, 000 rpm). This would  bring the cells to the bottom, allowing us to see the red color expressed more clearly.
4.Upon positive result (red color produced), the cells could now undergo either plating on media containing the methicillin class of antibiotics, or a PCR-detection method using nuc/mecA genes (as described in section 2.2.1)
This method would bring the time consumption demands down to a few hours, as opposed to at the very least, a day. As well, less media would be used in the process. Finally, it is much cheaper than the faster methods such as PCR.
It is possible to initially inoculate the sample from the patient into liquid broth containing samples of the methicillin class of antibiotics. The expression of RFP in this case would mean that MRSA are present. This direct method of detection could shorten the test to "

Day 3 (27/06/14): 
Today we carried out the transformation of our competent E.coli cells.  
Firstly we prepared 500ml of LB agar (5g Tryptone, 2.5g Yeast extract, 5g Sodium chloride, 10g agar) and autoclaved. Once this had cooled we added 0.5ml (1:1000 dilution) of chloramphenicol and made the plates. These were then allowed to set.  
We then carried out the transformation by thawing four eppendorfs of our competent cells on ice. 2µl of resuspended DNA (GFP open reading frame), was added to the competent cells, and 1µl of RFP control was added to the control competent cells. Cells they were incubated on ice for 30mins and were then heat shocked in a 42°C water bath for 60s and place back on ice for 5mins. 1ml of LB media was added to the cells and they were then incubated at   37°C for 2 hours. 50 and 100µl of the cells were plated on the LB agar   with chloramphenicol we had prepared and left to grow at room   temperature over the weekend. 
 
Week 2
Day 4 (30/06/14): 
Over   the weekend our plates had been growing, both plates of GFP transformed   cells showed many colonies of E.coli. The two control plates both only   had a few colonies and their morphology was very different to the   colonies on the other plates. We therefore repeated the control plates.  
We   picked a single colony from each plate we had grown and inoculated them   in glycerol stock and left them overnight to grow ready to carry out   the miniprep tomorrow.  
 
Day 5 (01/07/14): 
This   morning we centrifuged our inoculated cells but no pellet was produced.   We found out this is because they should not have been inoculated in   glycerol stock. We therefore took two more colonies from the 100µl   plates and inoculated them in LB and left to grow overnight.  
As   we had no growth on our repeated control plates we also repeated the   transformation, using RFP for the controls and YFP for the non-controls.   These were left to incubate overnight at 37°C.

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices#Business Students_-_-_TEXT.html," style was well received by the business students. With this in mind we moved forward with plans for a formal presentation and time for Q&A time. We followed up with Surjan Singh to give him as much time as possible to put together his presentation.
Search the Database & Adapt
The structure for our event was already determined by Mr. Henshaw's feedback and the subject was heavily influenced by the business students we spoke with. The goal of Surjan's presentation was to put synthetic biology into a business context, engaging more university students and future business owners in synthetic biology. This early engagement would hopefully lead to larger investments in synthetic biology research from members of the business community. However, we did still check our the Database . This kind of program combining business and a formal presentation was not as common as we originally assumed, but we did notice quite a few ""interviews with stake holders"" coming up when we searched using vendors/businesses option. We read through a few programs, namely British_Columbia's 2015 project where they kept incredibly detailed notes about their interviews with stakeholders in their bee project. The summary points outlined looked very similar to a business cost/benefit analysis and with this in mind, we asked Surjan to share about the financial benefits and risks that had been a part of his journey with Spira.
Implementation
On September 26th Mr. Singh came to present to 21 business and biology students about his journey with Spira, the pitfalls and creative problem solving that went into making the company successful. Students asked both biological and business questions at the end of the presentation. His presentation can be found at the bottom of this page.
Reflect & Record
At the end of the presentation we asked students to leave suggestions for the program, many students responded that they would have liked to hear even more about the science behind Spira and bioengineering. This was a wonderful surprise which demonstrates that there is a deeper interest in our work beyond just business applications.

Discussion
The preliminary results were inconclusive primarily due to issues with staining. The dye used was  not very soluble in water and produced a colloidal suspension. This resulted in some of the dye binding to  the surface of the leaf indiscriminately giving us false positives. A better dye that can more readily  penetrate the leaf and have better solubility may be required to obtain a clear result.
Further Study
The future goals are to continue testing with the Castor and PhaC constructs in Nicotiana, and  expand to testing in Physcomitrella. We are going to work on getting clearer microscopy results and GCMS results.
Another goal for the Butanol project is to assemble and test the Pollux construct for the  production of n-butanol. At this time we could also complete a protein extraction on samples using the  His-tags and categorize the 2A sequence utilized in the project. This could help us to ascertain the  efﬁciency of the 2A sequence in the respected test organisms.
Further categorization of the submitted constructs and their products is an ongoing task.

Parts
For this year’s iGEM competition, our team has chosen two new parts to finish our project.
The first one is Nanobody with aldehyde-based precursor label, can be converted to fixed-point                 aldehyde-modified Nano (BBa_K2772000). It is anti-beta2 microglobulin nanobody with aldehyde-based                 precursor label, and it can be converted to fixed-point aldehyde-modified Nanobody by                 formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE). It contains two sections: nanobody and ald tag, which is                 precursor                 of aldehyde label. Firstly it can cambein with beta2 microglobulin because of antigen-antibody                 interaction. Then its special label allow fixed point fixing or other fixed point decoration                 possible.
Another one is Formylglycine-generating enzyme(BBa_K2772018). FGE can specifically identify ald-Tag,                 which is consisted of 6 base pair or 13 base pair, then it oxidze sulfhydryl group of sulfhydryl group                 to aldehyde group. Conveniently, it can be used for in vivo catalysis of the substrate label of the                 precursor, i.e. higher conversion can be achieved without purification separation.

We used SPR (Surface plasmon resonance) to characterize Nanobodies.
First, we immobilized the antigen bound by our Nanobody on the SPR crystal. Then we configured different                 concentrations of Nanobody solutions (including blank solutions), and then, through a microflow system,                 a solution with nanobody is injected over the bait layer. As nanobody binds the antigen bound, an                 increase in SPR signal (expressed in response units, RU) is observed. After desired association time, a                 solution without nanobody (usually the buffer) is injected on the microfluidics that dissociates the                 bound complex between antigen bound and nanobody. Now as nanobody dissociates from the antigen bound, a                 decrease in SPR signal (expressed in resonance units, RU) is observed. From these association ('on                 rate', ka) and dissociation rates ('off rate', kd), the equilibrium dissociation constant ('binding                 constant', KD) can be calculated. The equilibrium dissociation constant"

σx(BBa_K1379004)
Introduction
To test the functionality of σX, we first enable constitutive expression of σX in the σX Generator, BBa_K1379006 .  The generator was then assembled with the standard promoter measurement kit BBa_E0240 , with either promoter PcelA ( Promoter only: BBa_K1379000 , w/ BBa_E0240 : BBa_K1379002 ) and PcomFA (Promoter only: BBa_K1379001 ,  w/ BBa_E0240 : BBa_K1379003 ). E. coli colonies holding the resulting  constructs in pSB3K3 were observed under fluorescent macroscope with UV filter. Measurement kit for standard reference promoter BBa_J23101 ,  which is BBa_I20260 was used as a positive control; BBa_E0240 was used as the general negative control for background fluorescence. Measurement kits for PcelA and PcomFA without σX Generator were used   as negative controls for function of σX.
Results
Figure 1. PcelA and PcomFA promoters activated in presence of σX.
Only in the presence of σX would PcelA and PcomFA be turned on, as GFP expression could        be seen when σX is present. Therefore, σX is functional.  PcelA and PcomFA gave little GFP signal in the        absence of σX but has comparable activity as reference promoter BBa_J23101 in presence of σX. Scale bar = 5mm.
PcelA (BBa_K1379000) and PcomFA (BBa_K1379001)
For characterization, PcelA promoter was assembled with the promoter measurement kit BBa_E0240 to give the PcelA Measurement Kit BBa_K137"

Design Level
You should choose what level you focus on. Generally, there are four levels: parts level, device level, system level and abstract level respectively. The former three levels should be designated before design for a certain database should be selected to link. They are aimed at real application by using practical materials. The last level is rather general and mathematical. It doesn’t link to certain database while providing topology information only.
Parts Level:
Since, the function of parts can only display when they are in device with other kinds of parts. Thus, this level is to serve the device level that details about parts could be retrieved while designing a device. Details about kinetic laws and kinetic parameters these parts play in biochemical reactions are needed.
Device Level:
Devices are composed by basic parts and fabricated in a special manner. The function may vary be inserting different parts of same kind like promoter to the same place in device. This way is actually means to change the kinetic parameters in order to change the response of the device. Both static and dynamic transfer functions are needed to describe each device in order to be inserted or replaced in the software for simulation and design purpose.
System Level:
Systems are usually composed by devices while details of parts are not emphasized. The system level is an extension of device level, but focusing on much complicated ones even the entire cell, organism and ecosystem.
Abstract (mathematical) Level:
Topology is crucial for a network even if the kinetic laws are not that clear. Here, we do not care what concrete parts we use but rather mathematical and graphic form. It is universally significant and instructive for design process.
Design Type (Sub Level)
After you choose what design level you focus, there are four types of sublevels to select. We define these sublevels because the users are unnecessary to run the every design step that we give prior for an entire design process but some certain functions. Given these information, users could quickly start their design without wasting additional running time. Though our software runs relevant functions according to your input, it will be helpful and clear for the users to know what sublevels fit their need to complete their design efficiently.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator"

Transformed 72, 92, 94, and 95 in pSB3K3 into arabinose strain.
Melanin Biobrick
Did the last stage of PCR for the Melanin Biobrick creation. Fragments AB and CF were added with primers A and F and the Finnzymes enzyme, then run on a CYBR-safe gel. The results showed smears rather than bands. As the CF fragment was a little dodgy on the first extraction it was decided to re-extract and try again.
The CF band was reproduced and extracted in the afternoon, creating more CF fragment stock.

Re-tried the PRC using the new CF fragment under the same PCR conditions. Still getting smeared bands.
Dry Work
Work on data analysis: make sure the scripts are working, and can read the standard plate layout. Then plot graphs: raw data over time, rate, normalised rate, max rate v concentration.
Wednesday
Wet Work
Melanin Biobrick
Looked up the possible reasons for smeared bands after PCR, three main ones discovered:
Too much template DNA
Incorrect salt concentration
Comtaminated PCR mix
Nanodropped the fragments and diluted AB 1/10 to get the recommended DNA concentration, and used new pipettes and Primer aliquots. Two tubes were made up using a new Finnzymes mix, and two using the old one.
The gel still showed smears! For all the samples.

Project Description: Soiled
Soiled i​s the project name for the School of Visual Arts’ participation in the Art and Design track of the 2015 iGEM competition. The project consists of a speculative mobile device and a multimedia installation denoting the respective results of soil samples collected throughout the New York metropolitan area.
The installation functions as both a data representation of our sampling sites and additionally relies on aesthetic principles of investigation. Composed of computer generated cut¬outs in the shapes of the five boroughs of New York City, the works are fabricated from compressed board, lucite sheets and LED lights. As a visual representation, the installation is consistent with the scientific processes of creating chemical color reactions. Color, which crosses the boundaries between art and science as a perceptual marker, is of extreme importance in both practices, pointing at once to the ways knowledge is produced.
In February 2016 a formal art exhibition will be held at the School of Visual Arts Gallery in Chelsea (NYC) to highlight the aesthetic and conceptual aspects of the work as a whole. Various parts of the jamboree installation along with reagents, consumables, prototypes, and graphics will be displayed with descriptions about the piece and statements from the student artists who took part in the competition.
You are what your food eats.
If you are what you eat, then you are what your food eats.
With the recent trend of urban gardening flourishing in metropolitan areas it may be time to evaluate what is in our plant’s soil. The five boroughs of New York City are no exception. From the backyard gardens to the rooftop farms, New Yorkers of all ages have taken up the quest for do-it-yourself edible and ornamental greenery. Many citizens assume their backyard is a “clean” place well suited for planting vegetables and flowers. This may not be the case. Soil health is important for the home gardener; however, most of the methods for determining said health use chemicals that are toxic. It is the intention of Soiled to develop an alternative non-toxic and reliable method for processing soil samples.

The strains were cultured at 37 °C in M9 medium with 5 µg/mL chloromycetin under different extracellular glutamate concentration (0 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 5.0 g/L) for 24 hours. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
GFP fluorescent intensity (FI) reports the PgltAB function
PgltAB-GFP and P43-GFP were converted into both B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam and B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam -icd strain (with stronger promoter before icd gene), which were designated as LL3-PgltAB-GFP and LL3-icd-PgltAB-GFP respectively. The two mutants were cultured in M9 culture medium for 24 hours. If needed the medium was supplemented with antibiotics or glutamate at the following concentrations: 5 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.5 g/L or 5.0 g/L glutamate. During the fermentation, 1.5mL bacteria culture was taken out every 3 hours, of which 600µL was for GFP FI measurement (395nm\509nm) by microplate reader, and 900µL for OD600 measurement.
With the extracellular glutamate concentration increasing, the FI of GFP was decreasing, which means higher glutamate concentration can indeed repress the promoter PgltAB's effect. The FI first rose and then fell, which may due to the extra glutamate adding that can promote cell growth. (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.)
Fig.2 Principle for detecting the PgltAB function. Under high glutamate concentration, GltC level goes down, reducing the level of GFP.

RIP secretion following S. aureus detection: BBa_K2616003
In order not to produce RIP continuously but only in presence of S. aureus, we engineered a sensor device in our modified E. coli capable of detecting S. aureus and producing RIP after detection.
Our modified E. coli expresses under a constitutive promoter BBa_J23107 the sensor device of S. aureusagr operon. This gene regulatory accessory is composed of agrA and agrC, and we took it from BBa_I746100 from iGEM Cambridge 2007 team. Staphylococcus communicate through a quorum sensing mechanism, which consists in producing and detecting signaling peptides called AIP (Auto-Inducing Peptide). If S. aureus approaches our system, AIP will be detected by the transmembrane protein agrC, launching the phosphorylation of agrA which then activates promotor P2 ( Bba_K1351037 , characterized by LMU-Munich 2014 team). Our RIP sequence fused to a signal sequence for periplasmic export is placed after promotor P2 and will consequently be expressed only if S. aureus approaches our biofilm.

KILL SWITCH : BBa_K2616002
Since we imagined a technology which requires to integrate engineered bacteria in humans, we need to ensure that the engineered bacteria are contained in the specific environment they are designed for. That is why we thought of using a “kill switch” that cause bacteria death if they are released in the environment. Our kill switch is based on temperature: it enables bacteria to survive at the human body temperature (37°C) but die at lower temperatures.
The kill-switch we use is based on a toxin/antitoxin combination, CcdB/CcdA[9]. CcdB is a lethal toxin for E. coli and its production is placed under the regulation of a temperature-sensitive promoter [9]. In permissive conditions, i.e. in the human body, the expression of the toxin is repressed and the antitoxin is expressed at a constitutively low level in order to counteract any leaky expression of the toxin. This is done thanks to the modification of the Plac promoter, which is explained precisely in the KILL-SWITCH part of this wiki. When the temperature drops, the repression is lifted and toxin expression increases. The constitutive low level of antit"

Construct 13 has been grown again in LB-KAN. Plasmid isolation was done. These plasmids had to be analytically restricted to make sure that the plasmid contained an insert. To speed up the progress, the analytical restriction (EcoRI-HF & PstI-HF) was done at the same time as the “real” restriction (EcoRI-HF & SpeI-HF).
Restriction of constructs 3-6 were done with EcoRI-HF & XbaI-HF. This should cut out a DNA fragment of around ~10 basepairs, which will be removed using column purification. Restriction of constructs 7-13 were done with EcoRI-HF & SpeI-HF. The restriction products were added to electrophoresis, proceeded for 30 minutes at 120V.

Restriction digests
For enzymatic digests, the following formula was used if bovine serum albumin (BSA) was not part of the buffer, which was the case for NEB buffer 3.0:
... µl DNA (~500 ng)
5 µl BSA
5 µl buffer (for example NEBuffer 2)
2 x 1.5 µl enzymes (for example EcoRI-HF & PstI)
... µl water
=> 50 µl in total
The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1h or up to 1:30h and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
In case BSA was already part of the buffer, the following recipe was used:
... µl DNA (~500 ng)
2 µl buffer (e.g. NEB CutSmart buffer)
1 µl restriction enzymes
water ad 20 µl
The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1h or up to 1:30h and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.

We kept a video notebook to track the progress of the project. At every major milestone, we made a video which records the date as well as a demonstration of the robot model. Prior to this successful version, we implemented two other robotic models, which failed.  We learned from the mistakes each time, and used the information learned to build a better robotic model. Here’s a brief comparison of the 3 models of BioBrick-A-Bot that was implemented, since Summer 2009.

Abstract
In order to fine tune the Wolf coli system, we prepared a new series of OmpC promoter. The new series of promoters are PompC(C) BBa_K395301 , PompC(CB) BBa_K395302 and PompC(CS1) BBa_K395303 . For measuring the strength of each promoter, we used GFP as a reporter. We have found that expression of GFP in OmpC(CB) and OmpC(CS1) promoters increased in high osmolarity medium. In contrast, under same conditions, there was no significant difference of GFP expression in OmpC"

Characterization
Two fungal promoters have been characterized by both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. The plan was to characterize the fungal promoters; DMKP-P6 also known as PAN1122, a medium strength constitutive promoter and PalcA an inducible promoter. A simple way of analyzing promoters is by measuring the expression of a reporter gene. This was done by performing the widely used β-galactosidase assay (1) with the modifications described here .
Genetics and USER cloning
Aspergillus nidulans can integrate DNA fragments into its genome by exploitation of the natural mechanisms for double-strand break (DSB) repair. In fungi, the most widely occurring mechanisms for DSB repair are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Integration by NHEJ will occur randomly, which means that DNA fragments will be integrated at a random site in the genome, and with alternating copy numbers. HR uses widespread homology search to repair breaks and does this without losing any of the sequence around the break (3, 4). For the characterization of the promoters it was important only to have one copy integrated in the genome. The host strain used for transformation nkuAΔ, was therefore a NHEJ deficient strain, and the integration should occur by HR (2).
p68 is a plasmid that contains a lacZ gene, a terminator, and a USER cassette. For HR to occur, the gene-targeting substrate has to contain two large sequences of around 1500 bp. Therefore, p68 also contains up- and down stream regions for targeting to the specific site called Insertion Site 1 (IS1) situated 202 bp downstream of AN6638 gene and 245 bp upstream of AN663"

Characterization of pRha
          One of the most significant design choices in our oscillator plasmid was the inducible L-rhamnose promoter (pRha). We based our choice by researching the characterization of a variety of different inducible promoters in the iGEM registry. The reason we chose this specific L-rhamnose inducible promoter, compared to a more standard IPTG inducible promoter was because the characterization for the L-rhamnose inducible promoter (Part:BBa_K914003), portrayed a more well characterized tight and graded response of pRha by the 2012 Paris-Bettencourt team. This leads us to believe that pRha is more suited to fine tune the concentrations of KaiA in order to investigate the KaiA : KaiC ratio in vivo.
 
Figure H: Characterization graph developed by the 2012 Paris-Bettencourt Team.
For more details: http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K914003
           
We conducted our own characterization of this Biobrick by tracking KaiA expression for a gradient of L-rhamnose percentages during a 10 hour induction (10 hour induction time was reported by the 2012 Paris-Bettencourt team). In order to track KaiA expression we used western blotting techniques as well as protein densitometry analysis in Image J. We believe our characterization is an improvement on the characterization accomplished by the 2012 Paris-Bettencourt team which used a plate-reader.
          Induction for the characterization curve was accomplished in M9 minimal media with supplements (0.4%glycerol, 0.1% casamino acids).
The results from our western blots indicate the tightness of pRha. At 0% L-rhamnose, there is significantly less KaiA expressed compared to KaiB and KaiC. This supports our ability to tune KaiA concentrations to optimize oscillations.

Exemple of sequences of base units.
From the modeling side, we calculated analytically the steady state of the integrase and terminator modules, and it  appears that the deterministic model gives a binary steady state corresponding to an XOR gate. This is what we expected, it confirms that deterministic model in our case is interesting for the study of dynamics of the whole system, and not for steady state calculations. So we are now moving to dynamic studies.

Week 4: Improving plasmid design, Modularization of the whole model
Wednesday, June 18th
We improved a little bit the plasmid design, determined which parts will be taken from the iGEM registry, and which parts we have to synthesize.
Second draft of plasmids. The repressors production genes have been moved to the sensor plasmid in order to distribute more evenly the number of kb.
Sensor plasmids will be approx. 9.3kb long, and logic plasmids will be approx. 5,2kb long.
From the modeling side, the whole model has been modularized and we have calculated and simulated steady state for the quorum sensing module.

Modularization of the system
Sunday, June 15th
The idea of our system is to associate a quorum sensing part, which should be able to react to a certain concentration of input, with a integrase-base logic part, which should be able to derive a computation given the transformed inputs.
From a modeling point of view, it seemed obvious that we had to consider these two entities separately. That is why we chose to have a modularized approach, where we regrouped, on one hand, the equations corresponding to quorum sensing and, on the other hand, the ones corresponding to the integrase logic phenomena.
As the integrase module is not that well known, we further decomposed it into two successive parts. The first one only models the path integrases go through in order to bind to DNA. The second one models the switch behavior of the integrases (after they are bound to DNA) and describe the XOR logic of our system.
As we see, these modules are successive. After the logic module, we added a production module, which is responsible for the production of our outputs (GFP and"

Figure 14. Example of the use of biomarkers as a means of prognosis on the health of a patient with melanoma. In this case, the patient receives our vaccine as a treatment, and we assume that the treatment worked. This would be marked by a decrease in the concentration of ctDNA characteristic of the neoantigens targeted by our vaccine, ideally until their complete eradication. The condition of the patient stabilizes for a certain amount of time but it still ends up in relapse, which is nonetheless promptly marked by an increase of chromosomal rearrangements ctDNA fragments in the blood.

We thought of transforming all the needed BioBrick parts one by one from the iGEM distribution kit in order to clone them later on and at the same time we ordered the other necessary parts from IDT. In silico part design was done in Snapgene software. Subsequently, we planned to do the cloning and parts characterization in parallel. We decided to perform osmolarity experiments with different concentrations of sucrose in the culture media. We also considered repeating our experiments at least three times to have some statistical data points and to show their reproducibility.
Readout – a second detector strain
Readout is a critical part of a biomarker detection assay. Used clinically this step determines whether or not the method can be trusted. A simple readout system needs an easy and cheap assay without the need of any extra expenses which at the same time provides high accuracy.
In conjunction with the signaling part of the project, the readout of the system was constructed in a separate strain of E.coli. This was chosen for several reasons: to make it easier to create the systems in parallel; to make it a more general system which could be used for other readout purposes; and to potentially achieve amplification through the use of quorum sensing.
Positive and negative fluorescent readout
In order to have a simple and cheap method, a fluorescence readout was chosen. We decided to express two different kinds of fluorescent proteins. One colour would be produced by the bacteria if the biomarker is bound to the receptor another one no biomarker is bound. This would make it possible to see that the system was working and provide an easy way to distinguish positive/negative readout for diagnosis.
Quorum sensing (QS) as a modular approach
Quorum sensing (QS) system use communication between bacteria through quorum signalling molecules (QSMs) (N-Acyl homoserine lactones or AHL used in our experiments). If expressed by one bacterial strain, the other bacterial strain can detect and respond accordingly. Biofilm formation is an example of where quorum sensing is used endogenously.
Figure 8: An overview of the ABBBA read-out system.
QS was chosen to be used as it would provide a modular approach where the main bacterial strain would signal to a secondary bacterial strain stimulating it to express a certain fluorescent protein. The fluorescence producing bacteria could potentially be used for various different purposes. Another speculation was whether the use of quorum sensing potentially could achieve amplification for the"

Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
iGEM challenged me! The competition provoked my curiosity. The whole process was a challenge for me - from the team building to the departure for the finals. I took the competition as a cause - Bulgarian and international. I wanted more young people  to participate and to have interest in science, to get out of the comfort zone and to create something by themselves. The thing that attracted me the most in iGEM is that there are no boundries in front of us. The competition gives us the opportunity to use our imagination and talents and all of our time in the name of the collective goal - the success.

Could be a problem when sequencing into our construct from downstream primer binding site as we use B0015 in synthetic construct. Because sequencing was done succesfully using this primer by others, we'll try it keeping the mispriming in mind. --> B0014 would be a better terminator for next time.

1.1 Overview
This year, team of XJTLU aims to simulate the process of global warming by introducing ribothermometers and chromoproteins to Escherichia coli. Global warming causes many consequences, including glacial ablation, the rise of sea level and the withering of plants. The appearance of the Earth will change as the average temperature rises: the white glaciers will melt; the green threes on the land turns into yellow and the coastal area will be flooded with sea water. To simulate this process, a genetic circuit made up with a ribothermometer that will switch at 37 degree Celsius and different color of chromoproteins was designed. Four different strains sand for four differen areas on earth are made: “Inland”, “Coastal”, “Marine” and “Polar”, as shown in figure 1.

Given that many people are anticipating an energy crisis, one must ask whether accelerated development of the oil sands is a responsible approach at this stage, especially when we consider one or two generations into the future, when the effects of the extravagant lifestyles of this generation become more pronounced. Please note that I have not said that the oil sands should not be developed – I am merely suggesting that we should approach their development cautiously until we have more efficient means of extracting oil – let’s say a 20:1 output-input energy ratio. For now, developing the technologies that are capable of extracting oil more efficiently is critical.
From an iGEM perspective, this could entail designing bacteria that release an enzyme that lowers the viscosity of the bitumen. This would allow us to operate with lower steam temperatures, and thus lower the input energy necessary to get anything out of the process.
Alternatively, we could design bacteria that can effectively crack longer carbon chains. This would help circumvent the energy expenditure required to bring the bitumen up to a high heat and pressure that are currently employed in the cracking process.
Mining versus SAGD. Different technologies are more appropriate for different environments: the former is useful when the oil sands are close to the surface; the latter is more suited to sands that are too deep to be mined safely. Mining is advantageous because up to 95% of the bitumen trapped in the sands can be extracted for use. SAGD looks better because although the extraction efficiency is much lower, the surrounding land doesn’t look as scorched. Nevertheless, a day of production at the Cold Lake site uses as much input energy as the entire city of Edmonton in that time! Moreover, SAGD only extracts 65% of the bitumen that is actually present. From what we were told, the rest remains trapped in the sand pores and could be later extracted with different technologies, but that would entail re-drilling the well, re-clearing the reclaimed land and re-setting up the equipment for the well – each of which require time, money and energy.
Bacteria that can survive the steam treatment and extract some of the remaining 35% of the bitumen that SAGD technology misses will enable us to gain more output energy for a similar amount of input and thus"

Hoping to know more about the prospect of our project, we paid a visit to Nanjing Military General Hospital, a grade III, class-A hospital famous for its service in Nanjing.  In order to further shape our project direction, we interviewed some doctors from the department of endocrinology in Nanjing General Hospital, and obtained their professional opinions on the current situation of obesity. As is known to all, the inventions of most anti-obesity drugs on the market focus mainly on the medicine efficacy and the technology breakthrough, however the acceptance of patients and the side effects are under less consideration. Suggestions from the doctors shed light on the further improvement of our project, which also reminded us of the safety issues that should be well concerned and dealt with when our synthetic biotechnologies encounters clinical medicines inevitably in the near future.

This is a problem because, in clinical centres, patients infected with B. cenocepacia may be excluded from lung transplant lists1 because it is so difficult to treat. It is also associated with 'cepacia syndrome' - acute pulmonary deterioration with bacteremia leading to sepsis, which often leads to death within weeks2. While PCR can be used to verify if B. cenocepacia is present, it is costly and can take several days. We wanted to use Synthetic Biology to build a detector that would minimize risk of misidentification and of pathogenic isolates in CF sputum samples. In optimal conditions, chronic biofilm infections can form within two weeks. An infection or amplification of bacteria may not result in a noticeable exacerbation until bacterial load increases to a level to form a biofilm infection. Once a biofilm develops, eradication with antibiotics is much more difficult as biofilms are inherently resistant to antibiotics3. Earlier detection of these infections could improve the success rate of eradication therapy, maintaining pulmonary function for longer, thus extending quality of life for the patient. We wanted to address this problem by allowing our device to quantify the bacterial load. This knowledge could then be used to inform treatment options and make antibiotic eradication therapy more effective.
Aims of The Lung Ranger
To use Synthetic Biology in a responsible way; to address unmet clinical needs as specified by patients.
To use Synthetic Biology to build a range of biological detectors that would sense and respond to the chemical signals PQS and PAI-1 produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, BDSF produced by Burkholderia species and DSF produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, at concentrations in which they are found in CF lung sputa. The biological detectors will be housed in Escherichia coli as our chassis.
To use fluorescent protein production as our output for proof-of-concept, ultimately replacing this with light emission for downstream applications.
To model the system pathways in order to analyze and optimize the systems used in the biological detectors.
To build an easy to use piece of equipment to house the biological device and quantify light output as a measure of bacterial load ( L.A.S.S.O. ). Ultimately allowing patients to monitor change in lung infections from the comfort of their own home.
To engage stakeholders ( health care professionals , CF patients and Medical Technology Developers ) to discuss our ideas and to ensure that our products meet the needs of end users.

Tokyo_Tech,2015,Team:Tokyo Tech#Experiment#Overview of fim inversion system_-_-_TEXT.html,"Abraham, 1985).  The fim switch has two states, ON and OFF.  The promoter in the fim switch directs transcription to the right when the fim switch is in [ON] state.  In [OFF] state of the fim switch, on the other hand, the promoter directs transcription to the left.
 
Fig.3-3-2-1.The relationship between the fim related genes.
The fim switch is inverted by two recombinases, FimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632010 ) and FimE(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632011 ). These proteins have distinct activities. FimB inverts the fim switch in [ON] state to [OFF] state direction and in [OFF] state to [ON] state direction with approximately equal probability.  On the other hand, FimE inverts the fim switch predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state direction (McClain, 1991).
We designed two fim switches: the fim switch(wild-type) and the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) which promoter can be exchanged with an arbitrary promoter.
In the first fim switch, the fim switch(wild-type), the sequence is derived from that of a wild-type. The fim switch(wild-type) we constructed are named fim switch[default ON](wild-type) ( BBa_K1632004 ) and fim switch[default OFF](wild-type) ( BBa_K1632005 ).  In the second fim switch, the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech), the promoter of the fim switch(wild-type) is replaced with J23119 promoter(BBa_J23119) and two restriction enzyme cut sites are added in each side of the promoter.  Due to this addition of the restriction enzyme cut sites, we were able to replace the J23119 promoter in the fim swtich(Tokyo_Tech).  For example, we replaced J23119 promoter with Lac promoter ( BBa_K1632006 ).  The fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) we constructed are named fim switch[default ON](Tokyo_Tech/J23119) ( BBa_K1632000 ), fim switch[default OFF](Tokyo_Tech/J23119) ( BBa_K1632000 ), and fim switch[default ON](Tokyo_Tech/B0010) ( BBa_K1632006 ).

Team Rheda_Bielefeld at the Marta Museum of Contemporary Arts
On September 16th of this year, Leon and Ben represented our team at the Marta Museum of Contemporary Arts in Herford, Germany. Topic of the exhibition, which took place on this date, was “Creatures made to measure”. Many visitors from all over Germany had been part of a tour over the weekend, and this tour ended in the museum. There were many interesting pieces of art to see. The pieces went from classic sculptures made of marble to very extraordinary short movies and paintings.
As the exhibition was about creating figures of living being, our team, in collaboration with the team of Bielefeld-CeBiTec, had a booth. At the booth, we showed the visitors how to extract DNA from peppers.
The Experiment required some home remedies: mortar and tappet, glasses, peppers, salt, water, dish soap, pineapple juice, a sieve and pure alcohol.
The protocol we used to perform the DNA extraction:
Firstly you crush 2 pieces of pepper together with a tea spoon of salt in a mortar, followed by mixing it with 100 ml of water. Then you leach this mixture with a sieve and pour it into a glass with two tea spoons of dish soap. After waiting 5 to 10 minutes, you pour pineapple juice to the filtrate and stir it. Now you have to tilt the glass a bit so that you hold it diagonally and then you pour the pure alcohol in it. After a couple of minutes you can hopefully see a white fade in the substance.
Since synthetic biology is about solving problems and creating solutions via genetic engineering with organisms and organic material, we wanted to show the people the opportunities and possibilities of genetic engineering. To make the people getting interested in our project, we linked them in into a small experiment. Extracting DNA out of pepper using pineapple juice, salt and straws is quite fun and also possible to repeat at home, so the visitors will remember that synthetic biology is not just a complex field of science only taking part in  laboratories, but can also be very simple and even funny. While telling the visitors about our project, we realized that some people"

We also hope to perform a complete economic and environmental analysis of our project to see how feasible it would be in real life and to assess the impact it could have.
Lastly, we need to ensure that our parts do not have common restriction sites within them so they can be used properly in the standard BioBrick format. We hope to create and characterize a part family and to end up with a series of BioBrick standard parts to submit to the Parts Registry.
What We Have Done So Far:
We have outlined a plan for the engineering of the PET degradation circuit and we ordered a synthesized sequence for cutinase. We asked for separate strains of E. coli from Yale and Barcelona.
We learned basic lab protocols, such as ligation, transformation, and digestion and we have worked on the Wiki.
We have done extensive research on past attempts to degrade PET and other plastics. We even visited our local landfill to talk about current issues with waste degradation, such as control over concentrations of methane.
Two of our members (Nick and Mattan) attended the Biomedical Engineering Entrepreneurship Academy to be better informed about the economic implications of our project, and what companies might be looking for in terms of a completed product.
Lastly, we’ve had team bonding, over sushi buffets, ice cream sandwiches and laughs.

The reaction chamber is also a mixing chamber, where the user must press repeatedly the chamber upper part for homogenization - critical for a good visual output.
Figure 6: Lateral cut of the chambers to show the inner content with the fluids, the air bubble and the residual volume on the reagent chambers.
Knowing the well described turbulence profile of serpentine patterns on microfluidic chips [14], a convoluted channel was designed to trap eventual droplets that may arise from the solution mixing on the reaction chamber.
Figure 7: Diagonal view of the serpentine channel between the cover layers.
This channel structure never was used for particle trapping in the gas with droplets scenario. Further computer simulations are needed to evaluate more preciselly the hypothesis of this concept design. A  syringe will be needed to fill the chambers with its respective solutions. This will be necessary to insert the blood serum sample aswell. Plastic seals will be used to cover the openings made by the needle; some of them could have numbers to indicate the order of pressing the buttons (as may be seen on Figure 1). A color scale will be provided with the device to compare the obtained output with previous standarized color results, indicating a qualitative prognostic for the user.
Figure 8: Overview of the device. (A) A color scale is provided to qualitatively evaluate the output. (B) The reagent fluids are previously loaded by the manufacturer and the user loads the sample on reaction chamber using a syringe and closing it with a seal (C).
Given the spores germination time of about 3 hours [19], we expect a similar amount of time to our device completely provide an output. The red scale color on the Figures 1 and 8 are merely illustrative of a future approach for the project. The biological system being developed uses a fluorescent output as a proof of concept for biodetection, but the main idea ie rely the detection on a naked eye visualization and qualitative estimation.
Fluid Dynamics
To calculate the flows through the microfluidic channels, it is assumed 4 hypothesis [15]:
The fluid ""body force"" is negligible;
The influence of convection is small and also negligible;
The flow is axiosimetric;
The flow is stationary.
For the last hypothesis be valid, it is indirectly assumed that the button pressing movement is approximately uniform, assuring a constant pressure difference between the chambers. All this assumptions are the same used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation of fluid mechanics to find"

At the same time, the concentration of binding metal proteins rise significantly from 0 to 20h. All in all, the last pic shows stable decline of heavy metal ions in the soil, that means the heavy metal ion could be extracted by our hyperaccumulator.

Then we obtained the monoclonal cultures and sequenced some of the yeasts. As a result, we sent them the two kinds of vectors they need.

Through voice conference with XMU-China , we got to know their problems appearing in the experimental stage about T7 amplified system. And we positive solution feedbacks based on our original T7 system design. Finally, our two teams established collaboration that we would help them test the formaldehyde promoter and T7 amplification system.
At the same time, XMU-China actively helped us to take the test of heavy metal content of chemical fertilizers with icp when our icp experiment in trouble.

We help UCAS to test that after adding casamino acid whether the system could give a valid feedback.

Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.

The measurement results are shown below.
1.5 mMGlutamate / 600 nm OD / 3h 100 mM IPTG
When the given data checked, it is obvious that the produced GadE is functional and makes E. coli survive in the acidic microenvironment in comparison to negative control results. Based on the data given, the E. coli with overexpressed GadE can survive in pH 2 gastric juice for 5-9 hours.
Acid Repellency
The main objective of this part of our project is to direct resistant E. Coli into the internal mucus layer where Helicobacter Pylori are abundant for a length of time. We will direct our E. Coli using the hydrogen ion difference between the stomach fluid and mucus layer. The PH of gastric juice is 2.0 whereas the pH of gastric mucus layer is 7.0. The chemoreceptor tlpb naturally found in the inner membrane of helicobacter pylori enable these bacteria to move away from acidic condition to a more neutral and basic environment. Therefore, we decided to use the TIpB protein and designed a biobrick for our E. Coli in order to ensure that our Bacteria reach the region where the helicobacter pylori are.
Background
Chemotaxis, movement toward or away from chemicals, is a universal attribute of motile cells and organisms.  E. coli cells swim toward amino acids (serine and aspartic acid), sugars (maltose, ribose, galactose, glucose), dipeptides, pyrimidines and electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, fumarate).
E. coli's optimal foraging strategy
In isotropic chemical environments, E. coli swims in a random walk pattern produced by alternating episodes of counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation (Fig. 3, left panel).  In an attractant or repellent gradient, the cells monitor chemoeffector concentration changes as they move about and use that information to modulate the probability of the next tumbling event (Fig. 3, right panel.  These locomotor responses extend runs that take the cells in favorable directions (toward attractants and away from repellents), resulting in net movement toward preferred environments.  Brownian motion and spontaneous tumbling episodes frequently knock the cells off course, so they must constantly assess their direction of travel with respect to the chemical gradient.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theoryold_-_-_TEXT.html," Exposure to blue light leads to the suppression in production of the yellow pigment.
The remaining pigments, magenta and cyan, will combine to form a blue colour.
The Future
Our project aims to provide a foundation for the control of organisms using multiple wavelengths of light for future development. Using lasers to control bacteria will provide high spatial control, while a well characterised system will provide good temporal control. Importantly, response is not limited to a molecular output. Possibilities include taxis, luminescence, electricity, magnetic fields and sound. As has been proven in past research, systems expressed in E.coli can be modified and expressed in a eukaryotic model. In consideration, such a system could enable finely controlled mixed volume outputs of medically relevant molecules, for example patient specific antibody treatment. From an economic angle, a calculatable light input will correlate to a desired complex output from a single customizable organism strain, vastly increasing production times from current processes. Attractively, laboratories will have reduced chemical usage and only require a single processing machine, as light is a cheap, easily manipulatable and mostly harm free resource.
So what do our constructs look like?
As we have the three different light modules to work with, we can experiment with different techniques and companies when it comes to our assembly techniques and synthesis.
The Red Light Module is the ""easiest"" to work with, as we only need to be working with the red light sensor and cyan pigment (the intermediate protein, OmpR, is already present in the genome of E. coli, so we don't need to include the genes which code for it). We will try and assemble this module ourselves in the lab, using a variety of assembly techniques.
The pink arrows indicate the direction of transcription. OmpF is the specific promoter which matches OmpR, the intermediate protein. The black brackets indicate the separate BioBricks (eg. BBa_S05058 is an RBS with the gene that codes for our cyan pigment).
The cyan pigment has been placed before the red light sensor so that if there is accidental read-through, we're not getting unwanted transcription of the cyan pigment.
The Blue Light Module is being synthesised for us by DNA2.0. It includes YFI (our blue light sensor), FixJ (the intermediate protein) and amilGFP (our yellow pigment).
The pink arrows indicate the direction of transcription. The central section, coding for FixJ, has been flipped backwards and upside-down. This ensure that, if we get accidental read-through from the RNA polymerase from YF1, the sequence for FixJ will"

Concretely, we can use variable y, which only takes the values 1 or 0, to indicate with or without the cancer, and a 4 or 3 dimensional vector x, each element of which takes a real value, to represent the concentration of 4 or 3 kinds of miRNAs in the saliva. Then y can be modeled as a function of x:y=g(x)
The parameters of the model is unknown, but it can be learned using some machine learning techniques. Considering the scale and nature of this problem, we can use Fisher linear discriminant, logistic regression or SVM to solve this classification problem. Concretely, we can separate the data into a training set and a test set. We will use the training set to obtain the parameters, and the test set to test whether these learned parameters can make good predictions on new examples.
Method and Results
We use the experimental data from Salivary MicroRNAs as Promising Biomarkers for Detection of Esophageal Cancer, Zijun Xie et. al. Altogether, there are 58 samples, 46 of which are patients and the rest of which are healthy control.
Plotting the ROC curve
The ROC curve can be used to test whether a single feature (in our case, the concentration of a particular kind of miRNA in a person’s saliva) is linearly separable. The bigger the area under the ROC curve, the higher the possibility of the single feature being linearly separable is.
We have the following results:
Using the original concentration of miRNA:
Using the log2 of the concentration of miRNA:
Using the log10 of the concentration of miRNA:
For the above 3 figures, the first 3 subfigures are the results of 3 kinds of miRNA in the sample’s whole"

Part 1  On Competition Experience
We have communicated a lot with CSU_CHINA. This is a video clip recording our exchange on participating in iGEM. During our first meetup, team leaders showed the situation and progress of projects. And the present members had a heated discussion. We hope more people can pay attention to and participate in iGEM, expanding influence of synthetic biology in society.

Part 2  On Fundamental Study
Knowing that there was a gap between scientific research and product development in China, with the proposal of team Tianjin team, six universities worked together to make research on how the laboratory results are converted to market products. We conducted market research on the products based on fundamental study and then investigated the evaluation mechanism. The final report of commercialization of research findings worked as a reference guide for foundational advance.
The body of the report is the analysis and research of this transformation process (with theory and case study) and our projects. The theoretical part was completed by iGEM Tianjin and our team. The case study was completed by OUC-China and Jilin_China. In our own project analysis section, ZJU-Chian and XJTU-China wrote a detailed application plan.
Finishing this part of the report, we discovered that the transformation of research findings was a comprehensive process related to many factors. Government, users, companies, and scientists should work together for the final goal. In view of our project, we should consider market demand if we wanted to convert our innovative protein degradation tools to a practical curing method.
As for the transformation of our project, PR PREDATOR, basically we have been following the mode of GCIUR. The laws and policies from the government work as the guidance and support. The potential users’ attitudes are mostly positive. There is a huge market demand in innovative tools of degrading proteins in practice so the industry part is willing to work. Plus, our research in the university has been going and will continue to be done.
Many of the diseases caused by abnormal proteins are fatal or can’t be easily cured. Even though there have been some effective cures for them, the disadvantages and limitations still exist. And at present, the application of medicines for degrading proteins is still a new field. It can be concluded that the transformation of our research has a huge market demand, so that the supply and demand market for collaborative innovation"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"
