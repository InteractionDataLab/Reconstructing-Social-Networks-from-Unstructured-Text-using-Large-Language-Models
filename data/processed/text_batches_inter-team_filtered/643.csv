Description
Determine whether the ions nitrite, nitrate and ammonium are toxic to E. coli, and at what concentration. This experiment will use the Biolector to grow an E. coli strain that constitutively expresses RFP in the presence of these ions (at a range of concentrations) to determine the OD and fluorescence of the cells as a proxy for growth.
Results
The graphs in the following sections show the response in biomass and fluorescence of GFP over time for varying concentrations of each ion.  The data has been baseline adjusted by using a script from Chris Workman (unpublished).  The horizontal facets show concentrations in mM.
Ammonium
Nitrate
Nitrite
Conclusions
Very high concentrations of ammonium ≥500 mM were able to inhibit growth of E. coli.  Nitrate at concentrations of 25mM and greater also inhibits growth of E. coli, whereas concentrations of nitrate at 5mM and greater show delayed expression of GFP and slower growth.  The tested concentrations of nitrite were not sufficient to inhibit growth.
Discussion
The average concentration of ammonium in wastewater treatment plants is 70 mg/L [1] which is much less than 500mM that we found to be toxic to E. coli.  If we assume the ammonia is stoichiometrically converted to nitrite via our mutants, the concentrations of nitrite that will be produced with this volume of ammonium will also not be toxic to the cell.  We do not expect that a significant amount of nitrate will be produced during this process, since E. coli contains the Nap pathway that converts nitrate to nitrite.   Therefore, we can expect that our transformants will survive in this environment.

To try to encourage reflection and debate around these questions, our team has applied speculative design into our integrated human practices. In contrast to science, which aims to describe how things are, the purpose of speculative design is to show how things could be. This can help us to discover how we think things should be and what actions to take to reach this future. Speculative design aims to provoke thought and discussion by postulating a future situation or society in which the subject matter is portrayed. This could be in the form of stories or simple descriptions of how life is in relation to the discussed subject. It could be how transportation is envisioned, how society is organised or, as in our case, how synthetic biology is applied and how it has affected the world.
Since the future consequences of new technologies may be difficult to imagine and even harder to predict accurately, the stories are intentionally fictional. The reason for this is to remove the restrictions one commonly places on imagination when trying to come up with “realistic” ideas. This problem does not arise when it comes to fiction since these restrictions are lifted when you know the story is not real. What may seem “unrealistic” today can often be commonplace tomorrow, fiction can help us embrace unconventional ideas. The purpose of speculative design is therefore to liberate our creativity and open our minds to what might seem impossible.
Consider the idea: If all industrial production of chemicals across the world is based on biosynthesis, what could the world look like in 50 or 100 years? Below, three short stories are presented, inspired by our own project idea.
Some areas that are worth considering when discussing the future of synthetic biology are: Safety, regulation(law), education and general ethical aspects.

1ml samples were placed 10 eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 20 000 for 30 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was transferred into clean eppendorf tubes and also centrifuged at 20000 rpm for 45 minutes. 7.25ml of the supernatant was removed to serve as the cell lysate in the E.coli cell free system.
Expression and purification of yellow and green fluorescent protein
An expression and purification of the yellow and green fluorescent proteins was carried out to determine what cell line it had; DH5 alpha or BL21DE3.
An overnight culture was set up in 2X falcon tubed with 5ml LB media and a pipette that was stabbed with YFP and GFP. 5µL of ampicillin was added and incubated overnight at 37°C at 220rpm. The protein expression was then completed by dividing the incubated YFP and GFP into 2X falcon tubes and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000rpm.  The supernatant was emptied and the pellet resuspended with 20 ml of SOC solution and 20µL of ampicillin added.  Spectrophotemetric analysis of the GFP and YFP at 1:100 dilution was done in the nanodrop 2000.
Absorbance at 600nm was taken before the dilution and the results were as follows: GFP=1.4 and YFP=0.8. the overnight cultures were then spun in the centrifuge to create a pellet for resuspension and again incubated at 37°C and 220rpm. The OD measurement was taken to be: YFP = 0.195 and GFP = 0.374.
The proteins were then induced by adding 147µL of IPTG into each conical flask containing the YFP and GFP. This was poured into 2 x 50 ml falcon tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at 2000rpm and subsequently stored at -80°C.
Electrophoresis of YFP
To measure the purity in preparation for the electrophoresis run of the YFP protein, the following reagents were prepared: 6 X DNA gel loading dye (5.6ml of 80% glycerol, 9.2ml MQ water, 0.18ml EDTA at 0.5M and 0.018g bromphen"
UCC_Ireland,2014,Team:UCC Ireland#Projects SeeDNA.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"illaries.  Our detector plasmids could be tailored to detect both the normal and SCA alleles, allowing for the determination of an individual’s genotype for SCA.
Accurate DNA quantification
Our system is similar in several ways to digital PCR, which is used to determine the amount of DNA that was in an initial sample (Hall Sedlak and Jerome, 2014).  In our system bacterial cells are the equivalent of the compartments into with a reaction is divided in digital PCR.  Since bacteria usually only take up one plasmid upon transformation SeeDNA could be used to measure how many copies of a target DNA sequence are in a sample.  Accurate DNA quantification is essential in several diagnostic tests.  One example is the detection of copy number variations (CNVs), where a variation in the number of times a particular gene sequence occurs, has to be detected. With further tuning of our detector, a colony / fluorescent cell count and DNA target input could be related to a certain degree of accuracy. Further testing will need to be carried out to evaluate how sensitive the detector is to varying concentrations of the target.
Potential Markets
Molecular diagnostics is a growing area of diagnostics and analysing genetic material has now become the norm for disease diagnosis and treatment. Genetic abnormalities, cancer diagnosis and detection of viral / bacterial infections all rely on these new methods of analysis as they are accurate, highly reliable and reveal more information than traditional tests.
Many molecular diagnostic methods exist, however these methods which are mostly PCR-based do have limitations as outlined below:
Limitations of current DNA Diagnostic methods
Requires highly sophisticated, expensive equipment (real time or digital  PCR machines)
Requires expertise to use
Large running costs (reagents, chemicals)
Complicated results analysis
Problems of contamination of samples with previous PCR products in the lab environment.
SeeDNA would solve these issues... and more!
Versatility - detector plasmid can be easily changed to detect DNA sequences from any virus/bacteria.
No expensive equipment
Use of cheap reagents/chemicals (bacterial media)
Straightforward, easy to use
Cheap/affordable
Rapid and efficient results
Requires little training to use
In principle, the presence and quantification of a target in a sample could be carried out, just like quantitative or digital PCR, but with SeeDNA, could be done with just competent cells and a handful of cheap, commonly used reagents. This avoids costly machines and expensive chemicals. In addition, no special training is required to carry out this test; a result could be obtained with just a few simple steps. This means that SeeDNA"

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," drug resistance. In terms of several literatures, mutation sites can be sorted into three groups. Firstly, L1460P mutation in FAT domain and E2419K mutation in kinase domain would render mTOR independent from upstream signals and keep active while intracellular amino acids starvation; secondly, mutations on V2198A, L2216H and L2260P could obtain higher kinase activity by binding with Lst8; Thirdly, mutations on S2215Y and R2505P exists in cancer cells would keep the downstream substrates in continuous phosphorylation and maintain strong constitutive activity. But not all of these sites are suitable for yeast TOR despite their similar structures. In accordance to comparison of mutation sites between TOR2 (1st row), TOR1 (2nd row), mTOR (3rd row), only the following four sites share the same original amino acids.
Besides, the hyperactive effect in cancer cells may bring about unexpected consequences in yeast in addition to FAP resistance. In the end, we picked out four point mutations of amino acids sites with sequence replacement and functions listed in the following form. As yeast TOR2 shares more similarity with mTOR and deeper involved in cell growth, we decided to use tor2 gene rather than tor1 as target of the whole project.
With the confirmation of four mutation sites, a new question came out. How could we manipulate on such a large fragment of 7800bp?
The large size of eukaryotes coding gene increase the difficulty of getting the original gene from yeast genome; condon optimization and chemical synthesis also seemed nearly impossible. While the design of mutation methods and primers became rather important and challenging, since we had to avoid massive common restriction sites to guarantee the insertion of tor gene into proper vectors. After rounds of discussions and brain-storming, two solutions are determined. We divided our experimenters into two groups and the two methods got started in parallel. 3.2.1  Circular PCR (emphasis) Our inspiration came from Fast Mutagenesis System Kit from Transgen Biotech. Different from traditional mutagenesis on linear fragment, this mutagenesis system is conducted in circular plasmid after our target gene has been inserted into the vector. Using high fidelity polymerase EasyPfu and FastPfu, we got the whole 7.8kb fragment of tor2 and inserted it into our modified plasmid backbone pSB1A11 for mutation. Its principle is quite simple but classical: Two primers anneal with template chains and synthesize mutagenesis chain with FastPfu Polymerase. The mutation base pair"

From 2009.igem.org
The Thermoinduction system
Gene expression of the lambda promoter is strongly inhibited at 28°C due to transcriptional repression by the cI857 repressor.
When the temperature is raised, typically to 42°C as shown in literature, the structure of the temperature-sensitive cI857 repressor is destabilised, so it loses its repressor function.  The lambda promoter is now able to express its downstream genes.
Thermoinduction has been used commonly in lysis plasmids. Expression of a cell lysis gene E is kept under the control of thermoinduction, and is consequently grown at 28°C.  Bacteria cell lysis is then induced by an upshift of the temperature to 42°C.
The thermoinduction system has been combined with restriction enzymes so as to allow for the safe production of restriction enzymes.  At 28°C, the restriction enzymes are expressed at a low level, so that when used together with a methylation system they would not be toxic to the cell.  When the temperature is raised, there will be overproduction of restriction enzymes and cell death.
After encapsulation (Module 2), when the cell has been encapsulated in colanic acid, it becomes more difficult for chemical inducers to infiltrate the outer protective layer.  In this case, heat is an ideal way to circumvent this problem and achieve effective industrial processing.  The cI857 thermoinduction system has recently been tested by Harvard 2008, but the results have not been convincing.  We have decided to reuse thermoinduction as it is particularly relevant to our project.

(2) Invasin & Listeriolysin O Constructs
An essential virulence attribute for Yersinia enterocolitica is its ability to invade the mammalian cell. Invasin, a protein encoded by inv, is an outer membrane protein found on the surface of Y. enterocolitica that is responsible for its binding property.
Listeriolysin O (LLO) (Fig.6) is a hemolysin produced by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen that is responsible for listeriosis. LLO is activated within phagosomes of cells that have phagocytosed L. monocytogenes cells, and lyses the membrane of phagosome. The bacterium is then able to escape into the cytosol without damaging the plasma membrane, and grow intracellularly. This would result in the protection from extracellular immune system.

ICT-Mumbai
Collaboration
Skype meetings were often a little too early for us and a little too late for them, but collaborations with ICT-Mumbai ended up being very successful! We helped the mathematical modelling team with their oscillating circuit, especially concerning the correctness and scope of the equations they had used in their system, since it was their first time working with MATLAB. From their code, we were able to find a small correction in their model, called a “basal transcription level” that is commonly referred to as leakage, that could help turn their code from a purely qualitative description of the biological system into a quantitative one that could further allow them to make predictions and test experimental data. This additional consideration comes from the fact that RNA transcription actually never reaches zero, which could have lead to potential discrepancies between the modeling and"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

Also, the Spo0F lacks an output domain and is incapable of activating transcription, therefore it serves only as an intermediary in the phosphorelay.[5]
Other than the external and internal signals that are integrated into the phosphorelay, it is important to note that sporulation is also initiated by nutrient starvation , cell density , and cell cycle progression .[5]
KinA
Sporulation can be triggered with high efficiency in cells in the exponential phase of growth in rich medium by artificial induction of the synthesis of any one of three histidine kinases tha feed phosphoryl groups into the relay.[3] For our project, we are using kinA, a major histidine kinase responsible for activating the sporulation pathway in Bacillus subtilis.[6]
The sensor kinase, kinA was chosen to induce sporulation as it is responsible for the majority of phosphate input into the phosphorelay, in response to as yet unknown signal ligands.[7] It has also been demonstrated that the fraction of cells that initiate sporulation is decreased in a kinA mutant background.[8]
KinA is a soluble cytoplasmic protein that appears to be active as a dimer and is composed of an amino-terminal sensor domain and a carboxy-terminal autokinase domain.[6][7]

It is just like the gambles among the people. In our project, we train the transgenic C.elegans and control the behavior of them by lights. Expression of two channelrhodopsins in the olfactory receptor neuron pair provides worms with the preference and aversion to specific wavelengths, and the corresponding lights are employed to reinforce their addictive or abstemious attitude to alcohol. Those reflects or behaviors are all operant behaviors and operant reflects which can be helpful for people’s more deep studies about the nerve and behaviors.
Optogenetics
Optogenetics is a method which involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, which have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin. Optogenetics provides millisecond-scale temporal precision which allows us to attain a quick shift between positive and negative reinforcement(a consequence that will strengthen an organism's future behavior ).Employing light as the input signal instead of chemical signals, optogenetics is leading a methods revolution across all fields of science and engineering(""Method of the year"",2010, Nature Methods)[10] Optogenetics can stimulate and monitor the activities of individual neurons within freely-moving animals and precisely measure their response in real-time. In our project, it makes it possible to train worms, observe their behaviors and quantify the neuronal signal. In traditional training experiments of worms, however, the simulation (input) is always along with an inevitable residue, from hours to days. Besides, it is also important to have fast readouts(output) that can keep pace with the optical control. This is realized by using our optical device( see hardware-link ) to receive the signal from the reporter proteins(mcherry) and indicator(GEM-GECO).
Why microfluidics?
Microfluidics is a powerful technology that can integrate a number of functions in a plate of very tiny scale, which is best matched with the size of C.elegans. Scientists have successfully achieved high-through imaging and screening of worm populations with this technology[11]. Inspired by that, we designed two microfluidic chips to study the development of learning behaviors of C.elegans by observing their phisical response at the group level and measuring the signal of individual neuron after optical stimulation. Despite the fact that worms are confined in chips and pushed by the fluid, the channels are specially designed to effectively simulate their normal movement."

Figure 1: The Indigoidine Synthetase IndC Catalyzes the Formation of the Blue Pigment Indigoidine a) The indigoidine synthetase indC from Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01 consists of an adenylation domain with an internal oxidation domain, a thiolation domain and a thioesterase domain. The A-domain adenylates L-glutamine, which is then attached to the T-domain via a thioester bond. The TE-domain catalyzes the cyclization of the glutamine and cleaves it from the T-domain. Each two  cyclic glutamines are oxidized by the Ox-domain, resulting in the blue pigment indigoidine. E. coli cells expressing the indigoidine synthetase appear blue when grown on agar plates. b) The indigoidine synthetase must be activated by an enzyme called 4'Phosphopantheteinyl-transferase (PPTase), which transfers the 4'-PPT residue from Coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue in the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase, thus transforming it from its inactive apo- to the active holo-form.
We expressed the indigoidine synthetase indC together with the PPTase in different substrains of E. coli to observe their growth behaviour and to get an impression, which substrain is most suitable for our experiments. We used the E. coli substrains MG1655 [4], TOP10 (Invitrogen), NEB Turbo (NEB), BAP1 [5] and Rosetta (Novagen). In order to optimize the yield of indigoidine produced by indC, we investigated the influence of the T-domain on the enzyme efficiency. Previous studies showed, that exchanging the T-domain of the blue pigment synthetase bpsA from S. lavendulae [6] yields an unfunctional indigoidine synthetase [7].We replaced the T-domain of the wild-type indC with T-domains from several other NRPS modules from different host organisms (S. lavendulae, E. coli, B. parabrevis, D. acidovorans, P. luminescens) observing the change in enzyme efficiency ( Fig. 2a"

Today we made plasmid DNA’s extraction from colonies that amplified the bio bricks inserts BB_Essential and BB_Bioremediation separately PSB1C3.
Electrophoretic Extraction’s profile:
1: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 2.
2: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 3.
3: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 2.
4: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 4.
5 – 6: Extração of “BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3” that didn’t amplify, just made out of curiosity
As we showed last day, the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation insert in PSB1C3 didn’t amplify on colonies’ PCR on transformed DH5a.
Due to that, we’re going to redo the PCR with all colonies we got from the DH5a transformation with the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 binding system.
In total we have 20 colonies. We used the primers VR and VF2.
Electrophoretic colony PCR’s profile:
All samples from 1- 19 are BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3.
We selected the just the samples 8 and 11 for plasmid DNA extraction and made inoculum in liquid LB medium with chloramphenicol 34ug/ml.

These delayed reactions mimic the complex cascades of processes (transcription, translation, maturation, etc.) leading to formation of functional proteins. The pre-factor [1 − (d/d0)4] describes slowing down of protein synthesis at high cell density d due to lower nutrient supply and high waste concentration.     In the equation (3), AHL synthetase is encoded by luxI and aiiA with LAA degradation tag is controlled by pluxR promoter and aiiA encodes the enzyme catalyzing AHL to degradation. We use the Michaelis-Menten kinetics to describe these two processes. Also, the internal AHL will diffuse into the extracellular space because of the difference of the concentration of AHL inside and outside with the diffusion coefficient D0.     The equation (4) describes the external AHL concentration outside the cells. The factor d/(1 − d) comes from the total mass conservation of AHL inside and outside the cells. The micro fluid in the main channel of the microfluidic chip will take the external AHL off, which we have built in the penetration model. The last term in equation for He describes the diffusion of external AHL. In our model, the trap is considered a unit, so it is meaningless for us to calculate this term and we set D1=0.

    By consulting relevant literatures and measuring in our experiment, we get most of the coefficients in the differential equation above and solve the equations in Matlab. The followed picture shows the result solved by Matlab.

The area \(A\) describes how much and how long Cre was active. As such it could be used as a measure for the likelihood of a recombinase event occurring in a single cell. We suspected a sigmoidal relationship between the integral and the probability of a recombinase event occurring in a single cell.
According to the Binomial distribution, if a tube contained \(N\) cells that had no reporter activity, the expected number of recombinase events after light exposure is \(N \cdot f(A)\). As we assumed constant PADH expression, each of these cells will have about the same luciferase concentration. Therefore we can predict the change in luciferase luminescence \(L\) do be proportional to \(N \cdot f(A)\). (The yeast is on a plate, and therefore has a constant distance to the measurement device)
If \(k\) is the proportionality coefficient in \(L = k \cdot N \cdot f(A)\) for an observed \(L\), then it is \(A = f^{-1} \left(\frac{L}{k\cdot N}\right)\). From \(A\), we were able to deduce \([\textrm{Dronpa}_\textrm{On}]\) at the time point of light exposure, which allows the computation of the galactose concentration as we assumed that a Hill function describes the Dronpa expression.

Operator site cloning in standard plasmids
Operator sites are Dna sequences very small in length (15 to 20 bp) and a restriction digestion for the religation in standard plasmids is not possible with the existing purification kits.  In fact, only Dna sequences down to at least 40 bp can be efficiently purified with the standard kits available.  Small bands extraction requires laborious condition optimization and hazardous reagents like phenol-chloroform So, we decided to set a new protocol up for the isolation and cloning of single operator sites into standard BioBricks plasmids.
We started from the analysis of an existing custom vector into the Registry . In this vector, a RFP gene was cloned, as a reporter, between the SpeI and PstI restriction sites. Thus, this is the only part in the Registry that can be separated from a plasmid with a S/P digestion.
Therefore, once the RFP is isolated with S/P, it could be assembled with an operator sequence digested SpeI- PstI, too. This could allow the isolation of the Operator- RFP sequence from the commercial plasmid and the subsequent religation into a standard plasmid. Then, a final extraction of the RFP gene with a SpeI- PstI digestion would leave the operator site inside the standard plasmid.

Experimental assesment of LacI operator functionality
According to the protocol to test operator parts ( procedure for K-index identification ),  two circuits were assembled (Figure 1): K079020 is the closed-loop configuration where GFP expression is auto-regulated by the synthesis of LacI repressor protein; K079026 is the open-loop configuration lacking the operator site to determinate the maximum fluorescence due to the constitutive promoter. In the latter construct, GFP was spaced from the promoter inserting the LacI gene sequence, to account for the abortive transcriptions.

One milliliter for each of the two samples was collected by O/N cultures and spinned  at 6000-8000 rpm for three minutes. The supernatant was harvested and the pellet resuspended.

Introduction
Bacteria have the ability to sense their surroundings and respond to them by turning on genetic regulatory systems. One of the environmental stimuli to which bacteria may respond is pH1. Bacteria respond to environmental stimuli for a variety of reasons for example to trigger pathogenesis or survival genes, which help the bacterium, survive, thrive and compete in a new environment1.
We found several promoters that were submitted from previous iGEM teams, this included Pasr ( BBa_K1231000 ) and PgadA ( BBa_K1231001 ) both submitted by the 2013 Northwestern iGEM team . These have been reported to be activated at low pH. So we started by characterising these two promoters and finding the best one suitable for our project. We cloned gfp ( BBa_E0840 ) downstream of both of these promoters in order to measure expression levels (Pasr-gfp ( BBa_K1962014 ) and PgadA-gfp ( BBa_K1962013 ). For our bile salt responsive promoter we used PacrRA ( BBa_K318514 ), submitted by the 2012 Wisconsin –Madison iGEM team, which consists of the acrRA operon found in Salmonella enterica strain. This operon contains the RamA binding sequence, the acrR gene and part of the acrA gene. We then cloned a gfp biobrick ( BBa_E0840 ) downstream of PacrRA ( BBa_K1962010 ). Due to E. coli not containing its own RamA transcription factor we codon optimised the ramA gene sequence for expression in E. coli and got it synthesised by IDT as a gBlock gene fragment. RamA was also submitted by the Wisconsin-Maddison 2012 iGEM team ( BBa_K318516 ) but was out of stock in the iGEM registry so we also submitted this as a biobrick ( BBa_K1962009 ).

My position in our team is that of an assistant actually, I try to learn the techniques from our seniors by assisting them and later on I get my hands dirty by trying out my new learned techniques. I want to learn as much as possible because I want to continue in the field of synthetic biology.                                  To the question, why iGEM, I have only one answer, why not?                                  My suggestion to new iGEM teams would be to work hard, buy lots of coffee and have tons of fun.                                 .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

Project Overview
In synthetic biology, while safety is often one of the largest concerns to the field as a whole, there is a lack of standardized designs that can easily be added to a construct without affecting its function. Our project seeks to remedy this situation by  creating a standardized safety switch which allows synthetic biologists to easily and effectively knock out a specific gene of interest when it is no longer required.
Our project could potentially have potential uses in both single and multicellular organisms, and for different applications - including but not limited to bioremediation, therapeutics and biosensors.
Our construct consists of three modules:
A Sensing module to receive and amplify a signal
A Time Control module to give the Sensing module time to amplify the signal before knocking out the gene of interest
A Recombination module to produce a recombinase which will separate the gene of interest from the origin of replication
Fig. 1 Domilox Design Overview
The first module in our construct is the Sensing module. The purpose of this module is to respond to the concentration of AHL in the cell and amplify the amount of AHL as a signal for further modules of the construct by using a positive feedback loop which amplifies an initial concentration of AHL and allows for quorum sensing because AHL can diffuse through the cell membrane into other cells.
The second module in our construct is the Time Control module. The purpose of this module is to produce a time delay in responding to the AHL signal inside the cell and to control the translation of two repressors downstream the sensing promoter in order to turn on the expression of Cre recombinase, which is necessary for the recombination reactions in the Recombination module. In transducing the signal through the Time Control module instead of directly passing it to the Recombination module, we seek to allow the Sensing module sufficient time to amplify the AHL signal with its positive feedback loop which would allow for more effective quorum sensing when the AHL diffuses into surrounding cells.
The final module in our construct"

Our project did not contain internal model generation, instead we received a model from the UCL iGEM team. The model simulated bed bugs moving randomly in a cubic room. One of our proposed blood traps was integrated into the simulation, which visually demonstrated bed bugs being attracted and then subsequently killed by the device.
This simulation was written in C#, in a similar manner to UCL's own model. The animation below shows the model operating. Red dots represent bedbugs; as they move to the bottom-left hand corner of the floor, they are killed and removed from the model.
Below this animation are a couple of graphs demonstrating the potential uses of the model. The first shows the approach of a single bedbug to the device; note the random fluctuation in addition to the directional motion. The second graph shows the effect of room size on time taken for all bedbugs to reach the device and die.
The main collaboration for the Westminster project was with the UCL undergraduate team. The partnership was very beneficial to us and the UCL team were very helpful in enhancing our project!!
The robust model allowed us to see how effective our device could be if it were to be developed as a real product, which is a very exciting prospect to consider that our project could be taken forward.

K.U.Leuven Team
The 2011 team consists of (bio-) engineers and (biomedical) scientists of the KUL, and – new this year – media developers from the MAD faculty of Genk. Each team member spends his/her summer holiday working on the project. The project was housed at the laboratory of Functional Biology of the Faculty of Science, which kindly provided space for experiments, access to computers and appropriate equipment.
Attributions
If you scroll over the team member pictures, you will see what they mainly did for the project. Most team members actually attributed to different parts in the project than the 'prescribed' role, but you'll only see the 'main role'.
Collaborations
• We sent a plasmid containing the InaZ-gene to the Edinburgh iGEM team.
• We took the initiative to organize a debate and invited the ULB iGEM team to present their project.

Rajiv Tanwani (Wet Lab Volunteer)
Rajiv is in his third year of Life Sciences. He was originally drawn to QGEM last summer because he wanted to explore the avenues of research in a student-led environment. Rajiv contributed to both the Dry-Lab as well as the Policy and Practices component last summer but is working as a Wet-Lab volunteer this summer. In his spare time, Rajiv enjoys hiking, tagging his friends and family in Facebook memes, and enjoys the occasional Netflix episode. In the future, Rajiv plans to continue pursuing research that combines his interests in both healthcare and synthetic biology.
contact us: director@qgemteam.com
Meet the QGEM 2017 Team
The Queen’s iGEM team consists of fifteen undergraduate students from a variety of different disciplines. Common among all our team members is a passion for synthetic biology and an eagerness to learn more about it while contributing to advance the work done in this field. Having the advantage of being from diverse backgrounds, each of the members has uniquely contributed to our 2017 research project.
Yifei Wang (Director)
Yifei is in his fourth year of Life Sciences. Yifei is the new QGEM Dictator after overthrowing Dragos in a peaceful coup and enjoys bossing the QGEM team around from his SynBio throne. His favourite class at Queen’s was molecular biology, and he hopes to pursue a career that combines SynBio and medicine. Yifei has a burning passion for Metro prepared meals, but hopes to have enough money one day after becoming the CEO of his own biotech startup that he can hire Chef Dee #anotherone. His favourite sports team is the Toronto Raptors, and he hopes that his amateur career as a Roots model will one day allow him to replace Drake as their new courtside celebrity.
Nolan Neville (Wet Lab Co-Lead)
Nolan is in his fourth year of Biochemistry. He is particularly interested in bacteria and the rise of antibiotic resistance, so this year’s biofilm project was right up his alley. When he isn’t running around in the lab or admiring crystal structures, he can be found listening to old Dire Straits records and learning classic rock riffs on his Les Paul. In the future, Nolan hopes to pursue a career in research working to create novel antibiotics.

UChicago,2018,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," banding below 500 bp. Likely a combination of mispriming and  Remaining primer as it is extremely faint.         -Overall impression: Desired product can be synthesized at a range of temperatures using standard protocols. Issues with cloning likely have been technique related or a problem with the dNTP stock as it was homemade. Using the new dNTP from NEB yielded correct results. -Gel Purification of all 12 fragments     -Purification of ArgArs         -Followed Promega protocol for Wizard PCR cleanup. Yields were less than 10 ng/µL and 260/230 was 0.03 avg. Discarded samples. Likely due to improper incubation with membrane binding solution (See reasoning below)     -Purification of Gradient products         -Done with RF and VP         -Followed directions according to promega protocol. Measured concentrations were 30-56 ng/µL with 260/230 of 0.46. Still not great, but might be able to improve on future runs. Suspect incubation with the membrane binding solution is too low and DNA does not have sufficient time to bind to column. Could also be a problem with adding the membrane binding solution as this was a problem in my lab with the Zymo Kit. May be able to be used for Gibson but will need to overshoot 7/13/18 -Removed overnight plates of streak purified RFP-pSB1C3 stock + pSB1C3mut stocks 2, 3, 4, and 7     -Only plates pSB1C3-2 and pSB1C3 4 had colonies         -Other plates had no observable growth -Mini-prepped overnight liquid bacterial cultures of pSB1C3mut-3     -Followed manufacturer's instructions for the PureYield Plasmid Miniprep Promega Kit     -Got less than ideal results when nano-dropped -Ran an ethanol precipitation protocol for the mini-prepped pSB1C3mut-3 DNA     -Didn’t work, no pellets seen in the eppendorf tubes -Made overnight cultures of pSBC13mut 2, 3, and 4 -Full digest of D and E     -32.2µL of nuclease free water     -5µL of buffer J     -12.3 µL of D and E     -0.5µ"

Overview
Successful directed-evolution of mechanosensitive (MS) channel relys on the precise measurement of the mechanical sensitivity of MS channels. When they are stimulated by mechanical force, a Ca2+ influx is triggered, which in turn induces downstream NFAT promoter.
To quantitatively test the mechanical properties of MS channels, a standard method to generate force field was developed and evaluated. Microfluidics was designed to study the MS channel response to fluidic shear force. In sonic stimulation part, we developed both ultrasonic and audible sonic simulation hardware.

Microfluidics
Microfluidics is an experimental methodology integrating multiple disciplines such as biology, bioengineering, physics, chemistry, nanotechnology, and material sciences. It includes design and fabrication of small devices in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve automation, and high-throughput screening. [1] Microfluidic chips allows fluids to pass through different channels of different diameter, usually ranging from 5 to 500 μm. [2] Owning to its characteristic small dimensions, it saves valuable reagents and requires small amount of samples. In the past decades, the basic techniques of microfluidics for the study of cells such as cell culture, cell separation, and cell lysis, have been well developed. Based on cell handling techniques, microfluidics has been widely applied in the research of cell biology. [3]

As previously shown in the ‘biosensor’ part, the PmerT promoter is a divergent promoter, and it regulates both the upstream merR’s expression level and the downstream Mer operon’s expression. In detail, the mer operon contains several genetically related gene, including merT, merP, merC, merB,merA, etc. also, there are new discovered gene related in mer operon such as merF and merG. Among them, merT, merP and merC have been revealed to play central part in the resistance to Hg (II).

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"anococcus janaschii wild type tyrosyl tRNA consists of two arms: Firstly, the acceptor-minihelix, where the ncAA will be attached to the 3' end and secondly, the anticodon containg arm. Synthetases interact mainly with the acceptor minihelix of the tRNA. Due to the lack of a recognizing element within the anticodon-containing section, a mutation of an anticodon base has a comparatively small effect on the aminoacylation efficiency and may explain why a variety of ncAA can be incorporated with this tRNA. Example measurement proving incorporation of amino acids:
Figure 2:  normalized fluorescence spectrum of mRFP1
Figure 3:  normalized fluorescence spectrum of sfGFP as a sign for successful amino acid incorporation via tRNA/synthetase pair for tyrosine via amber supression
The wild type Methanococcus janaschii tRNA/synthetase pair for incorporation of tyrosine at an amber termination codon (the pair containing the tRNA mentioned above) is co-transformed with pFRY , a flourescent reporter plasmid for measurement of incorporation of ncAA into BL21 DE3 gold, which is induced by 100 µM ITPG. pFRY is one part of the two plasmid reporter system for measurement of incorporation efficiency of ncAA via amber supression. It consists of two fluorescent domains connected through a linker sequence containing an amber stop. When induced with IPTG, a the fluorescence can be measured. A red fluorescence is always visible upon induction, and if an amino acid is incorporated in response to the recoded amber stop codon, a green fluorescence intensity is also measurable. Fidelty and efficiency of the incorporation can be determined by comparison of fluorescent levels. This experiment is performed in order to obtain fluorescence spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP. As shown above (fig. 3) GFP formation is measured as a result of successful amino acid incorporation via amber supression. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1 (fig. 2), and sfGFP (fig. 3) were obtained through measurements with a modified Biolector set-up. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

Application Design
Ultrasonic imaging: the key to successful cancer imaging using our engineered bacteria is the sufficiency of maximal attachment to the tumor and minimal attachment to normal mucus of our bacteria. Therefore, we incorporate the delivery of our bacteria into the conventional bowel preparation protocols for colonoscopy and ultrasonic imaging of the colon, which our HP team learned from interview with experts.
The bowel preparation procedure is roughly summarized as follows:
laxative –clear liquid –enema
Among which clear liquid, typically 500-1000ml, orally introduced 4 hours before ultrasonography, is most suitable for carrying our engineered bacteria in terms of sufficient quantity, time for adhesion, and upcoming enema which could wash away non-specifically attached bacteria.
Bacteria should be induced with 1uM lactose for at least 22h before mixed into 500-1000ml clear liquid, with final concentration around 107cell/ml. After ultrasonography, the bacteria could be removed by orally administered arabinose.
The imaging procedure can be adapted from our protocols. In general, ultrasound plays two roles: imaging and collapsing. As Bourdeau et. al. [6] Reference 6[6]Bourdeau, R. W., Leegosselin, A., Lakshmanan, A., Farhadi, A., Kumar, S. R., & Nety, S. P., et al. (2018). Acoustic reporter genes for noninvasive imaging of microorganisms in mammalian hosts. Nature,553(7686), 86. reported, the gas vesicles produced by the engineered microbe can be collapsed with acoustic pressure that exceeds certain intensity, therefore enabling distinguishing target signal with background. The strategy is collecting imaging graphs right before and after introducing high-power ultrasound to collapse target gas vesicles in areas of interest, and the subtraction between two images would indicate the target signal.

We applied and got to the finals, which meant free pitching training for the team by Helsinki Think Company and a chance to win 1000 euros and get our picture to the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York City’s Time Square! Unfortunately we weren’t the lucky winners this time, but the event was great practise for Boston and we met a lot of like-minded people from our own field.
HEUREKA
We attended the World Biotech Tour festival in collaboration with Finnish Science Centre Heureka. For two days in September we had educational activities in Heureka for school students and families. Our aim was to explain and teach about lab work and synthetic biology in an easy and funny way to get new generation of possible coming researchers and scientist interested about biology and chemistry. These events - Meet a Scientist Day and Family Festival Day where mentioned in the event calendars of both the Finnish Bioindustries and the European Biotech week.
For explaining synthetic biology we created experimental Plasmid Puzzle which was targeted more for smaller children to challenge their imagination and possible give them a tiny hint what synthetic biology and DNA modification could mean.
Puzzle was made out of colorful foam blocks that we made by ourselves.
Every block presented some feature, like hot, cold, tasty, fluffy, sparkling, glowing in the dark, radio-active (or resistant for that), fledged and so on. Together five blocks created a shape of plasmid. We wanted to make attractive and really visual game for children to get their attention and we definitely succeeded with that. Kids from 1-12 were interested to play with the blocks and meanwhile we were able to explain principles of synthetic biology to them and to parents.  We got really nice feedback about the activity from the Heureka staff. They said that this kind of activity is exactly what they are looking for and what they need in Heureka and they were willing to borrow the idea for future projects as well.  In the end we also got possibility to be part of something very nice and valuable. After Biotech weekend our plasmid blocks were donated for a voluntary workshop meant for tortured refugee families coming from really hard conditions and especially for the children of the families.

Characterisation of the pigments - consider LCMS
Plate all colours as streaks on the same plate, for presentation purposes
Check the Melanin rbs is compatible with B. subtilis
We could probably have a  think about why our pigments don't grow in liquid culture.
Carotenoids
Check the gene homology for the different genes
Contact Edinburgh to ask about the promoter
Double-check the orange colour is actually being formed by the genes we think they are
The Roche strain can only be used for testing, not for the actual iGEM product
DNA purification
Overall, we are still not sure why the column washes are not working
Suggested that we try purification with 0.5M Ammonium acetate
Melanin retention
More controls needed to check whether the melanin diffusion out of the cell is the cause of the staining.
Modelling
Presented the continuous modelled behaviour of the latch: to a large extent independent of input transcription. This means it is likely to turn on under basal input.
Stochastic modelling may agree or disagree with this finding.
Overall Plan
We need a lab meeting to set out the following:
What we want
What is feasible
What is justifiable within the overall project plan
Work towards the end-result, and the talk/presentation at MIT
Results with theoretical underpinning
What we have managed and what our model days we could achieve
Finished PRODUCT
Ideas for finished product - dipstick, 'lollypop' etc.
Modelling
Basic promoter-activator-phage promoter system modelled. A variety of parameters changed and the effects collated.
Addition of positive feedback for first 'latch' design - Note that the same output is gained for any input, so it would destroy any natural switching level on-off property of the activators.
Began to develop 'threshold' switching level system as detailed at bottom of modelling page. Considered different mechanisms by which it could work:
activator and repressor bind to different sites on operator, both can be bound at once, but transcription only occurs when the activator alone is bound.
activator and repressor compete for binding to DNA; they do not necessarily bind the same site, but if one is present the other cannot bind.
the activator prevents production of the repressor by inhibiting transcription, but it is only capable of doing this once it has reached a particular concentration. This is effectively just the activator system with a second step, as the switching level depends on the properties of the"

Fast Fourier transform of the recorded signal showed that the largest component was from the 60 Hz range. Extensive testing showed that the noise was related to the protoboard itself as the signal persisted long after the components were removed. There was no other option but to continue the development by creating a circuit board.
Version 1.0
Our first circuit board was designed and drawn in a scalable vector graphics program. The traces, pads, drill holes, and board outline were exported as SVG files. After several file type exchanges, the files became a single DXF which was loaded into software for precision CNC milling. The board was milled using the LPKF Circuit Pro milling machine in the TEAM prototyping lab on campus. The board was populated and tested using the traditional potentiostat test: reference and counter shorted, resistor connecting working electrode and ref/counter.

Circuit Abstract
The signal was was full of 60Hz noise. Our immediate thought was to digitally filter the signal, but ultimately we had an analog problem. We suspected the lack of a ground plane in our hand drawn circuit was the likely culprit in what seemed to be a ground loop. We switched our approach from hand drawing our circuits to using Eagle.
Version 1.1
> <
Circuit Abstract
Over a very long weekend, we learned how to build schematic and board files in Eagle. A ground plane was built into the circuit to resolve issues related to ground loops. The board design was sent to Seeed Studios, Inc for cheap PCB manufacturing. There services cost only about $4 per board, and allowed us to significantly reduce the cost of the circuit. When testing the circuit, the results were far noisier than the original protoboard. The wiring on the board was a mess though. New rule: wire the components by hand. The auto-routing feature in Eagle was not made with instrumentation in mind. All the components at this point were getting power straight from the USB. We considered finding an op-amp with a higher power supply reject ratio (PSSR), but the problem was the power source, not the op-amp. We wrote software to provide digital filtering of the signal so our electrochemistry team could continue their work. Then the circuit was redesigned to address the power supply issues.
Version 1.2
Our next iteration fixed some of the power supply issues. We switch from our ICs receiving powering by USB,"

Part II focuses on the everyday usage of the wiki create in part I and gibes some general advice how to use the iGEM MediaWiki. All team member that want to contribute to their wiki should read this part.
So the goal of your social project is to give every teams an easier access to the iGEM wiki: Because a wiki should simplify your life and not make you struggle!
Part I: Setup your Wiki
Before creating your own wiki, you should be aware of some aspects that you have to deal with when you create your team wiki. The intention of a wiki is to provide an easy-to-use platform where team member can enter information without having to know any HTML, CSS, etc. Secondly, most teams want to add their own style and design to their wiki. The normal way to customize MediaWiki is by using skins and extensions. As all iGEM teams share you common wiki, this is not possible. Changes done by one team would screw up the wiki of some another team. Summing up, the following text has to goals: Create a wiki that every team member can easily edit. Demonstrate how to customize the look of your wiki.
Create an easy-to-use Wiki
Although team wikis tend to vary, most of them contain two areas. A navigation area is always found as well as a content section. These two sections are the most relevant parts of your wiki since every team member should be capable of adding information or arranging your wiki pages. In this tutorial we will use a straight forward, table-based layout that will be put into practice using an invisible HTML table (see figure). Please note that HTML code within a wiki page has to be marked as such, by surrounding it with an opening ""<html>"" and a closing ""</html>"". For a very short introduction on HTML open the up the following ""Read more"" section.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language that tells a browser (e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer, …) what a webpage is supposed to looks like. In fact, a HTML file comprises plain text and holds instructions, so-called tags, for the browser. Every tag is marked with brackets and has a name that specifies the tag type. The beginning of a tag always contains an opening an a closing bracket (<...>) and the ending of a tag additionally has a forward slash / (</...>). For example,

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Glycogen#Synthesis_-_-_TEXT.html," For all expression plasmids, we used the vector library “pSB1X30” from team Heidelberg [2] . These backbones have a lacI repressible T7 promoter inserted directly upstream to the BioBrick prefix. Therefore we used E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) for our expression test, which contains the T7 RNA polymerase.
To express GlgA in pSB1K30 we subcloned its coding sequence from pSB1C3 and transformed into Bl21 Gold (DE3). The expression plasmid for GlgB, the branching enzyme, was also built via 3A assembly, following the same procedure as for GlgA. The coding sequence for the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, GlgC, was subcloned into pSB1A30. This was done via CPEC assembly. Here, pSB1A30 was used because after expression and analysis via SDS-PAGE for GlgA and GlgB, no difference between induced and not induced was seen.
The three expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3). All proteins were detected on SDS gels when compared to a RFP control, thus, the expression of all glycogen synthesis genes was confirmed.

2. Characterisation of the alginate line thickness
In order to be a real 3D printer following the principle of stereolithography, many layers need to be deposited on top of each other to generate the aspired structure. But can we print several layers on top of each other without great losses in precision, thus: how thick will the lines be? To answer this question, we printed lines of one, two and three layers in triplicate using our Biolinker and measured their thickness using a microscope (10x).
Adding a second layer of alginate on top of the first layer lead to an average increase of line thickness of 7%. The addition of two layers increased the line thickness by 21% compared to a single layer.
With this, we have proven that we can print several layers of alginate on top of each other without significant losses in resolution during this process. The next question thus is: how do the layers look on the inside? Do they mix or do they form clean interfaces in between them? To answer these questions, we conducted the following experiment: two types of bioink were prepared containing each either GFP or RFP expressing bacterial cells. These two types of bioink were used to manually create two alternate layers of radial biofilms on a plasma cleaned coverslip: the bottom layer contained RFP expressing cells with a layer of cells expressing GFP on top of it. In order to analyse our layered biofilm, we used a spinning disk microscope. Imaging was done by starting at the lower end of the first layer and increasing in steps of 2 micrometer over a distance of 146 micrometers. Each layer was imaged both at 488 nm and 561 nm and the final image was obtained as an overlay of both images. This data set was used to create a 3D projection, showing that the bottom layer is approximately 29 micrometer in height and contains only cells producing RFP. The layer on top is approximately 34 micrometers in height and contains only cells producing GFP. Mixing between the layers is almost negligible, proving that the hydrogel assists in layer formation and the system is useful in printing the biofilm.
The extensive protocol can be found here.
With this image we were able to show that we can deposit two layers in a controlled way on top of each other. The area with low cell density and mixed GFP/RFP is limited to a thickness"

Project Overview
In 2010 it was estimated that 6.5 million people in the United States alone suffered from chronic wounds, accruing an annual cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Furthermore, experts predict that the burden of chronic wounds will increase rapidly in the near future due to increasing medical costs, an aging population, and the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Chronic wounds are characterized by their inability to progress through an orderly set of stages within a time period of about three months. Wound healing progresses through four successive stages known as hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodeling.
  
  
  
The etiology of chronic wounds is very diverse, but patients frequently suffer from persisting chronic wounds arrested in the inflammation phase due to overproduction of wound site proteases. In turn, proteases inhibit the proliferation phase by degrading growth factors meant to induce tissue growth. They also inhibit tissue remodeling by degrading the collagen scaffold, which new cells migrate into. Thus, proteases decrease wound healing rates by degrading host growth factors and the extracellular matrix of the wound site. Our team is using a bioreactor and synthetic biology principles to purify and infuse a synthetic collagen scaffold with platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and Aprotinin to induce the healing process of chronic wounds. Synthetic collagen scaffolds are currently being used as a replacement for skin grafts in the treatment of burn victims. They have been shown to increase wound healing by attracting tissue cells, such as keratinocytes and aiding in angiogenesis and re-epithelialization. In our collagen scaffold, the aprotinin serves to prevent degradation from wound site proteases. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that aprotinin can increase angiogenesis, ultimately improving synthetic scaffold integration efficiency.  PDGF has been well studied in the past and is the first growth factor to be approved by the FDA for human treatment. Currently ointments infused with PDGF, such as REGRANEX are being used to treat chronic wounds. We envision that our technology will help to introduce a novel synthetic-biology-based process for the development of therapeutic wound dressings. Learn more.

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua-D#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,", thereby interfering with ribosome binding.  High temperature (42℃)  disrupts the bend and initiates the process of translation (3).
Figure 2.  a. Formation of stem III in  the rpoH transcript at low  temperatures (30 °C) induces a bend in the ribosome-binding site (RBS)-associated  downstream box (DB) region, thereby interfering with ribosome binding.  b. A  rise in temperature to 42 °C opens stem III and stem I of the rpoH mRNA, liberates the AUG start codon  and DB region, facilitates ribosome binding.
Inspired by such a mechanism, our  group designed a series of RNATs whose SD sequence will have trap-release  structural change according to the environmental temperature.  The following is the schematic diagram of the  RNATs we designed (Figure 3):
Figure 3.  Schematic diagram of the RNATs we designed.  The red box indicates the SD sequence.
 
The design of RNATs based on physical principles
To give RNAT sequences that meet  the given parameters, the central problem is to predict RNATs’ secondary  structure at a given temperature.  Two  methods are adapted according to the computer algorithm’s requirement. 
One principle adapted in  predicting RNA secondary structure is free energy minimization (4).  A secondary structure with the least free  energy is regarded to be the optimal solution (5).
Another principle adapted here is the  partition function method (6).   Rather than give one definite structure as the free energy minimization method,  the partition function gives the probability of each secondary structure’s appearance.  In the following equation, Q stands for the partition  function and P (structure) stands for the probability of one specific structure’s  appearance.
The design of RNATs adapting computer algorithms
The software RNAThermo for designing an RNA  thermometer is presented.  RNAThermo is  based on the Vienna RNA Package, which is a program for RNA Secondary Structure  Prediction and Comparison (7).
Before introducing RNAThermo, this is the  basic RNAT design problem: given regulation temperature, the structure of the  RNAT (both unmelted structure S1 and melted structure S2) and the SD sequence  position of the RNAT, find an RNAT whose SD sequence will be released from the  hairpin structure above the desired temperature.
A three-stage algorithm is designed to solve the  problem (workflow is present in Figure 4):  A set of sequences that fold"

BBa_K1951008  : FliC E. coli producer
We also improved an existing BioBrick, Glasgow 2014 team's BioBrick ( BBa K1463604 ), making our brick ( BBa K1951008 ). This BioBrick is an improvement of the orignial BioBrick in three ways:
The codon usage has been optimized to ensure a strong expression in E.coli,
The RBS has no mutation so the flagellin is well expressed,
Our swimming test show that the swimming phenotype of the BioBick is improved thanks to our changes.
All the functional tests and experiments, show this part is functional, are listed here .
Part Composition:
This part is a composite part composed of 2 Biobricks :
BBa_K1951005  : Flagellin C
BBa_K880005  : Strong promoter, strong RBS combination
Flagellin C from Escherichia coli
Flagellin C (FliC) protein from Escherichia coli strain is the main protein constitutive of the flagelar filament and is involved to promote bacterial swimming. This sequence is conserved in many bacterial strains. It has been demonstrated that flagellin has the ability to adsorb precious metal such as platinum or gold. We made a FliC mutant by transduction using phage P1 in a E. Coli W3110 strain. Then we have complemented the fliC mutant W3110 with BBa_K1951008 and performed a swimming test for every background. The result has shown that swimming was recovered into the complemented fliC mutant W3110
Flagellin C swimming test
We constructed a fliC deletion mutant that is unable to swim, from the wild-type strain W3110. The ability to swim was restored to this mutant by our biobrick, as can be seen in the illustration here. This demonstrated that the protein can be correctly inserted into flagella and functions.
Part Assembly:
The subparts were assembled using standard BioBrick Assembly.

Amoy Newsletter
This year, we have taken part in the biweekly newsletter hosted by iGEM Amoy , iGEM Paris Bettencourt and iGEM Pasteur . The newsletter presents projects of participating iGEM teams and focuses on topics interesting for Synthetic Biology. So far, special themes of the newsletter have been the controversial use of CRISPR to modify human embryos, software programs and the state of SynBio in many different countries. Check them out below!
Amoy newsletter issue 1 - How to set up and operate an iGEM team.
This issue of the Newsletter was aimed at future iGEM teams. To this end, the Newsletter gives iGEM teams room to describe the composition of their team and how their team is operated. This includes which teachers and students guide the team throughout the competition, from which department the team members originate and how to overcome difficulties. We contributed to this issue by describing the composition of our team, the distribution of team roles as well as making jokes about pizza.
Amoy newsletter issue 2 - Project introductions and ethical discussions.
The second issue of the newsletter was set to be published two weeks after Chinese scientists had succesfully used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the human genome. Sparked by the outcry within the scientific community, the newsletter gave room for ethical discussions on the subject. In addition to the ethical viewpoints from different iGEM teams from all over the world, the newsletter gave room for some iGEM teams to present their projects.
Amoy newsletter issue 3 - Show our projects.
The third issue of newsletter gave room to iGEM teams to present their projects. This issue contains project descriptions from teams from South America, Asia, Europe and Northern-America, targeting problems like lung cancer, malnourishment and bee & bat pathogens.
Amoy newsletter issue 4 (special) - The development of synthetic biology in different countries.
For the fourth newsletter, Amoy asked contributing times to describe the development of Synthetic Biology in their home countries. The guide features among others pieces on synthetic biology in Canada, France, Honduras"

Today we discussed in detail the plans for our upcoming experiments. We are currently growing V. cholerae cultures at 37 °C, 30 °C, and room temperature. We started growing our cultures on Monday (3/25) and have not observed any biofilm growth. Overnights of cholera were started again but left overnight in the shakers to better disperse the cholera growth. Once we observe biofilm growth we will focus on our biofilm degradation assays using the following three enzymes:
Amylase (AmyA)
Plasmid IG 86 were sequenced and verified as AmyA with appropriate forward and reverse primers. Subtilisin Savinase - from Bacillus lentus
We have the primers from last year and need to get the genes so that we can start cloning them into E. coli
Dispersin B - from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae
We have the primers from last year and need to get the genes so that we can start cloning them into E. coli.
We will try to obtain Bacillus lentus from another professor in the department, Dr. Richard Robison for our DNA template.
On Monday (4/1), we are going to give a presentation on the progress of our research and specify our experimental design. Each group member will research and present on a specific enzyme:
Whitney: AmyA
Nathan: Dispersin B
Michael: Savinase
The following research papers were studied and used to prepare for our presentation:

Background
As we know, there are more than 20,000 biobricks in iGEM official standard database and the number of biobrick keeps increasing every year. with the explosive increase of biobricks, it will be harder for synthetic biologists to manually find good biobricks which meets the requirements when they are trying to create new devices with existing parts. This issue will inevitably lead to the birth of softwares and databases especially related to synthetic biology and these intelligent tools will further promote the rapid development of synthetic biology. So we integrated biobricks data before September 3,2015 from the iGEM official standard database and then created a visual online device-designing system for synthetic biology researchers.
Meanwhile,we get some ideas with our own system from 2014 SJTU Software’s EasyBBK that is available for finding good parts but has a lot to be improved. In this way, users can find biobricks with their requirements more quickly.
Design
Introduction
Our software, BASE, has four functions: search, recommendation, evaluation and upload. Via search function, users can search for parts or devices using IDs or features as keywords. In recommendation interface, users can draw their devices. They can also give some keywords when drag an icon to the chain to get a list of parts which fit the require and other parts best. When using evaluation, users firstly enter a device that they designed, then our software can give a score and advice for each part to improve their devices. Finally, users can upload their device to BASE’s database. For the first three functions, we develop a set of scoring system to evaluate the effectiveness and ease of use of the parts and devices. And the last 3 functions provide a whole set of helping system for device design.
Method
We get the data of bricks from IGEM part registry. A total of 28,637 biobricks are recorded in the database. Then we divide them into two groups, one for parts and the other for devices, according to whether the biobrick has subparts. Among them, 14,744 are parts and 13,893 are devices. For each biobrick, there’re four different websites:

II. ${\kappa}$ and ${\mu}$ are the same order, since these two values is always used as ratio.
parameter values:
The parameters we estimated are on this table.
Consider the reaction formula below.
LuxR + AHL ⇆  LuxR-AHL ... 1
LuxR-AHL + promoter ⇆ LuxR-AHL-promoter ... 2
(Naturally, LuxR-AHL dimer binds to promoter and activate this[4] but we can consider this model because we assumed Hill constant is 1.) K increases in proportion to LuxR.
If we assume there is 1's equilibrium,  [LuxR][AHL]/[LuxR-AHL] = const
At the same time, there is also 2's equlibrium,  [LuxR][AHL][promoter]/[
(We indicated that K becomes smaller inversely to the numbers of LuxR and promoter on the condition)
[LuxR-AHL-promoter]/[LuxR]
There is also the selection of AHL(Las, Lux, H6). ←K is different from this selection. AHL:Refer to experience[2]
This parameter can also be changed by expression rate of LuxI.
LuxI generate AHL, so increasing LuxI means increasing AHL itself.
On the dimensionalized form（ mathematics ）,
$K = \frac{b}{{\lambda}_a}K_A$ K_A is dimensionalized and steady value regardless of the amount of AHL if the concentration of LuxR is steady.
Increasing the expression rate of AHL means increasing ${\lambda}_A$ and K decreases.
Therefore, many variations can be considered.
We considered the parameter from {\gamma}, {\alpha} and {\beta} that are already found to some extent.
specifically,divide the geometric means of values of {\alpha} and {\beta} of each parameter set by {\gamma}.  And then we mulitiplied it by random numbers which range from 0.1 to 100. But the random numbers here aren't unifomal because the ratio is important this time.
delta
delta is the maximum value of E. coli death rate caused by AHL
Varying promoters such as pLux or pLas, you can control the value of this parameter. According to ETH Zurich 2014, crosstalk by promoters happens[2]. Because the expression caused by crosstalk is relatively weak, you can adjust the expression of delta by taking advantage of this.
According to the result of the experiment, we succeded in reducing the reproduction rate to its"

ProtoMetrics
     To read more about ProtoMetrics, please check out our Measurement page.
ProtoChat
ProtoChat is a messaging service built into ProtoCat to allow users to contact one another directly, as opposed to leaving comments on a protocol. Users have their own inboxes, where they can keep track of messages as they arrive, and respond to them. This can be used to communicate between collaborators of a protocol, or between researchers in order to share ideas prior to publishing them to ProtoCat.
Protocols.io Import Tool
     To read more about our import tool, please check out our Human Practices Gold page.
Visual Protocol History
     ProtoCat enables users to 'version control' their protocols; anyone can create a variant of a protocol and make modifications as they see fit. However, once multiple revisions are made, and the subsequent tree of protocol revisions gets unruly, it can be quite difficult to figure out which version one should be using. In ProtoCat 3.0, the only way to navigate through a set of protocols was to do it one level at a time, which was incredibly arduous and hard to keep track of. To address this issue, we have created a way for a user to view the history of protocols visually to make navigating to the best version of a protocol as efficient as possible.
     Protocol nodes are color coded from red (1 star) to green (5 star), and are transparent should they be hidden from search. These visual cues, in addition to the tree diagram,  makes finding a well-written, tested protocol much easier. On hover, a user can see the title, author, and change log of that specific version of a protocol.
Favorite Protocols
     ProtoCat allows users to find protocols for a variety of disciplines, and gives easy access through an online catalog. However, a Primary Investigator may want his/her students to only use specific protocols that are, for example, optimized to the equipment in the lab. This PI could send everyone in the lab a link to the protocol that should be used, but what if a new version of the protocol becomes available? In addition, every time the PI finds a new protocol, it needs to be sent out to everyone in the lab. To address this, we have built a favorites system into ProtoCat, which allows users to signify a select set of ""favorite protocols"". Now"

Amplification of Signal Peptide sequence of ChiA74 and cloning into the pCold
    Analysis in silico of the putative alginate lyase of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis AM65-52 (GenBank accession number: CP013275.1) indicate that this gene does not have a signal peptide ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ ), for this reason we decided to control the secretion of these genes with the signal peptide sequence of ChiA74. The spchiA74 was amplified from the vector pEHchiA74 reported in Barboza-Corona et al. (2009), digested with KpnI/PstI and then ligated into the pCold-algy previously digested with  BamHI/Kpn (Figure 3). This construct is transformed in E. coli to generate E. coli/pCold-spchiA74-algy. This signal peptide will allow the secretion of alginate lyase in E. coli. We are in process to check the effectiveness of the spchiA74 to secrete the alginate lyase comparing the enzymatic activity of E. coli/pCold-algy versus E. coli/pCold-spchiA74-algy.
Figure 3. Amplifications of the signal peptide sequence (spchiA74) and generation of  pCold-spchiA74-algy. Lanes 1 and 5, DNA ladder (invitrogen); lane 2 and 3, spchiA74 after PCR of pEHchiA74; lane 6, digestion of pCold-spchiA74-algy with  BamHI/PstI releasing the pCold and spchiA74; lane 7 and 8, pCold digested with  BamHI/PstI.
P. aeruginosa biofilm formation
    In order to check the effectiveness of the alginate lyase synthesized by E. coli, we standardized the biofilm formation  according with  O´Toole (2011), which is stained in blue (Figure 4). Once we check the effectiveness of the alginate lyase, we  will be able to test the effect on the P. aeruginosa biofilms.

Afterwards the sensitivity of a single specie with  respect to all of the parameters was plotted with respect to time.
 Time Dependent Sensitivity Analysis,  specific for AHL with respect to all of the parameters
The parameters that influenced AHL the most were those  involved on its degradation and the formation of the complex AHL:LuxR.
Time Dependent Sensitivity  Analysis, specific for cI:cI with respect to all of the parameters
An interesting behavior can be seen for the dimer cI:cI.  It is sensitive to most of the parameters in our model.  However most of them are only temporal, only  influencing the model during the lifetime of AHL. The only parameters that  always influence its concentration are its dimerization and degradation rate  and the “leaky” synthesis rate.
Time Dependent Sensitivity  Analysis, specific for RcnA with respect to all of the parameters
 RcnA is sensitive  to practically the same parameters as cI:cI, nevertheless, it is easily noticeable  that RcnA is inversely affected by them, which makes sense, because  the dimerization of cI lowers the available  amount of cI and enhances the synthesis of RcnA
 
Time Dependent Sensitivity  Analysis, specific for intracellular nickel with respect to all of the  parameters
In our model, an increase in the amount of internal  nickel is the expected outcome after the addition of AHL. The sensitivity  analysis demonstrates that it is sensitive to all of the parameters in our  model. Just temporally to some of them, but continuously to the rest.
 
Stoichiometric matrix
Mathematically,  the stoichiometric matrix S is a linear transformation of  the flux vector to a vector of the time derivatives of the concentration  vector of the form dx/dt = Sv, and it’s  formed from the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactions that  comprise a reaction network. This matrix is organized such that every  column corresponds to a reaction and every row corresponds to a  compound. Each column that describes a reaction is constrained by the  rules of chemistry, such as elemental balancing; and every row thus  describes the reactions in which that compound participates and  therefore how the reactions are interconnected. The stoichiometric  matrix thus contains chemical and network information.
There  are four fundamental subspaces associated with a matrix, and each of  them has important roles in the analysis of biochemical reaction  networks. In particular, we have analyzed the null space and the  left null space of the stoichi"

For Bronze
We registered for iGEM, and are going to attend the Giant Jamboree.
We have completed the Judging Form.
We have created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and documented the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We are going to present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We have created a page on our team wiki with a clear attribution of each aspect of our project, following all the necessary criteria as per the instructions.
We have document a new standard BioBrick Part, which is central to our project and are going to submit this part to the iGEM Registry, adhering to the iGEM Registry guidelines.
For Silver
We have experimentally validated that our BioBrick Part as well as the device (of our own design and construction) works as per the expectations. Apart from that, we also documented the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry.
We submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Our team has identified the issue of Pollution in general. We have investigated the effect it has through numerous surveys carried out in different parts of Delhi. We are implementing our prototype in project ""Aanch"
