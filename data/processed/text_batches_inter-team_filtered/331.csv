Program
git, svn, and other version control systems focus on differences between lines. Since most DNA file formats split DNA to fixed-length lines, many lines are changed at once, for example, when inserting a single new line. darwin does away with that by producing a formatted file representing each ORF on its own line of text, making each edit only modify a single line of the output text.
Fig1. - darwin eliminates extra lines in the output file
Genes can be very long. To combat this, darwin will sample a section of every newly inserted ORF and compare it to nearby ORFs; if the new ORF is similar to another ORF, it is counted as “edited,” and darwin only records the character-by-character changes required to transform the old ORF into the new ORF.
Fig2. - darwin's unique method of parsing ORF
Finally, darwin uses concurrency to help speed up the process. File I/O is typically extremely slow, much slower than processing a file data already in memory. Splitting the processing concurrently helps to open up that speed bottleneck.

UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," the students in a discussion about what synthetic biology is and how we have used it in our iGEM project. In each classroom, we got to speak with the students about our project, interests, and own educational experiences. The students were very receptive and eager to learn more about biotechnology and the growing industries of synthetic biology. By sharing information about the large and rapidly advancing biotech industry right here in La Jolla, we saw the students start to ask how they could get involved as they began to see how viable that possibility really is. For the high school presentations and Sally Ride Science workshops alike, educating younger students that fields in STEM that are available and can provide promising career paths was a major goal of ours. The workshop we developed introduces students to the basics of DNA technologies, synthetic biology, and 3D printing. The workshop is three hours long, very dynamic, engages the students in hands on activities, and achieves the goals of Sally Ride Science and UCSD iGEM all at the same time. We were able to include a hands-on experimentation with 3D printing into the workshop as well as include DNA modeling kits to aid students in active learning and to help future participants in Sally Ride to best lead this workshop.
Reflection: After discussing amongst ourselves the best ways in which we could get out into our community, both now and in the future, to teach younger students about STEM and give them exposure to synthetic biology, we decided to implement our own work into presentations and reach out to other organizations that could help us carry out this idea. Presenting at Torrey Pines high school was more rewarding and successful than we had anticipated. We saw how we were able to use our own work in developing a product this summer that could improve healthcare using synthetic biology, and our own enthusiasm for the project, to get the high school students asking their own questions and wondering how they could get involved. Lastly, being able to continue influencing a wider demographic through our middle school and high school workshop with Tritons for Sally Ride Science fulfilled our goals for STEM education and engagement on a long-term scale.
Here is a picture from our talk with the Intro to Biotechnology class at Torrey Pines High School. It was wonderful to see the enthusiasm and curiosity that all the students had.
In addition, here is a copy of our workshop document for teams that may be interested in replicating.

The Peking team took traI out of the F plasmid, and implemented it into a miniF plasmid to allow only cells who contain the miniF plasmid would be able to conjugate with other cells. The problem that Peking had with using traI was that it had several restriction sites that were not allowed by the iGEM standards. Nevertheless, we looked today at a small part from the traI that had crucial genes for conjugation and did not contain illegal segments. We are still not sure whether this gene will be removed properly from the F plasmid and function well within the miniF, so we are still trying to consider some alternative tra genes in the F plasmid that are important to conjugation.

Also the E. coli are genetically engineered so that they have limited growth, because otherwise they would simply overgrow and also it improves the trap’s biosafety, since these E. coli are not able to reproduce in a normal environment and also they are not able to exit these traps, because we have a membrane with a distinctive size, so these small molecules and small proteins, the E. coli produce, are still able to exit the trap.
Dr. Hutchinson: May I ask you: Is this mosquito-specific?
Bjarne: The papers this is based on were written about Anopheles gambiae. They tested different kind of luring assembles in order to lure these mosquitoes.
Dr. Hutchinson: And does it kill the mosquito at the time or does the mosquito then fly away?
Oda: Fly away and then die.
Dr. Hutchinson: They will fly away? They will die on their own?
Bjarne: Hopefully.
Dr. Hutchinson: Because I belong to the mosquito protection society.
Bjarne: Well…
Mr. Lindemann: Do they only kill those mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite?
Lisa: No, it’s mosquitoes in general.
Bjarne: What I also wanted to say: We haven’t had a chance to test it, so we don’t know whether they fly away or not, but that’s the plan so far. And also, these proteins are not that deathly, that they kill them right away, but we don’t know yet.
Alex: But there is also a kind of aspect of mosquito protection. So, there is an alternative idea, which is called gene drive and with the gene drive technology … You are familiar with it?
Dr. Hutchinson: Yes.
Alex: The gene drive technology would lead to the extinction of these mosquitoes. So, our trap will reduce the population of mosquitoes in a specific place. But we are not aiming at killing them all.
Lisa: We don’t want them to go extinct. Just in the places where you put the trap the mosquitoes are killed, but some miles away they won’t get hurt.
Dr. Hutchinson: So perhaps you would use this in the villages, but not in the forests. Just to make sure again: I’m so sorry about this English. So please talk in German, if you wish. I’m not offended. So again, I understand that you would be killing all mosquitoes within an environment, whether these mosquitoes are transmitters of malaria or not.

Fostering relationships within the synthetic biology community is  a crucial component to the iGEM journey. By collaborating with other teams, we were able to aid our peers across the world while getting to know them a little better. Team MetaSense collaborated with iGEM teams by answering surveys, exchanging protocols, planning experiments and participating in an international effort to spread awareness and make synthetic biology more popular.
Purdue University collaboration
The Purdue University iGEM team also spent the summer working with cell-free expression of proteins and paper-based diagnostics. By Skyping with their team, we had the opportunity to exchange ideas at the start of our summer and discuss different protocols on getting our system on paper and exchange ideas about mathematical modeling of our system. We remained in contact throughout the summer and also had the opportunity to debug their paper-based assay.

The bands on the gel (see figure 26) fit quite nicely with this description, except for the ~1000 bp band, which looks to be ~2000 bp long. However, since the plasmid only is about 7000 bp in length, it made no sense for such a large band to appear, and we assumed that the Scavidin would be inserted correctly, or the 6000 bp band wouldn’t appear. It thus appeared like the lacZ composite part was assembled correctly, but after sequencing the part, it was apparent that the positive result from the BseRI digest were due to the BseRI sites from Scavidin being recombined within the plasmid.

Test of composite lacZ part: ScAvidin binding to biotin
To test if our composite lacZ part was able to attach to biotinylated beads, a cell lysate from BBa_K2355313 transformants was added to tubes containing biotinylated magnetic beads. After separation on a magnetic separation rack, the supernatant was removed from tubes, and tubes were washed with washing buffer (PBS TWEEN-20 0.05%) a couple of times. For each washing cycle, samples were put aside for testing. The different samples were tested by adding ONPG, and measuring the activity of β-galactosidase. A plot of the measured average β-galactosidase for each purification step is shown in figure 27. Along with samples of washing buffer, the biotinylated beads themselves were measured for β-galactosidase activity, both before (Beads 1) and after (Beads 2) the washing steps.

Best Education and Public Engagement:
Best Education! We thoroughly understand that it's vital to spark new scientific curiosity among the youth. Therefore, this human practice is designed to introduce the magical world of life science to kids around 10 years old. With the help of a simple but interesting experiment, kids can know more about microbes and enjoy the fun brought by synthetic biology. Furthermore, we explain the principles behind every step to them when doing experiments together. Another meet-up is held latter to encourage them to bring their friends to come next year, which means our human practice is sustainable. Best Public Engagement! Voices or views outside the lab are important for iGEMers to optimize their projects. The human practice 'Sketch in Dish' could also be regarded as a public dialogue. Not only kids but also undergraduates of other major, parents and other family member of kids, etc. participate in Sketch in Dish. Thus we get an opportunity to explain the science behind synthetic biology to them and talk about the benefits and risks in this emerging field. Some views and conclusions are listed below: 1. ""Even if we don't know what synthetic biology exactly is, we still encourage our kid to take part in such activities. Because we want them to know more about science but we lack the ability to explain those things to them."" one of the parents said. Many parents are eager to develop their kid's interest in science and would like to take part in any relating activities. 2. People are more willing to learn about brand-new field than we expected before, especially when the development of the field might influence their daily life. Many parents are curious about the use of synthetic  biology in medicine and the microbes that may apply in daily life in the future. 3. ""Transgenic"" was the word they mentioned the most. Parents kept asking us questions about this when we talked about the biobricks inside E. coli. Risks of such transgenic operations have been asked again and again. Therefore, we must pay more attention to explain our work to the public and reconsider the potential risk of our products more carefully.

Human Practices
Gold: Meeting of minds
Human Practices is necessary for the birth of a project; also, what we did should be given back to human practices. With such idea, we have investigated the human practices into the design and execution of our project, Bio101 and Bio2048.
Bio101
THEME CHOSEN
Before we chose the theme of our project, we considered taking some actions to seek inspiration. We held a lecture with UESTC-China in Puyang Middle School. We began by introducing Synthetic Biology with some well-known examples. Then, we engaged the students to build their own plasmids. They added the functional genes such as Bioluminescence gene into the plasmids, which enlightened us of the fact that DNA carries biological information. Along this line, we put forward that we could utilize DNA to store information besides its biological characteristics. That was the beginning of exploring the DNA information storage.
Fig.1.We built the plasmids together.
FEATURES DESIGN
Furthermore, we did man-on-the-street interviews in the community around. We asked people what features a storage tool should possess and what they think about using DNA to store information. We received much useful information from the interactions. A young man left the deepest impression on us: he had high expectation for the storage capacity, equipment volume and storage speed. He had special interest in our project and gave us great help to decide the property and function of software.
Fig.2.The interview about Bio101.
MODEL DESIGN
We knew that for iGEM, sharing and collaboration is one of core values. We met and discussed in iGEM Southwest China Union. During the meeting, the participants did not only focus on software functions, but also were curious about the algorithms. We talked about transformation of IT to BT, comparing ternary with quanternary. This contributes to model design for us to get the better one. During the communication, they gave suggestions from a professional point of view.

Density of bacterial cells
Estimating a precise distribution of cells into the tumor is not straightforward, and we had to apply assumptions that appeared reasonable to us to be able to estimate a plausible quantitative repartition of bacteria in solid tumors.
Geometry of the tumor and bacteria colony (green area: colonized by E. coli Nissle)
Volume of E. coli cell
1 µm3 [3]
Radius of tumor Tumor radius
20 mm
Radius of colony shell (concentric to tumor)
10 mm
Width of colony shell
0.5 mm
The three last values where obtained from an estimation made from the microscopy images of mouse tumors presented in a paper studying E. coli Nissle colonization of tumors [4] . The proportions were kept and adapted to a model tumor of 4 cm in diameter, to be closer to a situation in the human body (the colonization was studied only in mice). In addition to this data, we took into account the measured overall concentration of E. coli in the tumor, 1e9  CFU/g to deduce an estimated more precise distribution of the bacteria in the tumor. Considering that the bacteria colonize preferentially the ""shell area"" at the border between the necrotic area of the tumor and the alive tissue, the effective concentration of bacteria in this area can be inferred from a simple proportionality equation, as follows:
We model the bacteria as inhabiting a layer inside a spherical tumor of radius \( r_2 = 20 \text{mm} \). According to [4] , the bacteria colonize the interface between live and necrotic tumor tissue, which we model occurring at radius \( r_1 = 10 \text{mm} \). The width of the colony is set to \( w = 0.5 \text{mm} \).
We expect that the concentration of bacteria in the tumor will be approximately 1e9 CFU/g (citation needed). The volume of a single bacterium is \( V_{\text{cell}} \approx 1 \mu m^3 \).

Biofilms: Results
The biofilm gradient using different concentrations of bleach was taken out at 8:13 and observed for visible signs of RFP growth. All seven LB media tubes seem to have visible signs of RFP growth. The 1/16 bleach dilution however does not seem to have any RFP growth. Cultures will be left in the 4˚C fridge overnight to allow the cells to precipitate at the bottom.

Biofilms: Bleach Concentration Gradient
Objective: The previous biofilm gradient using the different concentrations of oxalic acid may not have been successful. A repeat of the gradient is needed to verify results of the previous trials.
Procedure: Protocol the same as on July 22, 2015 with the previous concentrations of bleach used.
1.The dilutions were made for a 15 mL falcon tube using water and standard bleach solution
2.3.2 mL of one of the bleach dilutions were placed in one the Petri dishes containing biofilms from the previous day. This process was repeated for the other six dilutions.
3.The biofilms were then allowed to degrade for 15 mins.
4.The bleach solutions in each of the Petri dishes was emptied and rinsed once with Milli-Q water.
5.LB media tubes were labeled with one of the bleach solutions. 5 µL of KAN was added to each labeled tube.
6.20 µL of LB from one tube was taken out and placed on the edge of one of the Petri dishes.

Remarks
The Preincubation step takes care of what is called the „run off“ step, a step imple-mented in order to eliminate endogenous cellular mRNA. The removal of endog-enous mRNA bound to ribosomes/polysomes is accomplished by finishing their synthesis via the added PEP, pyruvate kinase and ATP at 37°C. The residual endogenous mRNA will then subsequently become degraded due to the high RNase content of the extract. This step is precautionally performed in the dark, because some components are slightly light sensitive.
The lysate can be frozen again after use, but looses effectivity

Even in this case my results were partially: one colture worked perfectly (CysDes-GFP induced), while the other colture (CysDes K) worked a bit worst: you can see a little difference in the color between the induced and not induced (the induced is little more green), but the induced one is too yellow: I think that this is always due to the too old plate. I will repeat the test next week with a freshly transformed plate.
I exposed the gathered data to the group.
Starting from this week, I will work on Biosafety and Future Application sections. It’s not a light task, but it’s something new, so I’m happy about it. I don’t want to hear about cloning anymore.
I will also work on modeling.
Along with Ross, I also started to characterize co-cultures.
Eventually I reach also this week, that’s the present one.
On Tuesday we started to measure some terminators. We measure the fluorescence of T7-platform, B0010-platform and platform and compare all the data. We did a preparatory step to find the best way to measure also absolute values of peaks, as we want to see if the terminator’s presence influence Cherry expression.
The results were amazing: the coli terminator seemed to work much better than the T7, and both terminators seemed to stabilize Cherry, in addition to reduce Venus. This behaviour wasn’t expected and we were really surprised and pleased of that.
Moreover we discovered that our results were quite strong: even for non equal OD coltures and different lapse times after sonication they seemed constant, although with a higher variability.
Also the sequencing results arrived, and confirmed Ptac platform with t7 and B0010 terminators. Also pSB1C3 with the same two terminators was confirmed. No construct with B0015 was right, but luckily they are less important.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Du: I’m Shuangshuang Du of team Nanjing_China from Nanjing University.
Xu： I’m a member of iGEM_Tianjin. Our team would like to communicate with you.
Du: Sure.
Du: By what means?
Xu: We intend to biodegrade PET using yeasts. How about your project?
Du: Photobiological hydrogen production.
We both are environmental projects!
Xu: Yes. Then we should have plenty of common topics. What strains do you use?
Du: We use Escherichia coli.
Xu: We use yeasts, but the other day when we consulted theses, we found that Rhodococcus might meet some of our needs.
We use yeasts, but the other day when we consulted theses, we found that Rhodococcus might meet some of our needs. Searching through the internet, we learnt that Pro. Wanjun Liao from your university had deep researches in this area, so I wonder if you are familiar with him?

1.3 Reference
Futurework
We will try to create S. cerevisiae which make necessary nutrients for nation which is troubled by starvation while have resistance to high salt concentration and low pH.
Adapteing S. cerevisiae to low pH
First of all, we wanted to complete DNA fragment overexpressesing HAA1 because we could not complete. Once this DNA fragment is completed and integrated into the genome by homologous recombination, S. cerevisiae will adapt severe environments. So it is possible to freely design fermented foods.
strengthening resistance against severe environment and increasing production of nutrition
We are also considering strengthening resistance against severe environment and increasing production of nutrition. Gifu taught me that the expression level of S. cerevisiae mRNA can be regulated not only by promoter but also by terminator. [1]All devices used our project  have CYC1 terminetor.If we wanted to express more mRNA, we found that it would be better to turn into high activity of terminator. Since the activity of cyc1 terminator is 0.556105, it can be thought that increasing production of β-carotene and strengthening of salt tolerance can be achieved by changing to higher activity terminator than cyc1 terminator. We decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons. Since using a highly active terminator may cause problems, we would like to carefully examine whether they are really the best choice for us.

Winter Camp
After the Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share                                 their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the                                 cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire. All students in our school are welcomed.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about                                 synthetic biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students to know                                 more about the logic                                 design and skills required to start a project related to synthetic biology.
Based on their needs, we arranged several courses for someone maybe interested in:
(1) The history and development of synthetic biology (Chun Li)
(2) Literature searching and reading (Chenyi Li)
(3) Photoshop training (Mingming Cao)
(4) Academic writing and English presentation training (Hui Luo)
(5) Brainstorm introduction (Zeyan Li)
(6) System biology and mathematical model (Pengcheng Zhang)
After the course, we got some feedback from students. From preparation to implementation,                                 the whole winter camp lasted for two months.                                 Then,we welcomed students who showed great passion                                     to iGEM to take part in the brainstorm activity.
Communication with COFCO
What we designed is a product that might be used in large-scale                                 fermentation, to get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production, we visited COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute.

We introduced our project to the staff, getting many useful feedback.                                 Their suggestions helped us view our project in a different way,                                 and lead us to think more about application and the practical problems.                                 For example, they talked about whether we can give a false signal to                                 indicate the plasmid lost and kill the bacteria. In this way, they can                                 reduce the cost of treatment by not using heat treatment. Besides,                                 they raised a question about the distribution of inhibitor proteins                                 as well as the plasmids. The random distribution may also lead to the                                 signal delay,"

Exeter & Warwick
Crash Course in Bioreactor Design
The Exeter and Warwick iGEM teams were both designing bioreactors that would allow them to clean up water. Bioreactors are large containers that allow for substrates to be converted into products under the correct conditions - often requiring organisms to catalyse the reactions. he Exeter and Warwick iGEM teams wanted to be able to put contaminated waters into a bioreactor and have the microbes clean it up. We provided a crash course in bioreactor design, which in turn helped them troubleshoot their designs.
The Exeter iGEM team hopes to put their bioreactor on Mars. To achieve this they initially chose graphene as their main construction material due to its lightweight. However, as graphene is very malleable it would be unable to withstand forces generated within the bioreactor by the impellers. To resolve this issue and using our knowledge of bioreactors, we suggested stainless steel. This resulted in them designing a theoretically functioning bioreactor and taking their idea to other experts.
Wiki Support
The Exeter iGEM team helped us design our Wiki page by troubleshooting errors we had in the interactive webpage. This enabled us to produce a more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly
website. This is essential for stakeholders to better engage with our work. Without them, a large interactive aspect of the page would not have been functional.
Water Samples
The Warwick iGEM team collected water samples around the United Kingdom by asking iGEM teams to pick three tubes full of river sediment and water. We assisted in this
by collecting London river water. In return, the Warwick iGEM team provided us with their samples, allowing us to measure the metal concentrations in the water.

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of some of our parameters. Oxford recommended we used Karzburn’s 2011 paper, ‘Coarse grained dynamics of a cell free system’ for the translation constant. They also pointed out that we had forgotten to change some of the parameters’ units so our model was not dimensionally consistent, and we updated the model to fix those.

Karzburn’s 2011 paper gave 4 amino acids s-1 [7] . As the GFP sequence we used was 239 amino acids long, [8] we simply did 4aa s-1 ÷ 239 aa.

One of the biggest potential problems we identified was that if enough translation of closed switches occurred, it would be difficult to see any meaningful results. The kleakage parameter represents the ratio of translation rate on the closed and the open switch. We concluded that would not get any observable difference if translation on the closed switch was above a ten thousandth of the rate on the open switch, something we would never have been able to quantify easily without the model.
Without the model we wouldn’t have realized quite how crucial reducing leakage was. We spent a lot of time designing our switches to minimize leakage.
The lab team also asked us to find the optimal concentration of DNA for both output variation and overall output. By varying ktranslation and the concentration of DNA we found that a higher concentration was better in general, however it would plateau eventually as miRNA consumption became the limiting factor. In the specific case of miRNA degradation being 2 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of degradation of the other RNAs the GFP concentration plateaued around 5×10-9 mol dm-3.
Try out the model for yourself and see if you can see our conclusions by changing the parameters to see the final"

1 Answers to the safety questions
1.1 Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
1.2 Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
2 Interview with Dr. Stéphane Karlen, Biosafety Coordinator at the EPFL
Answers to the safety questions
Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
Our project is part of a Level 1 biosafety lab, meaning that our work involves the lowest level of risk. The E. coli strains we use are harmless and are used world-round with no health risks associated. Both for the experiment's own success and for the safety of others, all bacterial manipulations (cell cultures, glycerol stocks, mini-preps) that involve exposing bacteria to the air of the lab require the use of a Bunsen burner. Moreover, disposing of all bacteria is a two-step process. First, one must bleach the receptacle containing the bacteria (fill its contents with bleach) under the fume hood. The bleached mixture is then poured into a special canister which is treated separately. Second, all cell pellets or dry receptacles containing or having contained cells must be placed in a special biowaste bag, clearly labelled for that specific use. This bag is then disposed of, every week, by a special team from the Life Sciences building. These precautions, coupled with the usual wearing of nitrile and latex gloves at all times, are adequate to the task of maintaining the safety and health of our iGEM team.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
There is no known risk to the public if these bacteria are ever released into the public.
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
No known environmental damages have ever been attributed to the innocuous strains used in our lab.

İlkem Kumru
Hello dear iGEMers, it's Ilkem Kumru here, a senior student in Biology Department of Middle East Technical University. This is my third year in iGEM. I am the team leader of this year's team. I take part in WetLab, P&P, Modeling, wiki designing and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM Team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death , and it is also the only place where I feel as immortal as my love of science.
Dorukcan Özköse
Hello all H.s.sapiens. My name is Dorukcan Özköse and I'm a junior student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department at METU. This is my second year in iGEM, hence I'm so excited and curious about all synthetic biology subjects and our project. I love swimming, sightseeing and doing science about genetics. Good luck to all teams that are in iGEM 2015 contest.
Uğurcan Sakızlı
Hello people! =^o t o^=  I’m Uğurcan SAKIZLI and they call me “ghu” which is my nickname on the internet. I am just graduated from Biology Department of METU and I was –fortunately- dragged into the iGEM team by İlkem again and again. So, this is my third iGEM experience. I still believe what I learn here will become useful"

September 20th
1-1-64 Transfection
At 20 min after removing the medium, 25 uL of serum free medium containing the 1 uL of siLentfect and 200 ng each of pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-EGFP DNA was added to the well. As a negative control, 25 uL of serum free medium containing the 1 uL of siLentfect and 200 ng of pUAS-EGFP DNA alone was added to the well. Similarly, 25 uL of serum free medium containing the 1 uL of siLentfect and 200 ng each of pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-LacZ DNA was added to the well. As a negative control for this experiment, 25 uL of serum free medium containing the 1 uL of siLentfect and 200 ng of pUAS-LacZ DNA alone was added to the other well. At 4 hours after transfection, the transfection medium was removed and the Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to each well. The cells were incubated for 48 or 72 hours at 25 ℃.
September 22nd
The cells transfected with pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-EGFP DNA were examined under the confocal lazer microscope (Olympus, Fv10i).
Results: 12.6% cells were observed to be EGFP-positive, while only o.5% cells were apparently EGFP-positive for the negative control cells, indicating that the P-element plasmid, pUAS-EGFP DNA, Biobrick part (BBa_K758006) is truly functional in Drosophila cells. We therefore decided to send this prasmid to iGEM Headquarters.

    It's always been a great pleasure to share ideas with other iGEM teams and help each other along the way from summer to Jamboree. It's a process that one can inspire and be inspired at the same time. The whole project and the participation in the competition were made much easier and enjoyable with the help and support from them.
    One of the projects of iGEM-Team Tianjin involves the expression of a heterlogous protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is exactly the case for the application of our software Bach. While helping them to optimize the sequence, Bach is practiced, examined and improved in the whole process. It's a great tryout for Bach and an aid for their wet lab experiment as well. We've also consulted them about some wet lab procedures concerning operations of chemostasis, in which they offered much help in solving our problems.
    We've helped the iGEM Team of Bielefeld to translate the main page of their wiki from English to Chinese, so that their work and iGEM competition at the same time can be more accessible to Chinese people.
    We've participated in the iGEM-China meet-up hosted by iGEM team of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai at Aug.8th. Ideas about team's projects and related issues in synthetic biology have been exchanged, which has shaped our thoughts on Bach and made the summer even more memorable.

OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the researchers, we visited the laboratory and learned about the history of the laboratory as well as the results of the innovative research on Marine fish germplasm.
We asked the teacher if our project could be combined with genetic breeding, she gave us some suggestions. At present, they use traditional genetic technology in model organism zebrafish to explore the function of target gene. We wondered if our project can be applied to their labs. The researchers said we could have a try and it is an innovation to apply our system to another model organism. Indeed! Applying our system into another model organism is an opportunity as well as a challenge.
The researchers also encouraged us to combine our fundamental research with industry, which was an affirmation of our project. They are willing to apply our projects to their labs in the future.

2.2.3 Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co. LTD.
In order to find more ideas, we came to Qingdao Bright Seaweed Group Co. LTD. It is a leading enterprise in the Marine biological industry of Shandong province, and the largest seaweed biological products enterprise in the world. We visited the seaweed science museum and the state key laboratory of algae active substances, learned about the alginate and seaweed polysaccharide industries.
In the process, we came up with a new idea that we can use our system to regulate the expression of one or two enzymes that are needed for the processing and production. The company's research and development staff agreed with our idea and suggested that we should design a complete biological treatment scheme and explore its cultivation conditions to realize the better integration of our system with industry. We learned a lot from the journey of Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co. LTD, which was a great progress for us.

Currently we have no idea whatever our method of using Ferritin to identify and separate DNA of interest will be successful. To have a backup plan, I was in charge of finding alternative reporter genes that will at least indicate the presence of DNA of interest. Specifically Lisa and Rai came up a list of interesting and widely used reporter genes that I should research on, in the hope that eventually a differential equation based model can be developed, to predict their signal strength for any given input conditions of cells etc. This week I mostly did qualitative research, where I found out how they work and what equipment are needed, with a start on kinetics.
Those reporter genes can be divided into two categories: enzymes or proteins. Beta-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase all report promoter activities by react with a substrate that will either emit light or undergoes color change. I have found that between the enzymes luciferase has superior sensitivity and linear response range than GFP and beta-glactosidase.(Nakajima & Ohmiya, 2010) On the other hand GFP, FRET and BRET behaves similarly but themselves don't catalyze"

Proof of concept
To demonstrate that the BioLens concept works, a literature study is done.
Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the solar cell mounted with the MLA layer.
Figure 2: Schematic representation of the solar cell mounted with the MLA layer (Nam et al., 2013)
Based on the figure it appears that as a consequence of the differences in refractive index between the media and the lens, the light is concentrated on the focal plane. The MLA has multiple advantages in this way. First of all, it redirects the incident solar light toward interfinger regions and away from the mirror-like electrodes. Secondly, it redistributes the refractive light under the gridline areas. Furthermore, it provides a micro-concentration effect to facilitate photo-induced exciton generation and finally it protects the cell from harsh environmental conditions after being fully packaged (Nam et al., 2013) .
The efficiency of this setup have been tested and is compared to solar panels with a regular encapsulation layer. Based on published experimental results it appears that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar panels is almost 20% higher for the solar panels with MLA than for the solar panels without MLA encapsulation layer (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Efficiency measurements of different solar cell setups. (Nam et al., 2013)
Based on the published results it appears that the use of MLA as encapsulation layer is a successful way to improve the efficiency of solar panels. In this case so called GaAs-based solar cells are used.
In a comparable research project, the researchers have proved that the efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells can be increased with 50%. In their research they have used microlens arrays with spherical lenses. However, they have mentioned that this is not necessarily the optimal lens-shape and also the optimal array shape could be different (Jutteau et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is not surprising that research is done into the influence of the shape of the microlens arrays. Researchers have figured out that a curved microlens array can even improve the efficiency with more than 100% compared to ‘normal’ flat microlens arrays (Figure 4) (Xie et al., 2015) .

Our results suggest that these regulators play a complex role in E.coli’s native defense network [10][11], and for our purposes- proved difficult to directed towards benzaldehyde tolerance. We believe that the antibiotic resistance conferred by the transcriptional activators (MarA+/SoxS+/Rob+) independently validates our benzaldehyde results. Most interesting, our results suggest the AcrR+ mutant repressor strain performs inversely to the activators in respect to both ampicillin and benzaldehyde tolerance. This relationship is displayed in the following table. We assert that overexpressing AcrR is this study’s best candidate for conferring benzaldehyde resistance, but the benefits are marginal at best. While our results display distinct phenotypes, we hope to repeat these experiments with constructs that include a UTR between the RBS and start codon in order to increase translational efficiency.

Enzyme Homologues
The xylAMB genes from the 2016 project showed great specificity, which limited the number of products that could be formed. To expand our library of products, we searched for enzymatic homologues that could catalyze a wider range of substrates and/or increase the conversion of BTX compounds to their respective aromatic aldehydes.
Through literature search, a gene cluster coding for a protein called toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) from the organism Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 [12] was found. The six open reading frames corresponding to this gene were designated as touABCDEF. An advantage of this enzyme was that it metabolizes o-xylene. Our xylene monooxygenase (xylAM) enzyme from last year failed to metabolize o-xylene, while it successfully metabolized m-xylene and p-xylene. The substrates oxidized by ToMO and the products formed are highlighted below. Cresols are widely used as chemical intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry, solvents, preservatives, and various other applications [13].

Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in a relatively low concentrations. Also, the sizes varied unequally around 100 nm, which is an indication of aggregation as the expected sizes are around 10 nm. Therefore, a new batch had to be made for the actual analysis.

d-AuNPs Generation
In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C"

HIGH SCHOOL PRESENTATIONS
On October 14th, we had an opportunity to present at Western Canada High School to a group of interested students over the lunch hour.  Interested students were invited to attend and we had a great turnout!   Our presentation went so well that we were invited to stay to give the presentation again to a Biology 30 class after lunch.  On Friday we also sent team members to William Aberhart, another high school in Calgary to give a presentation in a Biology 30 class.
In both presentations we gave the students some brief background information on synthetic biology and we talked a lot about the iGEM competition.  We talked about how the competition works, the gals of the competition and we went over some of the projects that students have done in the past.  This gave them an idea of some of the diverse applications of synthetic biology.  We felt that this was important as it gives people a better idea of how cool science can actually be put into practice.  We think this is a big part of iGEM, learning through doing things and getting to apply some of the things that you learn in class.  We learned so much this summer and went far beyond what we learned in classes.

Valencia,2010,Team:Valencia#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," the process is promoted in an autocatalytic manner and all the protein is found in the prionic conformation. The cells resulting show the phenotype [PSI+].
It is important to note that the rate of the change of conformation is not equal to zero even at optimal growth conditions, and that not all the cells become [PSI+]. The rate of spontaneous activation of the switch is thought to be around 10-6 or 10-7 (Alberti et al., 2009). This process is promoted under heat stress (Tyedmers et al., 2008), probably because of the important role of heat shock proteins like Hsp104 in the formation and maintenance of the amyloid fiber (Halfmann et al., 2009). These approximate rates will have very important implications for the yeastworld model that we briefly describe in the following subsection, and with more detail in our wiki Modeling section.

Making our Biobricks
After a lot of attempts trying to make our BioBricks (we had some dificulties at different steps) we achieved our purpose: we built 2 BioBricks  and we sent them to de Registry.
PCR
First of all, we needed enough amounts of DNA in order to insert them as our Biobrick into the pSB1C3 provided by the Registry. We had purified DNA from PM2 E.coli strains and from NMGR526 E.coli strains. Using these as our DNA template we amplified the quoted genes: PM2 and NMGR526. The chosen program was:
A first denaturation cycle: 94ºC 3min
30 amplification cycles, made up of:
94ºC 30s
55ºC 1min
72ºC 1min
Final step: 72ºC 7min
Digestion
Next step was the digestion of the amplified material with the enzimes EcoRI and PstI, keeping the reaction tubes during 4-5 hours at 37ºC with:
PM2
1 μL PstI
1μL EcoRI
2,5 μL of insert PM2 (at 370,9 ng/ μL)

Then we go into the inner loop, which use each of the value in the vector to train the model and learn the model parameters. When the training is done, we would evaluate whether the learned model meets certain criteria. If so, the corresponding entry in the Evaluation matrix will add one. And the loop goes on and on until finish.
Step 4: By checking out the Evaluation matrix, we can see how many times that a value for lambda has met the criteria for good parameter. By sorting out the first 3 values that has the best performance, we can narrow down the scope of the parameter and set a new vector for lambdas and repeat the above procedure.
The Final Value for the Regularization Parameter:
1. lambda for whole saliva logistic regression: 0.0016
Criteria:
1) 2 F1-scores both ≥ 0.65
2) 2 accuracies both ≥ 0.8
3) mean and variance: mean = 0.232, variance = 0.00097
2. lambda for supernatant logistic regression: 0.03
Criteria:
1) 2 F1-scores both ≥ 0.55
2) 2 accuracies both ≥ 0.7
3) mean and variance: mean = 0.25, variance = 0.0008
3. SVM with linear kernel performs badly on the dataset of whole-saliva samples, so we give up using this model to classify the whole-saliva samples.
4. C for SVM with linear kernel: 10000
It took about 20 hours to select the parameter. Totally the optimization process was called 1500 times. The larger the C value is, the longer it took to train. Considering performance and efficiency, we chose the value 10000.
Criteria:
1) 2 F1-scores both ≥ 0.5
2) 2 accuracies both ≥ 0.7
3) mean and variance: mean = 0.145, variance = 1 * 10-4

On the other hand, we also paid attention to the differences between in vivo tests and confrontational coculture, although T.atroviride completely inhibited Phytophthora in PDA medium, however, in plants, T.atroviride only delayed the diseases outbreak, but could not eliminate the harm of Phytophthora, this may showed that the further improvement of T.atroviride,like combining with synthetic biology technology, is necessary and meaningful.So the next step was collecting DNA parts which can be used in filamentous fungus and proving that we can express foreign genes in T.atroviride.
Gene manipulation in T.atroviride
Overview
In order to introduce the T.atroviride as a new kind of chassis, we accomplished                 the random insertion manipulation in T.atroviride. According to the report gene(GFP) under the fluorescence microscope, we can prove that we are able to manipulate the T.atroviride at the level of genes and express the genes of interests.  However, to the extented application, especially to enable the T.atroviride to realize their biocontrol  function in the automatic agriculture, we need our T.atroviride to finish more tasks. For instance, we need to establish more complicated pathway in the T.atroviride and to integrate more transcription units to the genome of the T.atroviride at the same time. Therefore, we referred to the research in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the modularized two-step(M2S) chromosome integration technique and established a T.atroviride homologous recombination kit[1].
Experimental Design
The first phase: random insertion
We obtained the constitutive promoter(H3 promoter), which is workable in T.atroviride, as well as the terminator used in T.atroviride called RP27. Then we assembled the promoter, terminator, a reporter gene(eGFP) and hph gene (hygromycin) together with the vector PKD1 to construct the random insertion plasmid. PKD1 backbone is a kind of TDNA vector so that it is able to insert into the T.atroviride genome.
This experiment can prove whether the random insertion can be manipulated in T.atroviride and whether it’s convenient to explore various promoters strength for standardization.
Through ATMT(Agrobacterium Tumefaciens-mediated Transformation), hph gene and the reporter gene(GFP) can be imported into the genome DNA. The transformants can grow on the"

Important notes
1. The idea of a pulsgenerator as reset mechanism has been cancelled for the following reasons:
it takes too long before the proposed system generates a pulse-like event
the pulse itself is too long
a constant lactonase production sequence generates enough lactonase to reset the timer

Bacteria are released if we change the pH of solution, by which they can be turned into working state. The last question is that when should we use our elves system to degrade atrazine after atrazine used. The half life of atrazine is considered to be seven days, and we need to measure how long enough for atrazine working is. We are trying to mix our bacteria powder with atrazine, and design a system for releasing our bacteria in a specific period of time after atrazine used. It is very regretful for our missing Phd Wang, the scientific research team leader of Zhongshan Chemistry Industry. Feasibility of our design was not evaluated by experts.
Perspectives of Atrazine
We try to find out the effect of transgenic crop on atrazine development. According to the secretary of the party committee of Changxing First Chemical Industry, atrazine develops smooth and steady in recent years. Maybe transgenic crop will have negative effect on traditional herbicide, such as atrazine and drive researches to develop new specific herbicide. At present, these effects are not remarkable. We believe that atrazine will not be weeded out in the coming decades and more methods to make it more environmental friendly will be developed.

Room 341 Yifu Building   Sunday  May 12, 2013
In this meeting we discussed eight reviews read by the team members during the past several days. The contents of the reviews are in the areas of gene switch which is based on the research of protein isomerism; mammalian cell structure design using the idea of engineering of small molecules; synonymous codon bias; application of catalytic efficiency of light in synthetic biology reactions and RNA functions. The software Notebook done by other team for past competition was also introduced. Considering what we have already discussed before, we decided to focus more on the projects from the past iGEM teams. Now the topic that interests us is codon optimization based on selection bias, but it calls for  further discussion.

In this meeting we discussed four papers and some software. “SynBioSS: the synthetic biology modeling suite” is a synthetic gene structure modeling and simulation software in which different parts could be set in a complete network, but it highly recommends a wider and more comprehensive knowledge on synthetic biology, molecular biology and computers. Another paper talked about how antibiotics kill bacteria, and what we can learn from it is the possibility to create a piece of software to simulate this process, which, of course,will provide great convenience to synthetic biology researchers. Yang Xue introduced SBOL to the team, which is an open language for synthetic biology. “Engineering of synthetic intercellular communication systems” summarized how to accomplish cell communication systems in cells in synthetic biology. The software Bioguide introduced by Jurong Zhao focused on the categories for pathway generation and database search. After the discussion, we all agreed that the project we plan to do should be fully considered with the user needs and provide convenience to synthetic biology researchers.

Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.

Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.
We have looked further into all of this on our silver human practices page .

We were unsure as to the clinical implementation of our project, so we spoke with Dr Justin Daniels, a pediatrician and clinical director, who has served on NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a UK public body that provides national guidance to improve healthcare) appraisal committees. He suggested its main value could be as a screening tool for high risk individuals. We knew previously about how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the"

Similarly, we insert this large fragment into the upstream of the ligated pTAL with terminator (Figure 2). Eventually, we successfully reconstruct regulative pTAL and offer 3 our own parts this year. One is regulative pTAL (K1311004, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311004:Design ); one is K1311005 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311005:Design ) and the other is K1311006 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311006:Design ).

Report System
We construct a report system so as to test the reliability and efficiency of our ‘Marvelous TALE’. In this section, we test the TALE’s DNA binding ability and report it with a common report gene ‘RFP’. We attempt to put the target of TALE’s DNA binding target sequence inside the expression cassette of report gene and binding TALE can disrupt the express of report gene. We use iGEM standard parts to build our report system.
We designed a standard iGEM part BBa_K1311007 to complete all the tasks http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311007:Design . This part contains
Promoter (J23102)-TALE binding site (repeats three times)-RBS-LacI coding sequence-Terminator(B0015)-LacI Regulative Promoter(R0010)-RBS(B0034)-mRFP1(E1010)-Terminator(B0015)
This part can convert the binding ability of TALE protein to its target DNA sequence to an easier available parameter, the florescent intensity of RFP. When the TALE protein is expressed, the TALE make binds to its target, which may interrupt the transcription of LacI. The lack of repressors may lead to the expression of RFP. So the stronger florescent intensity means the better binding ability of TALE protein. In this part, the target of TALE recognition site is chosen to be the 18bp sequence (ACCTCATCAGGAACATGTT).

Collabrations
As a student team, we highly appreciated recommendations and feedback from experts of different scientific areas. Especially for a scientific project like the iGEM competition, it was valuable to unclose new perspecives and assess feasibility of our project ideas. Following, short protocols of the meetings and conversations are listed. At this point we would like to thank all individuals that have supported us with inspiring discussions, provision of constructs or material.
Outreach
There is no doubt that IGEM needs a communication platform to share our idea, ask for and receive help. Though we have Meet up, IGEM Summit, Facebook and Twitter, indeed, these platforms fail to become popular.  We visit to the pharmaceutical industrial companies, understanding pharmaceutical plant layout, and the drug production process (from raw materials to finished products). The leading managers strengthen our GMP knowledge and safety knowledge, which inspired us to hold a scientific exhibition. Cooperated with the Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Bio-engineering Co. Ltd, we held a scientific exhibition about synthetic biology in Harbin’s Science Center. The theme of the exhibition is how synthetic biology improves our life, aiming to popularize the knowledge and application of synthetic biology in social life, history of IGEM foundation and introductions of our project. In the scientific experience section, visitors can obtain latest information about IGEM projects on posters and QR code. We thank Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Bio-engineering Co. Ltd for great cooperation to achieve such a successful exhibition. 
Meetups
Team construction
In Jan, 2015, the life science college firstly held an examination to select the IGEM pre-members of NEAU-Harbin-2015. In order to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology and to attract new members for the 2015 IGME team, a symposium on synthetic biology and IGEM was organized, in which the IGEM pre-members gave lectures to introduce synthetic biology and previous IGEM projects. A series of  academic lectures were launched during the first few weeks. and then pre-members of NEAU-Harbin(2015) gave an introduction lecture about synthetic biology and IGEM. About 30 students participated in the lecture. In order for students to get a"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part"

The Making of a T7 Promoter Variant
Gene-Specific PCR
The first PCR that is used to build a full T7 promoter variant is called a ""gene-specific"" PCR. The primers are chosen so as to add a ribosome-binding site (rbs) upstream of the reporter gene (here RFP or Lysis) and a terminator downstream of the gene. It is in effect a typical PCR.
Extension PCR: Part I
The PCR product from the gene-specific PCR becomes the DNA template for the second PCR, which is oftentimes called the ""Extension PCR"". To find out more about the protocol for this PCR, click here . This PCR adds the T7 promoter (or some variant thereof).
Extension PCR: Part II
In the second phase of the Extension PCR, Gibson overhangs are added to the endpieces of the PCR product of the previous Extension PCR. These Gibson overhangs will allow for the Gibson Assembly of this promoter construct into a plasmid.

Site directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™)
Site directed mutagenesis was used to remove internal restriction sites from genes. The method relies on PCR using primers containing a single nucleotide mutation, which maintains the amino acid sequence and has specificity 15 bp up- and downstream of the target nucleotide. Herculase II polymerase was used in PCR reactions to amplify the target plasmid containing the mutation. PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme DpnI to remove any methylated DNA leaving only the PCR product.

The lambda phage
The temperate bacteriophage lambda found to infect E. coli, is the best-studied phage with regard to phage structure and regulation. Once lambda infects a cell, it can chose to either follow the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle described in Figure 1.
Figure 1: The two distinct development pathways of a prophage life cycle [wikipedia].
In the lytic pathway the phage uses the bacterial molecular machinery to make many viral copies for infection of other cells before lysing the host bacterium. In contrast to the lytic pathway, the phage integrates its DNA into the bacterial genome in the lysogenic pathway. The lysogenic state is very stable, which means that the prophage can be replicated along with the bacterial genome for generations.
Despite the stability of the lysogenic state, the lytic state is readily induced when the bacteria are irradiated with ultraviolet light.
The organization of the phage chromosome is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Schematic representation of the genome of the bacteriophage lambda [wikipedia].
The Lysogenic Pathway
The rightward promoter/operator region in lambda prophages forms a switch with the two genes cro and cI under mutually exclusive expression in the lambdoid phage.
This regulatory region consists of the promoters pRM and pR and the three sub-operator sites, OR1, OR2 and OR3, in-between the promoter. The interesting feature about these two promoters is that they are orientated in a back-to-back fashion and are also called divergent or bidirectional promoters. The sub-operator sites are shared regulatory regions that influence the expression of two oppositely oriented genes. This type of promoter arrangement is common in prokaryotes and is also found in humans and other higher species. The pR promoter is very strong and"

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Meetup_-_-_TEXT.html," a debate about biosafety, and filmed a short video of iGEM team presentation on biosafety for each project. This encouraged all teams to think about safety considerations in their project and allowed us to discuss general safety issues such as containing Genetically Modified Organisms and ensuring that they do not become out of our control.
Afterwards, we had a discussion about Paris Pasteur's project and answered their survey in order to talk about the pollution due to the plastic and help them with their project.
We would like to thank again all of the teams which came to our meetup, Cap Sciences for the loan of their place and for the videos. We also thank all the people who took pictures and videos this week-end and shared them with us.
Collaboration
Paris- Saclay
When talking with Paris-Saclay during our meetup we were very interested in their project this year which is concerned about safety. Safety in our project is not a particular problem since we are using our genetically modified organisms for production and all cells are destroyed during Curdlan purification. However, when thinking about alternatives where our bacteria would be directly applied on grapevine leaves, these safety issues are extremely important. We spent some time with them during the meetup and afterwards thinking about Safety of our project.
Oxford
In collaboration of IGEM oxford Team we managed to do a toxicity assay of Curldan as we want to use it in vineyards.  Our lab does not have the required material to do so and this would help complete our project. So we sent them a sample of our produced Curdlan so they could do tests on it.
They decided to test curdlan toxicity on two Bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas putida. They choose these bacteria because these two species are very common in the environment  so  they believe these bacteria represent a good marker for an eventual environmental toxicity. Oxford Wiki
Methods and Materials
Single colonies of wild-type Rhodobacter sphaeroides WS8N and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were grown in SUX media and Lysogeny Broth respectively overnight to stationary  phase at 30°C with orbital shaking at 225 rpm. 1% w/v curdlan in NaOH was made by adding 0.1g of solid curdlan to 10mL of 0.5M NaOH  and warming the mixture at 55°C with regular vigorous shaking for 15 minutes to achieve complete dissolution. 100µL of stationary culture was added to 100µL of cur"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"binant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

confirmation with 2xYFP tags
In order to confirm that the miraculin and brazzein are able to be expressed in E. Coli we attached a 2xYFP tag sequence to both the N- and C-terminus of each protein.  The proteins were placed under an IPTG-expressible promoter and used spectrophotometry to determine the level of YFP fluorescence against a baseline, untagged protein.  Figure 1 shows relative-fluorescence at times post induction.  In all circumstances the levels of YFP-fluorescence increased.

Figure 1. Induced expression of YFP-tagged Miraculin and Brazzein in E. Coli Figure 1 (A) through (D) are normalized plots of miraculin and brazzein YFP-fused constructs expressed in E. Coli. 2xYFP tags were attached to either the N- or C- terminus to ensure that folding was not hindered.  In all cases relative YFP fluorescence had appreciably increased after 120 minutes as compared to the non-induced E. Coli
confirmation by western blot
A western blot assay was performed to check for E. Coli expression of miraculin and brazzein.  Proteins tagged at either the N- or C- terminus were placed under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter.  In the miraculin assay, no protein expression was seen.  It is possible that the protein does not express well in E. Coli, or that the plant-specific codon optimization of the proteins resulted in reduced expressibility.  Brazzein, specifically C-terminus tagged brazzein was seen to be highly expressed in E. Coli.

What we aim to do
Though our project aims to realise a lot                             in a short period of time, we have objectives
that would develop further our                             project Quantifly :
cost effectiveness
Also, we aim to develop metabolic pathways in order to add a degradation ability to the                                 cell in complement of detecting and measuring pollutant levels in the air.
unique ideas
Last but not least, we want to popularize even more synthetic biology by participating in                                 other science conferences during all the year 2016.
reliability
We wish to compare our measurement results with already existing results gathered with                                 different methods, in order to evaluate our biosensor efficiency.
customer relationship
We want to optimize our bacteria by                                 enhancing the bioluminescence signal emitted by the cell.

In this section, our aim is synthesize the TlpB protein in our E.coli for to E.coli can penetrate to the stomach mucus layer, which is our pathogenic bacteria, H.pylori, resides.
For enhance the production of our protein TIpB, we aim to assemble our TIpB gene with T7 promoter which is a fast and strong promoter during we design our parts.
For controlling the system, we decided to add a Lac Operator, which is LacI protein can bind, between TIpB gene sequence and promoter. We searched for a expression vector that include Lac Operon and we found that peT45-b has the properties we want and we decided to use that vector.
When we order our genes we added RFC10 prefix site to 3’ end and RFC10 suffix site to the 5’ end of TlpB gene and also we added BamHI and XhoI restriction site sequence on the Pet45-b for cloning.
We planed to cloning TlpB gene that we ordered as described above to the Pet45-b vector with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes.
When this cloning achieved succesfully, there will be a construct that with order T7 Promoter-Lac Operon (LacO)- HisTag-TlpB and also there are LacI constructive promoter and LacI protein sequence ,in front of"

STAT's Promoter
STAT1 homodimers are involved in type II interferon signalling, and binds to the GAS (Interferon-Gamma Activated Sequence) promoter to induce expression of ISG (Interferon Stimulated Genes).  In type I interferon signaling, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer combines with IRF9 (Interferon Response Factor) to form ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor), which binds to the ISRE (Interferon Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce ISG expression.

Tokyo-NoKoGen,2012,Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen#Project#lux operon_-_-_TEXT.html," Lux+GFP at 512 nm (Figure.b). We thought that the shift of emitting light wavelength was caused by BRET. After 1 hour culture, peak could not be observed at 512 nm, and we performed the culture in dark condition. So it is possible to occur that GFP absorbes the lux luminescence and emits fluorescence.
[Figure.b]
3.lux+YFP
We could not observe the yellow light from lux+YFP construct (Figure.c). We assumed that the yellow shift didn’t occur due to difference of luminous bacteria strain (YFP is from Vivrio fischeri.).
[Figure.c]
4.Comparing to lux from BioBrick part(Cambridge 2010, BBa_K325909)
We also evaluated the difference of the light emission property between our cloned lux operon and lux operon from BioBrick part(BBa_K325909) (Figure.d). Sequentially, it was revealed that our lux and Cambridge lux had almost same maximal absorption peak and the light intensity.

Rib operon
P. phosphoreum has rib operon(ribEBHA) downstream of luxG. Their gene productshave been identified as riboflavin synthase(RibE), DHBP synthase(RibB), lumazine synthase(RibH) and GTP cyclohydrolaseII(RibA).
Riboflavin is the key substrate for lux operon because riboflavin is the precursor of riboflavin 5'- monophosphate (FMN). FMNH2 is the substrate for emitting light. Synthesis of riboflavin is important to enhance the luminescent. Instead of rib operon from P. phosphoreum, we cloned the rib genes from E. coli BL21(DE3) and constructed rib operon biobrick.
Method
Construction of biobrick
We cloned ribA, ribB, ribC, ribF, and ribDH from E.coli BL21(DE3).
Original rib genes, ribA and ribDH, have illegal restriction site in each genes.
In order to remove restriction site, we chose inverse extension PCR method.
After sequencing of each gene, we started to construct rib operon. First, ribosome binding site (RBS) was ligated with each gene. Second, each genes are ligated. Finally, promoter and double terminator were ligated."
