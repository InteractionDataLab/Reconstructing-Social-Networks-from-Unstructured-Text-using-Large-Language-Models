Overview
The team planned and implemented several events concerning the application and field of our project.  We focused on fields including transgenesis and genetic therapy, where TALE has been widely used as gene editing tool.  Two of our teammates attended as guest lecturers a conference held for leaders in sci-tech education of High school and elementary level students in Beijing.  Aside from publicity among high school students and educators, we held two seminars on synthetic biology and systems biology in Tsinghua University. Through heated discussions of the fields and our project itself, we managed to raise public awareness of novel advance in such interdisciplinary subjects.  Multiple ethics issues were proposed during the seminars considering current topics in synthetic biology.  We also conducted questionnaire survey on these issues later on. Results revealed important information and resolution on such. Ethics problems in genetic editing are researched and discussed in relevant pages.

Lecture
On Sep. 9th, Xu Chumeng and Liu Huarui gave a lecture on our project and current topics in synthetic biology as part of the conference for leaders in sci-tech education of High school and elementary school students in Beijing.  Teachers, high school students and researchers on Bioinformatics, Heredity, Molecular Biology and Botany gathered in Beijing No.8 Middle School aiming at enacting educational plans on science and technology research for high school and elementary level students.
After presenting our project, Chumeng, as an alumna of Beijing No.8 Middle School, shared her experience on high school sci-tech research experience and how it had led to synthetic biology research in Tsinghua.  We received a lot of useful insights on our projects from attending researchers.  An overview on the current topics in synthetic biology and its applications was delivered by our two teammates.  We found that interdisciplinary subjects like synthetic biology still lack awareness among students below collegiate level and their educators.  The high school students present at the conference showed keen interest in the topics, even raised a"

Therefore, there might be an annealing temp. problem. Also, we are going to look at the primers that were made to make sure they are good and it's not a primer problem.   We also did a co-transformation of the mini-prepped HSP+input backbone with the GFP+pBR322 into the ultra competent cells. We followed the transformation protocol. We added 1 uL of each plasmid to 50 uL of the ultra competent cells and had them sit on ice for a half hour then heat shocked for 30 seconds in 42 C water bath and added 900 uL of SOC to each tube and let them incubate on a shaker platform for an hour and then plated 200 uL of each on a chlor-amp plate and put it in the incubator overnight.
7/15/14: (Devora)   Today we checked on our co-transformations and we had a bunch of colonies! ! ! Yay.  We then colony PCR'ed colonies 2-5 on the plate of pBad promoter that we had along with a GFP, UV, and HSP. This was put into the new OpenPCR machine, and the settings that were used are below:                 temp time   initial step: 95  30  anneal: 56  30  extention: 72  30  final hold: 4  final step: 72  420  *****THIS PCR RAN GREAT!!! THE SETTING HERE WERE GOOD FOR PBAD-GFP SIZES!******  We ran a gel to check the PCR'ed colonies mentioned above. All of the PCR'ed products came out clean without a band. One gel had the UV, HSP of the T-team's one colony on their plate, and two GFP's. The other had the last two GFP's and the last 5 wells were PBad, with the first of the pBad wells being a negative control (because we put in the wrong primers).
7/17/14:  Ran PCR of HSP+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 to amplify the input and output backbones. Trying HSP because UV didn't work, and making more GFP. We used 5uL 1000x dilution of plasmid, 2.5uL water, 2.5uL forward primer, 2.5uL reverse primer, and "

King Membrane Energy Technology Inc.
Fig 5. Picture of KME interview
Sewage problem is a critical issue for every kind of bioreactor and ferment, especially for bioreactor containing genetic modified organism, which must absolutely prevent the organism leaking out and polluting the environment. After designing a bioreactor, we were eager to build up a sewage treatment system.
Process
On October 12, we visited the King Membrane  Energy Technology company (KME),                                          which is specialized in producing the Membrane Bio-reactor system.                                          Different from traditional Sequencing Batch Reactor Activated Sludge Process,                                          the system they use hollow filter membrane that can filter most of bacteria.
Feedback
This technique minimized the area required for sewage treatment,                                          allowed us to concentrate the medium before extracting bioproducts,                                          and recycled the water after filtering. After discussing with Dr. Kao, the manager of the company,                                          we improved our device with the MBR system.                                          This improvement made us one step closer to a company and eco-friendly bioreactor system.

Business Model
The business model describes how an organization creates,                                          delivers, and captures value in an economic, social, cultural, or other environment.                                          Therefore, we introduce this business model as the basis for assessing the integrity and                                          effectiveness of our ideas to work with our industry and even national research.                                         First, we ask questions about this, and beyond the solution,                                          we also explain why we chose this question. Second, we analyze future developments, including the advantages of using this approach.                                          Furthermore, we introduce our plan to many relevant departments and discuss with the national research.                                          We hope that this plan can be used to promote this plan in the future.
Target issue
More and more people are now paying attention to the impact of CO2.                                          The trend of environmental degradation is gradually increasing.                                          Scientist and national worldwide contribute to capture those excessive CO2.                                          However, how to reduce carbon and use it have become a major problem today.                                          Challenges against carbon process are complicate. Except the technique and implement problem,                                          social acceptability and policy are aother key factors about carbon process technology.
In general, planting is a method of carbon process,                                          and green algae is currently being one of carbon utilization.                                          This year, we hope to combine synthetic biology with the most advanced technologies.                                          We want to draw people's attention to the environment and reuse these environmentally                                          stimulating projects.

We did a restriction enzyme digestion with the colonies we picked up yesterday to see whether the mutation plasmid has been duplicated. 6 out of all 8 samples are successful.
8.22.2012
At first, we digested the plasmid with Not I and Afl II. Then we did an electrophoresis and purified the gel to get the production – plasmid cut by enzymes. After that, we connected the GFP, RFP, and plasmid together under 16℃ environment.

We transformed the new plasmid into the body of E.coli and waited the bacteria to grow. Since we don’t have such type of experience, a teacher showed us the process before we started.
8.24.2012
Since it might be difficult to connect three fragments together at the same time, we decided to try connecting GFP and the plasmid at first, then connecting the product with RFP.
To start this new scheme, we have to digest the plasmid again but with different restriction enzymes. We used Spe I and Afl II to cut the plasmid.
Because we run out of GFP and RFP, we did the PCR again to get more.
The E.coli which contains our new plasmid – all 3 fragments connected – grows well. We did a bacterial colony PCR, using the RFP’s upstream primer and GFP’s downstream primer, to check whether the connection is successful. If the amplification of RFP and GFP is successful, we can come to a conclusion that we finally build the right vector we want!

Lab strain deficiencies are a selection disadvantage, like             lower fitness or lower survivability. On the other hand, the DNA is beneficial for fitter bacteria if transferred.             However, we took arrangements to prevent the uncontrolled release, especially the working steps of our student             team members had been carefully examined. Here we paid special attention that all the work was performed with regards to             the lab safety regulations. If you are interested in more details, you can check out the video here.
Risk of our Project
For our project we used E. coli BL21 DE3 Gold, XL1-blue, TOP10 and DH5α strains. These common lab strains provide no risk for the general             public. The antibiotic resistances we used were spectinomycin, kanamycin and chloramphenicol. These are common             markers that have been used for many years in molecular biology practice and are regarded as safe. Their use in medicine             is not relevant anymore, since they have been substituted by more efficient and safe antibiotics with less side             effects. Horizontal gene transfer, HGT, could lead to some problems, but that concerns all iGEM teams and synthetic             biology projects and is not unique to our work. In our case, we used fluorescence proteins and we cannot imagine             a scenario, in which fluorescence proteins help bacteria to survive or provide a selective advantage. Therefore,             HGT is not a high risk.
Misuse
Since we are dealing with a new application, we cannot accurately determine what our project will evolve to in the future.             Connecting bacteria to a computer is a completely new way of data exchange, but due to long expression times of             fluorescent proteins, it is very unlikely that this interaction might be used for risky actions. There might             be many applications, but we cannot imagine a hazardous one. The potential for the misuse of the biobrick database             is an inherent problem not only for iGEM, but also for all the DIY biology projects and the biohacker movement. To conclude, all team             members and all the people who supported us are aware that the usage of GMOs always implies certain risks for us humans and the environment, but risks can be limited by following the established safety guidelines."
Washington,2009,Team:Washington-Software#Notebook#Model C_-_-_TEXT.html," work is software based, and will not increase the cost of the robot, if we provide it to the user community in the form of open-sourced programs. This project also provides an open framework, where other iGEMers can extend our current functionality and collaborate with us to further develop the user interface too. Hence, in subsequent years, the cost of the project will remain almost constant at $700, but it will have better and better software support.

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," of a Two-switch System
We simulated the two-switch system with varying Int1 and RDF1 promoter strengths. We used 50 switches in the simulations, and kept track of the percentage of switches that had flipped from PB to RL state at the system’s steady state for each of the two switches. The strength of the switch 1 promoter was chosen such that the sum of expression from all the switch 1 promoters was equal to the expression from the Int1 promoter. This way, similar amounts of integrase are in the system for both switches.  Figure 5 displays a two-switch system using two PhiC31-style switches. We selected the PhiC31-style switch because it offers control over switching at a wider range of parameter values than the Bxb1-style switch.
We also ran the simulations with different switch copy numbers, different switch 1 promoter strengths, and different combinations of switch 1 and switch 2 styles, and obtained qualitatively similar results.
Figure 5. Percentages of promoters flipped for a) Switch 1 and b) Switch 2 in a two-switch system. Both switches were PhiC31-style in this case.
We see that the ranges of Int1 and RDF1 promoter strengths corresponding to incomplete switch flipping (the colours between blue and red in Figure 5) are narrower for switch 2 (Figure 5b) than for switch 1 (Figure 5a). This simulation suggests that controlling one switch with another helps make a multi-switch system more switch-like, with flipping of all copies at once.
To investigate the effects of stochastic processes, we implemented our differential equations model for the two-switch system stochastically using the Gillespie algorithm and varied Int and RDF promoter strengths. The shape of the parameter regions where each switch flipped switches flipped were qualitatively similar to those found in the continuous model (Figure 7).
Figure 7. Percentages of promoters flipped for a) Switch 1 and b) Switch 2 in a two-switch system simulated stocahstically. Both switches were PhiC31-style in this case.
We note a clear reduction in the variability of the percentage of switches flipped in switch 2 compared to switch 1. By controlling switch 2 with switch 1, we have reduced the stochastic nature of switch 2 to give it more robust switch-like behavior. This complements the finding using the continuous model, which showed that a two-switch system narrowed the parameter range corresponding to partial flipping of switch 2.
Conclusions
Our goal is to use modelling to inform design decisions in a model-based design approach.  The following points are relevant"

Emily and Peter transformed two hns-mutant strains (black and red) with G28 and of Top10 with CD and EG from Mr Gene. In case that didn't work, we should have plenty of DNA left in the tube they sent us. I'll check in on those tomorrow. The Top10 cells are plated on kanamycin plates. If the transformation works, we can roll out the Gibson assembly. Assemblies to do are:
CD into Psb1C3 EG into Psb1C3 CD+EG into Psb1C3 pBad+CD+EG into Psb1C3
Since the hns-mutants are temperature sensitive, and the Lux operon is as well, we left the plates out on the bench. I used big plates with 300µl of transformed cells to increase the chances of getting some working colonies.
Saturday 9th October
Peter went in to check on the transformation plates today, the CD and EG transformants grew up massively, i.e. hundreds of cultures. There are still a couple of singles, so we should be fine (unless our Soc is contaminated again).
The hns mutants (termed R28 and K28, if only to abuse Will's naming system) don't show any colonies yet, but that was to be expected. 20°C and all that.
Sunday 10th October
Peter set on liquid colonies of Top10 G28, R28, K28 (the hns mutants) pBad+PP+YFP and pBad+YFP. All of these grew up, but they were rather thin (because shaking incubator < rotation incubator and all the cells sedimented). He left them to grow a bit more and will go and take them out of the incubator tonight.
There were lots and lots of colonies on the hns-mutant plates, so many to make us doubt our SOC, so Peter plated some out and left the bottle on the bench, but nothing grew over night, so we're probably fine. The K28 plate was grown over quite densely, so it was put in the fridge yesterday. Peter checked both plates for glowth yesterday and couldn't see anything, but today the R28 plate (a hns knockout) glowed quite well, so yay!
everything is in the fridge now.
Tuesday 12th October
Peter went into the Plants lab and looked at the results of the plate reader. All the strains seem to be growing fine, with quite consistent ODs, Luminescence has fallen off in all of them by"

Let v travel along the KD Tree in a way like binary search , we can end up with K(in our case , K is set to be 5) most similar key words(KNN) to the current word k.
Make Recommendation
We have calculated the affiliation between key words and parts which shall be used to guide our final recommendation. Let pi denotes the connection between the ithe part and the current word k , we calculate pi by formula $$p_i=\sum^K_{n=1}\frac{\text{Affiliation}(w_n,p_i)}{\text{distance}(w_n,k)+\text{bias}}$$
where \( \{w_n|n=1,2,...,K\}\) denotes the k most similar key words
Affiliation(wn, pi)denotes the connection between wi and the ith part and distance(wi, k) denotes the the Euclidean distance between the normalized word vectors of wn and word k.
After the computation of \(\{p_i|i=1,2,...,m\}\), we use heap sort algorithm to get R highest pi and recommend to the users the corresponding parts.Besides, we use exactly the same strategy to make recommendation of related projects to the users. For simplicity, we ignore the details here.
Simulation for General Genetic Circuits
Introduction
The users of S-Din are all active and innovative researchers in Synthetic Biology, who come up with many interesting and new ideas in a wide range of fields. Our software helps them achieve their creative goals by allowing them to combine various genetic parts together to form brand-new genetic circuits that may never exist before. To help the researchers have a deeper understanding of how the genetic system that they created works, we construct an ODE system to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the genetic system mathematically. The main challenge of simulation is the uncertainty of genetic circuits since the users can construct them arbitrarily. Therefore, we build a rather general model capable of simulating various genetic circuits.
Model
The interaction among the substances in genetic circuits can be characterized by a n * n relation matrix R, where n is number of substances. The entry in row i and column j has 3 possible values for 3 possible relations, i.e. $$           R_{i,j}=           \begin{cases}           1 & \text{if $i$ promotes $j$} \\           -1 & \text{if $i$ inhibits $j$} \\           0 & \text{No effect}           \end"

We were able         to receive instant feedbacks from them regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified         organisms. With more than 75 participants in the survey, 58% claimed to have knowledge about GMOs. Within this group         of participants, 63% knows that genes inside the organism is changed, while an equal percentage of participants also         think that GMOs greatly affects the ecosystem. 54% of the people voiced GMO will negatively affect human health.
However, these responses contradicts to our research findings prior to the events. There is no valid proof that GM         food is harmful to human health. Our team realized that this misconceptions and bias can be an important barrier         to the advancement of synthetic biology, so we had elaborated more on this issue through our project introduction         and written articles about synthetic biology which we had posted on a local science FaceBook page.
Using the same set of questionnaire, we also received feedbacks on opinions about our project, which some parents were         interested and spent time discussing with us at our booth.
From these feedbacks, we were able to draft out an idea on how our future project would look like. We sought to interview         with Prof. Terrence Lau who is knowledgeable about current GMOs situation in Hong Kong. It is also a surprise that         GMO papaya is actually very common in Hong Kong, while our survey conveys that people know GMOs in a broad sense,         but not the GMOs particularly grown in their country.
Throughout the interview, we sparked another similar idea that we can also tackle, which is the Genetic Containment         Strategy, where we also care about preventing accidental release of the genetically engineered organisms, and we         sought more in-depth detail about how to improve our construct to Prof. Matthew Bennett.

Outreach strategy
The IOD band presents a new approach to diagnostics and diagnostic engineering. So at Team Czech Republic we addressed engineers and medical experts to discuss the application and the novel engineering approach. In addition, Czech Republic teamed up with Chalmers Gothenburg to conduct a multinational survey on the public perception of Synthetic Biology.
Engineering
Since a lot of ideas behind IODs were built on the fundamentals of classical engineering, we wanted to present the concept of our project (from an engineering point-of-view) to young engineers and receive their feedback. We presented our project and synthetic biology in general at a lecture of the Introduction to Cybernetics class led by Prof. Ing. Miloš Schlegel CSc. After giving a 30-minute lecture on synthetic biology, we introduced our project. The response was surprisingly positive. Not only we were asked several to-the-point questions, but some of the students even showed a deeper interest in synthetic biology and individually contacted us after the talk.
Medicine
In order to get a professional opinion on our project and to learn more about cancer and CTCs, we conducted an interview with two cancer specialists, Mgr. Pavel Pitule, Ph.D. and Mgr. Pavel Ostašov, Ph.D. The interview took place at the Biomedical Center of Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen. After introducing our project idea we discussed some particularly interesting points. This interview was not only helpful and enriching but also led to an agreement to collaborate with the Laboratory of Tumor Biology in the near future.
Key outputs
Most engineers are eager to see the immediate reaction of the system. Following the lectures such as the one for young engineers, we designed IODs as a fast diagnostic test. Also, the preliminary process is quick thanks to the clone-free preparation of required IODs.
Questions we received during the lecture from students and teachers concerning current cancer diagnostics, their price, and efficiency were afterwards discussed with cancer specialists in the interview .

Key outputs
We were recommended to use a color change instead of the agglutination as an indicator of CTCs' presence. As a result, a group of experiments from module"

For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission. But for adult patients, it is still hard to observe this effect. Actually, intestinal flora is in large quantities and very complicated. Therapeutic mechanism of supplementary micro ecological preparation (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, etc.) is not clear and sometimes it is hard to determine the clinical effects.
A2: Intestinal microecology is one of the factor causing inflammatory bowel disease. Treating inflammatory bowel disease completely through changing intestinal microecology still have a long way to go. For example, fecal bacteria transplantation is effective only in a few patients. (But for the inflammatory bowel disease with the concurrency of infection of clostridium, it is the first-line therapy.) Personally, treating inflammatory bowel disease in the direction of intestinal microecology is very promising.
Survey
This survey consists of three major parts: intestinal diseases, gut flora and synthetic biology. As people know life-related diseases, i.e. intestinal tract diseases, better than merely intestinal diseases, the survey is needed to start from a boarder aspect and be narrowed to intestinal diseases.
363 shares of answers are received, with 81.82% of which have no idea about iGEM. People above 40 years old contribute to 46.55% of all answers and people from 26~40 take up 15.43%. People below 26 account for 15.43%. Participants come from all walks of life, with only 36.36% of them being students.
In the first part we investigated people’s cognition in intestinal diseases. People believe that cancer and AIDS are the most severe diseases. Heart attack ranked the third, followed by Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s, then the pneumonia. Intestinal tract diseases are among the least severe common diseases, as expected. However, 84.3% of participants have witnessed the suffering of intestinal tract diseases, with the cost of treatment covers a long range. 8.82% cost is below ¥100, 29.41% ¥100~500, 24.18% ¥500~1000 and 23.2% beyond ¥2000 . Only 6.21% participants claim that 1~2 days are needed to cure the disease, while different people suffer from various intestinal tract diseases, with the time required to cure ranging from days to more than half a year. Furthermore, 50% people get the diseases once or twice, while the rest suffer more often. Among all the intestinal tract"

Results
This questionnaire shows three remarkable results.
First, though there are few people who try not to get genetically modified foods, a lot of people feel anxious about them. This is a paradox. Next, synthetic biology (e.g. genetically modifying) is not common among people. Finally, people have an image about flies as ‘Dirty’ and ‘Harmful’ and about leukemia, they think it is scary. Moreover, the interest thing about treatment is that ‘’ Curable’ and ‘Incurable’ account for half and half.

JOINN
In mid-october, our experiment has been basically completed. And we have completed the goals which we want to achieve before. We went to JOINN Laboratories, Inc. (one of the most famous biotech company in China) to communicate with our project. We had a clearer picture of the value of our project. They were interested in our project very much, and they gave us much advice about targeting the market.
Among these proposals from JOINN Laboratories, Inc., the followings are the more important ones:
(1) With the improvement of the life quality, people’s pursuit of health is getting higher and higher. People's appetite for food is mainly concerned with the followings:
① low calorie
② good taste
③ high sweetness
④ a sense of happiness
So on the basis of detecting the sweetness of sweet substances，we should think about taste and calorie of sweetness, which is important for our product to enter the market.
(2) Our biometric method involves the growth of the fungus, which may cause people to think about safety and health, so we should pack our items and ensure that the strain are safe and harmless.
(3) Before entering the market, we need to consider our project cost. Compared to the existing physical detection technology, our project cost shoule be an advantage.
ITCCC
In October, 2017, BIT-China was invited to take part in the the CGEM conference held by INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER. About 8 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.
Conclusion
In our human practice, we got the idea of the project. Through this idea, we attached this idea to synthetic biology step by step. Finally, we completed it. In this process, we first understood the importance of sweetness for food through the form of social surveys. And we realized that people prefer natural sweeteners. Later, in order to target market, we went to one of China's most famous food companies, COFCO, learned that if we want to enter our project idea to the market in the future, we still faced with many problems. Such as cost, function and the value of the project itself. In addition, We"

That was a great new experience and very educational. I loved working with all the team during the summer and had a lot of fun !
Except my passion for synthetic biology ;) I also like drawing and running.  I am very exiting about this Giant Jamboree and can’t wait to meet all the iGEMers.

Being a volunteer in the 2013 European Jamboree gave me the opportunity to discover the iGEM Competition and the motivation to be part of this year’s team. Although a 4th year student at INSA Lyon in Bioinformatics and Modeling, I spent all the summer in the lab. And I loved every single moment of it! My work consisted especially in developing protocols, test and improve them, but I took part, as the rest of us, in the long late cloning hours.  This project has been a great experience for me. It allowed me to get closer to the research field and showed me that this is the path I want to follow in the future.  I spend my free time doing all kind of sports: skiing, playing tennis, biking, but I also enjoy travelling, reading and watching movies.

Our discussion inspired us to approach art that interfaced with the future of synthetic biology as the mainstay of our human practices project.
We also visited the Fraunhofer Center for Manufacturing Innovation with BostonU_Hardware to inform our collaboration towards a microfluidic platform for RNA detection. They provided us with a wealth of knowledge about the considerations needed to translate a biological protocol to a microfluidic device at scale. More information about this collaboration can be found here .

Critically-Acclaimed JoVE Video
While making our cellfree transcription-translation system we used a modified version of the Noireaux Lab TX-TL protocol. Their JoVE video supplemented our understanding of the protocol. After utilizing the JoVE protocol video throughout the process of making our own TX-TL system, we realized the utility of step-by-step protocol videos that are easily accessible. In order to add to the JoVE video collection focused on the TX-TL system, we decided to enter the JoVE Film your research contest. In our video, we detail how we test our constructs in the TX-TL system and provide a theoretical understanding of how the TX-TL system works on a molecular level. Our video was ranked among the top 15 Critically Acclaimed, and our video was one of only two undergraduate produced videos to be recognized in the competition.

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Biosensor#PromoterCharacterization_-_-_TEXT.html," dose of Hg(II) to the wells and the plates was incubated in the shaker at 37℃during the interval of measurement. For both plates, the volume of LB medium with bacteria was 100uL per well. (a) GFP intensity was measured by Tecan Microplate Reader with excitation wavelength at 470nm and emission wavelength at 509nm. A black 96-well plate was used to minimize the interference of different well. (b) OD 600 was also measured by Tecan Microplate Reader in a transparent 96-well plate, since the depth of 100uL in the well did not reach 1 centimeter, the OD 600 value here was smaller than that was measured by a spectrophotometer.
As shown in Fig 3, the basal level of PTPCAD is relatively low. At the concentration of 5.0E-8 mol/L, the expression of GFP was observed. With longer induction time and higher concentration of Hg (II), the fluorescent intensity dramatically increased in a narrow concentration range (Fig. 3a). After the normalization by OD 600, the trend did not change obviously (figure not shown). Around 120min later, bacteria growth reached stationary phase (Fig 3-b) while GFP still accumulated rapidly (Fig 3-a). When the concentration of Hg(II) was higher than 1.0E-6 mol/uL, GFP expression level grew slower which might be explained by the saturation of MerR by Hg(II) and the cytotoxity of mercury.
Fig. 4  Dose response curve of MerR/PmerT to mercury in vivo. Note that the GFP expression intensity was induced from 10% to the maximum across a narrow range – 7 fold change in Hg (II) concentration. The basal level is low and the activation fold is dramatic. Also the metal reorganization specificity of MerR was demonstrated by the result that lead (II) could not activate significant GFP expression in vivo.
Besides, it is obvious that the MerR dependent regulation worked as a hypersensitive switch which represented negligible basal level expression of GFP, but induced from 10% to 90% of maximum in response across a range of Hg (II) concentration as narrow as 7-fold change (Fig 4). When the expression was fully induced, it was even below the threshold at which Hg (II) adversely affects the growth rate of bacterial cells. Actually, the hypersensitive switch behavior is postulated to arise from the unusual metal binding mechanism of Mer"

Week 9
Monday, July 16, 2012
Chris ran some mini-preps for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Victoria revved the results of her sequencing with Kait. Kevin worked with Hannah and taught her some HTML.
Tuesday, July 17, 2012
Hannah came in early to mini-prep cultures from her most recent CBAR for the Multiple Start Codon Project. These were subsequently digested to check for proper length. The result of this gel raised some questions. The colonies that she had grown up were all expression RFP. There were some colonies that were expressing GFP, but these were not cultured. Analysis of the gel and expression of RFP indicates that those plasmids did not contain all of the correct components. The GFP colonies probably would contain the entire construct. These were cultured to test this hypothesis. Victoria worked with Jyotsna to design primers to make some of the necessary parts for the Codon Optimization Project construct. Alexander is also beginning presentations for describing all of the projects. Kevin made some headway with the animation, which is till humming along. He also prepared materials for making new Chemically Competent cells.
Wednesday, July 18, 2012
Kevin updated some of the website and made some new chemically competent cells. Hannah and Kevin then transformed a number of fluorescent protein plasmids into these new cells. Hannah prepped her GFP presenting colonies from her CBAR. These were then digested to check them for length. The correct plasmids were prepped to be sent to sequencing. Victoria planned and designed primers for the Codon Optimization Project.
Thursday, July 19, 2012
Victoria ran a PCR of one of her components for the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah sent her plasmids to sequencing. Some of the plasmids that she transformed yesterday with Kevin were successful and presenting the correct fluorescent protein. Chris ran a gel on the construct for the Multidirectional Promoter Project. Kait and Victoria transformed some plasmids in preparation for another PCR to make a fragment for the Codon Optimization Project.
Friday, July 20, 2012
Victoria and Alexander completed a ligation to hopefully give them their desired construct. Kevin created a new run of chemically competent cells for the lab. Hannah ran a PCR of one of the components of her construct. This was to test to see if the deletion in the construct was caused by the PCR or if the problem resided"

Figure 4. The color spectrum built from chromoproteins and their tandem expression products.
As shown in the figure 4, we built a color spectrum using chromoproteins and their tandem expression products, which can show orange, pink, yellow and green colors. Furthermore, we can see that the color of the tandem expression products, is always between the colors of the two chromoproteins in the spectrum. That is to say, by applying the physical principles, we can easily mix the color we want using tandem expression of chromoproteins.
Figure 5. The position of the color of GFP and the mixed color by the tandem expression of amilCP and amilGFP in the spectrum
What’s more, using the tandem expression of amilCP and amilGFP, which are blue and yellow respectively, we mixed blue and yellow together to create green color, which rarely exist in colors of chromoproteins in iGEM registry. We use color picker and Photoshop to analyze and compare the color we got and that of amilGFP. The RGB value of our color is 184-209-108, while that of amilGFP is 178-191-138. That shows our color from the tandem expression is brighter and greener. Following the physical principles of mixing color and tandem expression rather than struggling to edit the molecular structure of the proteins, we provided a new approach to getting a new color with less cost of time and effort, which will largely enrich the part registry and generate more colors for scientific research and art creation.
Mixing Color by Applying RGB system!
We performed simple verification of our concept using tandem expression and got well-fitted results, but the bacteria tandem express several chromoproteins can only have one color at a time, so we tried to use more convenient methods, for example light, to control and change the color of the bacteria. We decided to use the RGB system, which was introduced above, to achieve light-controlled color mix in bacteria, because light sensors on the cell membrane can response differently to the lights with different wavelengths, thus producing different outputs accordingly. By changing the wavelengths of the lights, we can control the response of red-, green- and blue-light sensors and expression of mRFP, GFP and BFP. And for precise quantitative data, we chose fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP, mRFP) as our actuators to mix the colors."
UIOWA,2018,Team:UIOWA#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"a said printing was extremely expensive and that’s what was limiting for her project. For us, we considered doing a digital copy of our comic. I asked her if she would ever be interested in doing something of that sort with “Brains!”. She said she might someday be interested in doing that. Time management was also a big constraint for her. She said she was able to draw out the entire comic (the story being previously written) within two weeks. She does not recommend that to anyone, though, as it was a lot of work.
We played with the idea of leaving our comic in black and white (which is how it is currently presented). We liked the idea of people being able to color in the characters and the scenes. We also knew that playing with Photoshop in order to color the comics would be a feat within itself. Perhaps next year we’ll have a vibrant, colorful comic to present digitally!
Midwest iGEM Meetup in Michigan
Several of our team members, Jianwei Hu, Delaney Soule, Katie Amick and Kyleakin                         Helm attended the iGEM Midwest Meetup at Michigan State University in East Lansing,                         MI. Michigan State invited us to come and share an informal presentation about                         our project and our goals. The hope was to get some experience presenting in front                         of others, as well as meet other teams and discuss possible collaborations.
Michigan State hosted a great Meetup. It all started off with a tour of the                         University’s huge garden. The garden consists of plants of every kind you can                         imagine. Even the most dangerous ones. Although it was a brutally hot day, it                         was a very interesting tour. We got to learn about the differences between                         edible plants and poisonous plants, even got to hear some interesting stories                         about why the poisonous plants had to have a small fence around them (animals                         kept getting into them and were getting sick). We even were given a seeds for                         our very own plant to take home. No one from our team got the same plant                         either!
After the plant tour, we were given lunch catered by a local Thai                         restaurant. It was quite delicious and gave (some of us) something                         new to try. After lunch we moved into some fun icebreaker games.                         We split up into several groups with mixtures of people from different                         iGEM teams. One of our activities included a competition to see how                         fast and well we could wrap someone up like a mummy given a time limit.
We moved forward into giving presentations about our various projects.                         We received feedback from other teams, as well as"
EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html," scientific fraud and polemics, as they need to stay entertaining and relevant for their respective audience. “There is unfortunately no room  in mainstream media to talk about science and the actual process of research: how research works, where the money comes from, how papers are reviewed and published”, regrets Aurélie Coulon,  “Such subjects only show little interest to the Editor-In-Chief, except in the case of a great fraud. Therefore, the reader never gets the keys to understand shocking news. […] As a journalist, I try to describe the methodology and to explain the words again, those that look simple in particular. But all this is definitely not easy in a one-way communication context”.
Breaking the one-way interaction model
The remark about the existence of a “one-way communication context” leads to the issue of the interaction between scientists and the general public. Does such an interaction really exist? We asked the public about during our survey in Lausanne, and the answer was mostly negative. “Science should be discussed more often in the street, with the public” or “Scientists should make an effort” were recurring comments. Despite this perception of lack of communication, the media coverage of science in Western Switzerland seems adequate according to Prof. Didier Trono, researcher at EPFL and former Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences: “I believe that a lot of effort is made in order inform the general public”, he told us, furthermore underlining the large offer of media content available in the region, including daily national radio shows and weekly TV shows. Not only national media, but also private media such as newspapers regularly talk about science and related social concerns, he adds. “It can be better”, Prof. Trono conceded, “You should never miss an opportunity to go and inform the people. We could be more imaginative in the programs we design for schools and for the public in general”.
Despite the variety and abundance of information available for the general public, the overall feeling that interaction is insufficient remains .This may be due to the fact that information alone is not sufficient to create interaction, as it only goes one way. A less top-down way of informing the public could be found in more participative methods. The University of Lausanne for instance provides to the public an open-access lab called “L’Éprouvette” (French for “The Test Tube”) [2]. In parallel, they offer introductions to scientific research with both practical experiments and discussions about the issues around Science. Other examples are the DIY biohacker spaces that are burgeoning outside institutions, such as the “Hackuarium"

Florida Atlantic Team
The OwlGEMS team is a multidisciplinary group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students from Florida Atlantic University focused on using synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and machine learning to create innovative solutions for real world problems. This year, OwlGEMS is tackling the problem of counterfeit medicines, which lead to many deaths per year in the developing world and contribute to the development of drug resistance. The overall goal of this project is to create a biosensor that binds to artemisinin sensitively and specifically, while still being flexible enough to use without access to specialized training or equipment. We hope our machine learning protocol will be integral in the development of our biosensor, and that other groups will be able to use this protocol to validate their novel proteins.

Notre Dame Collegiate High School
When we were introduced to the Notre Dame Collegiate iGEM team at the aGEM (Alberta) competition, we were extremely impressed by the hard work that these younger students accomplished in their project. It was evident though that their access to necessary equipment was severely limited, to the point that they were required to build their own incubator. Touched by the heart put into their project, we offered for their team to visit our labs and conduct some of their final assays needed as a proof of concept for their team. Along with supporting their lab work, our resident graphic designer created a new logo for their project, which was used as a base model to teach their dry lab subgroup the basics of design. This logo was replicated by one of their team members, and is now used on their wiki. The members of the team we interacted with were all very appreciative and ready to learn. We hope to catch-up with their team at the jamboree and cheer them on.
University of Lethbridge
Prior to meeting at the North American iGEM Kickoff, we hoped to collaborate with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team in developing a proof of concept. Excitingly, our projects had a clear area of overlap, resulting in a mutually beneficial collaboration. We provided a gene editing system, which complimented Lethbridge’s delivery vector. Our entire system could be encapsulated in Lethbridge’s protein nanocompartments. As such, both of the projects could be tested together to provide compelling results. At the kickoff, we further discussed possibilities and logistics regarding this partnership. Both teams worked to prepare the delivery system and target DNA sequences, though results are still to come!
Queen's University
As a fellow Canadian team, we hoped for an ongoing relationship with the Queens Canada iGEM team .

Synthetic biology has begun an era of creation and development of new and better biological systems that, through engineering, seek to modify the natural behavior of living microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and yeasts to make them perform tasks that are designed to create high value-added products with useful applications in industry, improving at the same time the life quality of people.
iGEM ​​(International Genetically Engineered Machine) is a competition based on synthetic biology, presented by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), that allows professional students work in the use of biological parts to build systems operated in living cells. This year it is expected the participation of 165 teams and over 1,700 students from America, Africa, Asia and Europe, from prestigious universities such as Imperial College of London, Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, among others.
The number of Mexican universities participating in the contest is increasing each year; for this competition it is expected the participation of 5 teams:
Tec Monterrey - Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey,from Monterrey, Nuevo León, México.
UANL Mty. Mexico - School of Biological Sciences. Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León from Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. UNAM,
ITESM Mexico City - Institute of Applied Mathematics and Institute of Cellular Physiology at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM) in conjunction with the ITESM Campus Mexico.
ITESM_Mexico - Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Querétaro.
UNAM-Genomics_Mexico - Center for Genomic Sciences, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).
In order to meet the other 4 Mexican teams and talk about common problems that had arisen along the competition, we organized the ""First Micro Congress iGEM"", this June 3 and 4. This event was held at Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey.

Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry.
BBa_K1604031 . This functional BioBrick contains pncB a gene that encodes for the enzyme NAPRTase (nicotinic acid phosphorbosyl-transferase). It catalyzes the formation of nicotinate mono-nucleotide, a direct precursor of NAD, from NA (nicotinic acid).  We built it because we planned to increase electrons production by over-expressing pncB.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Results#Light system_-_-_TEXT.html,". For the blue       light system, we tested  CHO cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T).       As reporter the gene seap was transfected together with the genes required for      the implementation of the blue and red light inducible systems.       A SEAP-assay was performed after illumination. Measuring SEAP concentrations in the       supernatant lead us two two important conclusions: First, the blue light system works       more efficient than the red light system; second, the blue light system works better       with HEK-293T cells than with CHO cells (Fig. 1).
The plasmids required for the implementation of the light inducible SEAP expression are:
Red light system:
pKM022: SV40_PhyB-VP16_IRES_TetR-PIF16
constitutive expression of PhyB-VP16 and TetR-PIF6
pKM006: tetO-CMVmin_SEAP
SEAP under control of the tet operon
Blue light system:
pKM292: SV40_Gal4BD-LOV
constitutive expression of Gal4BD-LOV
pKM297: SV40_ePDZ-VP16
constitutive expression of ePDZ-VP16
pKM084: Gal4UAS-CMVmin_SEAP
SEAP under control of the Gal4 upstream activating sequence

Figure 1: Comparison of the blue light system in CHO cells and in HEK-293T cells and            comparison to the red light system in CHO cells.
To test the efficiency of the light system, SEAP expression after illumination was determined.           The SEAP assay was performed 24 hours after light exposure. Labjournal
Figure 2: Efficiency of the blue light system using different time intervals of illumination.
To test the efficiency of the light system, SEAP expression after illumination was determined.           The SEAP assay was performed 24 hours after light exposure. Cells were incubated with           blue light for 1 hour, 2.5 hours and 5 hours. Labjournal
The blue light system is effective in activating the reporter SEAP which was introduced        into the cells before illumination by transfections. As we know       that the duration of illuminating the system with blue light (452 nm) is critical       for its efficiency, we tested various time intervals for illumination. Our results       indicate that five hours of illumination lead to the highest level of SEAP expression (Fig. 2).

This collaboration combined both teams’ detecting projects. We exchanged our hardware design, principle, commercial value, strategies so can make both projects more compatible. In the following paragraph, we will briefly show the function and mechanism of our nitrate sensor.
[ Figure. 1.4-2 ] Structure of nitrate sensor based on fluorescence.
． Sensor design
We use a 450nm laser to excite our E. coli. Then, E. coli. will emit 510 nm green light and the green light will be received by the light sensor. By analyzing different fluorescence intensity. We will get concentration value of nitrate in the water..
． Mechanism
1. The water will enter the boat and flow through two solenoid valves.
2. With the specific controlling, we can gather quantitative water for nitrate sensing.
3. The sample of water will react with our E. coli in a tube fixed in a light absorber.
4. The laser will excite the E. coli, and the E. coli will emit the fluorescence.
5. The fluorescence will be received by a light sensor.
6. The Arduino will process the fluorescence we collected and send the data to server.
7. Our server will calculate fluorescence into the concentration of nitrate in the water.

They provided a method they had designed in which enzymes would be produced, packaged and released in vesicles in combination with “Tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins” (TDPs)  stabilize enzymes just with a simple drying step rendering a functional enzyme upon subsequent rehydration. However, after a closer look to the integration of TU Delft’s approach, we reported some of our concerns about it: vesicles, could affect our  degradation ability, as  the volume might not be great enough as to carry enough ER-alpha or GFP and the variability in a number"

Result Page for Cell Line Construction
Transfecting the cell line with gRNA-encoding plasmid
Cas9 uses gRNA, a 23nt short RNA fragment which binds to its complementary target and 'guide' Cas9 to cut the target DNA. We first check the efficiency of this system. We construct a plasmid based on Zhang Feng Lab’s pX330 plasmid that encodes a chimeric guide RNA scaffold and mCherry reporter gene followed by a NLS (nucleus leading sequence). It also contains 0, 2, 5 or 7 repeats of UAS sequences which are necessary for the vehicle’s recognition and binding (See Future applications – A-B toxin based gRNA shuttle for details).
Figure 7. Constructed plasmid to express gRNA in host cells
The chimeric guide RNA scaffold is used to insert gRNA. We acquired the gRNA for EGFP from Wei Huang’s lab and put it into our constructed plasmid. Figure 8 shows the design of chimeric guide RNA scaffold (Cong et al., 2013).
Figure 8. Mechanism of gRNA insertion into pX330-derived plasmid backbone
In this way, with the ratio of reduced green fluorescence and the quantity of red fluorescence we can roughly obtain the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas system we created. And finally, we reconstruct the plasmid but this time with the gRNA targeting HIV and test its efficacy.
See how we design and construct our powerful gRNA-mCherry-UAS plasmids
Deliver gRNA plasmids by A-B toxin-based shuttle
CRISPR/Cas system needs two essential parts for normal function: Cas9 and gRNA. Traditional methods usually transfect the cell with Cas9 and gRNA together (Hu et al., 2014). However, this limits the usage of this system because HIV has high mutated rate, which needs to update gRNA. So we decided to use a flexible nucleic acid delivery system.  We choose a non-viral DNA delivery system which is based on a modified A-B toxin. The chimeric fusion protein mainly comprises 3 parts: target cell-specific binding domain, a translocation domain and a nucleic acid binding domain. The target cell-specific binding domain recognizes the EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors on the cell surface. The translocation domain enhances nucleic acid escape"

2. Analyze the relationship between the dsRNA length and RNAi efficiency through statistics
3. Fortunately, we found a special material bio-clay, which could storage dsRNA as shelters (more details in project design). We did control experiments to see the protective capacity of bio-clay and according to the experiments data got the conclusion.
Results
1. For a wider application scope, we synthesized RNAi data from different kinds of plants for determining a range of dsRNA length which is suitable for as much as possible species. Because weeds are much more complicated than model organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana and Triticum aestivum. As result shown, 21bp dsRNA is the minimum length to cause gene silence among most species.
Figure 1. dsRNA length affect RNAi efficiency in difference species
2. Based on the formula, a relatively stable curve shows that dsRNA stability change with their length.
Figure 2. dsRNA stability change with their length
At this curve, we took a second derivative to the curve :     \[ f(x)' = 0.0110x^{-0.5} \]     We found that max curvature of f(x)' is appear at 600bp around.
3. DsRNA storage situation in different medium
We dissolved dsRNA in bio-clay solution(particle diameter is 172nm) or in double-distilled water to make dsRNA final concentration 20ng/uL, and we put tubes under the normal condition in different intervals.
Finally we did an agarose gel electrophoresis respectively at the beginning (0 d), 5 days (5 d), 10 days (10 d), 17 days (17 d) and 21 days (21 d) to compare the dsRNA degradation.
Here is the figure put together.

Once we ran the PCR of our 11 chromoproteins+his-tag (minus DT because it didn't work) we ran it on a gel and performed a gel extraction of the one part we wanted which was amplified around 3000 base pairs. We did a gel extraction because we were not sure how specific our primers would be and wanted to only get our backbone+chromoprotein+his-tag
●
We also ran a PCR of the cellulose binding domains for each chromoprotein and performed a PCR extraction on these. After our PCR extraction we saw little to no DNA present via the nano drop so we could not perform our Gibson today. It looked like our sample may be contaminated with ethanol which would make the concentration look different than it actually is so we will test the concentration again after the weekend to see if ethanol has evaporated off and left us with cleaner results.
●
We ran a DT PCR so that we could re do the Gibson assembly of adding a his-tag again. We also ran a PCR of the meffRed backbone and ran these both on a gel for a gel extraction. On the gel there were no bands at around 2000 base pairs for meffRed or around 700 base pairs for DT so we will re do these PCRs on Monday to then Gibson and transform
●
We purified our 3 proteins we had prepared yestereday (MP, SP, DT) using nickel column purification and then placed the colored fractions together into snake skin dialysis tubing into 1X TBE buffer to sit over the weekend
Monday, 10/3
●
We took the 3 chromoproteins+his-tag purified proteins (MP, SP, DM) our of the dialysis tubing and placed them into 50 ml eppendorf tubes.
●
We ran a PCR of DT and meffRed which we then gel extracted. These will be used to re do the gibson and transformation and plating. If this works then we should see colored colonies of DT-his-tag on the plate and be able to sequence, lumio test, mini prep, and then protein extract and purify.

Another PCR was run of VV-his-tag because it did not work on Friday and we need it for our CBD Gibson"

    We mainly follow the formerly mentioned protocol of protein induction in Subtitle 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. And we used several different halogenated organics to test RdhANP’s ability of dehalogenation by HPLC done by professional technicians in Testing Center of Wuhan University.
6.Integration of hemAKK and xylA Promoter upstream of Operon hemAXCDBL
    In Introduction-B12, we`ve introduced the synthetic pathway of B12 along with heme and siroheme from glutamyl-tRNA to uroporphyrinogenⅢ. And regular biosynthetic enzyme engineering involves in introducing hemAKK instead of hemA and the xylose-inducible promoter PxylA into B. megaterium’s chromosome. This work can be achieved by formerly mentioned plasmid pHBintE.
7.Coexpression CBD and MAD
    In our hardware, we also designed a special membrane which is made of cellulose and has engineered B. megaterium attached to. Because when we took the cost of artificially synthesized membranes into account, we realized that there should be some substitution done here to make our hardware more available. In this way, we referred to one of the most well-known membrane in biology, cellulose membrane and used the surface display system constructed in 2016 Kyoto for reference. And we shall repeat their experiment in the following process.
8.Introduction of engineered B. megaterium into HMBR
    After finishing biosynthetic enzyme engineering in B. megaterium, we would come to the next stage of introduction of this engineered strain into HMBR. Several problems are encountered, for example, the livability of B. megaterium in organohalide-contained wastewater, cohabitation of B. megaterium and the other bacteria, biofilm formation on suspended carriers. We have consulted Prof. Mao Xuhui of SRES-WHU about these problems. He showed great interest in our project and promised that if we finished our engineering work, he would help us in applying our engineered strain into HMBR.
9.Detection and adjustment with Model
    In this experiment, we used 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (symbol as A) and 3,5-dibromo-2-hydroxybenzoicacid (symbol as B) to represent the"

Fuse, or Die: The Case for the MoClo Revolution
Synthetic biology exists more as a form of art than a reproducible, well-defined production chain. From laboratory to laboratory, the experiments vary in procedure, characterization, and yield. The main product of synthetic biology — engineered organisms, are available only to the highly-experienced researcher and are not without the costs of timely preparation and low product yield. Consequently, the lack of standardization across the field has impeded the product from ever reaching a wide industry audience. More recent engineering efforts in the assembly of gene circuits has provided a pathway to a modular view of genetic parts. Termed the Modular Cloning Assembly Method (MoClo), this novel single-pot reaction protocol is a time-efficient, two-enzyme system for DNA assembly (Weber et al., 2011) . Before MoClo can reach its full potential across research and industry interests, the synthetic biology community needs a standardized and well-characterized library of MoClo parts for Escherichia coli to enable protocol automation and informed device designing. The 2013 Boston University iGEM Team seeks to bridge this gap in the product development chain by building a standard library and characterizing the parts via flow cytometry. To further efforts to develop foundational advancements for synthetic biology, we are taking a multi-faceted approach and working at several aspects and levels of design automation by:
expanding a library of basic Level 0 MoClo parts by cloning from BioBrick parts and making new parts
building a library of composite Level 1 and 2 devices to characterize promoter-5' Untranslated Region combinations and demonstrate the library's usefulness
providing feedback on Clotho 2.0 software tools including the EugeneCAD language to a team of developers in the CIDAR Lab
working with the Wellesley Desyne team to develop an easy-to-use visualized programming language to wrap around Eugene
continuing the Datasheet project"
Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Project#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," resistance and your gene of interest can grow.
Our bricks will allow bacteria to grow in a cold environment. If the antibiotic resistance gene is replaced by one of our genes you can simply expose the medium or plate to the cold and only the bacteria that posses the cold resistance will grow.
This could be useful as alternative selecting method if you need a lot of different selection conditions, because it needs to contain different plasmids, or as new selection method because you do not want to use expensive antibiotics. Reasearch laboratoeries use a lot of antibiotics as selection method. An additional advantage of this method is that it eliminates some of the antibiotics that get flushed down the drain and end up in the environment.
iGEM teams
Growing bacteria under lower temperatures can potentially help a lot of other iGEM teams. This is most relevant to teams who have a project that intends to intorduce bacteria to inhospitable conditions. Here we present a selection of teams that caught our eye.
TU Delft 2010
The TU Delft 2010 team attempted to design an E.coli that was able to remove oil from the ocean after an oil spill. For their E.coli  to work optimally it was engineered to survive in saltwater since E.coli cannot normally cope with high salt concentrations. They did not, however, prepare their bacteria for the cold temperatures present in open water. Please note that their team did not intend to release their bacteria into the envornment. They imagined a large tank containing their bacteria to be punped full of contaminated water where it was rinsed, and then filtering out the bacteria. In their original design the saltwater would have to be warmed before the bacteria could efficiently perform their function, but our CryoBricks coud eliminate the need for this.
Brown-Stanford 2011
This year’s Brown-Stanford team is attempting to use synthetic biology to allow bacteria to survive on Mars. Since Mars is a very cold planet, the availability of bacteria able to survive at subzero temperatures would allow one of the hurdles presented in this inhospitable environment.

We will present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We documented several new biobricks for the 2013 iGEM competition, including  K1166000, K1166001, K1166003, K11660004, K1166005. We also implement the biobrick K905000, and reported our results in their “experience page” at the registry.
We experimentally validated several of our new biobricks K1166000, K1166001, K1166003, K1166004, K1166005 and even our new device “K1166002”; and its documentation is shown in the “Main page” section of our parts and device registry page.
We submitted our parts and device to the Registry in time.
We explained several considerations we took into account while designing our project in order to address the security and safety issues concerning the use of therapeutic proteins and their handling; they are all presented in the “Project” tab of our webpage.
We designed our device (K1166002) thinking in the improvement of several existing biobricks all at once, the biobricks taken into account were AraC/pBAD:BBa_I0500, HlyA: BBa_K554002, HlyB: BBa_K554007 and HlyD: BBa_K554008. We made sure to add some information to each of their experience page in the registry, and created its own for our device.

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the flavodoxin reaction. I was interested in identifying which reactions changed directionality with the addition of this reaction. Compared to our original FVA outputs (before knocking out malate oxidase), which detailed some reactions with variations of up to 1.0 × 101 in flux ranges, these updated figures only had variations of up to 1.0 × 10­2. So even though almost 1,000 reactions in the model did have different bound values, these differences were incredibly slight. I was also to identify 14 reaction whose directionality changed upon the addition of the flavodoxin reaction­ I included reactions that had an upper/lower bound of zero that then went in the positive/negative direction.
These reactions include:
- Experiments From Jun 29
Maximizing ATP
J_exp11
Laura and I also began running FVA codes at max ATP, and then comparing those outputs to our existing max biomass outputs.
Even though we identified 976 reactions that changed directionality, 220 of those being non­transporter reactions (independent of ATP cell transport), the slight changes in flux ranges led up to the conclusion that the model is already ATP­limited.
- Experiments From Jun 30
Reporting to Igem
J_exp12
Overview­: Laura and I finished up comparing the FVA outputs for the N2 WM1788 model at max biomass vs. max flavodoxin, but we had no conclusive feedback to report to iGem. Following my updates on the pyruvate knockouts, we reported to Cheryl that there is a potential to remove pyruvate dehydrogenase from the model. But we would need to counterattack any additional buildup of pyruvate from this knockout. We surmised that pushing flux through the pyruvate synthase reaction, and thus maximizing the production of flavodoxin, could account for any compromised cell growth.
The WashU branch was in the process of reworking the existing model to account for non recognition of certain promoters by E coli. These changes did not affect the WM1788 model that we are working with, given the nitrogen fixation reactions already account for any discrepancies. Laura and I completed all of our weekly tasks at the time, and were only responsible for summarizing our results and sending them to Cheryl. In addition to my reports, Tom, Laura, and I came to the conclusion that the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction can potentially be removed from the model if we account for the build­up of pyruvate in the cell as a result.

China Meetup
As time passes by more and more Chinese students are getting involved in synthetic biology. The number of Chinese teams had increased to 20 this year by the time we came up with the idea of holding a conference and inviting all teams. It was of much significance in that the new teams are lack of experience in the 2011 competition and a platform for communication and cooperation between teams was badly needed. The iGEM 2011 China Meetup was held at USTC from July 29th to July 31th.
The theme of this conference was “iGEM -- the breeding ground for the next generation of synthetic biologists"". During the conference, well-known experts were invited to promulgate their latest research findings and elucidate the development trend of synthetic biology, and there were also insightful students making subjective reports and reviews. Teams on the scene displayed the current progress of their projects, and shared their experiences with conference participants.
This conference turned out to be very effective and helpful. After two days’ presentation and discussion students from different teams got the main content of each other’s project. Through discussion in the evening and after meeting many new ideas were generated and students from different teams had their problems fixed.
Chinese teams began to participate  International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition from 2007, the number has increased to 20 from only 4 at the beginning.    Considering that the new teams are lack of experience in the 2011 competition and a platform for communication and cooperation between teams is badly needed,    a meeting for all Chinese iGEMers -- iGEM 2011 China Meetup -- was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th.

The main drawback to P. aeruginosa is that it cannot reduce nitrates and nitrites under aerobic conditions. Some strains are also known human pathogens making it a potential Risk Group 2 organism (Palmer; U.S. Dept. of Energy). Paracoccus denitrificans is a denitrifying chemolithoautotroph (Harms; U.S. Dept. of Energy). It can survive and multiply in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and is shown to be capable of partial denitrification in aerobic conditions (Baumann; Takaya). Most common molecular biological techniques work on Pc. denitrificans and most broad-range vectors and promoters used in E. coli also work in Pc. denitrificans and it has even been shown to possess minor nitrification capabilities (Crossman et al 1997). Nitrosomonas europaea is an obligate chemolithoautotroph with a strictly aerobic metabolism. It feeds off the oxidation of ammonia to nitrites in a process called nitrification  (U.S. Dept. of Energy). It is often found in aerated sewage where there is a high concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the form of ammonia. The genes responsible for nitrification in N. europaea are mostly characterized and available as a BioBrick in the iGEM Parts Registry (DTU-Denmark). N. europaea is an efficient nitrifier, but it cannot survive under anoxic conditions. This presents a challenge for sewage treatment plants when heterotrophic denitrifiers consume oxygen, necessitating continued mixing and aeration of the sewage during tertiary treatment to maintain the N. europaea component.
We have chosen Pc. denitrificans as a prospective chassis because it is a well characterized organism and is amenable to genetic modification. Most importantly, it is an efficient denitrifying bacteria. Sewage treatment plants currently use a multi-strain, multi-step system that employs a mixture of bacteria called sludge, which is known to contain N. europaea, Pc. denitrificans, and P. aeruginosa, to remove dissolved nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia. In current systems, the presence of multiple strains in a single reaction adds the risk that one strain outcompetes others and the reactor breaking down or becoming less efficient (Castillo; Heufelder). The sludge must be moved between two separate chambers in the Modified Bardenpho Process ("

Toluene evaporation test
Protocol
The toluene is known to be a volatile compound. This is why we decided to determine its rate of evaporation before proceeding to any subsequent manipulation with it. This will determine the care taken when handling it as well as the time the stock solution will be kept.
1.2mL of pure toluene (244511, Sigma-Aldrich) was added in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube. The tube was left open under a chemical hood and its weight was determine every 30 minutes for 6 hours.

23 years old, Functional Genomics student.
He is from Piacenza and obtained a BSc in Medical Biotechnologies from the University of Milan.
The communicator, he can speak with everyone. Maybe some students fear about speaking with directors of departments or of research centres... This is not his case, he always has the right word in every moment for every person! Totally hyperactive, he has the ability to speak with 3 people, prepare a PCR, write an e-mail and control 4 different gene sequences, all at the same time!!
He is a member of the eukaryotic lab, he has all the cells under his control... And they do what he wants... He has the right words for them as well!!!
Veronica Parisi: THE RED
24 years old, Functional Genomics student.
She is from Trento and got a BSc in Biology at the University of Bologna.
The red, she stands out a mile because of her hair,: now she is red but you never know how she could be tomorrow, maybe blue or yellow...
The one who remembers all the numbers of the biobricks we are using, and their position in the plates without checking the registry. Do not disturb her while she is working because you could be bitten! Indeed she is really nervous and concentrated in the lab but out of it she is more like a funny Oompa Loompa!
She is a member of bacterial lab and she loves her competent cells!
Francesca Cesaratto: THE SMALLEST
23 years old, Medical Biotecnology student.
She is from Trieste and obtained her BSc in Biotechnology at the University of Trieste.
The smallest one, hard worker and serious when it is necessary. She has a perfect  scheme of what we have done and what we will do, no step will be skipped! But she also is a little brat during relaxing cofee moments… Pay attention if you are quietly drinking your coffe because she probably will jump at you laughing and tickling your belly!
She is a member of bacterial lab and won’t let anyone skip his experimental control… She will know everything and will never be so nice with you... Until you do everything properly!!

The cultures from  the previous day were miniprepped and restriction digested to confirm identity however the gel did not turn out nicely.
Attempted to write out the pseudocode for the wiki written the day before. Probably not the best idea. Too many untraceable failures in the code appeared. Will rethink the coding strategy for next week.

Canada Day long weekend.
July 4, 2011 – July 7, 2011
July 4, 2011
The parts from the restriction digest (identity confirmation) were run on a 0.5% gel instead of a 1% gel and the identity of the parts was confirmed. About 70 LB/agar plates were made and the strain carrying the I0500_B0034_I732005 was cultured in order to make a glycerol stock of it the next day. Also the strain used previously in the viability assay was also cultured as a new viability assay was planned for the next day.
New battle plan set up for the wiki coding. Will be done in modules with constant testing. Established the minimum iGEM header bar (with some help from Brown-Stanford) and created the basic framework of how the menu will be set up.
July 5, 2011
Glycerol stocks were prepared of the strain cultured the previous day, also the construct was sent for sequencing to confirm the identity. The viability assay (E. coli in NAs and tailings) design was improved and the assay was carried out (details of this can be found under the NA Viability Assays).
Ran through the general architecture of the wiki with the team. Seems to be approved. Uploaded images for the menu bar.
Started a viability assay with Pseudomonas and E. coli to see which we will use in our final product. Fun readings at 8am and pm for a week.
July 6, 2011
The results of the assay showed that the E. coli did not survive in the naphthenic acid solutions but did survive in the tailings water (see NA viability Assays).
The assay is going well, with the Pseudomonas outperforming the E. coli so far. The race is on!
July 7, 2011
The results for the DNA sent for sequencing was received and the identity was confirmed. The strain carrying the DNA (I0500_B0034_I732005) was then plated on a plate containing X-gal and IPTG. The parts E024"

3) Nitrile gloves, masks, closed shoes were strictly required in laboratory to prevent potential threats of personal health.
4) Resting area and Experiment area were clearly separated to confine eating and drinking strictly in resting area.
Environmental Safety
1) Biological materials were not allowed to be taken outside the laboratory without sterilization. All of the used materials (bacterial samples, plasmids, reagents, agar, etc.) after experiments were sterilized before leaving the laboratory and collected altogether for further management.
2) Regular cleaning of the laboratory trash was arranged every day to maintain a clean and tidy laboratory environment.
Safe Shipping
We sent our BioBricks through the standard shipping process required by iGEM headquarter.
The design of our project
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
—Peter Carr, Director of Judging
iGEM projects involve important questions ""beyond the bench"" and teams' efforts are often well integrated into the technical aspects of their project, which has a significant influence upon design decisions.
This summer, we had held many activities in education, public engagement, dialogue and biosafety. These human practice activities not only broadened our views on synthetic biology, but also had a significant influence on our project designs.
Check the content below to find out how we have integrated the investigated issues into the design of our project.
1.The topic of our project: Overview
This summer, our team aimed to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in the natural environment. We mainly design two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecular level; AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behaviors of bacteria in group levels.
What's more, biosafety is further taken into account in our project. By applying gene circuits to control essential gene expression under the assigned biocontainment conditions, we can block essential gene expression to kill the cell upon loss of the biocontainment signal.
2. The interviews in The Ministry Key Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology and Technology: greatly helped us on the execution of our project
In our project, we designed AI-2 Controllers aiming to use these 'controller cells' to modulate the external AI-2 environment. But it's hard for us to apply this project to real world problems. At the"

Measurement
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Measurement Approach award , you must fill out this page.
There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Note about the fluorescence that were are using: Supplementary information from the paper by Ajo-Franklin indicates that the rate constant for RFP maturation is kRFP = 3.1 ± 1.3 x 10-4 s-1 and for YFP is 1.03 ± 0.17 x 10-3 s-1.  These numbers are corrected for photobleaching.
Redoing the PCR
Our gel results indicated that we simply did not run the PCR correctly because we did not even see the positive control on the gel.  Thus, we decided to retry the PCR reactions.  It was noted that we probably used too much template DNA and that 0.1-1 ng/mL is much more realistic.  Thus, we need stock solutions of our plasmid DNA of 0.025 ng/uL.  Since the stock solutions that we currently have are in a concentration of 0.5 ng/uL, we will simply add 5 uL of the latter to 95 uL of Tris HCl.
Also, it should be noted that we did not vortex the primer DNA after suspending it in water.  Thus, we will try to re-make the diluted primer mixes using the remaining water in the ""500uM"" tubes, but only after wortexing thoroughly.  Finally, we will check the program on the thermal cycler to ensure that it is indeed accurate for our purposes.

Add 46 uL of this master mix to each PCR reaction.  This is after adding 2 uL of template DNA and 1 uL of each primer.  For the negative controls, added 2 uL of water instead.  Also, added 4 uL of positive control provided with the Taq kit.

Panel with experts, students and parents
Insights: Target. The panel helped us identify new groups of people vulnerable to these diseases, we adapted our product and market studies according to the new information recollected.
Changes: The community presented more interest not only on the topic, but in our project.
Resume
The team decided to invite three expert psychologists in education, systemic family therapy and student affairs to a panel that aimed to talk about depression from an integral angle to the students, teachers and parents of our university. The event was held in the congress center of our university and was planned based on the idea of a coffee talk. At the beginning of the event the project of our team was presented and a brief introduction of the event was given to put in context those present. Subsequently, the experts talked about definitions, myths, truths and situations in particular of depression and anxiety. Finally, there was a time for attendees to express their doubts or share their experiences.
From this event, we realized that depression not only affects people with low economic resources, who have had some loss or suffer from another serious illness, but that all those exposed to stress become vulnerable to develop a disorder depressed or anxious, like students. This helped us along with our market studies to define the audience to which our product would be directed.
Science Diffusion in elementary schools
Insights: Appeal. We thought that they wouldn’t be interested on the topics
Changes: We learned that science is more present in our community than what we thought
Resume
Our team made a presentation with basic concepts from biology, microbiology, biotechnology, sustainable development, industry, applications of biotechnology, its origins and examples in our daily basis.
We contacted a secondary school called: “Escuela Secundaria José Arreola”, this public school is about a 10 min journey in car from our university; the administratives of the school allowed us to give the informative school to third and second grades alumni. The school has two schedules, it has different groups in the morning and in the afternoon, we attended both turns. After the chat was finished we proceeded organize a jeopardy for the teenagers to play, we divided the alumni into four groups, we gave each group a chance to pick a category: biotechnology, microbiology & biology, daily life and sustainable development.  At the very end, we awarded the teams with candies equivalent to the points they had earned.

EPF-Lausanne,2008,Team:EPF-Lausanne# Microfluidics_-_-_TEXT.html," circulate the surrounding medium.
All in all, the experiment will be conducted in the following order: the chip will be filled with cells containing our engineered plasmids. The buttons will then be closed and the medium circulated to eliminate cells that are not in chambers. Then, the signal in the first column will be initiated by addition of quorum-sensing molecules. Some time will be given to the cells to produce a response. Once there is production of response signal, the valves that control the connection to the following column will be opened. The 2nd column will now produce a response after some time, and again, the 2-3 connection is opened, and so on until the signal can run across the whole chip and cells in each column produce a response.
Physical characteristics of the chip
the chambers are 300µm wide
flow layer channels are 100µm wide
control channels are 30µm wide when they need to cross flow layer structures without making a valve
buttons have a 90µm radius
The ending of the inlets are opened to the exterior by punching wholes after the PDMS is solidified. These control lines are filled with water. When sufficient pressure is applied on them, it causes the membrane separating the control and the flow layer to bend in such a way that the flow layer is closed. This allows a precise control of what enters the chip at a given time.
Once the design is prepared, it is transfered on a chrome mask by laser lithography and so on to obtain the corresponding wafers. This process is described in the following sections.
Molds fabrication - Clean room
Molds were fabricated at the Center of MicroNanoTechnology at EPFL (CMI) on silicon wafers. The flow wafers were coated with the AZ9260 positive resist at a thickness of 8um and the control wafers were coated with SU-8 negative photoresist at a thickness of 10um. SU-8 has the advantage to be more resistant and more stable than the positive resist. But, AZ9260 has the advantage that it can be rounded when baked and this property allows to have a better closing ability of the flow channels by the control valves.
On the meantime, two glass masks corresponding to each layer of the design (flow and control) were written using a laser pattern generator (Heidelberg DWL200). The photoresist was then removed by a standard developer, the chromium was removed on the Chr etching bench and the masks were finally cleaned in a hot bath of 1165 remover.
The masks were used to expose"

From 2008.igem.org
Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Human Practice#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html," MFC design, which aspects were important for measuring or cultivation. All in all he always was available and willing to answer our questions.
Dr. Arnold Sauter
Introduction
To get an expert view on Microbial Fuel Cells concerning technology assessment, biosafety and the embedment in the current discussions about synthetic biology, we asked Dr. Arnold Sauter for his opinion. He is from the Office of Technology Assessment at the German Bundestag (TAB) and the deputy head of the TAB which investigates research on synthetic biology. He has got a long-standing experience in technology assessment for methods and applications of genetic engineering.
The TAB is an independent scientific institution created with the objective of advising the German Bundestag and its committees on matters relating to research and technology. Since 1990 the TAB has been operated by the Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis (ITAS) of the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT), based on a contract with the German Bundestag. TAB´s steering body is the Committee on Education, Research and Technology Assessment. TAB is a member of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) Network as well a part of the German language network NTA (Netzwerk TA) (NTA).
Dr. Arnold Sauter's opinion on our project
""Early consideration of biosafety aspects in the development of genetically engineered organisms, especially for all-day applications, is of fundamental importance, even if the technical or economic success cannot be assessed at such an early stage. A combination of physical and biological containment as it is provided for the Microbial Fuel Cell of the iGEM-Team Bielefeld, promises, at least for a batch process, a sufficient safeguard against environmental and health risks. A continuous process, which could be engineered and implemented for example in a waste water treatment, would certainly raise even more fundamental challenges.
Mentioning the biosafety aspect is not only a useful, but even a necessary part of the active presentation of the Bielefeld’s iGEM project to the public. The realization of the Day of Synthetic Biology (Synbioday) in order to establish public awareness seems to be very welcome for the field of research in Synthetic Biology. If possible, similar activities should be intensified. Especially the biosafety aspect should be one of the major topics for public discussion to show the advantages of such systems and to reduce the distrust. From my own experience I know how hard it is to clearly and appropriately communicate the different aspects of research and technology in the early stages.
From the perspective of the policy-advisory Technology Assessment, it is currently a very interesting question if i"

The concentrated solutions were purified by the Ni-NTA-column.
Team Substrate Analysis:
Creating  and measuring of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation samples for the laccase TVEL0. Experimental setup: 2 µg substrate, 0.1 mM ABTS, 110 µL BR-buffer and 10 µg laccase in 200 µL reaction volume. Measured at t0 and after 10 minutes.
Team Immobilization
Started immobilization of TVEL0 to analyze the binding of laccase during the first 10 hours representative for following immobilizations.
Tuesday October 16th
Team Activity Tests:
Today we received the samples from Team Cultivation & Purification. We are really motivated to measure the activity of our new produced enzymes. But before that we have to prepare the samples. This implied the determination of the protein concentration in each fraction, which we did today. The results are listed in the following table:
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Transformed B0034 into KRX
Transformed J23100 into KRX
Plated both on AMP-select-agar
Plated one more Colony of J61101 + GFP_Freiburg and J61101 + GFP_Freiburg + CBDclos
Team Substrate Analysis: The Massspectrometry data showed two potential products after the Laccase treatment of Estradiol and Ethinyl estradiol but we unfortunatly could not identify them so we decided to do MS-MS on thoose. The products showed that after Laccase treatment both Estradiol and Ethinyl estradiol losses two H atoms which was new for us.

Utah_State,2011,Team:Utah State#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," by serving in leadership positions for numerous technical conferences and workshops. Dean Hinton has also been awarded 12 patents. His current research is focused on developing systems applications of smart pixels and free-space optical interconnection, biophotonic systems, and in developing and understanding technology-enhanced learning environments. He was an IEEE-LEOS Distinguished Lecturer for 1993-94 and is a fellow of both the IEEE and OSA.
What We Did
Building upon the CyanoBrick toolkit developed by the 2010 Utah State iGEM team, our project will focus on producing valuable bioproducts using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our project will attempt to produce 3 different bioproducts: fatty alcohols, wax esters, and alkanes/alkenes. Fatty alcohols and wax esters are used to produce cosmetics, lubricants, and various pharmaceuticals. Fatty alcohols with a 20-carbon chain are used in the cold sore medication Abreva[reference needed], and long chain fatty alcohols have been linked to improved heart health [reference needed]. Alkanes and alkenes are utilized as hydrocarbon fuels. The production of these bioproducts in cyanobacteria will greatly reduce their cost and increase their availability. In addition to producing bioproducts, our project will also provide a more detailed characterization of the promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBS) produced by the 2010 Utah State iGEM Team. Utilizing a dual luciferase expression measurement construct, and reference promoters from E. coli and Synechocystis, our team will more precisely characterize the expression levels of 23 promoters under standard growth conditions, compared with the GFP-based measurements made in 2010. We will also produce useful intermediate parts, which are currently not available through the registry, allowing the dual luciferase expression measurement system to be easily adapted to new organisms and new reference promoters.
Team History
Utah State University first participated in the iGEM competition in 2008. Since then, the Utah State team has had the opportunity to put synthetic biology to use in many ways. Past projects include:
2008:  Efficient Systems for Monitoring PHB Production in Microorganisms
2009:  BioBricks without Borders
2010:  CyanoBricks: Developing a Cyanobacterial Toolbox
Throughout its participation, the Utah State team has brought home two gold medals as well as a bronze medal. Several former team members are now attending prestigious medical and graduate schools around"

As we know that the progress of the civilization depends upon the amount of value added and shared by the community. Advances in the field of Synthetic Biology, similarly, has to be shared to the community as a whole in order for something valuable to come out of it. Hence, in the pursuit of this, we have tried to involve the community as far as possible be it in the form of revolving the ideation of new application around the community's needs or making it feasible to share with them the work put behind achieving the idea. Having this mindset, we have collaborated with some of the iGEM teams, brought them together to share each other's idea, discuss their intricacies, issues, potentials and further collaboration opportunities.
Upholding the spirit of iGEM, this year, we organized our own online meetup. This is the first time iGEM IIT Kharagpur has organized its own meetup and also to join us were the experienced teams of India viz. iGEM IIT Delhi, iGEM IIT Madras and iGEM IISc Bangalore and also first time iGEM participant from Pakistan, iGEM Peshawar. The meetup was conducted through Skype. The format of the meetup was to discuss each idea through a presentation for about fifteen minutes following which a short question-answer session of five minutes was kept to clarify the doubts and a general discussion session about the problems with the project, opportunities for workshops and collaborations etc was kept post the completion of all the discussions. Since iGEM Peshawar is the first time iGEM participant, we kept a seperate  Skype session with them the following day where we discussed about the overall logistics of iGEM at length and there were many crucial questions raised by them regarding the same which we tried to address.. Each one of the teams discussed were working on different and innovative ideas which were appreciated by all. Some useful suggestions were discussed for each of the teams after their presentations, and all discussions were very productive and propitious for the teams in general.It was a great networking opportunity and a chance to know"

Porter’s Five Forces analysis
Marketing Strategy
Pitching the Staphiscope to a Research and Development Company When pitching the Staphiscope to the R&D industry, it is of paramount importance to establish its competitive advantage over traditional methods for S. aureus detection. To have a competitive advantage, a product or company must excel in at least one of the three following categories while remaining equal to its competitors in the others (Szarka, 2010):
Market access
Infrastructure
Technology
Market access refers to how easily the target demographic can get the product. Even a revolutionary technology can be hampered by a lack of market access. Infrastructure is related to whether or not a supply chain exists, as well as facilities for production and distribution. The third point, technology, is where the Staphiscope excels; its superior technology is what will separate it from competitors. Other selling points of the Staphiscope include its speed, efficiency, and room for expansion (could this technique be applied to other cases?). Conversely, there are also barriers that must be overcome when pitching to the R&D industry; namely, one must avoid falling prey to “not invented here” syndrome (Szarka, 2010). This term applies to the mindset some companies have of only trusting in-house innovation, and can be difficult to alter. Other barriers include the lacking of Staphiscope use on a commercial scale, and public perception regarding E. coli. While the latter issue can be combated via a public awareness campaign, the former is simply a fact of any innovative technology.
Companies such as Amyris Biotechnologies and Codon Devices have attempted to commercialize in the field of synthetic biology. Their experiences provide valuable lessons that can applied to the Staphiscope (Wilan, 2005). The most relevant of these is that patent protection should be a serious concern when developing a novel technology, especially in such a burgeoning and competitive field. Consolidating IP ownership and control early is equally important, as doing so will prevent a lack of unified vision from stalling the Staphiscope’s progress. Of course, there are a plethora of patent and IP issues surrounding the field of synthetic biology that must be dealt with before or during the commercialization process. Chief amongst these is the scope of protection that can be provided to new technologies (Chugh  Sakushyma, 2009). Additionally, looking for a pharmaceutical partner can help"

(C)
Looking at the coefficient a, b, we find it to have dimensions \([a]=1m^3\), \([b]=1m^3\). This allows us to use only the ln(x)-part of the integral as the left side of equation (A) has the same dimension. Then we do an approximation:
(D)
We find this to have the same dimension as a left part of integration (A):
(E)
The oil used for droplet production has a surfactant dissolved in order to reduce the interfacial tension. In the same way the oil used for spacing the re-injected droplets must have the same fraction of surfactant to make sure their surface keeps saturated with surfactant molecules. We postulate the lowest thickness of the drainage film can be equal to the size of the surfactant monomer [2]\(a \approx 2 nm\). Placing back the thickness of the drainage-film \(x=T\), and rewriting the equation for \(T\), we get a function \(T(t)\):
(F)
Here \(T_0\) is the initial thickness of drainage film at time \(t=0\).
The initial thickness T0 is found from a continuity condition stating the total flow rate in a system is constant. The flow rates for two populations of droplets are expressed as following:
(G) [Re-injected emulsion of droplets V1 with spacer oil]
(H) [On-chip produced emulsion of droplets V2 with oil]
(I) [Emulsion of droplets after coalescence]
Here \(Q_{sp}\) represents the spacer oil flow rates for two droplet populations. In our experiments of droplet coalescence, the flow rates of liquids are tuned in a way to have droplets of two populations flowing into a fusion chamber at 1:1 ratio. We might assume the number of droplets per time unit is equal to one. This means the time in equations (E)-(F) has to be changed into coalescence time tc. The time for two droplet injection is the same unit time \(\varDelta t\), while the time unit for droplet fusion is \(\varDelta t + t\). In our system with idealized-conditions, the volume of spacer oil comes between two droplets through a channel of dimensions H×W1. This unit is then injected into a wider chamber H×Wch (See Fig.2). Using these arguments and the"
