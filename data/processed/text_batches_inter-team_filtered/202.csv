For these reasons, the CuAAC reaction has a high potential for applications in the delivery of drugs with few side effects. One possible application is a “pro drug” delivery method where a pharmaceutical would be delivered in two separate inactive “halves” or precursors that could be joined by an azide and alkyne at a desired location to form an active drug without any negative side-effects.
Before the CuAAC reaction can be implemented in vivo, we must address the scarcity of free copper(I) ions in cells. Even though copper(I) is a requirement for living systems, copper is cytotoxic at the concentrations required for CuAAC because it reacts with oxygen to form peroxide and superoxide radicals (Pham, et al., 2013) that are prone to initiate radical chain reactions that propagate and destroy proteins and cell membranes. As a result, free copper ions are only present at sub-picomolar concentrations in cells, and most of a cell’s copper is sequestered by the copper-binding proteins that need copper in order to perform their respective functions (Dean, Qin, Palmer, 2012). Although copper is not readily available to catalyze the CuAAC reaction within cells, we hypothesize that an “unnatural” enzyme, derived from a copper-binding protein, can be evolved through phage display.
Phage Biology
A bacteriophage is a type of virus that infects bacteria, and bacteriophages are composed of the genetic material that encodes for the specific proteins that encapsulate the phage. Specifically, the M13 filamentous phage particles that we will use consist of a 6400-nucleotide circular ssDNA plasmid with “a dozen or fewer closely packed genes and an intergenic (IG) region that contains sequences necessary for DNA replication and encapsidation.” (Russel, Lowman, Clackson, 2004). This genetic material is wrapped in five types of coat proteins: pVII, pIX, pVIII, pIII, and pVI and the body of the phage is extremely small, about 6.5 nm wide and about 900 nm tall.
The phage reproductive cycle includes infection of an E. coli host cell, replication of the phage’s DNA, assembly of the progeny, and lysogenic secretion from the E. coli. First, the pIII coat protein binds to the pili of an E. coli, and Tol proteins Q, R, and A of the E. coli depolymerize the"

Gold Medal Criteria
#1 Integrated Human Practices
The Edinburgh UG project looks to solve a fundamental problem facing synthetic biology – the lack of a chassis for safe environmental release – by developing a novel chassis. We had to ensure our chassis had all the basic characteristics that a synthetic biologist would require. Therefore, we consulted with a number of active researchers in synthetic biology in order to gauge what they would require in an ideal chassis. These consultations became a basis of our project design as a whole, and often changed the direction of large parts of our work. We recorded these consultations and decisions on a timeline ( see here ) so that anyone may follow and understand the progression of our project.
#2 Improve a Previous Part or Project
We have improved upon the sequence of the previous part BBa_K914009 which contains a kanamycin resistance gene with one serine codon -> amber STOP codon mutation. We have increased the number of serine -> amber STOP codon mutations up to 5 in our part BBa_K2725012 and so it now confers decreased kanamycin resistance in the absence of a suppressor tRNA, i.e. we have reduced the leakiness of the gene. See here for more information.

#3 Model Your Project
Rational design of biobrick parts and protocols is an iGEM principle that Team Edinburgh UG have embraced this year through mathematical modelling. The mechanistic modelling of our DNA degrading killswitch was used to check for the viability of our project and to decide which promoters and ribosome binding sites to use in the final build of our system.  We created a model which would tell us how often our semantic containment system would theoretically fail and allow horizontal gene transfer. This allowed us to be more informed when approaching the human practices side of out project. We also trained an ordinal logistic regression classifier to be able to take growth curve data and identify which of our Semantic Containment parts was present within an"

We are also extremely thankful for the help and support we received from our mentor team, UAlberta, in our InterLab study. We would not be where we are today without their advice and aid.
Presentation-wise, we have presented at several elementary schools. The main purpose of these presentations was to educate kids about synthetic biology at an early age. We made a 15-minute, condensed and simplified overview of our project, including the way our bioreactor worked and what purposes our project had. As a team led by students, we believe fostering youth interest in STEM should be a key pillar to one’s goals. We hope that our efforts as a student-driven research team will show that passion in the STEM fields will push for innovation in our world.
In terms of fundraising, we successfully conducted two major fundraising events, with one of them being a bottle drive and the other being Summer SYNBIO. Our second event was a three-hour occasion with presentations, science workshops, and a silent auction. In order to hold the auction, we asked local businesses for gift cards and promo items, and despite this having been our first time to plan a silent auction, we managed to get in contact with over 50 local businesses. Thanks to the generosity of Edmontonians, we were able to hold an educative and fun event.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Here are a few examples from previous teams:

IISER-Mohali-INDIA,2017,Team:IISER-Mohali-INDIA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," transport facilities, using personal   vehicles as a symbol of status, lack of awareness about advantages of car pool system etc.   The number of personal vehicles increase the carbon-footprint many fold contributing   heavily to not only pollution but also to the quick consumption of resources like petrol,   diesel, etc. This can be checked by focusing on improving the status of public transport facilities which would incentivize more people to use them.   
  
  
       
  The results of the survey shows that 58.8% of people think that the governing authorities are not   taking up effective measures to check the issue of pollution. This calls for attention on the part   of the higher authorities like Pollution Control Boards. Furthermore, this needs to be focused upon mainly in the developed countries due to higher energy demands in comparison to   those of the developing or under-developed countries.   
       
  
  In short, the survey points out the requirement of awareness among the public, to encourage their   participation with the authorities, the latter being required to be more responsible on their part to   take actions to deal with the pollution and waste related issues.   
       
       
  
 
  
Fountain Pen Survey
  
Our dependency on plastic items has increased many fold.   So recently we issued a Google Form and asked people to mention the number of pens they   used throughout a year with the typically used brand. We recorded 26 responses to it which we   will present here.   
  
       
  
Average number of pens used in an year: 16
  
We have extended this data to the world population of 7,530,739,516 taken from here .This turns out to be 120,491,832,256 pens an year. And the amount of plastic generated by these pens is enormous even though we don't have a good number to represent that.
  
Hence, we would request you all to please join hands with us in using fountain pens (metal   ones :P ) and saying no to plastic ball and gel pens.

Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.

Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Introduction to the Lab Work
Objective
The goal of our wet lab work is to validate our software prediction. Since the terminator efficiency data available in literatures is very limited, we designed 100 terminators through the knowledge of terminator structure, and designed an experiment to measure terminator efficiency. By analyzing experiment results, we can adjust the parameters in our model to make it more accurate.
1, How to measure efficiency:
The figure above shows the plasmid designed to measure terminator efficiency. The terminator to be characterized would be flanked by gene sequences of two fluorescent proteins, GFP and RFP. By using flow cytometry, we could measure the fluorescence strength of GFP and RFP, so as to measure the terminator efficiency.
The terminator efficiency of a terminator is calculated with the formula:
E = 1- S/T
where S is the fluorescence strength of GFP with terminator, and T is the fluorescence strength of GFP without terminator, which is the baseline strength.
2. Plasmid Construction
3. Fluorescence strength quantification
We used flow cytometer to measured the fluorescence strength. Laser was used to be the luminous source and then radiated perpendicular to the sample flow. Under the irradiation of laser, cells expressed fluorescent protein. We calculated the average expression level of those cells and got the average strength of GFP. We also used fluorescence microscope to take a picture of bacterial culture.
4. Agreement with theoretical prediction
According to our experiment measured terminator efficiencies and our software predicted d scores, we created a fit curve to relate all the data. The corelation coefficient is 0.8. So we have achieved a good agreement between experimental efficiency and TTEC predicted efficiency.
5. Technical Standard
Our terminator efficiency measurement protocol has been submitted to Biobrick foundation as a technical standard(BBF RFC 90).

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,"or cyclosporine) is an important nonribosomal peptide drug used as an immunosuppressant in transplantations[5]. It consists of eleven amino acids, which are cyclized upon release from the NRPS. Like tyrocidine, ciclosporin contains D-amino acids as well as amino acids with modifications (Figure #). It was first isolated from the filamentous fungi Tolypocladium inflatum in 1969. In 1972, its function as an immunosuppresant was discovered by Sandoz (now Novartis). Despite, its wide use in clinical applications, it is associated with side effects [5]. In cyclosporine G, which is also isolated from Tolypocladium inflatum, the a-aminobutyric acid residue in position 2 has been replaced by norvaline [18]. Ciclosporin G shows reduced side effects in some clinical applications and it has demonstrated potential improvements in immunosuppressant treatments. A total of 25 derivatives of ciclosporin are known  [19]. Comparing the number of known derivatives to the actual potential diversity in compounds of an 11-mer cyclic peptide (11500) it is clear that only a miniscule fraction of potential compounds have been tested. Even substitution of a single amino acid would yield more than 5,000 potential drugs that could be screened for improved function.
Hypothesis: Targetted engineering of adenylation domains using MAGE in Bacillus
As highlighted above, there are multiple potential NRPS candidates that can be used for drug improvement through screening of NRP product derivatives. Since the 1990’ies, the Stachelhaus code has made it possible to target specific residues of the adenylation domain to create this variability in products, yet limitations in genetic tools for editing of these large proteins with a size approximately equivalent to the large subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome. Even though the changes required to potentially alter the specificity of the A domain is only around 1-10 amino acids, according to the Stachelhaus code, transformations require introduction of selection cassettes. As each NRPS module is ~1,500 amino acids and often multiple modules are encoded in one open reading frame, even a few minor modifications require assembly and introduction of large expression cassettes and multiple markers. For example, the NRPS responsible for cyclosporine synthesis in "

Tuesday 21stJuly
Pinheiro Lab
Our primers arrived! Time to get back into the lab for some hard graft. The first step was to introduce a pair of new restriction sites into our plasmid using PCR – which now contains the ORF314 gene – so we can carry out restriction to create suitable overhangs. The next step will be to introduce a His-tag into the gene.
Lab 307
The hard graft in Lab 307 begins! E. coli DH5α was streaked onto an LB plate for a growth curve on wednesday. at the same time, the transformation efficiency of the cells were determined along with the amplification of the plasmid containing the gfp part for the interlab study.
The restriction diagnostic of each of the components for the payload was carried out. It appears that all parts are correct. The plasmid containing tetR did not fully digest with EcoRI & PstI. On the gel it appeared that there was a high concentration of the tetR plasmid which was confirmed by nanodrop.
Wednesday 22ndJuly
Pinheiro Lab
Another delivery we received yesterday was a pair of DNA oligos we designed containing a His-tag. Today we annealed them, creating a short strand of dsDNA with overhangs compatible with those we’ve just created in our plasmid. Next step: ligation of the oligo and the plasmid, and just like that, we have a BioBrick containing a His-tag… Or so we hope. After purification it was time to transform this new plasmid into some more competent cells, so hopefully tomorrow we’ll have some brand new recombinant colonies.
Lab 307
Three separate colonies were picked from the E. coli DH5α streak. The three colonies are going to be used for the first negative control measurements for the Interlab Study . One of the cultures will also provide the basis for a growth curve.
Three separate colonies from the gfp plasmid transformation were picked and grown overnight in 5 mL LB broth containing 100 μg/mL of ampicillin. The three cultures will be harvested after approximately 18 hours of growth. This plasmid is essential in generating the devices required for the Interlab Study .

Congratulations to the UCPG 2016 iGEM Team from Denmark for their project ""CosmoCrops""!
The whole Stockholm team would like to thank Vinoo and the judges, as well as everyone who attended the second NiC conference and contributed to a great experience and a sweet foretaste of what's to come in Boston at the great jamboree!
Future of NiC
To establish NiC as a yearly event, we wanted to design a common platform for the Nordic meet-ups and thus created the website igem-nordic.org , with the goal of letting each mini-Jamboree winner use the website for the planning, and marketing of the next conference! Hopefully, this platform can become a community for the Nordic teams to more easily communicate, spread information, arrange meet-ups and much more. This year was the second year for NiC but hopefully many more meet-ups will come!

About 1.8% of the total global plastic waste was found to come from bio-research facilities (Urbina, 2015). Laboratories involved with mitigating the impacts of pollution, along with many other laboratories that conduct biochemical and chemical research appear to be significantly contributing to the waste by the amounts of plastics they unnecessarily dispose themselves. Various items like Petri dishes and culture tubes have been replaced with single-use plastic alternatives. Pipetting tips and syringes are used once and then disposed of, while culture media is cleaned through disposable filters into disposable pre-sterilised plastic bottles. Plastic consumables are cheap, come pre-sterilised and simply tend to save time and labour. After use, most of them go into landfill or biohazard waste streams. While many lab plastics are recyclable in principle, most of them remain thrown into general waste bins due to possible contamination.
An article published by the University of Exeter in 2015 estimated that Exeter’s Department of Biosciences generated about 267 tonnes of plastic in 2014, which was estimated to be 5.5 million tonnes of laboratory originated plastic waste worldwide. To understand the significance of this tonnage of waste, it is almost equivalent to the weight of the heaviest building in the world.
We additionally wanted to continue off the idea of laboratory plastic waste reduction as a sequel to last year’s iGEM goes green campaign by the TU_Dresden team.

Bywaters facilities are equipped to deal with a variety of mixed recyclables from both the public and private sector, such as; mixed plastics (PET, HDPE), Aluminium, Plasterboard, Cardboard, tetrapak and paper. Other materials such as non-recyclable are sent to other EfW buildings, this is so that such materials are converted into renewable energy.
The company survey at Bywater consisted of two major questions for which we expected detailed answers for. The general purpose of this survey was to help give context and develop the idea of the Plastic Lab, which will help set a standard protocol for plastic use and reuse in labs for future iGEM teams to use. The first question was whether laboratory plastics are normally recycled and if any were recycled by Bywater themselves, to which an answer was provided by Shamim Miah, Client Relationship Manager in Bywaters. He said that although most laboratory plastics are made from commonly recycled materials, most plastics that come out of"

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and high-pass “filter”, leads to the frequency-dependent expression of GFP. Due to the complexity of our mechanism of action, we needed a way to characterize the relationship between our inputs and outputs. Therefore, we developed both a deterministic and stochastic computational model to better understand our system. Through our interviews with researchers who are developing new ways to better model biological pathways, we aimed to learn how to improve our modeling approach.
Exploration
Prof. Guillaume Lambert, School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University
July 10, 2018
Early on in the development of our model, Professor Lambert provided us with advice on how to make our model more representative of our system. His research focuses in part on the development of synthetic biological regulatory elements and the creation of biological circuits, so his insight into what factors were essential to describe our system was invaluable. He emphasized considering both the cell growth rate and protein degradation rate, because both could be characterized by measuring our degradation rate with and without tags. Furthermore, he pointed us to research that would help determine the rate based on our specific degradation machinery.
Prof. Jeffrey Varner, Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical Engineering, Cornell University
October 4, 2018
Professor Varner’s research focuses on the development of physiochemical modeling tools. He is an expert on creating models for biological circuits, and therefore an invaluable resource for our project this year. In addition to confirming the foundations of our model, he spoke to us about parameter estimation, which is key to creating a model that accurately represents our system. Prof. Varner offered us suggestions on how to verify the parameters, including using cell-free analysis, analysis by individual colonies, and analysis by batch. Within our wet lab constraints, he recommended using batch cultures as an average value for the output of our model. He also introduced us to Langevin modeling, which offers the ability to incorporate noise as stochastic modeling does but without the complexity or long run-time. Beyond our model, he saw potential applications of our bio-circuit in drug delivery using cell-free protein-production implants.
Implementation
In our deterministic model, we included first order degradation for the repressor, protease based degradation of hrpR and hrpS, and deactivating repressor degradation of tetR and sigma-F.
We used measurements from our batch cell cultures to estimate kinetic constants for activator and repressor production, as well as the time lags involved in our biocircuit.
Testing
Recognition
Every system needs to be tested, especially one like ours with its numerous components. Throughout our research, we learned about testing and evaluation procedures, which influenced"

Yeast as a Chassis in iGEM
As we noticed how many problems choosing yeast as a chassis can cause, we decided that bringing attention to these issues would be a valuable contribution to the iGEM community. Yeast, being an eukaryote, offers many advantages compared to prokaryotic chassis options such as E. coli. Using an eukaryotic chassis makes it possible to execute projects that could not be carried out with prokaryotic organisms, and allows to expand the scope of topics covered by iGEM projects.
The first obstacle to be encountered when considering yeast as a chassis is the availability of parts in the registry. We made an inventory of parts available for yeast in the registry, and compiled the following statistics:
Out of more than 20,000 BioBricks, 163 are designed for yeast.
Out of these, 31 are available.
Out of these, 1 part is on the registry’s list of well characterized parts.
Because of this, any team that uses yeast as a chassis is pushed to use vectors and parts outside of the registry, which might not comply with the limits the BioBrick RFC 10 assembly standard sets. This creates a major hindrance to the creation of yeast parts, as iGEM guidelines and medal criteria require submission in the standard BioBrick backbone, with parts being flanked by the standard BioBrick prefix and suffix.
This, in turn, means a considerable amount of additional work to fulfill iGEM criteria and modify parts to be shipped in the standard backbone. Such a thought might discourage teams from pursuing ideas they have for yeast-related projects. In addition, doing these modifications doesn’t seem very motivating, as the framework offered by the conventional assembly standard offers a poor environment for the function of yeast BioBricks.
Having the mixed XbaI-SpeI restriction site resulting from the ligation of two biobricks directly upstream of the protein coding sequence would result in a T as the -3 base upstream of the start codon. It has been reported that in eukaryotic translation initiation, the -3 base is optimally an A or G (Kozak, 1996). This base is key in defining translation initiation, as changing it into a T or C increases sensitivity to differences in other bases upstream of the start codon. Cavener et al. (1991) on"

Environment
Environmental protection is one of the most compelling problems nowadays.   We kept thinking about this while proceeding the project. As mentioned above,    we built a paperless office, except for necessary invoices. Compared with previous iGEM teams of USTC,     we saved a lot of paper. Meanwhile, we paid attention to keeping our working environment neat and clean.      The workplace was cleaned by our team members every day.       Garbage was classified and dropped in the garbage bin. We believe that        appropriate regulation can ensure that working group of any project can         do their work comfortably and protect the earth at the same time.
Enjoyment
Although there were a lot of work to do, our project experience was joyful.   At the beginning of the project, team members with experience in software    development prepared courses for other members. Well-prepared courses made us accomplish    the assignments successfully and gain new knowledge. We also organized various kinds of    activities to relax our team members. In the summer vacation, we had group activities    after a whole day’s hard work, including having dinner outside, playing sports and even    computer game competition. We also recommend these activities to every team. They not only     relax team members, but also improve the relationship among team members, making the whole      working experience enjoyable and unforgettable.
Software & Platforms We Used
Google group
At the formation of USTC-Software of 2014, the team leader of 2013 recommended Google group as an online platform for communication and team management. Although every team member was highly enthusiastic about iGEM, they had their own school work to worry about. Meanwhile, our team members lived in different areas of the campus. Hence it became a serious problem that how team members could receive notifications in time to accomplish the work separately while co-working time could not be guaranteed. Google group solved this problem. Google group offers open online platform to users and users can build their own platform for sharing. Messages on the platform are accessible to all users joining the group. Emails can also be pushed to users. We built a platform of our team, and all messages on the platform could be pushed to team members in time. By Google group, we were able to:
1. send notifications and arrangements to all team members in time;
2. make team members share their thoughts and innovation conveniently;
3. make regulations, assessments and financal issues transparent by sharing work logs.
We recommend Google group for project management based on our experience. It can enhance communication among team members by breaking through the limitations of time and space. It can also make team work"

safety
Visit our safety page to learn in detail how we adapted our project to fulfill various safety considerations. First, we looked into best practices of engineering system controls and considered applied design safety on Mars by identifying likely points of failure. Next, we considered the various biohazard concerns on the International Space Station and Mars, focusing on both physical and genetic forms of biocontainment. To ensure our own safety, team received full biosafety lab training before commencing any wet lab work and followed all safety protocols.

Choosing an application
We wanted our system of PHB production and secretion to be applied in the real world, but were unsure where it could be best implemented. W knew our project had real demand in many areas concerning human waste management, upcycling, and creating biodegradable plastics, and narrowed down the scope of our search to four applications which seemed to have theoretical support:
sewage from wastewater treatment plants
sewage in developing countries
fermented liquid runoff known as landfill leachate, and
solid human waste collected during missions in outer space.
After consultations with industry, discussions with advisors and experts, and a tour of the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Calgary, we decided to evaluate the demand, cost, impact, and available resources of each of these applications could have. Most importantly, we used the findings for each application to carefully consider whether or not synthetic biology was the best approach. Ultimately, we decided that applying our design to long-term interplanetary space"

I remember she touched on some ideas before during the MIT bootcamp, that there weren't many regulations for the synthetic biology community. It's an interesting situation since you might expect many, probably overblown rules, given how easy it is to make the leap from synthetic biology into Hollywood science fiction, and the government's reaction to other research fields like stem cells.

Presenting the ELN/PLOTbox at the brainstorming session
We had Robert from Agilent and Traci, Shawn, and Monique from BU over for an all-day brainstorming session. Before they came, we put up printouts, photos, post-its, and posterboard from the previous day, and other notes all over a reserved classroom to create project-specific stations. At first, we ended up in small groups - I wasn't sure if we were meant to man our specific stations or wander around, but that's what ended up happening (the ELN station ended up a bit of a ghost town). After a while, I wandered over to the art group, which proved to be pretty interesting - I had a chance to finally see the Sifteos for myself and play a game with them, using the cubes to view a maze and guide a gopher through it. Towards the end of the day, we joined together to discuss one subject en masse - we focused on the art project and general workflow and collaboration, leaving the other topics for the following day. Later, I did a little research on the Eugene language, which I found just familiar enough to make some sense and yet the approach and way of thinking felt so different from standard biology that I was left rather lost. But it's probably a question of thinking it over and familiarizing myself with it. I think it'll get better with time.
14Jun 2012
We had a short time to interview Natalie Kuldell during our ELN/PLOT (Personal Lab Organization Tool) presentation today. She shared her work style with us and what benefits her current set-up (i.e. paper-wiki hybrid) offer her. Paper, she told us, was invaluable for drawings, and the sharing and editing capabilities of the wiki also proved to be very useful. Her insights highlighted desired features we'd noticed in our own research, like freeform annotation with support for drawings, as well as search capabilities. We also have a CS/Math department talk every week, and this week was a little relevant to our work in HCI.

presence isn’t that strong in Mexico, however, in Europe and in the USA, this is not the case. Mr. Ramírez took advantage and included implications of other frequent bee diseases like Nosema and Varroa in the conversation. He mentioned a very important point that we had previously started to notice: Most of the serious problems in bees caused by viruses or bacteria, are not correctly detected or even known. As Mr. Rodríguez had previously commented, Mr. Ramírez mentioned how different extracts of plants are used against diseases in bees, in this case, mint and grapefruit were the examples. On another hand it was mentioned how antibiotics are not an option at all for treatment, since the European Union does not accept them, neither does accept the presence of transgenics in the honey; there are rigorous studies exercised and if there is something wrong the EU may return an entire shipment of honey back to the remitter. We discussed the issue of innocuity of honey by highlighting that when there is a new product added to the hive, it should not generate any residue at all or change the expected properties from the consumer.
After talking about our project, a question arose in Mr. Ramírez, an issue that would be asked many times since that day and that we would do everything possible to solve and validate: Our product would actually pass from the food that the nurse bee ingest all through its system until reaching the larva by means of the royal jelly? And regarding the method of application, (initially consisting in applying the final product in the bee bread), Mr. Ramírez explained to us how this bee bread is created, and the fermentation process it goes through in the bee cell.
We also had the great opportunity of listening to some of the concerns Mr. Ramírez has as a beekeeper: He thinks the beekeeping area could be greatly impulsed by receiving more support from governmental institutions and he perceives that the validation of honey innocuousness here in Mexico results complicated as there are not enough tools to endorse the required diagnostics. On another hand, he mentioned how there are no young people able to continue with the job of the current farmers, and this is an alarming situation that requires a prompt resolution.
Mr. Ramírez gave us a lot of priceless information that was essential for the development of our whole project. He was the first to comment us about the beekeeping congress that would take place in the city of Delicias in the coming months, and which we would have the great  privilege to attend, he told us that"

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].
Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway, it’s very important to note there is considerable diversity in the structure of FabI’s from different organisms[5]. AND, not all of them have the same level of sensitivity towards triclosan[23]. This is why we needed to screen a panel of enzymes in order to find the enzyme most sensitive towards triclosan with a nanomolar inhibition constant. (See above for why we wanted to see nanomolar inhibition)
Reported triclosan inhibition constants:
Terms: Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme- inhibitor complex. IC50 is the amount of an inhibitor needed to inhibit a biological process by 50%
From our literature search, we were able to find enzymatic activity and triclosan inhibition data on the E. coli FabI. We also found 2 other FabI proteins that had at least nanomolar triclosan inhibition kinetics to screen: S. aureus and P. falciparum. Even though, H. influenzae FabI does not have reported nanomolar inhibition kinetics, we still wanted to verify the literature value so we included it in our set. We also acknowledge that A. thaliana has nanomolar triclosan inhibition, but we didn’t learn about its inhibition kinetics until we were near the end of our project
Of the organisms studied, algae is most sensitive to triclosan, where toxicity levels are roughly 9 nanomolar which are the same concentrations reported by Chalew and Halden of triclosan leaving Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)[18]. From our literature search, we noticed that there were no characterized FabI’s from algae, nor is it even known whether triclosan exerts its effects on algae by inhibiting its FabI enzyme [19]. Due to their extreme sensitivity, we hypothesized that triclosan exerts its effects on algae through inhibition of the FabI enzyme. Therefore we decided to test 3 FabIs from algae: P. tricornutum, T. pseudonana, and A. protothecoides.
This left us with a candidate list of 7 FabI proteins. 1 previously submitted FabI gene in the registry ( Bba_K771303 ), 3 FabI proteins taken from the literature, and 3 FabI proteins from algae. We decided to codon optimize and synthesize these genes to clone into a common E"

To amend this problem, we have researched information about synthetic biology in different languages such as English, Korean, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Indonesian. We have complied information of synthetic biology in four East Asian countries/regions and one South East Asian country. We believe that this novel approach will help the reader to have more holistic and unbiased view of synthetic biology all around the world. We also had time to share our experience and thoughts to various different people through presentations. We already had a semi-formal meeting with SUSTC and CUHK iGEM teams. We have also prepared three more presentations, two for HKUST students, and one for the general public in Hong Kong.

Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," This was in part due to the size of the fragments, as several of them are quite small, making it difficult sometimes to visualize them on a gel.
3.3 Lab work, results and conclusions
This year, in addition to conduct the expected laboratory research on the intron project, we invited 20 undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo to join us, in order to teach them some basic molecular biology techniques. Volunteers learned simple molecular biology techniques such as restriction enzyme mapping, miniprep plasmid samples, vector cloning, heat-shock transformation and agarose gel extraction.
The original parts received by our team include left intron (aka Intron 1), right intron (Intron 2), left GFP (GFP 1), right GFP (GFP 2) and a lox region of 34 bp in length. All parts were cloned into pUC57 vector backbone, which is ampicillin resistant. In order to conduct the RFC 53 protocol in our cloning procedure, we need to first sub-clone the R-Intron, L-Intron, L-GFP and R-GFP into pSB1C3 backbone (Chloramphenicol resistant or CmR).
To complete the sub-cloning process, we followed a flow-chart as shown in Figure 8(a)
Fig 8a
We used REN EcoR1 and Pst1 to double digest the original parts and then cloned into pSB1C3 vector. We transformed the cloned vector + insert samples into competent DH5α strain of Escherichia coli and then plated the colonies onto plates with Chloramphenicol.
Controls are important for plasmid cloning; in addition to our transformation plates, we included vector+ligase control, vector-only control, transformation control and negative (no plasmid) control to check for possibility of contamination and improper techniques. As expected, the transformation control, vector+ligase and vector-only controls had only pink colonies growing on them. The negative control plates were clean.
Our transformation plates showed a mix of pink and white colonies; the pink colonies represent the presence of Red fluorescent Protein in pSB1C3. As the multiple cloning site for pSB1C3 lies inside a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene, successful transformants are white due to disruption of the RFP. We screened 8 of these colonies (2 colonies for each type of insert) and checked the size of the inserts by running an agarose gel, as shown in Figure 8 (b). In addition, we also loaded the digested pUC57 samples to"

Improved parts: BBa_K2886004
This year, we present BBa_K2886004 as our improved part in the judging form, but actually we make improvement to another three parts.
BBa_K2886004
BBa_K2886004 and BBa_K2886005 are both improved from BBa_E0020, which has 87 uses till 2017. And we designed them from BBa_E0020 with the technology BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation).
BiFC is a new technology put forward in 2012 aiming to visualize the interaction of two proteins. If you connect these two parts with your two target proteins respectively, when two target proteins interact with each other, two parts of BiFC might well bind with each other and emit fluorescence for observation, which, in turn, proves the combination of your target proteins.
We split ECFP at the site A155 into two parts and get cECFP (coded by BBa_K2886004) and nECFP (coded by BBa_K2886005) which are the C- and N-terminal of ECPF. If these two parts of BiFC bind with each other, and they will emit fluorescence just as complete ECFP.
To demonstrate that our BiFC system works, we carry out a series of experiment.
Firstly, to prove it preliminarily, we implement experiment in E. coli BL21. To begin with, we transform E. coli with plasmids carrying BBa_K2886013 (leucine zipper + nECFP) and BBa_K2886012 (leucine zipper + cECFP) respectively. Because of the existence of leucine zipper, which can bind with each other due to electrostatic attraction automatically without out outer-membrane, trans"

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". The cyanobacteria produce sugars and oxygen from CO2 , water and light; known as photosynthesis. In their prototype consortium the sugars are used as a carbon source for, E.coli, which uses it to create a desired end-product. In their proof-of-concept bio-factory this product will be isobutanol, a potential biofuel. That said, their cyanobacterial carbon fixation module can be coupled to a multitude of biotechnological production processes to make these processes more sustainable. Using TU Delft’s 3D printer could improve both the reproducibility and specificity of a biofilm-based consortium. The 3D printer would, for example, be able to print a layer of cyanobacteria in between two layers of E.coli to create specific patterns that optimize carbon sharing and product formation in Amsterdam’s consortium.
The Bio-composite Leaf,
Besides potentially optimizing the productivity of  Amsterdam’s consortium in a bioreactor, accurately printing biofilms allows for a whole range of novel consortia applications. One of these is the so-called ‘bio-composite leaf’, an approach described by Bernal et al. as ‘[an] approach to improve solar energy harvesting capacity [by] fabricating inexpensive water- based ‘‘cellular biocomposite’’ materials that mimic or exceed the function and stability of natural plant leaves by ordering layers of closely packed living photosynthetic cells on a surface with a non-toxic adhesive polymer binder’ (2014). Such multilayered composites of densely packed cells could significantly improve the low light harvesting capacity of cyanobacteria commonly observed in photobioreactors.
Re-invented
Packing cyanobacterial cells together without losing photosynthetic capacity poses a scientific challenge. The most successful method used to date exploits adhesive colloidal polymer particles that bind the cyanobacteria to a leaf that consists of porous paper, which hydrates the cell coating via the fluid in the paper pores below the coating [figure 1]. Although this approach generates high photosynthetic rates, creating the latex coating is a time-consuming, complex process that has not been optimised for uniformity of the coating. A standardised, relatively simple process for creating such coatings could not only overcome these problems, but could ultimately enable the mass-production of bio-composite leaves for high-yield sustainable bioproduction.
A new approach
That’s where TU Delft’s 3D-printer for biofilms comes in. By using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of bio"

Human Practice Interviews
As part of our Human Practices project we wanted to go further steps. Based on what we have found out, up until this point we carried out many interviews with research experts and public health officials involved with the topic.
We were able to integrate our knowledge we had gathered to specifically focus on topics important to improve our project further. For example we found out that a specific cell phone is used during field trips and we were able to adjust our 3D-printed lab-in-phone device to this phone. In the following you will find all of our interviews, in which we research our application scenario. Make sure to download our podcast!
Skype-Interview with Paul Courtright, PhD

PhD Paul Courtright established the Kilimanjaro Center for Community Ophthalmology (KCCO) in 2001 with his wife, supporting and training local doctors and government employees from all over Africa to effectively manage public health, with regards to eye care.
This interview was essential to us for understanding Trachoma treatment strategies in the field and laid the groundwork for our preparation visiting the BICO Ophthalmology Centre in Malawi.
Finding Chlamydory:
Introduction and description of our project.
Dr. Courtright:
You’re familiar with the point of care work that was done in the past by … it was Cambridge?
Kai:
No.
Dr. Courtright:
It was not successful, so that’s that. They did some point of care diagnostic work. I think they did it in Tanzania in our facility and we helped with some of that. In the end it was not successful and I can find some of that documentation and send it all to you.
Daniel C.:
That would be great.
Dr. Courtright:
BBC actually did a little piece, […] I was interviewed […] I look for that and send it all on to you. […]

That would be cool. […] The reason we actually wanted to interview you, was because for the iGEM project we also have to do the so called Human Practices part. And we are trying to design an application scenario. So we want to just find out how well our device could be used in developing countries and if there is a need for a device like that.

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," buffer cap is on one piece and need to be put elsewhere, this is not very easy to understand at a first glance.
The price is consequent, it is sold at around 35 $.                                   Results take 15 minutes to show, which may be a source of stress.
The general aspect of the test is quite cold and unfriendly, dramatizing the situation.
It is polystyrene based, so not eco-friendly.
For the special case of HIV, detection is effective only three months after infection.
Based on these observations, we established our own design requirements. The test would need to:
Be able to detect multiple STI at a time;
Produce quick and relevant results;
Be intuitive;
Contain the least amount of pieces;
Be bio-sourced and eco-friendly;
Be able to detect diseases at an early stage.
Taking all these pieces of information into account, we started the design process itself.  After a phase of design with sketches and first shape choices, the chosen shape was modelized in 3D printing. A prototype was printed and tested in the lab. Making liquids migrate correctly on the paper band inside the prototype was not an easy task. Five trials were needed to achieve good performance. Then the final shape was developed, printed and tested as well. We pursued theses development cycles until we were satisfied with the results.
3D-printing our device
Our device is composed of two major functionals parts. The biological detection material is put on a paper strip. This paper strip alone would be difficult to handle. The casing is here to act as an intuitive user-interface. Thus handling is facilitated. We have chosen 3D printing to make the casing. To better understand this technique and its benefits here is an interview with Damien Jacques, who is an expert in 3D printing.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
Our device is printed with PLA (polylactic acid), which is a biosourced and fully biodegradable plastic. It was important for us to integrate an eco-friendly approach in the making of the device. The detection system is paper-based, so fully biodegradable as well.
New ideas brought by our device
As our final test was designed to detect several diseases at a time, we needed a shape that could allow an unambiguous reading of the results. Making a linear device, with all the  diseases having a result really close to one another was our first option.
But we quickly thought it was not a good solution, because it could lead to misinterpretations. So the round shape, with all diseases detected on different pads turned out to be far better."

We used pLac to drive expression of the immunity protein, however, different inducible promoters should be used depending on the overall design and application of the safety circuit. We chose the constitutive promoter BBa_J23108 from the Anderson Promoter Collection, which has a relatively moderate expression level, to drive the expression of the activity protein so that it would not overwhelm the cells until after the desired delay. We ultimately plan to integrate the activity protein cassette into the genome of our bacteria.
We do not require the colicin lysis protein for our system, and while the activity protein may degrade extracellular DNA released from our genetically modified bacteria, it is preferable that the cells do not lyse and the genomic material is digested within the cells. A small percentage of cells will die naturally and release the activity protein, which will have a lethal action on any cells that escape our system via mutation of the activity protein gene.
Experiments and results
Colicin E2 Expression Kills Sensitive Cells
We performed a basic assay to characterize the toxicity of the Col E2 cells. The Col E2 cells secrete the lethal activity protein, which diffuses out from the Col E2 colonies spotted on the LB plates. This generates a region where vulnerable cells can not grow, visible as an empty ring (ZOI) around the Col E2 colonies.  Here we expect ZOI when Col E2 is spotted on vulnerable cells.
Experimental setup
Cell Types
MG1655: These cells approximate wild type E.coli cells as they have undergone minimal genetic manipulation as compared to other laboratory strains. Genotype: F- λ- ilvG- rfb-50 rph-1
MG1655.RFP: MG1655 cells transformed with constitutive RFP (from Anderson promoter library, BBa_J23102 )
Col E2: Wild Type Colicin E2 cells, containing pColE2-P9 plasmid [2]
Protocol
Plate 10 uL of 0.1 OD lawn cells from liquid culture on plain LB plates
Spot 5 uL of saturated Colicin E2 cells from liquid culture on plates
Incubate plates overnight
Results
Col E2 cells produce ZOI in sensitive cells, as indicated bellow by red arrows. MG1655 and MG1655.RFP, cells which are not colicinogenic, do not produce ZOI when spotted on a lawn of sensitive cells.

Description
β-glucosidase is used to deglycosylate saponin of notoginseng. Our Lab have a PET-28a plasmid withβ-glucosidase gene and LacI gene. The transcription of β-glucosidase is repressed by LacI protein. But lactose and IPTG can induce the expression of LacI protein. We used a 3L fermentation tank to conduct preliminary experiments, then the enzyme was extracted from bacteria solution using glycine buffer.

Why we choose our project
As Chinese traditional medicinal materials, notoginseng has been widely recognized on its efficacy by Chinese people during thousands of years. With the developing of modern medicine, other characteristics of notoginseng have been utilizing. Now it’s been proved that notoginsenoside has therapeutic effect on hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. However, the bioavailability of saponin of notoginseng in human body can reach only 4%. Based on this premise, we hope to hydrolyze glycosyl on saponin of notoginseng molecule out of body, so that deglycosylated saponin of notoginseng can be easy for human to absorb.
Find new solid medium
Acting as solid medium for E.coli fermentation, notoginseng are boiled in water. E.coli can obtaining nutrient from notoginseng solid medium. After reaching a certain cell concentration, E.coli will express objective protein, and then saponin of notoginseng will be deglycosylated. To provide enough nutrition for the growth of E.coli, Notoginseng solid medium are anaerobically fermented by rhizopus and yeast at room temperature so that polysaccharide can be hydrolyzed to glucose, galactose, and arabinose etc. We kept in track the concentration of reducing sugar in notoginseng solid medium. The concentration of reducing sugar reached 10g/L when the E.coli fermentation began.

In order to get a clearer picture of UDCA-contained drug’s manufacturing circumstance in China,                         our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts                         about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the                         most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on                         chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively                         weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA                         medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged                         us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This                         suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.
Mr. Xing Ruwen
Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is                         an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs                         for years.
Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.                         Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about                         drug production.
According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two                         disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor                         that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it                         comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it                         is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and                         might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the                         dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method.
Mr. Li Jinlong
Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing                         department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company.
Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also                         profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification"

This year our team has developed an innovative way to deal with the safety problems during the study of synthetic biology-- Three Laws of Synthesis Biology. Read as follows:
1. Once an altered plasmid gets into bacteria that does not aim at adopting the plasmid, the suicidal mechanism of the plasmid will be executed.
2. Once the mutation accumulates to a certain degree, the suicide mechanism of the bacteria will be executed.3. Once an infected bacterium is away from its regular surroundings, the suicide mechanism will be executed.
We have illustrated the details in related parts of human practice.

Jun 12: Another day in the wet lab
Learning at BU
We spent the entire day at Boston University's Photonics Building with their iGEM wet lab team. We began the morning with an introduction to synthetic biology and biology basics: we learned the definition of synthetic biology - as quoted from Ahmad Khalil and James Collins, two well-known researchers in the field, ""Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel bimolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms."" We then went on to cover the parts of a transcriptional unit, including the definitions of a promoter, a ribosome binding site, a gene and a terminator. In addition, we reviewed plasmids and bacterial transformation. Finally, we learned about the methods that the BU wet lab team is using; knowledge of their experimental process enables us to better understand the needs of our potential users. We also shared our researched features and potential projects. Overall, it was a valuable experience to learn about a real wet lab team's process and to share our ideas.

Brainstorming project ideas about semantic search
As a continuation of yesterday's brainstorming, the Boston University iGEM team came to Wellesley today. Before they arrived, we gave a demo of our Beast surface and its applications to a representative from Agilent. He gave us some thoughtful feedback. In the afternoon, we all gathered in a room and covered the walls with ideas. We had four different categories - the Lab Organization Tool (originally the eLab Notebook), the Beast (both micro and macro features), Semantic Search, and Art. For the first hour, everyone wandered around the room, exploring the ideas and notes already written and then adding their own. Then, we sat together as a group and discussed each topic. We came up with several great ideas for each topic, and we have our work clearly cut out for us.
Jun 14-15: More brainstorming
More brainstorming of project ideas
Unfortunately, there was a personal emergency and I was unable to show up in the lab these 2 days. From my understanding, the lab continued researching and brainstorming. My team aimed to look at the registry and attempt to convert it to RDF to investigate how easily semantic search could be implemented.

Oct 03, 2018 Visit to ‘Expertisecentrum wondzorg’ (expertise center wound care)
We were told that there are two types of wounds, and three types of basic ways to distinguish what to do with a wound. The decision about what you need to do with a wound is very simple. It is based on color! If a wound is black, that means that there is necrotic tissue which has to be removed. If the wound is of a yellow color, the wound is not yet clean and there are still some remains of bacteria or tissue left. This means that the wound has to be cleaned, but there is no dead tissue. A red color means that the wound is not contaminated, but still needs to be protected and covered. These are things that we must take into account when designing a patch for wound infections.  We were also told that the amount of exudate of a wound is very important. If a wound is too dry, it will not heal. Is there too much fluid? Not optimal either. Treating a dry wound is performed by the addition of a hydrogel to increase the fluid levels of the wound. In that respect, our gel would provide an ideal environment for dry wounds.
After some information about the wound healing process, we asked about wound-related statistics. It turns out that of all wounds, about 80% are acute and will heal on their own without too much care. However, 20% will become chronic and of these 20%, more than half will get infected and thus requires attention. These wounds are estimated to be approximately 100.000 wounds. This means that in the Netherlands, 100.000s wounds annually could benefit from our solution.
Since an antibiotic treatment usually takes around ten days, it would be good to aim at removing the infection in ten days or less with our solution. That way, we can prove that our solution would be better than current treatments.
Insights
Keep in mind that the amount of fluid in a wound is very important.

Shortlisting
Project ideas – team members assigned to look into this projects
The team had gone through the top five projects in order to shortlist them. Progress with further research had been discussed.
[1] Computing DNA - Rachel, Zoltan, Steven
Zoltan had found a few relevant papers and told that even though there are plenty of papers available in the field, realising the final idea and solution will be difficult. Richard also suggested that it would be a difficult project.
[2] Microcracks in Concrete - Harsh, Da, Alan
Rachel told that Brussels made a glue before, however it was not used for concrete repair.
[3] BactoNatto, Teeth, Coating spores/BS - Rachel, Younus, Jannetta
Jannetta found some extra papers on tooth decay. MIT had a project where they used lactobacillus. More research is needed. Rachel had found the chemical flavouring of chocolate. It has been suggested that the projects mentioned in the title could be merged with the diabetes issue (therefore creating natto that solves many problems). This would allow us to have a selection of sub-projects with more chance of success.

Phase 1 Results
The goal of phase 1 to establish a consistent method of gene activation through dCAS9-VPR and well characterize the components of our system. Using MIT's CRISPR  optimization tool, we generated 20 sequences to be used as our gRNA and target site. The dCAS9-VPR complex, the target sequence and reporter gene, and the gRNA expression vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET28a vector. We used the T7 expression system to create high Cas9 yields in the event that expression in the periplasm was too faint to detect.
While we constructed parts to direct Cas9 to the periplasm, we concurrently wanted to test that saCas9 functions in E. coli. We built a device that synthesizes a corresponding guide RNA to direct saCas9. Our guide RNA device consists of mRFP device (BBa_J04450), and a scaffold and guide sequence targeting mRFP flanked by a BBa_J23119 constitutive promoter (Figure 4). This 20-base pair guide sequence is flanked by two BsaI sites and can be replaced with any desired sequence using Golden Gate assembly.
Figure 4: Cas9 and guide RNA devices.
While we constructed parts to direct Cas9 to the periplasm, we concurrently wanted to develop a procedure that would enable us to evaluate Cas9 activity. We built a plasmid containing a constitutive mRFP fluorescent protein (BBa_J04450), a BBa_J23119 constitutive promoter driving the production of a guide (gRNA) sequence and gRNA scaffold (Figure 4). This 20-base pair gRNA sequence is flanked by two BsaI sites to enable rapid construction of gRNA for any sequence of interest using Golden Gate assembly.
Cloning Methods
The periplasm-directed Cas9 device and individual parts were cloned using Gibson assembly . The guide RNA device was cloned with Gibson assembly, and the customizable guide sequence was swapped out using Golden Gate assembly . Signal sequences for Cas9 were synthesized by IDT with homology to the ribosome binding site in the tet backbone and to the His6 tag and first few base pairs of Cas9.
Assays
Periplasm Fractioning
To test whether the Tat/Sec system and outer membrane proteins successfully transport Cas9 across the inner membrane, we first separated the outer membrane and periplasm from the rest of the cell using a cold osmotic shock procedure from the 2014 Bielefeld iGEM team. This procedure sequentially applies two buffers of different osmotic pressures to burst the outer membrane.
OMV Purification
Dr. Matthew DeLisa at Cornell University, with the permission of Ronald Lloubes at the Institute of Microbiology of the Mediterranean, generously donated the hypervesicular strain JC8031. This NlpI-knockout strain of E. coli produces elevated levels of OMVs due to NlpI-mediated destabilization in the outer membrane attachment to the underlying peptidogly"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html,"omes. It is used as cofactor by at least two types of peroxisomal proteins the glutathione peroxidases and glutathione transferases, which reduce lipid- and hydrogen peroxides or transfer glutathione to lipid peroxides for the purpose of detoxification (Horiguchi H. et al., 2001) . Furthermore, it partly represents the redox state of the peroxisome. Knowing the pH of a compartment is important to predict the activities of almost all enzymatic processes inside of it and to follow up acidification and basification upon conversion of metabolites.
We finally chose two ratiometric sensors to perform measurements with. The pH sensitive and glutathione redox state reporting green fluorescent proteins pHLuorin2 (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) and roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . We aim to target them either in the peroxisomal lumen or the cytosol. To achieve peroxisomal targeting we attach the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 with Golden Gate cloning .
Figure 5.1 Level1 plasmids with  promoters of medium strength and uracil auxotrophy. Top left roGFP2 cytosolic. Top right roGFP2 peroxisomal. Bottom left pHLourin2 cytosolic. Bottom right pHLourin2 peroxisomal.
Using promoters with different expression strength in order to find optimal measurement conditions is of high interest. There is a trade off between a high signal-to-noise ratio and self induced effects which are both dependent on expression levels (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . This cannot be generalized for each sensor. For example, pHlourin2 has sparse influence on the existing pH because of the buffer effect of proteins.
Validation of the peroxisomal localization can be achieved via fluorescence overlap of the sensor and a peroxisomal marker in our case pex13-mRuby ( import mechanism ).
Figure 5.2 Level2 plasmids with peroxisomal marker Peroxin13-mRuby and uracil auxotrophy for colocalization. Left roGFP2 with strong promoter. Right pHLourin2 with strong promotor.
It can also be validated by transforming the sensors attached to the PTS1 sequence into Pex5 knockout yeast strain. The sensor is expected to show no specific localisation, because of the missing import sequence. We calibrate the sensors in living yeast cells and physiological"

Eutrophication
Most environments have limited plant and algal growth due to limiting growth factors. In lakes and other freshwater environments, phosphorus is usually the limiting factor. In estuaries, coastal marine ecosystems, and other saltwater environments, nitrogen is usually the limiting factor (1). Eutrophication is defined by high levels of the limiting growth factor(s) in an environment. The increased levels of the limiting factor prompt excessive plant and algal growth. The excess growth cause algal blooms of algae which can be toxic; tainted drinking water supplies; degradation of recreational opportunities; and hypoxia. The “dead spots” caused by hypoxia often kill marine creatures, including those fishermen rely on for their livelihoods (2). The decrease of water quality restricts water use for fishing, recreation, industry, and drinking (3). The estimated annual cost of damage of eutrophication just to the U.S. is $2.2 billion (2). The EPA identified eutrophication as “the main problem in United States surface waters that have impaired water quality” (3). 55% of river and stream miles and 70% of lake acres in the United States have been classified as impaired by the EPA (4).

Glycerol stock, mini prep and qubit of the overnighted cultures. The pJET reverse GFP products were sent for sequencing. The MoClo and transformations of DNase and lysozyme were repeated. Sequencing information for the KillerRed and KillerOrange protein came back to confirm which mini preps contain  the correct DNA product. KillerOrange was transformed into protein production strain BL21 (DE3). KillerRed will also need to be transformed.  The mini stat pump was set to 7.5 rpm and switched on at 13:30. The effluent needles were set to 20 ml.  The air was switched off at time 0 when initial measurements were taken once the cultures reached the   same volume level.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,". Those include patients, patient’s families, patient advocacy groups, physicians, professional societies, nurses, family administrators, public payers, governments and non-governmental organizations.
Some examples of different societies and and non-governmental organizations in Sweden are Riksförbundet Cystisk Fibros, Astma- och Allergiförbundet and Riksförbundet HjärtLung. The majority of the countries with people suffering from these diseases have similar associations for these diseases10.
n Sweden, the responsibility for medical care and health is shared by the central government, county councils, and municipalities, and therefore they are the decision makers. They are also the payers as the major population in Sweden possesses public insurance.  The county council is responsible for ensuring that the needs of tomorrow are met by today, in healthcare.  The doctors and government officials influence the upcoming treatments on the market, and the user is, of course, the patient.11
Need
What is this?
Needs correspond to opportunities for innovation. They are characterized by describing an outcome that is currently unmet for a problem, in a particular population, which helps direct the opportunity. By clearly and concisely articulating the needs they have observed, innovators will be in a much better position to then determine which ones represent the most compelling opportunities.
Summary
To identify the need, we targeted our most valuable stakeholders: the patients and healthcare professionals. We conducted a survey to reach as many patients as possible and could observe 3 outcomes: an unmet need for mucus-targeting medication, patients are willing to try a GMO as a drug and the preferred administration device would be a nebulizer. We arranged interviews with doctors, physiotherapists, nurses and family members, similar outcome as from the patient survey. There is a need for PROlung and nebulizer would be the most effective device. They all would be happy to prescribe PROlung to their patients as long as it’s safe.
We discovered the need for a new medication by approaching our most valuable stakeholder: the patient.

SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," As a visiting scholar of American Pacific University and Visiting Professor in McCain George School of Law, she provided us with a full-scale perspective of gene technology law in China.
And at the same time we have an interview with Dr. Huang, who is specialize at civil procedural law, and we introduced him some knowledge about synthetic biology and gene therapy to him, which he like it so much that he said he will communicate consult with us if he has some professional questions or he just want to learn more about life science.
Dr. Huang share some case related to reproduction lawsuit. And he told us even though judge finally coped with the problem based on the existing law system, the existing law system needs more development and progress so as to adapt to the pace of the times development.
B. Law and Regulation Actuality in China
What legal achievement has China made in gene technology?
Technical Guidelines for Gene Therapy Research and Preparation Quality Control, the first fundamental technical specification made for gene therapy, was officially promulgated and implemented in 2003 by SFDA and in 2004 its English edition was published in Biopharm International to the whole world.
The regulation of agricultural genetically modified organisms safety and Regulations on the Protection of Wild Plants of the People's Re- public of China is a relatively well-developed regulatory system in gene technology, especially in the field of transgenosis technique.
Human genetic resources management interim measures, a regulation serves as the criterion for the management of human genetic resources, went into effect in 1998. And there are many other regulations that have some statements related to gene technology indirectly.
And some other laws concerning to genetic engineering directly or indirectly like the Seed law, Forest law, Grassland law, Fisheries law and the Agriculture law made by Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, or Ministry of Health play a significant role in protecting the development of gene technology in China nowadays.
legislative shortcomings：
Although China has made a great progress in the gene technology legislation, there still are some legislative shortcomings we need to face. And only if we have a clear understanding about the current situation can conquer these shortcomings.
Firstly, there is not a statute book for gene technology and the regulations are so miscellaneous that it’s not easy to regulate gene technology development systematically and effectively. Secondly, because most regulations like the The regulation of agricultural genetically modified organisms safety and Regulations on the Protection of Wild Plants of the People's Re- public of China are made by the State Council and/or its departments working under it and these regulations are classified into administrative laws and regulations and/or Departmental rules, it’s not so possible for the regulations to"

Events:
- At first we want to model these reactions at equilibrium. However, Gibbs free energy for most of the reactions in mevalonate pathway is not available. We have to come back to Michaelis-Menten equation.
- We modify those Michaelis-Menten equation by searching for their kinetics in literature and parameters in database.
- We build the ODE system for this pathway and test the production of IPP, GPP and FPP in respond to changes in concentration of enzymes and ATP as well as NADPH.

Strain Engineering
In Strain Engineering we modified V. natriegens to establish three different strains which were designed based on commonly used E. coli lab strains to accelerate daily lab work. Therefore, we designed a new workflow for fast genomic modificationsin V. natriegens to further speed up our project.
Methods
We designed a workflow for fast genomic modifications in V. natriegens using the Flp/FRT system for excision of antibiotics markers and combining this technique with the natural competence of V. natriegens for the uptake of linear DNA from their environment. Therefore, we utilized the Marburg Collection to assemble the desired constructs for introducing the Flp recombinase and TfoX into the V. natriegens cells.
Natural Competence
In our project we wanted to build many different strains. For this we have to make many genomic changes of the wildtype of Vibrio natriegens. Mutations must be introduced in some genes, others must be deleted or inserted. In order to think about a good method that works in V. natriegens and with which we can make many modifications very quickly, we looked up into the literature. We found a great publication from the group of Ankur B. Dalia published 2017. They have shown that V. natriegens is natural competent and that it is possible to perform a natural transformation with this organism. This method is a good choice for many multiplex genome editing in a short time. They showed successful that it was possible to integrate a linear PCR product with a antibiotic cassette that replace the gene of interest. Besides, they have managed to perform a cotransformation. This fact was very interesting to us and we knew immediately that if we can reproduce it, then that's the method we want to use.
It was possible for us to get in contact with the group leader and asked him for his strain, he had used for the transformation. In this strain, Tfox is expressed under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. It is not yet known how the natural Tfox is induced therefore, this method was resorted.
After receiving the strain, we were able to start testing it to see if the method works in our hands. Before we start in the lab, several things have to be considered: Transformation is dependent on the length of homologous sequence. It was shown that the transformation efficiency is much higher with 3kb homologous regions than for example with 0."

We sought to both improve and characterize this part for future utilization in our filtration device by adding a modified lac promoter to allow for constitutive expression rather than IPTG induction within the biological system, and thus make it more applicable in the environment (Figure 5). We also improved the characterization of their part by testing its application for biological precipitation of iron and cadmium in addition to their copper testing to add to the functionality of the part.

Biobrick Assembly
Modified construct containing “phsABC”. The phsABC operon was amplified from the pSB74 plasmid and inserted into pSB1C3 (shipping vector) and the pBBRBB plasmid (for characterization) with the novel addition of a constitutive promoter.
Biosafety
In response to our survey results showing that there was some concern about the bacteria escaping the device, we have designed two kill switches to address this concern and highlighted their advantages and disadvantages. Click either of the pictures below to view more information on each proposal.

Achievements What we did
Dissecting cheaters
Our experience with the cheating bacteria began when we realized that a mutation was produced in the Bac2 construction (that consisted of the groE promoter fused to the coding sequence AsRed2). We used to grow them all over the weekend in the orbital shaker that was supposedly at 37ºC. The real temperature of the shaker in the Valencia hot summer was about 39ºC. Since Bac2 has a promoter that is sensitive to heat shock (the transcription starts when the temperature is higher than 37ºC), this high temperature was mimicking the “Are you hot?” question. In other words, the cultures were “being asked” continuously because of this high temperature. This led to mutant selection and our mutants were found to lack Bac2 inserts (Figure 1), and exhibited larger molecular weights on a native electrophoresis (Figure 2), suggesting that the inserts were lost and that two plasmids without inserts were relegated in the mutant clones.

Experimental evolution
We decided to isolate and characterize those mutants “cheaters” and compare them with standard, “honest” clones. We compared their behavior in terms of growth in ampicillin-containing medium and we also performed experimental evolution tests. We started by comparing the growth of the original Bac2 strain and the cheaters, at different concentrations of antibiotic.
