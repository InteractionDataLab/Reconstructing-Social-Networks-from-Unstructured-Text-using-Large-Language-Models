Float team member Taylor introduces the gas production subproject
Mechanisms of gas production
An important consideration for balloon production was the actual mechanism of flight. Part of our proof of concept involved gas production with the purpose of hypothetically filling our balloon. Although we know there are efficient electrical and chemical methods of producing gasses suitable for flight, we wanted to ensure a biological way of achieving our vision. With Mars’ surface pressure being only 0.6% that of Earth’s, [1] we ideally wanted a gas less dense than air (1.293 kg/m3 at 0˚C [2]). Although helium gas would have been preferable to experiment with due to its low density and inflammability (there are already balloon missions being done at NASA with superpressure helium balloons), there are no biological or chemical methods of creating helium. We instead opted for hydrogen gas, which has a density of 0.0899 kg/m3 at 0˚C [2] and is producible using the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

Generally, C. reinhardtii absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere to create various carbohydrates, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct. [3] Green algae in particular can produce hydrogen gas instead of oxygen through a process called direct biophotolysis, [4] where a reversible hydrogenase enzyme catalyzes a reaction between photosystem II and ferredoxin.

Collaborations
We collaborated on modeling with Nagahama.
Their project aimed cadmium collection using Escherichia coli which has positive chemotaxis for aspartic acid, then we constructed simplified model of chemotaxis       and simulated behavior of E. coli by using probability and random function.
Their wiki explained the result of modeling.(→<a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:Nagahama_project#Modeling "" >link</a>) We constructed equations in their simulation including the equation that determines E. coli to choose going straight or turning in probability, and explained equations to them.The figure describing the result of simulation is made by UT-Tokyo.

Day 2
In this camp, many iGEMers were the group of lesson. Therefore, they needed to prepare experiments that can introduce knowledge of molecular biology to senior high students. The lessons of this camp included Transformation, Mini-preparation and DNA electrophoresis. First, we explained the principle and the steps of experiment by Powerpoint clearly. We helped students to operate experiments and prevented them doing something wrong. Quickly, they were familiar with experimental technique by ours assistance. Everyone in these lesson learned well and was interesting to biological aspect.
Day 3
On day 3, they observed the result of last day. Then, we taught them how to analyze these result. For example, some plates grew well, but others were blank. Telling to them what happened, we let them know the correct method to do experiments.
Day 4
On day 4 of the camp, we prepared a lecture about synthetic biology. First , we taught them the concept of biobrick. Then, they realized the history of this competition and what iGEMers do.
Mr. Lin and Mr. Chen were the introducers of this lecture, using easy way to let students understand basic knowledge of molecular biology and biochemistry.
In Q&A part of this lecture, students asked several questions of IGEM , and we thought we inspired their passion to IGEM. So as to let them know more, Mr. Lin introduced ours 2013 project. Although it was hard to them , they still listened it conscientiously.
Day 5
On day 5, we programmed the visit of genomics research center for students. First, the guide of center took us to see the mass spectrometer and introduced its principle. Second, we visited Protein X-ray Diffratometer laboratory. Third, the center allowed us to visit Ultra High Throughput Screening. Finally, they prepared a lecture of more about Researches in the Center. We gained a lot in this trip, thinking this national-level institution great.
Day 6
On the last day of biocamp, the group of lesson had prepared souvenirs for students participated in this camp. The souvenirs"

As a year two student of the bachelor student of Biochemistry at CUHK, IGEM is a precious chance for me to learn more about synthetic biology and scientific research. I am just a year two student, therefore I can and need to learn more in this project, including the wet-lab technique and the synthetic biology theory. I am looking forward to meet other teams from all around the world to widen my horizons.

Cathy Mak
I am a bachelor student of biochemistry at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It is a precious chance to participate in the iGEM competition in which I learnt a lot about the leading field of science – synthetic biology. I found it very interesting to study how simple organisms can be manipulated block by block and brick by brick. I was also deeply impressed by the infinite potential of synthetic biology for seemingly any biological systems to operate. In this competition, I am responsible for the wet lab and part registry. I acquired much useful hands on experience and technical know-how. It is of great value for my future studies and further enhancing my interests in science.

Chu Tinyi
I am a sophomore student majoring in biochemistry at CUHK. I have always been fascinated by the principles behind lives – even those of a single bacteria cell – so that I take a great delight in studying and exploring them. The beauty of iGEM is that it provides a platform for us as undergraduates to not only understand these principles but also carry out creation of new function by integrating them, and that’s also the reason why I choose to participate in it. I wish I could get a deeper comprehension about synthetic biology through"

Procedures
(I)  Strand C (BBa_ K332021)
  1. Strand C is synthesized from three fragments –  (1) Ptet  (2) RBS+LuxR  (3) RBS+LuxI+double ter sites.
  2. All of them are in the form of plasmids, so we digest them by appropriate restriction enzymes.
  3. We first combine the last two fragments by ligation. The procedure is as follows:
    (1)Add the respective digestion products, vector plasmid, buffer, ligase to ddwater
    (2)React at 16°C for 30 minutes
    (3)Inactivate the ligase by incubation it at 80°C for 20 minutes
    (4)Store the products at 4°C
  4. The products of ligation are then transformed into competent cells. The procedure is as follows:
    (1)2µl plasmids(ligation products) are added to 33µl competent cells
    (2)Shake gently for one second, and cool it on ice
    (3)Incubate it in 42°C water bath for 45 seconds
    (4)Spread the liquid to plate which corresponding antibiotics have been added to
    (5)37°C overnight
  5. The next day we do a colony PCR for the transformed cells and have the PCR products electrophoresis to make sure that the two fragments have been combined correctly.
  6. Now we separate the plasmids(RBS+LuxR+RBS+LuxI+double ter sites) from E. Coli, and digest it with restriction enzyme.
  7. The first fragment (Ptet) is then combined with the above product by ligation, and transformed into competent cells by the same we have done early.
  8. Because the length of Ptet to the remain segment is relatively too short, we cannot confirm whether they have combined correctly by just do an electrophoresis of the colony PCR products. If the electrophoresis result seems like that they have combined, we then send the product to sequencing.
(II) Strand D (BBa_ K332022)

Also, our two captains and our PI met Dean Wolf, Dean of Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Roger Trippel, Senior Director of Development and Individual Giving, and Abigail Kaun, Special Assistant to the Dean. We discussed the project to-date, our outreach efforts, and shared ideas for managing both our and future iGEM UCSC team’s funds.
Created first batch of YPD medium and also created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of our Y. lipolytica strain. We attempted to miniprep our pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli but we made a mistake by switching the order of wash buffers used from the Zyppy Miniprep Kit. The Nanodrop curve of the plasmid sample was ragged and thus we will need to attempt this again.

This week, the captains held check-ins with each individual on the team to hear concerns and alleviate worries, since we are now halfway through the summer. While the captains were busy with meetings, the rest of the team was working hard as always. Our modeling team started a growth curve for Yarrowia lipolytica so we can better understand the yeast’s growth rate, our riboswitch team began lab work, our plasmid team started linearizing plasmids, and our outreach team continued to update the wiki page and started creating a presentation for high schoolers.
Four of our team members and our PI took a vacation to Minneapolis that wasn’t much of a vacation at all. The small group toured Medtronic's Operational Headquarters, Physiological Research Laboratories, and the University of Minnesota's Visible Heart Lab. Almost every other second of the trip was spent on the BMES Coulter College Conference, which required teams to come up with a medical solution to a need. Our team focused on hypertension in resource-constrained settings and developed a solution in the form of a blood-pressure-monitoring phone case and app. Even after the conference, the fivesome was hard at work; they met with the University of Minnesota iGEM team, toured their lab, and gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising.

5. Resuspend the cells in 10% glycerol to obtain a dense pulp (usually not more than 1.5 mL).
6. Take 50 µL sample and do the electroporation test (without DNA). You should have a pulse of 4-6 msec. If shorter, wash the cells once again with 30 mL glycerol.
7. Aliquot the cells (50 µL), quick-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C.
Electroporation
Materials:
- DNA
- Electrocompetent cells
- SOC medium
- Ice-cold cuvettes
Protocols:
1. Add 1 µL DNA to 50 µL of electrocompetent cells in an ice-cold cuvette (1 mm).
2. Electroporate (Eppendorf, 1700 V, 4 msec).
3. Add 950 µL of SOC solution.
4. Incubate for one hour at 37°C.
5. Plate 50 µL out on pre-warmed plates (37°C).
Miniprep
Materials:
Overnight liquid cultures
Thermo Scientific geneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit
Protocol :
1. Transfer the liquid cultures to an Eppendorf tube and spin down at 13400 rpm for 1 to 2 minutes
2. Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 µL of the Resuspension solution. The cells should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
3. Add 250 µL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
Note. Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA.  Do not incubate for more than 5 min to avoid denaturation of supercoiled plasmid DNA.
4. Add 350 µL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Note. It is important to mix thoroughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization Solution to avoid localized precipitation of  bacterial cell debris. The neutralized bacterial lysate shoud become cloudy.

BGU_Israel,2013,Team:BGU Israel#Bricks_-_-_TEXT.html," is an interpretation level in the context of the flow of genetic information transmission.[1] In order to incorporate the #21 man made, synthetic Unnatural amino acid (UAA) one must first find a way to expand the genetic code to add a translational sense codon for that amino acid. We used a method called ""Stop codon suppression""[2] developed by  Prof. Peter Schultz and co-workers. This method uses orthogonal tRNAcua and Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase from archaea. Orthogonal means that these components do not interact with the different host organism’s cellular pathways. Orthogonality: Since the PylRS originating from archea must be orthogonal in the host cell, our BioBricks could and should be used only in bacteria [2]. There is no orthogonality between archea and mammalian cells for example. Use in our project: The following parts were used by us to incorporate the unnatural amino acid proparagyl-L-lysine (as a model UAA) into our PASE 2 essential protein – TyrRS. When one of the following parts or the UAA itself are missing, one of the logical AND gate (Link to PASE2 project description) conditions are not met and essential protein translation is disabled. Pyrolysyl tRNA synthetase (PylRS) from Methanosarcina barkeri str. Fusaro (Archea): In well-studied model organisms such as E.coli , yeast and in mammalian cells, the natural AARS catalyse via the aminoacylation reaction the amino acid activation and accurate biosynthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA, the immediate precursors for encoded proteins. Note that each AARS should select its ""own"" (i.e cognate) amino acid (AA) which is subsequently covalently linked to the cognate tRNA isoacceptor ""Fished"" from the cellular pool. Immediately after their dissociation from AARS, the aminoacyl tRNA are shuttled or channeled to the ribosome where the anticodon is matched to the mRNA codon and the tRNA is deacylated , with the amino acid being added as the next residue of the a nascent protein chain.[1] In our project we used a class 2 AARS that is capable of charging Pyrolysine (Pyl – a natural, but rare, amino acid) and several unnatural Amino acids (Fig.1) onto the tRNAcuapyl. PylRS substrates: The PylRS can use"

Epilogue
Model
In order to reach the goal of minimizing the average degradation rate of E.coli, i.e. the highest average expression level of our target gene, we chose to simulate the behaviors of individual E.coli by a segregated population competition model, furthermore used the method of cellular automaton, while incorporating several modulating model parts into steps of cell reproduction, to get the population of different E.coli at each time step.
To specify, we first distinguish the E.coli by their plasmid numbers, under the assumption that individual behaviors are alike within the group with the same plasmid numbers. Then, by getting the ribosome bind rate through mechanism model and the growth promoting effect through 3-dimensional random walk model, we adjusted the E.coli’s individual growth rate. Meanwhile,  queue theory is used for exploring the relationship between intracellular plasmid number and target gene expression level. What’s more, a fall-off mechanism is incorporated by energy estimation, when considering the subsequent translation of glucose dehydrogenase, which serves as a growth promoter of E.coli.
After repeating the process of reproduction in a reasonable period of time, the population of E.coli with various plasmids can be simulated, therefore provide us with the population’s information as time goes on.
Main model
The whole population of E.coli are separated into 100 different groups, with $N(i)$ E.coli attributed to the $i^{th}$ group, in which they all possess $i$ plasmids at current time. Each group of E.coli was regarded as a distinct population, under the assumption that individuals are alike within, i.e. their gene expression level, growth rate are basically the same under similar circumstances. One minute is set as a time step. For each group of E.coli, a fraction of the population will go through the process of plasmid replication and"

Harvard_BioDesign,2015,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Platform_-_-_TEXT.html," Western Blot. Cultures of our His Tagged-fimH plasmid containing pili knockout bacteria were OD standardized and separated into two subcultures, one of which was induced with Rhamnose, the other uninduced. Samples taken at three timepoints show increasing expression of fimH in the induced culture but not the uninduced. This demonstrates that we can express recombinant fimH and that the His Tag gives us traction to measure expression.
In principle, the His Tag on fimH could also be used to quantify recombinant expression in assays like whole-cell ELISA, both integrated with the pilus shaft and separately. In the future we hope to test the efficacy of these assays for determining quantitative expression levels. Additionally, the His Tag will allow future teams to purify recombinant pili using Nickel NTA purification for use in vitro.

The Fim switch insert is 2882 bp in length which makes performing standard short sequencing reads challenging as multiple reactions are required to completely sequence the entire part.  To overcome this we used our in-house Illumina MiSeq to completely sequence the entire plasmid.  Following quality control analysis the sequence was assembled and shown to be a match to the expected Fim switch part.
A problem we found with the Fim switch was that a subset of the colonies were prematurely switching from red to white.  This is likely due to a low level of leaky expression of the fimE gene which then inverts the promoter region upstream of the eforRed gene.  A single white colony was picked and cultured for use in downstream testing as a control as the switching of the promoter should express the rhlI gene and therefor produce the C4 quorum sensing molecule.
Characterisation
To test the functionality of the Fim switch, ensuring that C4 AHL is produced, the strain was cultured with a reporter strain ( K2205015 ) which produces GFP in response to the quorum sensing molecule C4 AHL.  Due to a small sub-population of the Fim switch strain being white, a single white colony was picked and cultured separately.  This strain was used as a positive control as it should produce C4 AHL.  Both the majority (red) Fim switch strains and minority flipped (white) Fim switch strains were tested for C4 AHL production by co-culture with the reporter strain.  Initially the Fim switch strains were spotted onto a lawn of the reporter strain (Figure 5) followed by quantitative analysis of the strains by co-culture in a 96 well microplate (Figure 6).    This culture is then co-cultured with the reporter cell. This reporter cell detects C4 AHL and expresses GFP in response.
Figure 5: Initial test of the red and white fim switch strains which were spotted onto a lawn of the reporter strain ( BBa_K2205015 ).
Figure 6: Expression of GFP in the reporter ( BBa_K2205015 )strain in co-culture with the Fim switch strains.  The assay was performed using methods described in Fim 96 Plate assay Protocol .  The data shows the expression of GFP in the reporter strain over a standard growth curve.  The FimW and FimR strains represent the white and red variants of the Fim switch strain respectively, these were co-cultured with the reporter strain in a 1:14 ratio.  Each data point is the mean of 3 biological repeats"

Research in animals, have demonstrated that allostatic overload of this hormones and other                         mediators, resulting from chronic stress, causes atrophy of neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex; brain regions involved in memory,                         selective attention and executive function; likewise, it causes hypertrophy of neurons in the amygdala, the brain region involved in fear and anxiety                         as well as aggression (McEwen, 2004).
We say understandability is highly related to difficulty of terminology. In this project, we look into gene tech related terminology which is an important                     part in accessing the understandability of a team’s wiki. However, when reading the paragraph above, several vocabularies, such as: glucocorticoids,                     cortisol, corticosterone, gnathostome vertebrates, allostatic overload lead to low understandability in their background.
ii. What is the definition of terminology explanation?
At first, we thought the definition of terminology explanation is clear, meaning an article provides deliberation on a technical term. We found the                     definition is clear and successfully wade through the field of magazines. But we got stranded when we saw 2013 iGEM SDU-Denmark . SDU-Denmark is so thoughtful that they offer clear information when the                     mouse hovers a term. As we were astonished at these considerate design, we discovered the information displayed may not be useful for general public:
We may agree at ‘natural rubber’ is helpful to realize the word ‘isoprene chain’. But it doesn’t look so when it comes to other cases. In real work, since this design really offer several useful explanations, we consider it as offering more than 3 terminology explanation.
Result and Discussion
We discover that Newspaper shares the highest negative transfer attitude (10%). When we investigate into the contribution of each field. we found that when it comes to social issue and the field of economics, the negative rate goes to 31% in social issue and 23% in economics, market and industry. It is the technology and development that contribute most to positive rate.

sequences revealed that no His tag was present. In fact, although SOD and yCCS were digested with AgeI for the assembly, the insertion found between SpeI and PstI had not been removed, indicating that SOD and yCCS hadn't even been properly digested; this makes it even more puzzling how the picked clones have been to grow on Km 50 plates, as the SOD and yCCS source plasmid was pSB1C3.
The only reasonable explanation is that SOD and yCCS have been digested only by EcoRI. After enzyme inactivation, however, PstI (which cannot be heat-inactivated) has"

Motivation:
Seasonal flu has scourge a lot of people from the world.
1918 H1N1(Spanish flu):Killing over 40,000,000 people
1957 H2N2(Asian Flu): Killing over 4,000,000 people
1968 H3N2(Hong Kong Flu):Killing over 1,000,000 people
Current H5N1
This year H1N1: The number of people dying is still increasing.
An average of 25,000~50,000 people died of influenza in a single year.
Influenza causes serious health threats because Influenza (RNA virus) has the ability to evade the immune system through rapid genetic mutation.
Influenza structure(red:HA blue:NA)
Occasionally, viruses are transmitted to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics. The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease. The influenza A virus can be subdivided into different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses.
Infected with exposure to the virus HA and NA proteins, the body will produce different antibodies. However, because humans never had contact with the H5N1 or new H1N1 influenza virus, there is no corresponding antibodies in human body. So when people get infected, the immune system unable to respond as fast, resulting in an inappropriate immune response, leaving tissues with serious injury or even death.

1. Travel planning:
Application form (p80) has to be filled out until Monday, 13th
Anissa and Anna will visit the ]Reisekostenstelle“ to get general information about the possible duration of the stay.
2. Cloning advances:
Viral Bricks for loop insertions:
Recent update: 10 of the 14 Viral bricks are ready to use, the remaining Z34C constructs are in production.
Because the oligos for these constructs are quite too long, they had to be filled up by the Klenow enzyme. The first reactions didn't work because of several circumstances: Reasons could be that the heat inactivation wasn't done or the iGEM restriction enzymes weren't active in the Klenow buffer.
N-terminal fusion:
Darpin production isn't finished until the 17th, so there is the question of ordering the express variant.
Rep/Cap insertion:
Unfortunately, Rep insertion didn't functionate. Cloning of Cap is in progress, but wasn't tested yet.
Cytosine Deaminase:
First Ligation of insert and vector failed, maybe because the Quick Ligase Buffer was too old. Another approach will be done with T4 Ligase.
According to that, there is the idea to generate TK/CD as a fusion protein, but it has to be checked which linnker must be used.
3. Cell culture:
Re-Transfection of Rep (synthetic variant) with old 293 cells was done again, went wrong. New cells were freezed up and will be ready to use in 1-2 days.

mKeima, eGFP and mRFP Characterization
We had biobricked mKeima as expression cassette into pSB1C3. On the other hand, we also extracted eGFP [] and mRFP [] expression biobricks from iGEM 2013 distribution kit and helped to characterize their specs. Transformed bacterias were grown up and lysed. Then we characterized their excitation and emission spectrum on 96 well plates. Note the huge stoke shift of mKeima compared to eGFP and mRFP.

Improving Glucose Sensor
pCSTA promoter is repressed by presence of glucose. It is used as an indicator of glucose level in media, a very useful component in bioimaging. However, one potential hurdle is the ability of fluorescence to shine out of thick, dense culture media. Considering application in vivo or mammalian cell bioreactor, higher readout wavelength is more favored due to low attenuation of red light through living tissues. Higher wavelength light can pass through living tissue easily because most living tissues consist of blood and they are red which means they absorb lights of wave length below red light.
In this experiment, we wish to show that mKeima can be brighter, stable and more quantitatively informative than common fluorescent proteins such as eGFP and mRFP. pCSTA.mKeima, pCSTA.eGFP and pCSTA.mRFP are first amplified in tubes overnight. Then their OD600 is measured and their density is normalized with dilution. The normalized cultures are grown in 96 wells plate over a glucose gradient in LB media with antibiotics overnight in platereader at 37C. Kinetic data is obtained over 12 hours at 20 minute intervals.

Graphs above show the fluorescent readouts at the end point of experiment. For kinetics data, please refer to the original excel file for more detail.
In this experiment only 200uL (in each well) of living bacteria culture is measured. Hence, the fluorescent readouts are expected to be low. The purpose of this is to test the ability of each fluorescent protein to give out dependable quantitative data at tiny scale which is exactly the scale which most molecular experiments are done. pCSTA"

Darwin Toolbox
Darwin Toolbox is our first product towards making synthetic biology more accessible. Key design considerations were ease of use and affordability. Our first version contains the core tools for biotechnology. Darwin Toolbox will also effortlessly connect to a computer and synchronise experimental data such as pictures of gel runs, PCR profiles and timestamps. Future iterations of the Darwin Toolbox will include features such as synthetic biology breadboarding and networking to other boxes. Darwin Toolbox will ship with all the necessary accessories, such as pipettes and tubes, as well as a highly curated selection of reagents.

Leading on from this, Prof. Groundwater suggested pig-liver (porcine) esterase as an enzyme to be considered for our scaffold. He indicated how this could be very useful in the biocatalytic synthesis of Paclitaxel and Levofloxacin.

Theory
Fig.6 The carotenogenic pathway
crtYB, crtI, and crtE are originate from X. dendrorhous. Just as shown above, the carotenogenic pathway in X. dendrorhous consists of GGPP synthase encoded by crtE, the bifunctional enzyme phytoene synthase and lycopene cyclase encoded by crtYB, and phytoene desaturase encoded by crtI. S. cerevisiae contains a GGPP synthase, encoded by BTS1, which is able to convert FPP into GGPP. HMG1 encodes HMG-CoA reductase, which is the main regulatory point in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in many organisms. IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate. (René Verwaal, et al, 2007)
Like X. dendrorhous, S. cerevisiae is able to produce FPP and converts it into GGPP, the basic building block of carotenoids. Conversion of FPP into GGPP is catalyzed by GGPP synthase encoded by BTS1 in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, overexpression of only crtYB and crtI from X. dendrorhous in S. cerevisiae should generally be sufficient to transform S. cerevisiae into a β-carotene-producing organism. Additional overexpression of crtE from X. dendrorhous or BTS1 from S. cerevisiae will increase GGPP levels and thereby enhance β-carotene production.
Verification
We succeeded to integrate this part into the chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by homologous recombination. With the expression of β-carotene, cell is orange. The result is showed below:

Conclusions
After a great summer of hard work, we've learned quite a few things. The most important are listed below.
Temperature sensitivity - Protein measurements
Due to the fact it is impossible to state that lysis has a constant efficiency, it is not possible to take the cell density before lysis as a value for correcting luciferase activity. Therefore it is important to measure something in the soluble fraction of your sample correlating to actual biomass . We decided to use a total protein content (Bicinchoninic acid assay) for the value to correct luciferase activity by. However, the lysis buffer (of unknown composition) in the luciferase assay kit interfered with our protein measurements. To prevent this interference we tried precipitating the protein in the samples using 4 different methods to get rid of the (unknown) interfering agent in the buffer. Although calibration curves which were first treated with lysis buffer and then precipitated varied from quite linear (R2=0.983) to not linear at all (R2<0), samples containing the soluble fraction of lysed cells, usually gave protein contents of below 0 mg/ml.
A different approach to solve this problem of lysis buffer interference was trying various different lysis methods, including sonication, using glass beads in a fastprep or using lysozyme and glass sand in a bead beater. Although it looked like all these methods destroy some of the activity of luciferase in the sample, time was lacking to optimize each method. The sonication protocol, although time consuming, seemed most reliable in our experiments. Still, this method"

Kent,2014,Team:Kent#minutes_-_-_TEXT.html," disregard them and move on to another sequence. 
The sequences that we have are quite long so we would need to look at using Gibson assembly in order to synthesise them, rather than PCR 
We need to design primers (16-20bp) and when finished send them off to Wei-Feng and Mark to look over.  
When creating these need to think about the following: 
-Melting temperatures of all the primers are similar 
-They don’t form a self-complementary structure 
-Can the primers self-associate? 
When designing the primers there is online software that can be used  
Was   suggested about using light activating promoters and we can change   between different fragrances using different light.  This was thought to   be a good on-going idea but we need to get the basics sorted out first. 
Also was suggested about thinking about how we could use diffusion calculations to help our project. 
The Teams Wiki 
The Wiki is being worked on by Alex and Taylor, and was decided we should aim for a simple minimalistic approach to the Wiki (the Google effect).  
Was also suggested to stick to creating a wiki rather than a webpage as it is more unusual and may help us to stand out more.

Notices:
-The lab form has been completed and sent off to iGEM 
-The next safety form is due on Monday 21/7- Alex said he would look over it. 
-Sheffield trip is on Friday 18/07 and Alex and Ellie will be representing the team, need to take lots of photos and try to make connections with other teams. 
Project Work:
Currently got 5 sequences can realistically only afford to sequence 2 genes. £600 maximum budget has been put on the sequences by Wei-Feng. 
So we need to decide on the 2 genes that we are going to synthesize.   
Was strongly urged that we order the sequence in vector form as it will be much easier to handle.  Extra restriction sites need to be added so that the Gibson assembly method can still be used if needed to be. 
Need to also decide on the strain of Ecoli that we want to use, current thoughts that top 10 should be ok and K12 should be sufficient.  
Tasks needed for next week:
-Logo design for the poster and Sheffield presentation needs to be sorted 
-Feedback from the Sheffield meet up 
-Look for recording equipment to help make videos to go on the wiki 
-Need   to make a start on the Wiki; upload all files onto the"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," for the circularization construct with both the lambda lysozyme and ccdb insert were ok for both pSBX4C5 and 1K3. Moreover, we designed oligos to clone linear lambda lysozyme with his6 and exteins by Golden Gate assembly. This was needed to prove circularization of lambda lysozyme with his6 linker on a western blot.
The lysozyme assays were further evaluated and we have seen more strange results. We decided to have a closer look on the different errors occurring in the process of the assay and refined it again, to see the variability in wells, that should contain the same material. Furthermore we decided that a new substrate for lysozyme would be needed and we found a promising approach, that we want to test next week. We also decided to try some enzyme-kinetics modelling on the lysozyme data, that hopefully would make the analysis of the data more easy.
Wet lab:
Linear lambda lysozyme with his6 and exteins was successfully created by Golden gate cloning. A new attempt to get circular lamba lysozyme with a flexible linker failed, this time by cloning the linker insert into the circularization construct with lambda lysozyme and ccdb.
In this week we performed many assays with the new circularized lysozymes to see a shift in temperature behaviour for the different kind of lysozyme. The results weren't that clear, so we tested many different temperatures. We also saw, that activity goes down for circular lysozymes at 75°C, whereas activity of linear lysozyme there has a maximum.
Software:
A version of the linkersoftware for distribution was started, butthere were many problems, as it is quite memory consuming. Therefore this took us lots of work to rewrite the software, so that it takes less RAM of the clients.Also the workflow of the in silico screening needed to be implemented, where the linker team was needed.Another big effort has been made in the analysis of the archdb database, where a new sort of plots was made. Now analysis can be much easier and the preliminary linker patterns were fixed. A problem was that the dnmt1 and the lysozyme group waited heavily for good linkers.
In this week the analysis of the lysozyme assays was refined. Real error bars were included and also fitting of Michaelis-Menten kinetics was included. But the fitting of Michaelis-Menten kinetics isn't as reliable as we would need it to be for an automatic analysis.

It is also very sensitive to cold, so taking the flasks out of the incubator to take samples can have an impact on the growth speed. These small adjustments come with experience, and because the other teams are much more used to working with E.coli they treated the organism similarly, which worked well, but not as well as it did in our lab (after we gained experience). We think these small tricks created the difference between our growth curves. With experience it would be possible for them to achieve the same growth rate we started with growth curves that only reached an OD600 of about 1, and now we are able to produce ones with an OD600 of 14.
 
GFP/LUX
From all the data that we gathered from this experiment we formed an opinion on whether GFP measurements are adequate to realize the InterLab studies full potential. We think that by replacing GFP by Lux and measuring luminescence instead of fluorescence we could make a more universal experiment, easier to reproduce not only from lab to lab, but also from organism to organism. One of the Lux operon advantages is the almost complete absence of background signal without reporter expression. This is the reason why the Lux operon is suitable to analyze extremely low levels of expression caused by weak promoters or terminator readthrough. We also noticed we have a lower detection threshold when using Lux in our lab, which is why we did all measurements using Lux. The variability in the interLab results, represented by the large error bars and the order of strength changing, is in part a result of the low accuracy of GFP measurements in general. With fluorescence there is an excitation beam that produces light scattering and can falsify your emission measurement, resulting less accurate data. Lux has a lower detection threshold because there is no light being emitted to excite the Chromophore, instead a chemical reaction causes luciferin to emit light. There is no background! One big drawback of Lux is that it would be much more difficult to calibrate. For GFP, you can simply use a known concentration of fluorescein.
 
General
Organization
First of all, we were surprised by how complicated it was organizing and running an InterLab study. Writing universally understandable protocols for students on different levels of knowledge proved difficult. We only had to manage 11 teams, but this small number should not be underestimated. Each country has its own postage rules, which we had to learn about before we could send anything. 11 packages, each with about 40 aliquots needed to be prepared, labeled and wrapped individually took a lot of manpower and patience to pack.

Modeling Details of Repressilator
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

My name is Kevin Huang, a 21-year-old student from Nanjing University majoring in life science.  During my leisure time, I love to play basketball and read comics, and I have a degree of understanding of both of them.  I am a person fond of thinking, which is why I'm suitable for doing researches.  This is my first time to participate in such an international competition, iGEM, and I believe I can learn a lot from it.

TEC-CHIHUAHUA team
Model a sequence using our software tools & GMOS ‘S regulation in France
Our collaboration with the team Chihuahua started on the 10th of July. We first did a skype to present teams and projects.                     They were interested in our model part, so we offered them our help using our model softwares to get a clearer view about the possible interactions of their enzymes together.                     In order to do so, we used the website Phyre2 to model the only sequence not present in the PBD register: yhiH.
We tested the sequence during all July. Using Phyre2, the molecule was modeled with high reliability and corresponding to other existing close models.                     Using Pymol, we studied the molecule’s identity matching.
We provided a document about the French regulation to help them with their Human project to develop a new law for GMOs regulation in Mexico.
They helped us to build our interactive map, providing us information about synthetic biology in their country and spreading two of our surveys: the first one to their society to understand the society’s GMO perception, and the second one was for their winemakers in Chihuahua.                     They organised a skype with a winemaker, in which we had the chance to interact directly with her and talk about climate disorder, how it affects their vineyards and know their opinion on using SofterShock as a potential solution.
The results from the collaboration were very satisfactory: their sequence was very likely to be the one obtained by experimentation, we obtained several feedbacks from the society and winemakers, and they had extra elements to write a new law for Mexico.
""Besides good friends, the collaboration with IONIS team brought us some improvements in our project, mainly in our modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH”. Based on bibliography and the enzyme optimal conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behaviors, among other things. We hoped we helped you as much as you did, thank you so much!”

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," our design?
This year’s iGEM team Hamburg was very diverse including students from many unexpected faculties. We had a psychologist monitoring our work, helping with our communicational issues and structures, as well as counseling people who faced troublesome issues in the project or personal. We also had a graphic department, which had the task to create a corporate design and an overall marketing concept.  Of course, we had a diverse field of natural scientists, too  who covered the actual synthetic biology part.
Scientific, we had three half-autonomous groups which each had their specific tasks and goals to fulfill, but also cooperated on anything. Our chemists had the assignment to synthesize our target siderophores ahead of time to test our hypothesis if the compounds work and how they function. Therefore, we had an organic synthesis of each pyochelin, nor-pyochelin and desferriothicin, we monitored the complexation of gallium with each siderophore, a measurement that hasn’t been done yet, and utilized the chemically synthesized siderophore complexes to test the toxicity while also figuring out MIC-values.
The synthetic biology department had to develop and produce the corresponding biobricks and the biological testing system as well as preparing bacterial and human cell cultures. As the core section of our project, most lab and design hours were spent in the development here. For the core project 4 composite parts consisting of 12 basic parts were designed to express 2 different types of siderophores. While our other composite parts were designed to express transport systems to create E. coli testing strains for Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore-gallium complexes.
For our nanotechnology department we reserved the last and most fancy part: Toxicological experiments to mimic a real therapy in a lung-on-a-chip microfluidic device. Therefore, a microfluidic device had to be designed and casted that allows a coculture of alveolar and endothelial cells that we can infect with pseudomonades. Luckily, we could rely on former results by the Harvard Wyss institute, who developed a sophisticated device that suits our needs. Eventually we could create a slightly less complicated microfluidic chip to mimic the testing device invented by Harvard. Since the coculturing and measurement proved to be very difficult we could not measure results before the Wiki-freeze.
What’s next? Mycobactin derivatives targeting multiresistant tuberculosis.
As described earlier, we derived a specific set of methods that allows the development of any siderophore-gallium therapies, specifically those that are based on salicylate"

In addition to secreting antibiofilm/antimicrobial proteins, a comprehensive treatment for UTIs would be a bacteria engineered to also sense and move towards biofilms. We conducted extensive literature review on this in the early stages of the project but, due to the time restraints of a summer project, could not put our ideas into practice. With further work, we would incorporate both a sensing and chemotaxis mechanism into our design.
Our modelling of diffusion out of the biobeads showed that we would need too great a number of biobeads for this to be realistic design approach. To overcome this problem we would need unrealistically efficient enzymes or unrealistically high protein synthesis rates. The other way around this is to create a system that provides a high local concentration of antibiofilm/antimicrobial agents at the point that is needed. A high local concentration could be achieved by introducing free-living bacteria into the urinary tract. This idea is explored extensively in the Practices part of the project.
Nurses, doctors and professors all raised to us the issue of targeting the multiple bacterial and fungal species that are involved in UTIs, highlighting the fact that the problem extends further than E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Again, we have explored how we would approach this in the Practices page.

Eat it? Think about it? No way? Visitors were introduced to a variety of engineered foods, both currently available and in development, and asked their opinion on consuming the goods. Items included vanilla flavoring, caffeine, and milk synthesized by yeast, a food pill that provided all daily nutrients, golden rice, and meat created in a lab. Participants were also introduced to different ways we have modified agriculture like selective breeding, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology.
Tech Tokens
Visitors would be introduced to a wide range of applications for synthetic biology to start a conversation among the visitors on the level of importance of each application. Each visitor at the table was given a stack of colored coins to represent their opinion. They would place all their coins on the application(s) most important to them and then we would all discuss their choices and reasoning. An additional activity was to give each person at the table a character card with occupations ranging from president of the U.S. to Canadian college student. They would repeat the process of placing coins, but this time in the mindset of the occupation they were given.
Build Your Own Bacteria
This station combines science, art and play to present an analogy for synthetic biology. First, participants used legos to build their own plasmid, mixing and matching different parts. Different legos were used as an analogy for BioBricks, and contained pieces such as promoters and terminators. Visitors were able to pick what physical characteristics they wanted their bacteria to have, such as body color and number of legs, by picking the appropriate lego BioBricks. Then, participants were able to draw the bacteria they just built on our worksheet.
Make Your Own LB Broth
How do scientists feed their bacteria? Visitors learned about LB broth and were able to make their own “imitation LB broth” by mixing lemonade powder and water. To make their mixture, participants weighed out the proper amount of powder using a scale and measured out the correct amount of water using beakers.
Colorful Creations
Science is an art! Participants were able to try pipetting food coloring into test tubes with water, and then mix different shades to make their own colorful creations.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.

Creating a new Biobrick
Creating a new BioBrick
How does it work?
There are three levels of BioBrick parts: parts, devices and systems.  Parts are the building blocks and encode basic biological functions  (such as encoding a certain protein, or providing a promoter to let RNA polymerase  bind and initiate transcription of downstream sequences.
You can choose what part type you want convert to BioBrick standard, you can tick between:
Protein Sequence Coding
Protein coding sequences encode the amino acid sequence of a particular protein. Note that some protein coding sequences only encode a protein domain or half a protein. Others encode a full-length protein from start codon to stop codon. Besides, you can choose a codon optimization depending on a specific organism.
DNA
DNA sequence with a known function which can't be automatically optimized due to possible functional losses.
Characterized Sequence
DNA parts provide functionality to the DNA itself. DNA parts include cloning sites, scars, primer binding sites, spacers, recombination sites, conjugative tranfer elements, transposons, origami, and aptamers.
To use your own sequence, simply write or paste your raw DNA sequence in 5'-3' or upload your raw DNA sequence using TXT or FASTA format files.                 For FASTA format files, if your files have incorrect or missing characters, it has to be                 fixed beforehand. For multiFASTA files, this aplication only reads the first sequence                 For TXT files, aplication will read every character inside the file, so after it has to                 erase the information not useful.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," relevance to further test high RelE production in this model, as a high number of complexes will easily be achieved.
Light Sensitivity
One thing the model does not include, is the actual sensitivity to light. Out in the open, the amount of light is rarely an on/off switch, which means there will be periods with varying degrees of activation. Since the bacteria should be active during overcast days, the system requires a threshold, both in the sensitivity of the light-regulated promoter, but also in the activation of the toxin-antitoxin system. Variation of light is implicitly modelled through variation in promoter strength, for instance a half probability of activation translates roughly to a half production rate in the individual bacteria. Because of this, it is important not only to find functioning configurations, but also to investigate the closely related configurations, so that the bacteria neither lay dormant at overcast days, nor make the dormancy system obsolete in moonlight.
Close
Approach
In 2004 the Austen and UCSF iGEM team created a device sensitive to light, laying the foundation for the Coliroid project . In this project, the system is combined with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system in the endeavour to mediate light-dependent dormancy in bacteria. As tight regulation is required for the RelE-RelB system Tashiro Y, Kawata K, Taniuchi A, Kakinuma K, May T, Okabe S. RelE-Mediated Dormancy Is Enhanced at High Cell Density in Escherichia coli. J Bacteriol. 2012;194(5):1169-76. , modelling of the toxin-antitoxin system is essential. The impact of different RelE-RelB expression levels was simulated by modelling. Using the results obtained by this modelling, a hypothetical working system-design was devised.
On basis of the modulated system, the potential of different vectors and promoters in various combinations was tested. This constitutes the foundation for how the design of the light-dependent dormancy system in E. coli has been optimised, and the final approach shaped. Ultimately, the light-dependent dormancy system, which is illustrated in Figure 3, was composed of the following parts:
The photocontrol device controlled by the PenI-regulated promoter, BBa_R0074 , on a high copy vector.
The antitoxin RelB controlled by pBAD, BBa_K2449031 , on a low copy vector.
The toxin RelE controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_R0082 ,"

Backend
The backend is a software that runs on the Raspberry Pi and is responsible for the connection between the GUI and the hardware. If the user interface is executed on another device, e.g. a notebook, it has to be in the same network as the Raspberry Pi. The backend works like a web server that receives commands and acts according to the submitted parameters. It can take images and returns them to the GUI.
Before an image is taken, the backend turns on the specified LEDs by sending a command to the connected Arduino board. Subsequently, the LEDs are turned off using the same mechanism. These steps are repeated in the given interval for a time lapse shooting.

Sample connection between GUI and backend for taking an image
Arduino
The software on the Arduino board sets the power and thus controls the temperature of the Peltier heater. The power is set by evaluating the received values from the temperature sensors for the interior of the device and the aluminum block. Additionally, the Arduino receives commands from the Raspberry Pi to turn the LEDs on and off.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," as it had the unexplained single amino acid difference to the closest available sequence. For our plasmid backbones, we decided to use ones we had available in our lab: to express MlrA in E. coli , we used pET28a, which is well suited for efficient IPTG-inducible protein expression in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). It is a similar plasmid to the pET21a used by Dziga et al. in their successful experiments, with only minor differences such as antibiotic resistance.
For yeast, as there were no available plasmid backbones for yeast in the BioBricks registry, we decided to use pRS415-GAL. This plasmid is well suited for protein expression inducible by galactose. Although we could have designed our insert to be cloned into the backbone using the XbaI restriction enzyme on the 5’ end, we reasoned that using biobrick-compatible restriction sites would potentially undermine the expression of our construct. Having the XbaI restriction site directly upstream of the protein coding sequence, as the use of the BioBricks suffix requires, would result in a T as the -3 base upstream of the start codon. It has been reported that in eukaryotic translation initiation, the -3 base is optimally an A or G (Kozak, 1996). This base is key in defining translation initiation, as changing it into a T or C increases sensitivity to differences in other bases upstream of the start codon. Cavener et al. (1991) on the other hand showed that yeast has a strong bias for A in this position. Nakagawa et al. (2008) concurred with this conclusion, in addition to pointing out a strong bias for G as the base following the start codon. Because our protein sequence didn’t contain this feature, we reasoned that having a suitable upstream sequence would be doubly important.
As fusing an additional, designed consensus sequence upstream of the protein coding sequence could have unforeseen consequences, we decided to clone our inserts into the plasmid using the SpeI and XhoI restriction sites (5’ and 3’ respectively), as these had been previously used in our lab to successfully express proteins in the same plasmid. Coincidentally, having a SpeI directly upstream of the start codon results in a favorable base (A) in the -3 position. Although this meant incompatibility with the BioBrick RFC 10 assembly standard, we decided it was better to be certain that any potential failure to express the"

Q4: The desirable design for eliminating bacterial spill is to immediately knockout the construct                             containing GM gene without the delay of recombinase or endonuclease expression. Thus, one question                             raised would be ‘When and in which scenario should time delay be used?’ if time delay is not                             used in the accidental release of GM bacteria.
Time delay can be useful in laboratory experiments where GM bacteria should not last for so long                             time. This does not require modification of bacteria having genetic code dependent on some nutrients                             to survive nor require the activation of toxin killing GM organism in the culture. Thus, safer                             extraction of proteins (both secreted and non-secreted) can be achieved with no contamination                             of toxic compounds. Additionally, we would not need to worry about any changes in the organism’s                             genomic content..

FUTURE SUGGESTIONS
Suggest for an alternative way of resolving the leakiness of promoters,pluxR
We suggest that expressing our construct in gram-positive bacteria may avoid leaky expression                                 due to an auto-activation of pluxR. Gram-positive bacterium has SAM molecules that are conserved                                 in both gram-positive and gram-negative species. However, gram-positive bacteria do not use                                 the same communication pathway. It employs two component systems called oligopeptide auto-inducers,                                "

Tongji-software team
In the process of our project, we had some difficulty in network visualization. Just then Tongji-software team got in touch with us. They had some problem in the COBRA toolbox, hoping to get some help from us. Since they had completed the visualization work, they could help us with front-end visualization. So we decided to communicate face to face.
On September 23rd, we met each other in our lab. Tongji-software gave us some suggestions on network visualization and showed us how D3.js package was used. They helped us to deploy the package with an example. And we taught them the FVA function in COBRA toolbox and some methods to do gene knockout analysis on the result of flux balance analysis as well. They added this function into their software later.
Besides the communication on projects, our team leader Yangzhen Wei shared some experience in Giant Jamboree as an old iGEMer. What’s more, he shared some tips about transportation, climate, sightseeing in Boston.
USTC-software team
After completing our tool box, we invited USTC-software to run our β test. And they gave us some feedbacks. They pointed out problems on user guiding, and gave us their opinions. Then we improved our software in the way they recommended, making our software more user-friendly.
We also participated in their test. Their software, Biohub was an experiment process recording tool. It was convenient for process-experiment recording. Creating process module and sharing them in the community facilitated the communication between researchers. We gave them advices on visualization and multithreading experiment recording. In the end, we exchanged some of the visualization methods.

Synthetic Biology Design Course
Dr. Richard Anthony teaches a course in the spring to give students some insight to Synthetic Biology and to work on exploring and brainstorming ideas that can be turned into projects for the iGEM competition. ""This course focuses on the design of novel biological parts, devices and systems, and their use in engineering cell function. Bioengineering principles and the design of genetic logic circuits, memory modules, biosensors and other cellular devices will be addressed. For the final project, students will design a novel biological system that meets the standards and goals of the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition"" [1]. Two of our summer team members, Elisa and Emilie, enrolled in this course. We began having weekly meetings and brainstorming project ideas during our spring quarter, beginning March 5th. Ideas between our summer team's meetings and the class were exchanged, but we did not decide on the PEBBLE project until our summer team arrived on June 4th.
Starting June 6th, we began work in our Synthetic Biology laboratory and learned the basic protocols we would be using throughout the project. Throughout the summer, we worked ~40 hour weeks, furthering our outreach, modeling, design, and wiki portions. The last of our ordered DNA parts arrived on July 18th, so we began full work on the lab portion of our project in mid-July.

We recently had a chat via Skype with the Germany based multitalented artist, discussing the possibility of working together in an attempt to initially get the public interested and, in a long term, involved in science based research. His approach is the obvious one: “We produce art and make it public”.
Engaging with the public via this straight forward approach inspired us to be more optimistic about the link between science and public awareness and engagement. Manuel agreed to work with team SPECTRA, because: “Cancer is such a devastating development within the body. Raising awareness is very important. I like aspects of competitions like iGEM, especially that it shows research from a different point of view – more accessible, like I try to do within my art.”
Interacting with other teams
We had kept a close connection with UCL Undergrads team, Spotless Mind. We helped each other in resources and sharing ideas. Coming from Cancer Insitute, we gave away many clues of cell cultures and cloning.
Attending YSB 1.0 is a so much fun. We met many teams across Europe, presented our idea, slides and posters, and received many valuable feedback from all the teams.
Following that, we established collaborative contact with iGEM team from Exeter after knowing we are both working on photosensitive circuits.

 HOME HUMAN PRACTICES SAFETY NOTE RESULTS PARTS PROJECT TEAM
Our team has been working on the iGEM-2016 project for two years. In this project, we used rice (Oryza sativa L.) as chassis organism to produce a genetically modified organism (GMO) named aSTARice, which enables biosynthesis of astaxanthin in the rice endosperm. To achieve this goal, four genes derived from maize, algae, and bacteria, respectively, were expressed under the control of endosperm-specific promoters. We have successed in detection of astaxanthin in the endosperm of resultant aSTARice.
In the human practice, we have successfully held several public activities such as open laboratory day, a Bauhinia Scientific and Cultural Festival in our university, which attracted hundreds and thousands of people to visit a laboratory of molecular biology, to understand how is a GMO generated in the lab. We gave several biology courses for middle and primary school students. Therefore, we have promoted the knowledge of synthetic biology and the impact of iGEM in our project.
Achievements
1. We have used rice as a bioreactor to produce astathanxin in rice endosperm.
2. The experiences and BioBricks we developed are helpful for plant iGEMers in future.
3. The heterogenous genes in our parts have been codon-optimized for plants.
4. We have achieved selection marker-free transgenic plants using Cre/loxp site-specific recombination strategy.
5. Our experimental design has been worked out as aSTARice.
1. Risk assessment and marker free system are the efforts we made to deal with the safety issue.
2. We successfully improve the performance of the previously existing BioBrick BBa_K118003
3. Our BioBrick devices work well under the lab condition.
4. Our BioBrick devices work well under the greenhouse condition.
1. BBa_K1959002 works well and has been documented in the Registry entry.
2. We help the students of Guangdong Experimental High School to set up the team named GDSYZX-United and assist them to finish the iGEM project.

We were not the only team working on optical switch-CcaS/R, Team_SDU-China(2018) also  worked on it. We communicated with each other about the data and stressed the importance of the ""leakage expression"". What's more, Team_HZAU-China(2017) worked on it too and modified the pathway  to make it a 2.0 version, which makes it have a lower leakage expression.We wrote in wiki that in the next iGEM season we may improve our system, actually we may try the DNA that HZAU modified at that time!"

Therefore, what we proposed was one more choice for them and they were glad to hear                                                  that E. coli and contribute to CCS & U (Carbon Capture Storage and Utilization).
Part2. Customer demand investigation
The research and development of new technologies,                                                      which level will be considered to mature and worthy investing specifically?
There are three conditions:
1) Feasibility of laboratory technology: It’s okay with technical confirmation.
2) Feasibility of engineering: It’s feasible under engineering equipment construction,                                                      application of space and on-site environmental conditions.
3) Feasibility of economic: total cost (input, output) must be positive benefits.
There is a problem of limited space in Taiwan, how much space that we need to reduce at least in the enterprise?
This proposition should be how much CO2 the technology can absorb per unit area.                                                     Based on this basis, industrial will evaluate the existing space of the factory,                                                      consider how much CO2 can be absorbed, and investment cost of equipment. Therefore, a certain amount of CO2 can be reduced. We will also calculate the input and output to evaluate if it has positive benefit.
We will consider the secondary cost of waste disposal,                                                      just like the application of CSC unit in basic-oxygen-furnace slag,                                                      will you consider the cost of waste recycling be beneficial?                                                      Or is there a problem caused by China Steel and secondary pollution?
This part cannot be provided due to operational confidentiality.                                                      It is recommended that this proposition should be turned into be directly used as a marketable product. The cost of the resource should be assessed by the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a whole.
Since our project is facing the problem of the higher cost of culture medium,                                                      we would like to ask the question about the benefit of carbon fixation and cost of carbon fixation method.
The cost of carbon fixation depends on the carbon capture and storage methods used.                                                      For example, the calcium circuit developed by the Industrial Research Institute is used to capture carbon.                                                      The recent cost of carbon capture is intended to be reduced to US$30 per ton, and US$10 per ton of geological storage is required.                                                      Competition between carbon capture methods can be assessed by cost and overall utilization of reuse.
Regarding the part of industry-university cooperation,                                                    Why CSC chose to cooperate with Annan Campus in NCKU for microalgae carbon fixation.

In iGEM it is all about collaborating! Throughout the summer we have been in contact with multiple iGEM teams from all over the world to improve our projects, benefit from one another's ideas and also because working together is always more fun.
UCL iGEM Bootcamp Mini Jamboree
In collaboration with the London Biohackspace and Birkbeck College, we hosted an intensive, gruelling bootcamp that enlightened the attendees about various biobrick assembly protocols, biohacking, automation, and softwares associated with synthetic biology. The bootcamp culminated in a fascinating mini Jamboree, which featured all our iGEM projects, wiki and modeling tutorials, and even a DIY Spectrophotometer made in 1 week!
London iGEM Meet-up
iGEM teams around London met up on 31st of July at Birkbeck and presented the current progress of their research projects to each other, followed by a poster session and time for socialising. The teams involved were: UCL, Birkbeck, London Biohackspace, Westminster and Kent.
2014 Aalto-Helsinki Team: Blue-Light-Response Element
In order to use our constructs as personalised treatment devices, we collaborated with the Aalto-Helsinki team to use the blue-light-response element they created in 2014. The idea is to have a handheld/mobile device that can emit blue light and induce expression of out constructs when needed.

6. Determine whether compounds with positive scores have natural transporters in cell. If so, mark the compound as candidate.
7. Add each candidate to the growth media and the run FVA under optimal growth rate computed in Step 2. Compare the production rate from novel model (step 7) to that from the raw model (step 2), if the rate is improved, mark the compound as an effector.
Graphical user interface (GUI) development - Creating OSCAR Optimizer
The GUI allows for easier use of our program by everyone in iGEM and beyond. This will enable individuals to use our program who are inexperienced with programming programs such as MATLAB and/or the Cobra Toolbox.  We developed the GUI using the GUIDE program designed in MATLAB.  For more information please see our manual.
Code
This application is a Matlab extension that runs on top of the Cobra Toolbox and SBML Toolbox. To run the application, one must have the Cobra Toolbox and SBML Toolbox installed.  SBML Toolbox can download from SBML.org or here . Cobra Toolbox can download from openCOBRA or here . Application Package and source code download .
Demo
Below is an uploaded tutorial to show anyone how to use the GUI of the OSCAR Optimizer.  The GUI interface allows for easy building of different synthetic constructs into the E. coli network but this could based on any model from any organism that is available in SBML format.
Screen Shots of Our Application
Wet-lab validation of OSCAR Optimizer
We tested our OSCAR Optimizer FVA Model in the wet-lab by assessing if a suite of identified compounds  would increase the output of the Petrobrick. Therefore we ran the model with the AAR and ADC gene components of the Petrobrick system and looked at the predicted metabolites for growth media supplementation (Figure 5).
Figure 5: OSCAR Optimizer output for increase hydrocarbon production in OSCAR. This program identified a series of metabolites that are predicted to increase hydrocarbon output, including fructose and AMP with the highest outputs suggesting that their presence should contribute to increased product output the most.
Once these compounds were identified, we set-up an assay where we supplemented minimal M9 media and glucose with each of the compounds alone, or in combination. Compounds were added at concentrations of 50 mM except for Ethanol (2.5% v/v), AMP (100mg/L), and L-aspartate"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Background Information
Cell Free Protein Synthesis Systems
Cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems are capable of performing transcription and translation of exogenous DNA in vitro. CFPS systems have been in use for many decades (Nirenberg & Matthaei, 1961), however the field of synthetic biology has resulted in a CFPS renaissance (Lu, 2017; Lee & Kim, 2013). Commonly, CFPS systems are based on cell extracts, which provide the transcription/translation machinery, as well as enzymes required to generate ATP required for protein synthesis. While CFPS systems have a lot of potential, they also suffer from some drawbacks. Two of the major issues are the large variation in CFPS activity between cell extracts (Katsura, et al., 2017), and the high costs compared to whole cells (although cost have been reduced significantly in the past decade) (Carlson, et al., 2012). These issues can hinder the uptake of CFPS systems as an alternative chassis to whole cells, and as research tools.
Show/hide more information about the CFPS premix
Cells extracts being used in CFPS systems tend to be supplemented with a cocktail of compounds and molecules to aid the process of transcription and translation (Figure 1). Although exact supplement solutions can vary from protocol to protocol, most have the same basic composition; salts, nucleotides, tRNAs, co-factors, energy sources, and amino acids (Yang, et al., 2012). The supplement solution used in this study is based on the Cytomin system (Jewett, et al., 2008). For the cytomin supplement solution, the major energy source is sodium pyruvate, which is converted to acetate through a series of reactions catalysed by enzymes in the crude cell extract. The first reaction, pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, requires nicotinamide diphosphate (NAD) and Co-enzyme A (CoA) as co-factors. Both of these are components of the premix and hence added to the system to enhance flux through the reaction. The acetyl CoA is phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate, and then de-phosphorylated to produce ATP from ADP. The ATP is"

According to Machiel, no antibiotics are given to cows (in the Netherlands) unless they are sick. This is potentially different in the chicken and pig industry, which he suggested us to look into. Furthermore, he recommended research in para-infectious diseases, i.e. diseases spread via manure (e.g. Bovine Virus Diarrhoea).
With regards to our tool, Machiel thinks this would be very useful. However, the tool should then neither be too complicated, nor take a lot of time, as farmers generally do not have much spare time.

(1) The Wastewater treatment plant of Science Park
When we talk about water disposal, the first thing comes into our mind would be wastewater treatment plant (WTP) since most water that is contaminated or used by humanity would all eventually go to WTP. Thus, WTP becomes our primary target for practicing and working out our idea. In September, we went to WTP of National Science Park for investigation and sampling. There were three engineers in WTP who helped us realize the whole plant including monitoring station. We learned much about how WTP dispose of the wastewater step by step and also how they control the system:
1. Before entering the plant, nearly most wastewater has undergone treatment by each company. Actually, the inlet water is not that dirty as what we supposed but it still contains lots of metal ions and molecules that need to be rid of. And in these years, the main issue in WTP is ammonia nitrogen degradation. Targets like EDCs are not what WTP concern, engineer Chang said. EDCs’ concentration in wastewater is too low since the water coming in from all sorts of factories dilute it. The main harmful substances left are still a lot of ammonia nitrites and heavy metals added by Chang.
2. The visit to the monitoring station helped us a lot in dry lab design. This plant is one of the most novel plants which applies testing Ammonia nitrides disposal plant and an alto control system. This testing plant is built because of the rising attention of Ammonia nitrides and the alto control system installed for the purpose of reduction of complicated control steps. Unfortunately, the first renovation, again, implies that EDCs probably is not a priority WTP. However, the alto control system does make us realize the importance of automatic control system and IoT(internet of things). Since the engineers, all use the smartphone APP to receive first information of every disposal plant so it inspired us to develop an APP and we made it !!! On the other hand, Based on the prototype alto-control system we have seen there, we conceived an idea to combine alert, buzzer, e-mail, newsletter and a real-time website dis"

Place promotors BBa_J23109 , BBa_J23100 , and BBa_J23106 in front of GVP in either the plasmid of the promotor or the GVP-cluster
TODO make a cloning strategy for best assembly, and get familiar with procedure
Gel purification has to be obtimised for the standard plasmid purification kit, or a specialised kit has to be ordered TODO
Primers/Oligo's for three metal induced promotors should arive
TODO select vector to ligate fragment in for boibrick storage
TODO ligate parts directly infront of GVP-cluster
Expression of GVP genes in E.coli TOP10 cells test strategy
TODO start can be test in 50mL tubes and compare ""floating"" of cells with and without plasmid
TODO the test tube of 1 meter in lenght can be a good follow up test if floatation is observed
Clone GVP-cluster from vector BBa_J61035 to the high / low copy number vector
TODO deside together with persons from"
