General
Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium which can be found almost everywhere, especially in soil. It can form a protective endospore to resist extreme environmental conditions.
We decided to work with this organism, because Bacillus subtilis is a bacteria, which naturally secretes proteins and enzymes into its surrounding medium.
The goal was to utilise this attribute for enzyme production and create a “cell factory”. Instead of lysating bacteria, it was desired to have a continuous production of enzymes in a liquid culture that we can extract from the supernatant.
Repeated inoculations of new bacteria cultures are not necessary, because they will stay in the stationary phase. Only the media has to be replaced.
Bacillus subtilis is classified as a GRAS-organism (general regarded as safe) by the U. S. Food & Drug administration and widely used in S1 laboratories as a model organism. It is also present in economy as probiotics in pharmacies or fungicide in agriculture.
Furthermore biotechnological applications already use Bacillus subtilis to synthesize enzymes.
Usage
For using our product we currently have two different approaches.
Either just using the supernatant to deink our paper fibers or make the time intensive and expensive step of purifying our enzymes and then proceed with deinking the paper. For purification we attached a His-tag to our enzymes to separate them from other components of the supernatant with nickel columns.
In order to reach the project goals plasmids containing the needed genes had to be transformed into the bacteria.
We worked with two different Bacillus subtilis strains which were donated by the department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology of the Greifswald University, Germany.
We got the wild type strain ATCC 6051 as well as the promising LS8P-D strain. The LS8P-D stain is a derivate from the protease-deficient WB800 strain, where two additionally genes were deleted. The lack of proteases is essential to secrete our enzymes without damaging them.
After trying out multiple protocols, we decided to accomplish transformation by electroporation. The principle of electroporation relies on creating small holes in the cell wall of bacteria, by sending a current through"

Both teams were not only able to successfully electroporate E. coli cells, but also obtained results similar to those from the trials conducted by Lambert's own team. We are very grateful for the collaborations between two iGEM teams without whose time and efforts we could not have proven our Electropen hardware.  Thank you TASTaipei and UGA! TASTaipei received an assembled pen from us and built a custom cuvette from protocols that we provided.  Using provided videos and protocols they made electro-competentE. coli DH5a and Nissle cells.  They were able to successfully transform both strains with a GFP plasmid and provided transformation efficiency data.  UGA’s team received assembled Electropen and cuvette.  They were able to successfully transform and validate GFP expression with a plate reader.  Both teams gave us feedback on design and ease of use of the devices.

Nanjing-China
Lambert iGEM created a lab emoji in collaboration with Team Nanjing. The teams hoped to increase accessibility of science to the community. It was an activity that allowed Lambert iGEM to consider the fun of science rather than always focusing on its serious effects. This mindset set allowed a more relaxed, inviting lab environment and an overall better iGEM experience. Team Nanjing also used our app Color Q, testing and proving its functionality. They gave us great feedback on versatility and accessibility, changes that we took to heart. Here are their results:

Due to limited resources, the Lambert iGEM team understands the significance of conservation and frugality in the lab. In fact, frugal science remains a foundation of our project. In collaboration with Westminster UK iGEM, the team developed a protocol to recycle spin columns without an autoclave, promoting an easy method of increased conservation in the lab.
Recyling Spin Columns
Store unclean spin columns in 1M HCl solution for 4 hours or overnight (No damage if stored for longer).
Fill each column with 1 ml sterile distilled H2O.
Spin columns in microcentrifuge (inside microcentrifuge tubes or collection tubes).
Discard the flow through.
Repeat steps 2-4, 4 more times for a total of 5 times.
Fill with 1 ml of QBT buffer to rebalance charges.

The overexpression of MBP-tagged peptides was successful. The supernatant fractions showed a thick band at approximately 40kDa, corresponding to the size of MBP, which was not present in the uninduced samples. A smaller amount of the protein was also present in the lane of the pellet, but the major amount is cytosolic. Since the overexpression of NOX did not work, the planned pull-down of NOX with beads could not be performed. Instead the binding of peptides was tested by applying the His-MBP tagged peptides to S. pneumoniae cells.
Adhesion of peptides to S.pneumoniae – Pulldown with cells
Figure 3:‎SDS-PAGE of the lysates and the fractions of the incubated S. pneumoniae cells. E. coli cells carrying the plasmids coding for C4P, CSP and A5P were lysed. S. pneumoniae cells were resuspended in the lysate and incubated for 30 minutes, followed by pelleting to separate the supernatant (SP) from the cell pellet (P).  3 μl of sample were applied per lane.
The gel of the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) shows strong bands for the lysates at 40kDa, indicating a high amount of the His-MBP tagged peptides. The empty vector shows a relatively low expression of His-MBP.  The pellet fractions of the S. pneumoniae cells incubated with the tagged C4P and CSP peptides show light bands at the same height indicating adhesion of the peptides to the cells (Fig. 4, white arrows). Although the cells incubated in buffer alone also show a band at the same height indicating a native protein of that size (Fig. 3, black arrows) the amount of protein is clearly less. To determine whether the band represents the His-MBP tagged peptides, a western blot was performed (Figure 4).
Figure 4: Western-Blots of the lysates and the fractions of the incubated S. pneumoniae cells. Duplicates of the gel from Figure 4 (A) and another gel loaded with 10 μl/ lane (B) were processed by western blot with Anti-His antibodies.
The blot shows a clear signal for the applied lysates and all the pellet fractions of the cells incubated with the peptides, indicating their adhesion to S.pneumoniae. The band for the His-MBP of empty vector is missing (or"
Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Practices#Community Labs_-_-_TEXT.html," we had now aquired enough background knowledge to meet a real Community lab. Fortunately, we already made friends with some members of the ""Technik Garage"", the Community Lab we had the pleasure to meet at the MakerFaire.
Meeting the Technik Garage - Passionate Makers
Being curious, how the reality matches our expectations, we invited the “Technik Garage”, a German Community Lab to visit us in Aachen.
Our three main objectives were:
Connect Community Labs by integrating them into a network of universities and companies
Inform European Community Labs about iGEM and facilitate cooperations with iGEM teams
Discuss biosafety standards and compare those of Community Labs to those of Universities
The ""Technik Garage"" joins the Medlife network
To fulfill the first objective, we invited Dr. Jansen from the life sciences network MedLife. This Network connects around 35 biotechnological and medical companies, 12 research groups and 17 other companies like consultants, patent lawyers and software providers. It is designed to perceive the needs of their members and find solutions within or outside of the network. As a result of our discussion, Dr. Jansen agreed to add the Technik Garage to the Medlife network, which everybody appreciated as a win-win situation.
Subsequently, we discussed how synthetic biology can be used in Community Labs. Since the members of the Technik Garage regularly teach in different schools, as well as in their own lab, they were really interested in possible synbio school projects.  As a consequence of sharing experiences in teaching biology, we revised the school project of the iGEM Team Aachen 2014 as well as a suitable protocol of a practical course for bachelor students. Using the provided material, they are able to reach hundreds of students and teachers within the next years and thereby spreading the spirit of synthetic biology.
If you ask the public about Community Labs, biosafety is one of the most prominent concerns. To evaluate biosafety aspects of Community Labs, we invited the iGEM Team of Paris Saclay to join our discussion via Skype. Together, we discussed different approaches to guarantee a high safety level of Communitly Labs. During this dialog, we focussed on the applicability of the two containment strategies of iGEM Paris Saclay, especially concerning the use in Community Labs.

Overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Human Practices pages. This overview will introduce you to the projects that we investigation for our Human Practices efforts, as well as why we investigated them and what our results showed.
For our silver medal criteria, we complied 3 reports on the impact of our project, how people feel about phage therapy and what current legislation there is on phage therapy.      The objective of compiling these reports was to investigate whether our work was responsible and good for the world. We engaged with a variety of communities including field experts, community discussion groups and scientific articles and research papers to gain a wide scope of information to demonstrate the positive impact of our work.
For our gold medal criteria, we analysed how we could integrate the findings of our discussion group and field expert interviews into our project. We chose to document this via a clear flowchart so that we can explain how we have taken on board feedback and modified our project as a result.
For outreach, we hosted 3 events to teach children aged 4-16 about synthetic biology. We hosted these events in schools, libraries and our own University to engage a variety of community groups.  For our collaborations, we were lucky enough to work with 4 amazing teams on a variety of projects including characterising our promoters, collecting water samples and completing wiki grammar checks. We chose these collaborations to showcase the variety of teams and projects that take part in iGEM and to learn more about different projects.
Finally, we had 4 articles published in 4 different newspapers/blogs across a range of platforms. This enabled our team to showcase our work and engage a wide range of community audiences in the iGEM competition. We hope you enjoy learning about our Human Practices work on this year’s project.

After induction the cultures were grown for further 5 h at the same concitions and cells were afterwards stored at 4°C until they were used for analysis or bioprinting.
After the cell harvest the optical density (OD550) was determined again as it is known that a high expression of EspP makes the outer membrane of E. coli permeable and this drastically affects cellular viability. For the scAvidin-autotransporter and the secreted BAP-NanoLuc autotransporter at high inducer concentration show clearly reduced viability as they did not show any growth after induction at OD550 = 0.5 (see Fig. A). In order to analyze the functionality of the whole design and these new BioBricks we subjected each of the twelve cultures to three different treatments and determined subsequently the amount of NanoLuc luciferase using the manufacturers substrate kit (Thanks to our sponsor Promega ;). At first the total NanoLuc luciferase content was determined in samples that were just washed once with PBS and contained the whole bacterial cell (see Fig. B), bacterial cells that were incubated with PPA-buffer (periplasmic extraction buffer; 500 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) that extracts the proteins present in the periplasm (see Fig. C) and finally the culture supernatant of the cultivated bacterial cells (see Fig. D). The total NanoLuc activity is only present in bacteria that are transformed with a plasmid encoding the luciferase and there is a clear dependency of inducer concentration a detected luciferase activity. In the samples where a periplasmic extract was prepared the luciferase activity is highest in the samples of the secreted luciferase as the EspP-fused BAP-NanoLuc is attached to the cells and only proteins from lysed cells are present in the periplasmic extract. In the case of the samples where the supernatant of the cultures was analyzed the luciferase activity is present in both ""high"" induced samples.
As the luciferase activity only gave an indication for the subcellular localization of the cargo-autotransporter fusion protein, we also performed flow cytometry measurements. For this purpose the same cells were stained with app. 10 µM A3C5-Fab that was coupled to the fluorescent"

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," behind both exploring space by manned missions and colonization of land on Earth. We find the historical angle relevant in order to get a nuanced view of how the events leading up to a potential Mars mission may plan out. And perhaps more importantly - what the motivation for comparable events has been throughout history. From this, we will draw the conclusion that public support and opinion played an especially important role leading up to the moon landing compared to the further study of imperialism and its' causes for taking over and expanding land although the remaining arguments were similar. Here it is found that economy and countries' position of strength in a global context are crucial although it started off with more humble wishes for local trade and missionary and that big decisions on behalf of their country ultimately have been made by the respective potentate.
Part 2
Following part 1, we analyse motivations in the public debate by analyzing 4 chosen arguments that are often found in the debate around colonization of Mars. We do this in order to shed light upon the arguments that the world citizen will meet in the media and investigate the quality of the arguments in terms of persuasion. Following this analysis we conclude that there is some major problems on earth that most citizens likely will prioritize over expanding the planetary territory. However, the major arguments against colonization is not actual arguments against colonization, but rather arguments against prioritizing colonization over current problems. Therefore we find it unlikely that colonizing Mars will gain significant public support right now, but we asses that Mars colonization will likely awake stronger opinions from the public as the technology improves thus making humanity move closer to colonization being a reality. This could either become a primary motivator or the exact opposite.
Part 3
Following our historical and rhetorical analysis, we will examine another aspect of the colonization on Mars; the bioethical concerns. If we choose to colonize Mars or any other planet, contamination will be an undeniable risk. We will examine the existing regulations in relation to the biosecurity measures needed in order to colonize Mars responsibly. Contamination could damage any potential life on Mars or the traces of life which could answer questions regarding the evolution of life on Earth. We will furthermore discuss the extent of contamination risks of colonizing Mars and whether it is ethically justifiable to do so despite the potential risk.
Part 1
What has the incentive of launching space missions been, historically?
In this chapter, we will try to answer the questions ""what needs to happen for us to land a mission on Mars"" as well as the imperialistic question of ""how would a new space-based society work"". Although we can never truly answer these questions before the events have taken place, we will"
UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the immense numbers of reported cases of Leishmaniasis in the country and due to the current climate of governmental support for the disease. Last year, approximately 700 cases of Leishmaniasis were reported in the Choluteca county alone (South western Honduras), and the numbers of cases seem to be increasing exponentially. Also, due to focus on the arbovirus Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, governmental support is distracted from Leishmaniasis. Hence, the current lack of hope in Honduras in the battle against Leishmaniasis made it the perfect location to explore with our solution.
Suazo Hospital, Tegucigalpa
Our first task following arrival on Honduras soil was to visit the Alonso Suazo public hospital in the capital city, Tegucigalpa. We met with Dr. Cristian Valladares, who was working in the diagnosis laboratory for Leishmaniasis in the hospital. One of our team members, Yensi, could speak Spanish fluently, hence breaking the communication barrier with the staff. On entry, we were amazed by the differences between the laboratories that we were used to seeing at home in Ireland and the laboratory before our eyes. It was shocking how small and clustered it was, and also there was an apparent absence of modern laboratory equipment. What was more breathtaking, was the fact that this was not just the only diagnosis laboratory for Leishmaniasis in Honduras, but it was the only diagnosis laboratory for all infectious diseases in the entire country. We began to wonder whether a laboratory of such size could recognise the true prevalence of such diseases.
Photos with Dr. Cristian Valladares in Alonso Suazo hospital, Tegucigalpa
Following conversation with Dr. Valladares, we learned that several species of Leishmaniasis, from cutaneous to visceral are carried by Lutzomyia longipalpis, the sandfly which LJM11 induces immunity against. This backs the benefit of targeting our vaccine against this sandfly, as it covers a wide range of the disease subtypes. This eliminates the need for multiple vaccines.
In addition to this, we learned that diagnosis (by biopsy) is often avoided as there is a large epidemiological silence with this disease. Many people with cutaneous Leishmaniasis lesions avoid presenting to their GP for reasons such as tradition and culture, and mainly because of a lack of education about the disease. Many use “self-remedies” instead of standard treatment which can keep lesions at bay, but there is lack success in resolving of the condition as"

Brothers from other Mothers-ICT- Mumbai
In the present edition of iGEM ,Team ICT-Mumbai is venturing into an adventurous task of engineering a chassis bacteria:Bacillus Subtilis to detect the particular plant ,being grown, in response to fthe extudades They worked on mainlty fours types of crops namely Rice,Wheat,Soybean and Tomato.Since, our institute is located in the heart of the Northern plains of India, ICT-Mumbai wanted us to gather information about the types of crops grown,amount of fertilizers used and diseases widespread in the lush farms in and around the Haryana-Punjab region.
Our project kept us in regular touch with the farmers of our community,therefore, we were easily able to get access to the above information.We also were able to understand the amount of knowledge of Phosphate Solubilizing bacteria in the Farmer’s Community.On being questioned about Plant dieseases in their farms, a majoirty of the Farmer’s assusred us that “Weeds” were a biigger concern for them than Plant Diseases.This information allowed us not only provide valuable facts and figures for ICT -Mumbai but alos helped us understand other reasons for harvest losses faced by our farmers, which strengthened our will to succeed in our project.All in all we were more than happy to interact and share this information with our fellow scientists in Mumbai.We hope to see them again at the Giant Jamboree :)

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Antitumoral action_-_-_TEXT.html,"activation of this apoptotic pathway by bringing into tumor cells the wild type genes coding for functional tumor suppressors.
The COSMIC project from Sanger institute allowed us to determine which genes to bring to the therapeutic plasmid in the non-small cell lung cancer case. This project sums up all detected mutations for each type of cancer in function of their appearance frequency. So, from their data, the loss of apoptotic capacity of tumor cells for lung cancer can be due to the functional loss of proteins from the following genes :
These different genes play a predominant role in the application of the apoptotic process and are the most susceptible to be mutated in the lung cancer case. They compose the therapeutic plasmid .
Back to top
The objective
The objective of this study is to check if a wild type version of a tumor suppressor gene inside the tumor cell, for which the own version is mutated, induce or not the apoptotic phenomenon.
Experimental approach
Cancer cell line and reported gene
Cancer cell lines, which have a mutation of tumor suppressor gene has been selected from our database. We also possess a wild type version of the TP53 gene. Then we choose the prostatic cancer p53 mutated DU-145 in the goals to test if bringing the wild type version of the p53 protein (p53wt) in the DU-145 cell line allows to induce the apoptotic process.
Cell culture protocol :
Take out  ampoule from liquid nitrogen
Place the ampoule in 37°C water bath for 5 minutes
In a 50 ml Falcon tube, put 9 ml of 10% MEM + 1 ml of ampoule
Harvest 5 min at 1200 rpm
Discard the supernatant without touching pellet cells (DMSO elimination)
Resuspend pellet in 1 ml of media
Put the suspension in a new T25 containing 5 ml of media
Incubate at 37°C
Do not forget to change the media the day after to eliminate all DMSO traces
One week later, cells are at 100% confluence

We observed two colonies in one Petri dish. We put this colonies into LB+Cm to make them growth.  Falcon preparation: 3 mL LB + 15 μl Cm 1000x.
DH5α transformation with the previously used stocks of pCas9-SpeC in order to  reject cloning problems. We took the purified pCas9 plasmid and the Spec hybridated oligos and we ligated them.  Seeding was performed onto 3 petri dishes.  The rests of the yesterday’s ligation obtained with the pCas9 protocol was used to seed a fourth petri dish in the same conditions (LB + Cm).
Note: is it possible that we have too much Cm in the Petri dishes for a low-copy number plasmid as pCas9? Can it be the cause of having no growth?
All Petri dishes and falcon tubes were kept at 37ºC.

KatG,PatA, OxyR digestion repetition, from minipreps of 20/08/2016. We put 5 μl of the E-P mix and 5 μl of each miniprep  together and we incubted them during 1 hour.
A checking digestion + electrophoresis gel was performed. The wells were laoded in the following order: PatAa, PatAb, OxyRa, OxyRb, KatGa, KatGb.
Regarding the cultures prepared on 21/08/2016:
There was observed growth of the overnight liquid cultures of K2M in all the cases. This indicates that cells didn’t loose the pCas9 plasmid. We decided on seeding the surviving K2M cells. We did a 1:500 dilution to reduce the number of cells. We incubated the cells at 37ºC.
DH5α transformed with pCas9-SpeC overnight culture growth was observed. However, as there is very little growth, we don’t trust much the results. We decided on repeating the oligo hybridation.
No growth was observed in any of the Petri dishes containing DH5α with pCas9-SpeC. We reject the possibility of errors during the cloning.

pNPP Assay
Cutinase activity assays were performed using bacterial culture. The activity was determined using spectrophotometric assay at 410 nm with p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) as a substrate. pNPP was dissolved in acetonitrile at a concentration of 10 mM. Ethanol and 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) were added to a ratio of 1:4:95 (v/v/v) of acetonitrile/ ethanol/ buffer (Lee, 1999). 0.3 mL of the bacterial culture was reacted to the substrate solution (0.9 mL). Then, it was incubated at 25oC for 15 minutes then centrifuge at 12,000g, 15 min, and 4oC . Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the change in absorbance at λ 410 nm that represents the amount of released p-nitrophenol (pNP). The activity of cutinase was determined based on the standard curve of p-nitrophenol. One unit of cutinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol pNP per minute under the assay conditions (Lee et al., 1999).
SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope)
For biodegrading experiments, we used 3x5 cm2 bottle plastics with average weight 0.05 g. Then, we washed it several times with water and ethanol. Plastic sample was applying just before we inoculated the bacteria on the medium. Bacterial culture were grown at 37oC in Luria-Broth medium. After 3 days of incubation, we washed the plastic with water and ethanol then dried for measurement of the weight loss.
Meanwhile, for UC Davis bacterial culture, we inoculated the bacteria in Luria-Broth medium supplemented with 170 g/ml cloramphenicol. After an absorbance A600 nm of 0.6 was reached, we added 1% of arabinose and plastic sample. After 2 days of incubation, we washed the plastic with water and ethanol then dried for measurement of the weight loss. We used medium supplemented with antibiotics and plastic sample"

Functional verification of three kinds of recombinases in HEK 293T cell
Fig.7. All three recombinases can effectively reverse the sequence between recognition sites, and exhibit different reverse efficiency due to different promoter strength and recombinase types.

(B) The image under fluorescence microscope for 293T cells, transfected with plasmids containing the recombinase recognition sites (the first column picture) or transfected with plasmids containing corresponding combination of promoters and recombinase genes (other column pictures) together, are shown.
The results show that the recombinases can recognize the sites and reverse the sequence between sites in HEK 293T.
Functional verification of reversal efficiency and threshold characteristics of different recombinases in HEK 293T Cells
Fig.8. Recombinase has different intensity reversal efficiency and threshold
HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with six different amounts of plasmids containing recombinase genes (tetO-miniCMV-Bxb1( BBa_K2557010 )and tetO-miniCMV-TP901( BBa_K2557016 )) , and fixed numbers of plasmids containing corresponding recombinase recognition sites. After 36 hours of plasmid co-transfection, the proportion of fluorescent cells and the average fluorescence intensity of cells were detected by flow cytometry. Transfection of different amounts of plasmids containing recombinase genes into cells indicates that cells can produce recombinase at different concentrations. The experiment was repeated three times.
(A) Fluorescence microscope observation of HEK 293T  undergone different experimental treatments
(B) The statistical chart of average fluorescence intensity of cells shows that the cells with Bxb1 recombinase have a higher fluorescence intensity than those with TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However, if the concentration of recombinase is low, there is no significant difference in fluorescence intensity.
(C) The statistics of the proportion of fluorescent cells show that the proportion of fluorescent cells has a sudden jump discontinuity between low concentration and high concentration of Bxb1 and TP901 recombinases. Similar results were obtained in all three repetitions.
The results of image B show that the reverse efficiency of Bxb1 recombinase is higher than TP901 recombinase under the same promoter strength and recombinase concentration. However, if"

TtrS/R
Codon-optimized TtrS(BBa_K2507002) and TtrR (BBa_K2507003) are two basic parts which are derived from the two-component system of marine bacterium Shewanella baltica. TtrS is the membrane-bound sensor kinase (SK) which can sense tetrathionate outside the cell, and TtrR is the DNA-binding response regulator (RR). PttrB185-269 (BBa_K2507019) is a minimal TtrR-activated promoter which is activated when TtrR is phosphorylated by TtrS after TtrS senses tetrathionate.
Winter et al. have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the host during inflammation convert thiosulfate into tetrathionate, which this pathogen consumes to establish a beachhead for infection (Winter et al, 2010). Thus, tetrathionate may correlate with pro-inflammatory conditions and can therefore be used as a sensor for gut inflammation.
Characterization
We first validated that this system can function as a tetrathionate sensor and reporter in the laboratory strains Escherichia coli Top10 and E. coli Nissle 1917.

Put eppendorf tubes on ice now so that they are cold when cells are aliquoted into them later. If your culture is X ml, you will need X tubes. At this point you should also make sure that your TSS is being chilled (it should be stored at 4oC but if you have just made it fresh then put it in an ice bath).
Split the culture into two 50ml falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 min.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4oC and the cells should be kept on ice wherever possible

None of these bricks contain a terminator sequence; we have considered appending BBa_B0014 to them, but the tightly constrained time we had for our project, and what little of it remained after sorting out (part of) the problems with assembling BioBricks, caused us to decide against this and relying instead on the terminator sequence in the standard plasmid backbones.

The experiments used in model 2 show that with 7.5 * 109 cells enough lysostaphin is produced to eradicate the biofilm of S. aureus. For the reason we wanted to scale up consistently, we chose to end at 3 * 1010 to make sure we establish MBEC: 2.963 * 10-6 mol/L = 2.963 * 10-3 mol m-3.
Results
Starting for the hydrogel with a 1 mm nutrient layer, a 1.111 mm cell layer and 1.889 mm of buffer layer with a cell count of 3 million. The model shows a high concentration of nutrients at t = 0h in the nutrient layer just like expected. (figure 2)
Figure 2: Nutrient layer of 1 mm, cell layer of 1.111 mm and buffer layer of 1.889 mm. t=0h. Nutrient concentration is shown. Axis shown in mol/m-3.
Over time we see diffusion of the nutrients through the gel, but not only diffusion, the uptake of nutrients by cells is also taken into account. However, after twelve hours we still see a large concentration of nutrients of around 5 * 10-4 mol/m-3 or 5 *10-7 mol/L all throughout the gel as can be seen in figure 3.
Figure 3: Nutrient layer of 1 mm, cell layer of 1.111 mm and buffer layer of 1.889 mm. t=12h. Nutrient concentration is shown. Axis shown in mol/m-3.
For the lysostaphin production, at t = 0h in figure 4 an extremely small concentration of lysostaphin can be seen in the cell layer.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#cproject_-_-_TEXT.html,", we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

Introducing the hard working team of instructors and advisors supporting our team. From left to right we have Edward Moh, Louise Brown, Thi Huynh, and Elizabeth Daniel. These enthusiastic and dedicated supporters have guided, aided and inspired the 2016 Macquarie Australia team throughout the project.
Dr Louise Brown
Dr Brown is a Senior Lecturer at Macquarie University. She is a strong advocate of undergraduate research at Macquarie University and has been involved with the Macquarie Australia iGEM team since its inception, in 2010. Dr Brown has facilitated Macquarie University's ability to take part in iGEM through her advocacy of our sponsors; allowing us to gain funding each year. In addition Dr Brown facilitates our contact with other teams for advice and partnership opportunities. She has helped our team function as a whole by providing a positive and insightful environment to perform our research.
Thi Huynh
Thi is a committed and valuable advisor to our team. A Scientific Officer at Macquarie, Thi takes on this role even though she has other work to do. Thi’s ever helpful advice helping us to locate and use lab equipment is invaluable and we wouldn’t be able to work on our project without her. Hopefully now that we are near the end she isn’t so stressed. Thanks Thi for everything you have done for us!
Edward Moh
It wouldn't be exaggerating to say that Ed lives in the lab. He is currently on the road to completing his PhD (if he can ever get out of the iGEM lab). Ed has been involved with the Macquarie Australia iGEM team since 2011 and this year he has been an exceptional supporter of our team. As a result, Ed has been able to provide us with a tremendous amount of advice about the iGEM competition process. His commitment and dedication to our team is outstanding. We couldn’t have done it without you Ed!
Elizabeth Daniel
Liz is a past Macquarie iGEM participant who has been a supporter of the whole project this year. In particular, her help with the hydrogenase sub project has been extremely valuable"

The running of the study
To analyse the timing of plasmid expression in the DU-145 cell line, we realized a kinetic monitoring of the apoptosis induction by making an annexin V assay every 6 hours for 48 hours after the plasmid electroporation. By coupling apoptosis rate of the population control (blank electroporation) and the population assay (electroporation with plasmid) with their respective growth rate, we will be able to determine the p53wt impact on apoptosis induction. We use a control without the plasmid pcDNA3 CMV+p53wt to quatify the level of death cells causes by the electroporation and by the culture transfert.
Because we had not a continuous access to the cytometer, we grouped the all 48h analyses in 2 cytometry runs. Each time slot of the study is represented by a distinct cell population. So, we realized 14 electroporations corresponding to the 7 time slots: +6h, +12h, +18h, +24h, +30h, +36h and +48h (two by slot: population assay+ population control).
Here is the allocation planning of electroporations:
Three cell populations were respectively electropored 12h, 24h et 36h before the first cytometry run (in red, at 9 a.m, day 3), four others 6h, 18h, 30h and 48h before the second run (in green, at 4 p.m, day 3).
The first cytometric analyze allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +12h, +24h and +36h, while the second one, allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +6h, 18h, +30h and +48h.
By coupling all these data, we obtain a monitoring on 48h of the apoptosis induction after p53wt electroporation.

Outreach
Outreach is a very important component of our project. We have endeavoured to increase awareness of synthetic biology in a creative and fun way and reach as many people as possible. We set up Radio iGEM, a podcast about all things iGEM and synthetic biology and we even acted out a play written by one of our team members. We also had two high school-level interns who helped us with our project and we will be putting on a showcase of our project at an event in London’s Natural History Museum.
Radio iGEM
Radio iGEM started out small with our desire to broadcast the music we listen to in the lab to other iGEM teams using the Twitter hashtag #RadioiGEM. Quickly enough, this developed into a full-blown podcast that is also broadcast live. In Radio iGEM, we talk about all things synthetic biology and get guest speakers to discuss their projects.
Episode 1. What makes a good scientific presentation?
In this episode, Frank interviews Outreach Officer and winner of Famelab 2007, Nic Harrigan, to find out how the iGEM teams can prepare for their presentations.
Episode 2. iGEM Watch Watch
In this episode, Frank interviews the writers of the popular iGEM Watch blog to find out what inspired them to do it, and Frank finds out which teams have attracted their interest so far.
Episode 3. The George Freeman interview
In this episode, Frank is given ten minutes with George Freeman MP to ask some questions about the political situation surrounding GM technology.
Episode 4. The Green Siege (Radio Play)
In this special episode, written by Christopher Schoene, the Imperial iGEM team acts out a short play set in the future that Synthetic Biology might take us to.

Vtranscription ->signal*ktranscription
VmRNAdegradation -> kmRNAdegradation*mRNA[t]
Vtranslation -> ktranslation*mRNA[t]
Vproteindegradation -> kproteindegradation*Protein[t]
The transcription constant is influenced by multiple factors, for example the promoter activity and RBS strength. We want to calculate if there is a difference in the transcription constant if you change the promoter ( pLacI , and pBAD ) or temperature. Some promoters are always active; others are influenced by environmental signals.
First the degradation factors should be measured. This will be done by using antibiotics that stop the translation or transcription. To calculate the protein degradation the protein concentration should be measured before and after stopping the translation. From the decline in protein concentration we can than calculate the protein degradation constant. For mRNA it is a bit harder, because of the time limit mRNA concentration can’t be measured. This means that the only information that can be gathered is about the protein level. The solution is to stop the transcription, and see when the protein levels decline. This gives an indication for the mRNA degradation. The parameters that are left are signal strength, transcription and translation constants. With over expression of the input signal, the signal strength parameter can be neglected. The transcription and translation constants can not be separated easily. By testing both promoters with the same detection protein the translation constant is the same. This means we can give an estimation of the transcription constant on an arbitrary scale.
2. Characterizing growth rate of individual Growth rate enhancing, antifreeze & freeze resistance proteins
Information on this subject can be found on the Characterisation page .
3. Characterizing freeze resistance proteins on cell viability
Information on this subject can be found on the Characterisation page .
4. Combining BioBricks based on their characterization in order to maximize growth rate
An additional four final constructs will be designed as 'operons' comprising Cpn10 and Cpn60 together. These will be tested at 37°C and below, measuring OD600 at set intervals.
5. Combining Growth rate enhancing with antifreeze for subzero characterization
Theoretically the growth rate enhancer should stimulate the growth at lower temperatures than 0°C. With an addition of anti-freeze proteins E. coli has an protection against crystallization and thus can grow below 0°C.
6. Make and test a cold resistance backbone
Information on this subject can be found on the Application page .

Collaboration on lab safety:
In the Chinese academic society, safety education is an essential but usually neglected component of the lab training, which, unfortunately, has led to numerous tragic accidents. To our astonishment, only limited material on this matter can be easily accessed within the Chinese academic and educational atmosphere. Therefore, we planned a Chinese voice-over lab safety educational video shooting event together with Shanghai Technology University, Wuhan University, and some other Chinese universities. We were inspired greatly by the Yale Biosafety Manual, and divided the tasks into several parts and assigned them to each school. Our part was to shoot an introductory video on the safe operation on several commonly used equipment.          这里还差一个视频

The picture above shows part of our test results and to keep both the true negative and false positive rates at a reasonable level, we adopt 3 threshold values, namely, low (0.5977) , median (0.0778) and high (0.85), with a true negative rate at 0.1, 0.5, and 0.7 respectively. And for more flexibility, we also allow the users to set their own thresholds.
Part 2: the recognition of sigma factor motif and the evaluation of relative promoter strength.
In the case of sigma 70 factors, the motifs are the −35 and −10 hexamers. Enclosing a spacer of length 15–19 bp.
Given a promoter sequence, the -10 and -35 hexamers are located by the total MSS of the two hexamers calculated by the position frequency matrices of the sigma factor binding sites, which are derived from Regulon DB. And the calculating process is subject to two constraints:
1. That the spacer length (the number of base pairs between the −35 hexamer and the −10 hexamer) should lie in the range (15–20);

2. The total MSS  (our results are the sum of the scores for the −10 and −35 hexamers and therefore lie in the interval [0,"
Wash_U,2009,Team:Wash U#German#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Our intention is to create a more dynamic system to vary antenna size that is dependent on incidental light intensity and that can be readily optimized using synthetic biology principles.  This system should result in the bacteria at the exterior of the bioreactor expressing fewer light harvesting antenna proteins than the cells at the interior, reducing NPQ while maintaining a high absorbance of incidental photons.
We will focus on altering the quantity of the Light Harvesting Complex 2 (LH2) by regulating the pucB/A genes that code for the two subunits of the complex.  LH2 absorbs photons maximally at the wavelength of 842 nm and funnels its energy to LH1 and the reaction center.  The ratio of LH2 complexes to LH1 naturally ranges from 3.0 to 6.7 under varying light conditions (Scheuring et al., 2005).  We propose that if this ratio of LH2 to LH1 is altered to range from 0-7 or more in response to incidental light intensity, then the photosynthetic efficiency and productivity for a culture of R. sphaeroides may be maximized.

1.Nitric oxide sensor
We constructed our NO sensor in the pCDFDuet-1 plasmid (Figure 1)
According to the results of the ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team, 100μM SNP aqueous solution can                 continuously release NO, and the NO concentration is stable at about 5.5μM. This concentration is the                 concentration of NO in patients with IBD. Therefore, in the subsequent test of the NO sensor, the final                 concentration of the SNP aqueous solution we added was 100 μM.
We transformed the constructed NO sensor plasmid into DH5α, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to                 OD = 0.2. After 1.5 h of growth at 37 ℃, the inducer IPTG and SNP aqueous solution were added. After 6                 h at 37 ℃, 1 mL of the bacterial solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 min (Figure 2).
From left to right: control, 0.5mM IPTG without SNP, 1mM IPTG without SNP, 0.5mM IPTG with 100μM SNP,                 1mM IPTG with 100μM SNP"
Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," criticised due to the failure of researchers, industry and public authorities to “address concerns prevailing among the general public”. In order to prevent a scenario like this, we recognise the value of engaging the wider public to understand their concerns and then to act upon these in an open and honest way. Our ultimate aim is to create an accessible platform to enable an open dialogue about concerns and solutions between researchers, industries, public authorities and the general public. Our public outreach enabled us to do this on a small scale; feedback gained from patients and the general public highlighted the huge concerns about the safety of a GM probiotic. In response to this, we modified our design to incorporate kill switches and performed additional safety analysis that was presented on our Wiki and at further public outreach events. Our openness about the safety measures we have taken in light of public feedback demonstrates how collaboration between researchers and the public can be achieved to fully meet the needs and address the concerns of the wider public.
The public outreach events that we organised were successful at engaging individuals and increasing their level of understanding of these issues, although a more sustained approach will be needed to educate all members of the public and healthcare professionals. We have created a Long-term Public Education Plan, which outlines a series of steps that will be required to enable the widespread education of the general public, clinicians and patients. The Long-term Public Education Plan provides further guidance for how to maintain an open platform for the public and clinicians to express their concerns about using GM probiotics, thus ensuring that public concerns are understood and acted upon throughout the future.

Probiotic Information Leaflet
Having identified the lack of public knowledge about probiotics and genetic engineering, we developed an informative leaflet aimed at providing a basic level of understanding to the lay public.

It has been shown that MLC binds directly to mtfA (originally known as yeeI).5,6 Mutants of mtfA cause a decrease in the expression of ptsG, whereas overexpression causes constitutive expression. It has been proposed that mtfA is a peptidase specifically for MLC and helps to increase the transcription of ptsG and other PTS genes.5,6

Module:ABACUS
ABACUS is firstly developed by professor Liu Haiyan, to enlarge the functions of Biopano. The de novo design of amino acid sequence to fold into desired structures is a way to reach a more thorough understanding of how amino acid sequences encode protein structures and to supply methods for protein engineering. To overcome limitations in current computational models, they developed a comprehensive statistical energy function for protein design with a new general strategy and verify that it can complement and rival current well-established models. They established an experimental approach which can be used to efficiently assess or improve the foldability of designed proteins. To prove it, they report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to the well-folded, solved solution structures for two being excellent agreement with respective design targets.[2]
Unit Test
Our development is based on Git version control with multiple branches. All pushed commits will be automatically tested on our test server at once so that we can see the result soon. Besides unit tests, our test server will also process code analyzing to prevent fault codes and ensure that all classes and functions are well documented. When all is done, the new docker image will be generated automatically on DockerHub so that anyone can install and run our program with only one command.
Continuous integration and deployment ensure that we can fix bugs at the first time it appears. Unit tests ensure that our software performs all its intended function.

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project#detailed_-_-_TEXT.html," a potent anticancer drug target. Additionally, recent studies suggested a key role for the α5β1  integrin in certain bacterial invasion of human host cells leading to antibiotic resistance. The bacteria exhibit on their surface proteins belong to the invasin family which are capable of selectively recognition of this integrins. These findings suggest that usage of bacteria containing the invasin outside of the cell membrane to targeting cancer cell is resonable idea.
Error proofing and disposing of the run down bacteria
During the course of planing we have given much thought to the issue of error proofing. When the project will be finalised we'll be dealing with a potentially dangerous microbe, capable of entering eukaryotic cells. This forced us develop a method of emergency killing the bacteria at any given time, a so called ""kill switch"". We chose to use a toxin/antitoxin system (MazF/MazE for example) in which both proteins are produced at equal levels. The antitoxin will be expressed from a promoter that is easily inhibited by small size particles capable of penetrating inside the cell. If at any moment we decide to terminate the treatment the introduction of such a particle to the blood stream will cause the bacterium to halt the production of the antitoxin thus effectively killing itself.
The other problem we have faced was what to do with the bacteria that have already completed their task. If such a bacterium finds itself absorbed by a white blood cell along with the apoptosomes it might start inducing apoptosis to its new host. Our solution to that problem was inspired by the Team Waterloo's 2008 project. The cytoplasmic operon could be supplemented with an additional endonucleolitic enzyme, one that would dispose of every unnecessary peace of DNA including bacteria's genome and previous operons. Such a vessel could only carry out the one final step (be it protein secretion or conjugation) over and over again until it depletes all its resources becoming eventually digested by either the host cell or along with the apoptotic remnants.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," boxes show different identified receptors. The receptor colored in yellow are structural similar to the orange boxes.
D-aspartate and L-aspartic acid-4-benzyl ester were chosen because of their structural similarity to D- aspartate. Moreover, the four flavors – vanillin, geraniol, caffeine and sodium cyclamate were interesting to test. The most interesting chemical is 2-ethyl-hexanol, a volatile organic compound related to lung cancer [2]. As mentioned above, the library selection assay was performed (Fig. 2A). After three rounds of selection of the fastest E. coli were sequenced. Figure 16 depicts novel identified chemoreceptors. A particular color code reflects the sequence identity and structure similarity. The novel receptor colored in red with amino acid sequence LTAQPD…SSAVP was identified two times for D-aspartate, 2-ethyl-hexanol and sodium cyclamate. Another novel receptor colored in orange with amino acid sequence PPAQPP…PSAVT was found two times for L-aspartic acid-4-benzyl ester and once for caffeine. However, for caffeine a structural related receptor mutant to the orange colored receptor was identified since the amino acids proline and serine are similar in structure.
Epilogue
In conclusion the selection method worked although the selectivity was low. Nevertheless, we hold two novel chemoreceptors in our hands. All these experiments provide evidence for the functionality of the BioBrick K777001.

Conclusion
According to the steps mentioned above, we could then control the branched pathway successfully by inserting those genes, which code for thermal regulation, into an E.coli. We then are able to construct a human regulated pathway which was considered to be spontaneous mechanism and to prove our concept is practicable.
Firgure24. The overall conception of Violacein pathway.
The regulation is tested in violacein biosynthesis pathway, which allows us to thermally regulate the mechanism, and could also be monitored by color alteration resulting from the conversion.
Through color alteration, we could obviously observe different products as effect of different temperatures we set. When the temperature is maintained at 30℃, the colorless product called Protodeoxyviolaceinic acid(PVA) shows up, which means we stop the mechanism in this step and"
Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," Looking at the synthetic cell created by Venter’s team, it is difficult to denote the “man-made” material in his composition. His cell includes a computer generated “minimal genome sequence” that is encapsulated within a bacterial cell (found in nature) and still hosts cellular machinery required to allow the cell to adapt and function within its environment. The modification is within the genome, but even that raises some debate on whether it can be patentable.
The software industry has always tackled with patenting mathematical and computational algorithms, particularly in concern was their level of broadness. In perspective to the field of synthetic biology, an algorithm is analogous to the creation of novel and modified genetic sequences, which give rise to new metabolic pathways and cellular functionalities. Yet again, the derivation of their new genetic sequence comes from the naturally degenerate genetic code, bringing up the question of whether this is entirely man-made. What is seen here is a disconnect, in that it would be difficult to set  fundamental patenting protocols for the field of synthetic biology, given the legal complications faced in both the field of biology and computing. This is where many may agree that an open-source strategy such as the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts would bring forth more progression, versus the time and effort it would take to validate the patentability of a biological part or process.
SWOT Analysis
Below are other indicators to help define the relative benefit of introducing patent law, as well as the long-term threats that may hinder the advancement of research in the field of synthetic biology.
Strengths
1.Patenting assists in stimulating investment, and secured investments bring forth progression in research. Given that research projects can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars, patenting synthetic biology technologies would provide a more steady approach in financing the development of an invention.
2.Developers are motivated by reward, which is provided by the successful implementation of patent law
Weaknesses
1.The field of synthetic biology is different in the sense that innovation is not promoted through attaining proprietary rights to an entire process or genome, but through the collaborative use of fine, functional and specific biological parts
2.Synthetic biology is multidisciplinary as it incorporates the field of biotechnology and computing, each has their own sets of legal rights, restrictions, and pitfalls
3.In addition, lawyers would require a more extensive level of knowledge and proficiency in both fields
4.Sometimes, hundreds of parts are necessary for the composition of one biological machine, and attaining rights to each part would create what is called to be a ""patent thicket"" (Rutz, 2009). Attaining rights to"

While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.

Parts
We submitted three parts to the Registry this year: two parts involved in PHB synthesis and one part involved in PHB secretion.
To meet our medal requirements, we submitted BBa_K2260001 as a new part, which uniquely contains the phaJ4 gene native to Pseudomonas putida, along with the phaC1 gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
We also improved two parts. The first, BBa_K2260000 , was an improvement on Imperial College's phaCAB operon submitted in 2013. The gene order was changed to improve PHB yield (Hiroe et al., 2012), codons were optimized for expression in Escherichia coli, and restriction sites were removed to allow part compatibility in all iGEM RFC assembly standards. The second, BBa_K2260002 , was an improvement on SDU Denmark's phasin-HlyA part submitted in 2016. Codons were optimized for expression in E. coli.

Phillip's Notes
Introduction:  Today begins the first attempt at expressing the protein cage received from Yeates.  The glycerol stock will be used to streak a new plate, the bacteria will be grown and protein expression will be induced with IPTG.  Afterwards, affinity purification will be used to obtain a relatively pure protein cage sample for analysis to be determined.
Streaking plates:
Procedures:
A sample from the glycerol stock was scraped using a sterile wire loop and streaked onto ampicillin plates.  Plating was done in a zigzag fashion, and with aseptic techniques. The plate was set in the 37C incubator. LB was made using 25g of Difco LB mix, and autoclaved for 30minutes in a liquid cycle.
Observations:
The cells may have been burned as the tip was not cooled upon the second streak!  Olivia suggested to warm the plate up for ~ 20-30 minutes before use.  The plate was set in the 37C incubator at 2:40PM."

Evening: Gary, Liz, Tom, Patrick, Duke, Ryan
During the day-shift Robert continued to work on the PCR optimization, with the second set of Gels showing a continued contamination of one of the main components, pointing possibly to the template mixing into the dNTP's. Patrick helped Tom with some Thermophilic cultures, and Ryan completed the Plasmid Transformations of T3, K3, & C3 along with the Batch prep of the CAT8 plasmids.
We caught tonight's attendees up to speed as to where the group stands on it's individual projects. Then together we discussed in detail how to break up the foundational work-flow and what steps need to be accomplished to make them happen. Patrick detailed some of the foundational work previously performed by the earlier iGEM teams on Artificial Neural Networks.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  BCA assay will be done on the final elution of the previous affinity purification.  According to Kevin from the Yeate’s lab, a minimum of 2mg/mL of protein is needed for the DLS assay.
Procedures: The standard procedure was followed in the Thermo BCA kit in order to prepare the standard solutions.  All standards were diluted in triton lysis buffer.
Elution 3 was used because it appeared to be the purest.  Upon starting the assay, it was noted that some of the protein was aggregating and precipitating out of solution.  The tube was spun down at max speed for 5 minutes, and the supernatant collected.  The samples ran were the following:
Elution with aggregate, supernatant, 1:10 supernatant, and 1:100 supernatant.
A standard curve was constructed on excel.  Only absorbance readings at about .1 to 1 were used.  Only the original elution showed a measured protein concentration at about 620ug/mL.
Conclusion:  It appears that most of the protein cage is aggregating out of solution.  Perhaps this can be used in order to separate the protein cage in the other two elutions, and resuspend them in a higher volume."

Human Practice
Human Practice has always been a crucial part of an IGEM project. In order to establish integrated human practice with enough social engagement, we performed the following tasks.
 
Gold
 
Online Media
At the beginning of the project, we set up a Wechat official account, a form of online media, where our team posted articles that introduce concept and knowledge relating to our project. The official account was run by one team member and articles about introduction of lab safety, team member introduction, and interview with a doctor at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, an article about what is colorectal cancer, and an article talks about synthetic biology as well as our team’s project.
*Zhongnan Hospital is a hospital run by Wuhan University. Its whole name is Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
Presentations
During our visit in Hangzhou, we did a presentation to students from Yiling Middle School in Zhejiang University. As this is also a part of collaboration, the participated teams talked about different aspects of IGEM competition. Our team focused on the introduction of our project through explaining what is colorectal cancer and mechanism of how microRNA controlling gene expression as well as cell cycle. Later we went to the Zhejiang Science Museum to introduce our project and the competition to the public. We hand out fans with information about colorectal cancer, tell the tourists about the project, and we designed games relating to science for the younger children to play. The process of handing out the fans and talking to tourists involves a lot of social interaction where we get to know about people’s attitude toward cancer related projects.
Survey
To better understand the public opinion, a survey was designed after returning from Hangzhou. The first version was released and received 333 responses. A second modified version was released with changes in the descriptions and choices of the questions so to avoid the equivocation occurred in the first one."

The expression of COMPy is lower than the expression of COMPy noTAG, in Figure 5 the peaks are at a higher fluorescence than the peaks in Figure 4 . Furthermore this data shows that COMPy and COMPy noTAG do not express well in general. Even for COMPy noTAG, which does not use the non-natural Amino acid, the expression is not that good. When a protein is well expressed a single peak at high fluorescence is expected.

The most commonly used two means, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were developed only after World War II.
Chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells, and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. To some extent, chemotherapy is of certain specificity, but it still terribly influences normal cells;
Now there are some drugs for chemotherapy with less side effects.
● In 2004 after the listing of the molecular targeted drugs iressa (also known as  Gefitnib), situation has been greatly changed.
Targeting drugs have a lot of advantages:
Firstly, targeted drugs can be taken orally, removing troublesomeness of hospitalization, providing more convenience;
Secondly, the side effects are relatively small;
Thirdly, it concerned with genes associated with the disease, offering efficacy for specific populations.
● Most of our chemotherapy drugs perform by intravenous infusion, so patients need to be hospitalized. Yet lots of molecular targeted drugs are kinase inhibitors of small molecules, which can be made into oral dosage, providing patients with great convenience. Also, compared to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs with more specifically design, cause far less side effects. Life quality during treatment can be greatly improved from the patient's perspective.
● An important significance of molecular targeted drugs is that, in the past, most drugs are searched and then acquired by human from the nature, but the molecular targeted drugs is a re-creation of human with certain purposes, thus a great revolutionary breakthrough.
● The emergence of targeted drugs allow the basic research apply into clinical cases, leading a revolution in the field of oncology.
● Now, for those who can take targeted drugs, that is patients with sensitive mutations, we can practice molecular targeted drugs combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at the same time, enabling patients to survive up to three years --- such a survival period is pretty remarkable. (In fact, clinically 2 to 3 months of survival extension could be viewed as miracle.) The emergence of molecular targeted drugs, combined with a reasonable quantity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has promoted a huge progress compared to a dozen years ago.
● One or two decades ago, doctors would have thought it irrelevant to his treatment if they heard about a mutation in a patient's genetic site. With the emergence of targeted drugs, the clinical treatment of tumors upswing to a molecular level.

Collaborations
Collaboration with Harvard
We met team Harvard at New England iGEM, a regional meeting held at Boston University. After hearing about each other’s projects, we became aware that both our teams envisioned cell encapsulation to be a component of our respective projects. During that time, team Harvard expressed concerns over finding an expert on hydrogels and encapsulation who could teach them relevant lab protocols and allow them to make informed decisions about their project’s direction. Therefore, both teams decided to continue correspondence in order to find an expert and get essential training.
In August, team MIT met up with Derfogail Delcassian, a graduate student working on hydrogels at the Langer Lab and she offered to help us get trained as well as provide imperative feedback that we could use to design future experiments. We got team Harvard in contact with Derfogail and they arranged a lab visitation day at MIT. Based on their feedback, the training and input that they received from Derfogail was very helpful. We continued our correspondence after that and planned to develop a cell-encapsulation protocol manual in the future for bacterial and mammalian cells, so that the technique would be more easily accessible for future iGEM teams.
Collaboration with University of Connecticut:
We met Team UConn at NEGEM as well. During their presentation, they expressed concerns about certain protocols they needed help with and some lab training that they wanted to receive (and for which they could not find relevant experts at UConn). We reached out to them after the conference in order to provide them training in the relevant areas that they needed help in. They wanted to learn more about the electroporation protocol, making stocks of electrocompetent cells, Golden Gate assembly and lab work-flows. Therefore, in August, team MIT hosted team UConn at our lab. After a brief lab tour, we answered a bunch of their questions about transformations and golden gate, and mentored them through our own protocols.
Collaboration with Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)
Team MIT and Team WPI realized that we were both working on biofilms through Instagram and decided to collaborate on this common area. Over our Skype call, we both discussed our biofilm assay protocols and came to the realization that we had very different techniques to quantify biofilm formation. While we were using Colony"

4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
 
For safety development in dry lab, we notice that there are few safety rules for programmers. As software is also an essential part of bio research, the safety of both programmers and program need to be concerned.
For safety development in wet lab, the copyright of Biobrick is also needed to be protected.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#PoliciesAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," of this subteam receive. We concentrated on looking at two regions: Tanzania and Ethiopia. One of the topics that was researched is the organization and management structure of the National Health System in Tanzania. The National Health System in Tanzania has central-district  government structure. There are several layers in the Health Services Structure: village health service, dispensary services, Health Centre Services, District Hospitals, Regional Hospitals, and Referral/Consultant Hospitals. Village health service is the lowest level. Usually each village has two health workers who received short training before starting. Dispensary services supervise all the village health posts in its ward. Health Centre Services provide care for about 50,000 people. Each district then has a district hospital. Regional hospitals are similar to district hospitals, but they offer additional services and have specialists in certain fields. Referral/Consultant Hospitals represent the highest level in the country. There also are private health facilities that are often owned by government health care workers which creates a conflict of interest. In Ethiopia, on the other hand, the core of the health policy is accessibility of healthcare for all parts of the population, and encouraging private and non government organization participation in the health sector. Some of the priorities of the health policy include health information, education, communication, development of health service management systems, and provision of essential medicines, medical supplies, and equipment.  We also found a paper on National Drug Policy of The Transitional Government of Ethiopia (Nov. 1993). The following is the summary of the relevant sections: 1. Selection of Drugs This section states that National Drug list will be formulated considering safety, efficiency, quality and cost and based on health problems in the country, infrastructure, and fundings. National Drugs Advisory Committee will be established to evaluate and decide upon drugs and to create lists of drugs used in the country.  2. Drug Supply The country plans to establish drug manufacturing facilities with the possible help from private investments. Pharmacists would be responsible for compounding drugs in hospitals, pharmacies and drugs while  maintaining required standards. The government will also establish an enterprise to distribute the drugs on the national and regional levels. Both public and private sectors will be involved in the production of drugs. 3. Stock Management and Distribution Storage facilities will be created to ensure proper conditions for drug storage.  4. Drug Administration and Control The National Drug Advisory Committee will be responsible to evaluating drugs based on safety, quality, price, and other criterias. Drugs that satisfy the requirements will be issued certificated and existing drugs will go through regular evaluations. Information about harmful and beneficial effects of drugs will be collected."

>Measure 10 times and add values for the total light output value for each sample.
>Take average from 3 replicates for a final value.
This data reveals that higher levels of PCK appears to increase ATP concentrations within the samples. However there are a number of caveats attached to these results. Firstly the light measurements were below the values obtained in the ATP standard curve and secondly the 'PCK 0' measurement had a higher than expected value.
However although these results need to be repeated, they largely confirm what the WashU team had observed in their own analysis .
Exploring dCas9 with Saclay
We met members from Team Saclay at the European Meetup. After discussing our projects we recognised that we both planned on utilising dCas's specific DNA binding function coupled to a split reporter system. Additionally it later became clear that we both were going to use the E.coli codon optimised Cas9 from S.pyogenes, with additonal conserved mutations to knockout endonuclease activity. This linkage inspired us to plan to look at potentially testing each others guide constructs with the reporters we had individually developed (Cardiff- Split Luciferase/ Saclay - Split GFP).
However both teams were unfortunately unable to clone this dCas9 gene. This is due to unforeseen issues arising either from use of the original biobrick or from our cloning schemes. From the Cardiff perspective we speculate that the size of our construct (approximately 5kb) made this experiment unsuitable for the cloning technique we had initial chosen, which is outlined on our Parts page . Ultimately it was useful to discuss the similarities in our project and swap war-stories about the techniques that we might use for cloning these genes.
Meetups
European Experience 2016 - Paris
Despite being newcomers to the competition we were eager to discuss and share our ideas with other teams. We first headed off to Paris barely 5 days after we finished training to present our design to over 20 different teams from 11 different countries. During the conference we became familiar with multiple teams, and received input into one of the potential designs of our system. This is where we discovered iGEM Paris Saclay - a fellow team using the same CRISPR-dCAS9 system.

The enzymatic biotinylation of the Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP) using recombinant BirA biotin ligase is well established but could not be show before the wiki freeze. In Summary the whole device works great but there seems to be a limitation concerning the size of proteindomains that can be presented with the EspP autotransporter. We are curious to see what future iGEM teams will use the EspP Autotransporter in the future.

Experiment 1a: Verify nitrite stability in anaerobic, untransformed E. coli
Characterization of the behavior of E. coli wild type while growing in the presence of nitrite in an anaerobic reaction chamber by measuring the conversion of nitrite to ammonium.
In this anaerobic experiment three different concentrations of nitrite are added to a medium where a native strain of E. coli is growing, in order to test the rate at which nitrite is converted to ammonium.  The hypothesis is that nitrite will be converted into ammonium. We want to determine how readily, and at what concentrations this happens. The anaerobic experiments will be performed in a sealed flask.  The concentrations of NH4+ and NO2- will be measured every 20 minutes and the experiment will last for 3 hours. The literature states that 10mmol of NO2- is converted into NH4+ per mg cell biomass per hour. There will be also a magnetic stirrer on 250 rpm. Each sample with different concentrations of nitrite will be measured separately, as well as the controls.  There will be three controls. One will be with only anaerobic biomass to check the behavior of cells without nitrite. A second one will be anaerobic abiotic with nitrite and medium to check that there is not any conversion of nitrite in the medium. A third anaerobic with killed biomass to confirm that reaction is catalyzed only by microbial activity.

In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.

In the beginning each team introduced their projects, then we gave our audience a basic introduction of what synthetic biology  iGEM is. Afterwards we had a further talk about the problems we had in our previous experiments, project design, modeling and hp work. Team Jiangnan_China and team LZU-China met some difficulties in interlab study, too, so we gave them some instructions, pointed out their mistakes and helped them find the correct way to finish the study. We had further collaboration with team Jiangnan_China by providing them the cell lysis gene that we tested  functional in our project. It helped them to improve the environment safety of their project. In this meeting, we benefited a lot from other three teams and therefore had new ideas about how to finish our project. Many thanks to team Jiangnan_China, team DLUT_China and team LZU-China, and we appreciate teachers and students from Jiangsu Normal University who helped us find a meeting room.

I have been working simultaneously between art and science, sharing graphic design tasks with Matilda and assisting the core lab team in the laboratory. I made the first poster for the European iGEM Meetup and took the individual photos of our team members. I made various GIFs and videos for our project which I scripted and narrated. I went through literature to learn more about acne and interviewed patients as well as specialists. I was responsible for replying to the comments and messages we received through our Facebook page and when our team leader was away I lead the Skype meetings from our part. I designed primers for our BioBricks, though we didn’t need them in the end. I held a workshop and taught other team members how to use Adobe Illustrator. For the wiki I made most of the illustrations explaining the laboratory work. I wrote about acne in general and its effects on mental health to the wiki. I also wrote about the lacking transparency in cosmetic markets to the ethics part of the wiki and contributed to other pages as well, such as Attributions and Dialog. I took part in fundraising and as the team’s treasurer I took care of invoices and our bank account. I worked on the survey result analysis with Michal. A big portion of the pictures and updates on our social media accounts were posted by me and I also managed our blog in the beginning.

I was one of the responsible people for lab work and experimental design along with Meryem and Oona. Since I was more experienced in antimicrobial testing I played a primary role when we planned our experiments. I spent most of my days in the lab working and also documenting our results and parts in wiki. The process also involved literature research and brainstorming for application ideas. Together with Meryem I documented the parts that we sent to the iGEM registry.

Transcription factor development
We have developed a pipeline for selection and characterization of new transcription factors (TFs), specifically:
in vivo selection of functional mutants from a large library of variants using a “survival of the weakest” strategy;
in vitro characterization of affinity and specificity of mutants with MITOMI;
in vivo characterization of selected mutants using reporter plasmids.
Our data can be found here : Data .
Our project can be decomposed into four main parts:
In vivo TF selection system
As the first step in our pipeline we propose a new in vivo method for the automated selection of mutant transcription factors or transcription factor binding sites from large and diverse libraries containing millions of variants. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we use negative selection, or “survival of the weakest” as the selection strategy. In our method, a functional variant activates lysis of the host, leading to release of the plasmid DNA coding for the functional variant. The plasmid DNA can then be amplified, transformed, or directly sequenced to determine which variants were functional. We believe that our negative selection scheme is a potentially powerful approach when coupled to next-generation sequencing. Using a proof-of-concept version of the system , consisting of a T7 driven lysis cassette we were able to show that:
Cells can be specifically lysed upon induction of the lysis cassette.
DNA can be recovered from the lysed cells.
We get an enrichment of plasmids originating from lysed cells in a mock selection experiment.
In vitro TF characterization
We used a microfluidic based approach for characterizing TF mutants in vitro. The MITOMI method allows us to measure absolute binding affinities and specificities of transcription factors. We determined the precise binding energy landscape of the wild type TetR transcription factor. We also generated several TetR transcription factor mutants and determined the specificities of a number of the new variants.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#molecular interlab_-_-_TEXT.html," the fluorescence measurements. We obtained higher fluorescence values in wells only containing media compared to the wells containing the test devices and the postive and negative control. Since the values are negative, it is hard to conclude anything from the results. However, the graph indicates that test device 2 contains the strongest promoter. The results from test device 3 has a lower fluorescence compared to the negative controls, which should not be the case.

The absolute fluorescence indicate the same results as indicated in Figure 2. It appears that test device 2 has the strongest promoter. However, the values are also negative in this plot and the experiment should be repeated. It is also observed that the absolute fluorescence for each construct decreases over time. This decrease may be due to cells not being able to handle the plasmid.
Conclusion
The InterLab study should be repeated since negative fluorescence values were obtained. However, our results indicate that test device 2 has the strongest promoter.

What People Says About iGEM UB ?
GAMANANTA Support UB iGEM Team 2014
When i was a child, i’m educated by my parents about the importance of healthiness. Because we believe that healthiness is expensive. Therefore, eventhough we can not avoid sickness, prevention action is better than curing. Especially disease that spread by HPV virus on cervical cancer which generally attacks women. Men can also suffered from this disease.
Seeing the description of the outline of project brought by the IGEM team Biology FMIPA at UB, I become understand how important their steps. The program brings the C3P (Cervical Cancer Care - Preventing, Screening, Treatment) that are currently in progress of development, IGEM team Biology FMIPA offers a real solution on prevention of cervical cancer at early stages. A solution with a very good prospect. Shows the path of the light that prevention is indeed better.
For me personally, with GAMANANTA friends as travelling community that loves to have a trip, fully support that program. I openly invite friends to not underestimate cervical cancer because its deadly impact. We often underestimate influenza that can disturb our trip. It will not very sad if our dream travel to various quarters of destination both domestic and foreign disturbed by the presence of a virus diseases might threaten at any time.
I hope, among IGEM team Biology FMIPA UB and their program objectives could have a positive relation. Thus, it feel easier if both components work together. Awareness program objectives are not easily changed, but does not mean impossible. And C3P development program is one solutive step to increase awareness of program objectives . Time to beat the ""drums of war"" against cervical cancer and together achieve a better future.
