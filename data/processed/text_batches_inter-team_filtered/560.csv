The team
We are the SDU-Denmark 2015 iGEM Team! Our team represents four different faculties; the faculty of science, the faculty of health sciences, the faculty of humanities, and the technical faculty.  Coming from different backgrounds and with different competencies we wanted to find a project that could unite our different set of skills and make them work synergistically.
Kathrine Balslev Skovmøller
Since I have some experience in creating magazines and other graphic work my primary job has been to develop our wiki and other PR  related tasks. Though I have never tried doing either HTML or CSS before it has been great fun and I have learned a lot of new awesome stuff. In my real life I study medicine on my 6th semester. My motivation for participating in this project was to meet new challenges and of course  have a fun summer and meet new people! I have been working on the medical and therapeutic perspective of our project.

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," institution. This year, the uOttawa iGEM team did three presentations as part of EMCP courses. We did presentations in both English and French versions of the ""Detectives in Genes/Jeans"" course and a presentation in ""The Wonderful World of Electronic Imaging."" Our presentations featured activities such as DNA extraction from strawberries, exploration of synthetic gene network design using Lego and building marshmallow animals to learn about meiosis. Throughout the course of these presentations, we reached around 100 students and had a great time doing it.
In fact, we enjoyed this experience so much that we are now in talks to design and run our own enrichment mini-course program. Preparation starts up again this fall and we are ready to get involved.
University Course Design
Inspired by universities around the world who have already integrated synthetic biology courses in their curricula and by our own belief in the importance of exposing undergraduate students to the emerging field of synthetic biology, our iGEM HP team has helped put a synthetic biology course in the works at the University of Ottawa. As a team, we researched various topics and put together a first draft of the course outline, after which we handed it over to our team instructor and faculty member Dr. Mads Kaern, who will be moving the idea forward.
To gauge interest in a synthetic biology course, our team also designed and administered a survey to students at the University of Ottawa. The primary results were overwhelmingly positive.
This figure breaks down the survey respondents by field of study. Total responses = 72.
Responses to the main question in the student survey show that over 80% of respondents would be interested in taking a course discussing synthetic biology and genetic engineering concepts. Total responses = 74.
Some student comments we received as part of the survey:
""I think this course could be really practical!""
""This sounds so cool. I wish I wasn’t graduating so I could stick around and take this class.""
""I think this is [a] fantastic idea for a course and I hope it generates enough interest to become a reality!""
""Great idea, hope this pans out!""
oGEM and Synthetic Biology Ontario
The Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine (oGEM) conference was held in Toronto on Aug 9-10. The conference aimed to further develop the iGEM competition and involved the discussion of topics relevant to this purpose among the five Ontario iGEM teams.

Our project thus built upon the landmark study on optogenetically-regulated bioproduction in yeast [23] and demonstrated that the use of this technology with bacteria shows promise. We envision this to be the future of biomanufacturing.

STRESS REPORTER
Stress, and the cell’s response to it, is a universal phenomenon. In large industrial bioreactors, stress is exacerbated owing to the large variation in the local environment as compared to small bench-top fermenters or shake-flask cultures. This is the result of a longer global mixing time, causing significant heterogeneity in the medium. Besides hydrodynamic shear stress, cells are also subjected to stress induced by fluctuations in the level of oxygen, pH, substrate, and other parameters [24]. As Dr Nic Lindley said, “take a sample point in a bioreactor and you get an image, take a look of the whole bioreactor and you get a film.”
All these compound the difficulty in translating the biological potential of the cell as demonstrated in the laboratory into actual production. One type of stress, however, applies to bench-top experiments in the laboratory and large-scale processes in the industry, and across the bioproduction of any compounds. This opens up the possibility of investigating and regulating it in bioproduction.
This particular stress is that induced by the expression of recombinant proteins. The depletion of finite cellular resources during the expression of synthetic constructs constitutes an unwanted burden, hampering the growth and expected performance of engineered cells in an unpredictable manner [25]. Stress regulation was accomplished by decreasing the expression of a synthetic construct in response to increasing burden. Regulated cells outperformed controls in protein yield [26], a discovery with significant implications for the future of biomanufacturing.
Therefore, we strove to improve our yield by incorporating a stress reporter module into our system, which studies the level of stress induced by our constructs and facilitates stress regulation. The module consists of the mRFP gene placed under the control of a burden-responsive promoter PhtpG1 (Figure 11a). This particular promoter showed high promise as a biosensor for burden, as it displayed the best ON/OFF characteristics compared to other promoters that were similarly upregulated upon the induction of synthetic constructs [26].

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"
Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," misconceptions about the OGMs, a lack of concrete knowledge about what DNA           manipulations and Synthetic Biology mean. So from these feedbacks we felt that we had to involve           the general public in the design of our project and that we also needed to explain it in the more           general context of GMOs and Synthetic Biology. In order to do so, we planned to participate in           various scientific exhibitions for the public, to broadcast our project in medias, to create educative           videos translated in different languages and to create a theater play, as an innovative mean, to           educate and to trigger debates with the public about the OGMs and synthetic biology.
Safety
We were aware that we were manipulating toxic chemicals as well as GMOs that           could endanger the environment and people’s health. Therefore, we were willing to take all the           precautionary measures. The first was to complete a formation about safety in the laboratory           supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was in charge of the safety procedures in the laboratory.
Abstract: In the lab, we have to respect numerous safety regulations for the security and health of others and the environment.
Presence of safety department in INSA
During summer, our team worked in the engineering school INSA, which has a safety department. Their goal is to ensure the well-being of the employees, regarding safety rules and risk prevention. In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures. Thanks to her, we have completed a formation (with the NEO software) to learn the different risks related to our work in the laboratory and how to react in case of danger. The formation contained four parts: prevention, fire risk, biological risk and chemical risk. At the end, we had a test to make sure that we comprehended everything.
--> Autoclave training: Our team has taken an autoclave training, which showed us the explosive and implosive dangers of the dispositive and the security measures to take in order to protect oneself. A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses were required for the manipulation of the autoclave.
--> Legislation and French Labor Law: We work in a public school for engineers (INSA Toulouse), thus we have to respect the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms. As we work with microorganisms and cell cultures, we are concerned by the regulation on workers’ protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No. 94-352 of 4 May 1994).

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," sampled across all variants by homogenizing the first 60 base pairs, which can impact TIR.
Our construct before insertion of the dRBS
The dRBS will be inserted between Sac1 and Pst1
pFTV carrying a variant GFP. The dRBS will be inserted between sites Sac1 and Pst1.
Insertion of the dRBS
The spacer which had held a place for the dRBS is cut out by the enzymes Sac1 and Pst1
dRBS is flanked by restriction sites Sac1 and Pst1 and is manufactured by annealing two compliementary oligos that contain the dRBS.
The Ribosome Binding Site
The degenerate ribosome binding site (dRBS) is a sequence that contains a ribosome binding site library. Using software developed by the Salis Lab, we calculated the range of translation initiation (TIR) that would be expected for this sequence, from 0.5-157,000 au.
Check out the cool software that allowed us to accomplish this.
The dRBS sequence is the location where the ribosome binds, and a higher TIR will allow more ribosomes to bind to the mRNA. It was essential to measure the performance of our synthetic GFPs over a wide range of TIR in order to see if expression plateaued at high TIR, indicating that translation elongation was the rate limiting step, or whether it climbed along with TIR, indicating that elongation had been made sufficiently more efficient as to avoid any plateau.
The sequence carries five degenerate letters. Four of these specify one of two possible bases, while the other specifies one of three. Because of this, there are 2*2*2*2*3 = 48 possible sequences in our dRBS.
Graph showing the sequences in our library and their calculated TIR
Each number on the x axis corresponds to one of the sequences out of the total 48. TIR is graphed on the y axis.

TaZ Construct
Completed and Biobricked
We found the receptor, tar-envZ biobrick (Bba_C0082) which contains the coding sequence for Taz. In order to use the Taz we added the promoter Pcat (Bba_I14033), an RBS (Bba_B0034) and double terminator (Bba_B0015).  Thus we created the Taz construct biobrick BBa_K1343016 .

Two different E. coli strains were tested:
(1)BW25113 - parent strain for the Keio collection
(2)JW3367-3 - Keio collection mutant with EnvZ deletion
(These strains were given to us by Lior Zelcbuch, Elad Hertz from Ron Milo’s lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science)
The goal was to compare the expression in the wild type and in the ΔEnvZ mutant.  We expected that in the wild type the expression will be greater than in the mutant since the natural EnvZ/ompR system will cause expression of the RFP.

What is a copyright?
Copyright is a form of protection for original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression.
Copyright formally establishes the ownership between authors and both published and unpublished works.
How would one go about obtaining a copyright?
The process of obtaining a copyright can be found here .
What does iGEM or MIT own from this competition? in what capacity?
According to the BioBrick™ Public Agreement, neither iGEM nor MIT own the material submitted to the competition. The competition and the university are simply the venue for displaying the bioengineering projects. Any possible ownership does not fall on iGEM or MIT; parts, documentation, and presented materials are all property of the competitors participating in the iGEM competition.
What does the BioBrick™ Foundation own? in what capacity?
The BioBrick™ Foundation is a nonprofit organization storing open source material. It does not privately own any of the BioBrick™ parts. All of the BioBrick™ parts are available for anyone to use. A draft of a public agreement has been written to help define concerns about BioBrick™ submissions.
See the BioBrick™ Public Agreement draft (PDF).
What does the university own? in what capacity?
The university may lay claim to objects produced within the context of the university as agreed upon by students when they have matriculated and accepted working positions. For example, a university may own all developments funded by the university, while individual discoverers or developers may receive royalties on profits.
If another team patents a process for their project, and submit its BioBrick™ parts to the Registry, can I use those bricks in my project?
Certainly! The team can only patent a novel process it develops. It cannot both patent a brick and send it in to the Registry to be distributed. If a team uses a patented sequence in its project, you will need special permission from the patent-holder to obtain and use the sequence in your project, but in this case, the DNA would not be available in the Registry.
The iGEM requirement that BioBrick™ parts must be submitted to the Registry to be eligible for judging incentivizes the submission of new parts into the public domain, allowing other teams to build on them and create even better systems. This prevents the universal application of patents to all iGEM projects and maintains the open nature of the Registry. In this way, iGEM projects and entrepreneurial efforts can coexist peacefully, and indeed, fruitfully. Teams contribute to the overall body of available genetic parts, and can protect their innovation by patenting their unique procedure or a few parts"

ETHZ_Basel,2010,Team:ETHZ Basel#Modeling#Movement_-_-_TEXT.html," future state: p1: the probability of the future state being directed movement, when the current state is directed movement and p2: the probability of the future state being tumbling, when the current state is tumbling.
In deriving the expression of these probabilities, we separately and symmetrically focused on the two processes: directed movement and tumbling. As a consequence, the mean run length is only dependent on the time step and on the probability of continuing the directed movement (p1), while the mean tumbling length is only dependent on the time step and on the probability of continuing tumbling (p2).
We will explain in detail the technique employed in deriving the probability of being in the directed movement state, when the previous state was directed movement. Symmetrical calculations, for the mean tumbling length, follow identically.
The mean run length is the expected value of a random variable representing the number of time steps the cell consecutively spends in the directed movement phase. Since in simulating our system we will always assume a constant time step per simulation, but with the possibility of changing its value in between simulations, we will denote the time step by Δt. By expanding the definition of an expected value, the mean run length becomes an infinite sum over all possible consecutive run-lengths, multiplied by their respective occurrence probabilities.
In the final expression of the transition probability p1, dt stands for the fixed time step we used in simulating our system.
Direction Changes
Angular Velocity during Tumbling
As stated above, the observed probability distribution of the absolute angle change between two directed movement phases is not maximal around zero. An intuitive approach, which would set the angular speed to a randomly positive or negative value drawn independently from a symmetric probability distribution, would always result in a distribution having its maximum around zero, therefore not reproducing the real motility behavior.
We thus decided to keep the angular velocity fixed for an entire tumbling phase. However, even with this approach, it was not possible to fully reproduce the quantitative properties of the observed distribution.
The reason for this discrepancy was that the shape of the distribution of the tumbling lengths makes it impossible to create a distribution of the angle changes corresponding in all of its properties to the observed one, without making the angular speed inversely proportional to the tumbling length. Although such an approach is easy to implement, the resulting model would be characterized by a lack of mathematical aesthetic.

Audiences participating in this public speech
The final part was the most important section, the announcement for our own projects. We public two project, which came out after long time discussion and brainstorm. One is a novel proteins expression system with circular mRNA and RNA thermometer. Another is Synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation. Professor Lv asked many question about circular mRNA. He thought it could be used as drug to regulate gene expression; however he doubted that whether it could be used to translation of proteins. Hence, James explain the mechanism of group I intron self-splicing RNA and results from literatures. Pro. Lv agreed and would like to help us with the project. Dr. Liu thought RNA thermometer was quite interesting and could be widely used. She hoped we could use RNA thermometer to create a fantastic project. Although the projects were replaced by another better idea, we were benefit from group discussion and research training.

2.1 References
UVR8-TetRDBD
UVR8 (UV Resistance Locus 8) acts as a UVB photoreceptor in plants. It regulates the transcription factor COP and indirectly affects the expression of a myriad of genes. However, we employ it differently, as described here . In the following, we analyse the theoretical requirements for our system that employs UVR8's dimerisation ability to work. It involves some manual parameter optimisation in order to determine the optimal concentration regimes for the receptors and enzymes in the cell.
Circuit
The following scheme illustrates the system:
Modelling assumptions
In order to analyse a number of properties of the system, the model needs to be tractable. For this, a number of assumptions and approximations have been made:
UVR8-TetRDBD is conserved. This translates to a model not explicitly accounting for UVR8-TetRDBD expression/degradation, as this will be the case for most systems in steady state anyway.
The photoconversion process upon UV exposure of UVR8-TetRDBD is modelled as a 2-state process. While fundamentally it is highly likely that the conversion process involves a number of (meta-stable) intermediates, there is usually one rate-determining step. All other steps are then assumed to be in quasi-stationary state, thus simplifying to a 2-state system.
Those parts of the metabolic pathway that have been cloned into our E.coli have been incorporated into our model."

A large scale proteins extraction was done on the culture of AE Blue-CBD-Tag started on Monday and spun down earlier this morning and placed in the -20 °C. Using a small amount of LB and vigorous vortexing, the clumped cells were transfered from the four individual bottles they were in into one 50 mL Falcon Tube. The empty tube weighed 3.123 g.
●
The Falcon tube containing the cells was balanced then spun at 500 g (4500 RPM ) for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the falcon tube was weighed again: 14.034 g. Subtracting from the empty weight: 1.811 g of cells.
●
18 mL of Cell lytic B was added to the falcon tube  (add cell lytic B 10 ml/(g of cell)). 180 uL DNAse (10uL/(ml total solution)),  36 uLRNAse (2uL/(ml total solution)), and 2 uL lysozyme (10 mg/mL -> want final concetration to be .2 mg/mL).
●
After those four things were added, the falcon tube was taped to a vortex and shaken for 10 minutes at max speed then spun down for 15 minutes at max speed (12000 RPM). The supernatant was discarded and the clumped cells were used in the protein purification process according to the Protocol detailed elsewhere in this notebook (under label: Protocols > Large Scale Protein Extraction). Interestingly, the color of the solution during this process was a bright purple color.
●
An SDS page gel was run on each of the collected fractions during the protein extraction process (EQ, Wash 1, Wash 2, Wash 3, Elution Buffer) then stained with RUBY. In the Washes 1-3 and Elution Buffer, there appeared to be equal amounts of the protein we are attempting to purify at each stage, but the amount of other proteins present in the gel decreased"

Simulation is a simulator designed to solve the concentration function with respect to time based on the differential equations given by the user. After the user has submitted control functions, this module will upload relative data to a high performance server, which will be able to return results in minutes or hours, based on the quantity of control functions and the width of time domain. The concentration of all nodes will be displayed visualized, meanwhile a proper notice will pop up if an instability is detected in order to warn the user to be cautious about the result after the critical point.
You can simulate concentration of genes’ products by entering controlling ODEs. There are two ways to access to “Simulation”: Clicking “Simulation” at sidebar, or entering pano project and selecting “Simulation” with some certain nodes. Normally, the second way is more common. Here is the instruction of “Simulation”.
1. Enter your pano project and click button 1.
2. On the popped dialog, click “START SIMULATION”.
Module:BLAST
BioHub provide users with convenient one-key BLAST. In graphical interface, the user select the components which he or she wants to align the sequence, and by just pressing one build-in button, BioHub will read the sequence and align it with sequences in online databases using BLAST interface provided by NCBI, and show the outcome simply and elegantly to the users.
Tips: BLAST is available only online. When using NCBI BLAST API, any user should obey their usage guidelines.
Module:ABACUS
A plugin design to design amino acid sequence from the .pdb file provided by user. The uploaded .pdb file will be evaluated by several progress, with support of simulated annealing algorithm, then the server will generate a .zip file containing several .pdb files and .fasta files for user to download. It’s recommended to run this plugin on a high performance server, because the plugin will invoke computationally intensive programs. So please be patient while this plugin is running, it may take several hours to get results on a high performance server. You can press get status button to check if the calculation is done.
ABACUS can be a really useful function, because for synthetic biologists who want to design new protein, they may need to know the amino acid sequence for proteins in specific structure. For some researchers, they also need to design new protein which should in maximum degree resemble their original structure, which is needed to purify the protein. This steps can be really time-consuming, because if you make some mistakes in designing amino acid sequences"

CPU_CHINA,2018,Team:CPU CHINA#Application_-_-_TEXT.html," now regarded as a ‘gold standard’ in the design of new anticancer agents[10].
The disease we choose to apply on, Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), manifest a high vascular density, so it tend to have a relatively increased EPR effect[8]. By containing our two plasmids system in a liposome size ranges between 1-200nm(the size of nanomedicines) it can enrich in the tumor owing to EPR effect and thus, having a better selectivity on HCC.
Drug delivery based on Ligand-targeted liposome
Passive delivery like the delivery based on EPR effect is simple, yet its effect varies depending on a patient's pathological and physiological characteristics and clinical condition, for instance, when a patient's systolic blood pressure is low side of about 90 mm Hg instead of 120–130 mm Hg, the hydro-dynamic force pushing blood from the luminal side of a vessel into tumor tissue becomes significantly low, which results in a low EPR [8].
Aside from preferential accumulation in tumors, nano-particle-based drug delivery systems can also enhance the pharmacokinetic profile of therapeutic agents. Specifically, the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ""stealth"" coatings greatly enhances blood circulation times by allowing the liposome to evade immune detection[11].
Nanomedicine, particularly liposomal drug delivery, has expanded considerably over the past few decades, and several liposomal drugs are already providing improved clinical outcomes. Liposomes have now progressed beyond simple, inert drug carriers and can be designed to be highly responsive in vivo, with active targeting, increased stealth, and controlled drug-release properties. Ligand-targeted liposomes (LTLs) have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer.
In order to achieve maximum efficacy, controlled release of therapeutic agents from liposomes at the tumor site is essential[12]. Liposomes, can be surface functionalized with targeting ligands to enhance the selective targeting of tumors [13][14]. The grafting of targeting ligands to the liposome surface can further enhance tumor targeting and facilitate intracellular uptake after the liposome reaches the tumor interstitium, which indicates that a specific HCC binding protein(like HCC specific antibody) modified liposome will have a promising efficacy.
Macrophage signal regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) interacts with HCC surface molecule CD47 and resulted in low macrophage response towards HCC. By binding the CD47 specific antibodies (CD47mAbs) on the surface of liposome which carries our two plasmids system, not"

Safety Around Snake Venom
The project revolves around detecting snake venom so it was apparent from the beginning that a safe work environment had to be secured, especially whenever snake venom was handled.
First of all, the snake venoms was purchased from a renowned and trusted supplier that also provided safety sheets [2]. They laid the base for the safety protocol established for working with venom in the laboratory. Venom in its solid form posse the highest risk of harming the handler as it is highly concentrated and a puff of wind may introduce the venom to the eyes or respiratory tract. As a result, only two people on the team was allowed to weigh out the lyophilized venom and it took place in a fume hood wearing gloves, dust mask and eye protection at all times. The venom was immediately dissolved in an, for the experiment conducted, appropriate buffer to minimize the above mentioned risks.
Even though venom diluted in a solution is less dangerous we still work at concentration potentially harmful to humans. Hence, experiments with venom took place in fume hoods wearing gloves and no sharp objects were used. All solutions containing snake venom was disposed off in sealed containers and afterwards sent to destruction in the same way as solid biohazard waste.
Read more about safety in the laboratory here .
Ethics
In this section we are stepping back and considering the ethical implications of our innovation, the economics of the issue and motivations for all involved. That is the social responsibility that carries with knowledge and technology, the financial responsibility and incentives that follow and lastly the considerations of proposing out imperfect solutions in order to alleviate suffering.
Social and human responsibility
Leading the way
We are privileged in Denmark, so privileged that we had a challenging time finding good problems to be solved. A part of that privilege is abundant and nuanced access to what goes on around the world. We have sufficient tools and opportunity to enable us to solve an issue like this. The impact of catalyzing innovation within such a new field as synthetic biology, a field where there is potential lives to be saved.
Helping those in need

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of an ECM, cells need to migrate inside and on top of the tissue. One of the major disadvantages of current tissue engineering approaches is that a cell’s movement once seeded onto a scaffold is hard to control. However, if this movement is guided by a light-path more control can be gained for the structuring process.
Proliferation
Apopotosis - A growing tissue is defined by a dynamic interplay between cellular proliferation and death. For instance, the human embryo originally has webbed feet and hands but the controlled apoptosis of the interdigital regions is responsible for the development of our fine tuned fingers. Similar, in a developing tissue we want to control cell death in certain regions while leaving others to continue proliferating.
We first developed a photosensitive form of the common cell adhesion protein E-cadherin for structure formation, inspired by human body cells that first form structures and then develop into specialised cells. To control the second stage, where cells differentiate (i.e. become specialised via up- and down-regulation of certain genes), we designed a dCas9-TF system, attached to the plasma membrane via the photocleavable linker PhoCl for specific gene activation. When PhoCl is cleaved by light, the dCas9-TF is free to move into the nucleus and activate the gene of interest. In comparison to other approaches, our system would require only a brief pulse of light to cleave PhoCl and be activated.
A modified multi-photon microscope, using two light-sources to stimulate photosensitive proteins at the intersection of the laser lights, would give the system not only temporal but also spatial boundaries. Our choice for such a microscope would not require long exposure times and ensure specificity of photoactivation, compared to current light-induced methods.
Why tissue engineering & why optogenetics?
Tissue engineering allows the production of tissue structures that are specific to somebody's own cell and has the potential to overcome many of the problems seen in human-to-human transplantation.
Advantages
Using a patient’s own cells to create such tissues ensures there will be no rejection by the host
Independent of long transplant waiting lists patients would not suffer the impaired living conditions and death due to a failing organ
Streamlining the production of tissues in vitro would reduce the costs and enable access to transplantations to people living in underprivileged conditions
To achieve this vision, our project addresses common problems found in tissue engineering, by constructing a molecular tool that allows the control of cells while they are forming a tissue through light. Typically, sophisticated 3-dimensional scaffolds that mimic the tissue are developed to try to reproduce qualities such as"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"ET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in pur"

Being Human 2.0: #SynbioLive
March 2017
This was the very first event we hosted with a science communication goal. In order to reach the general public and bring science closer to everyone, we organized Being Human 2.0 in collaboration with The Institute for Science on Global Policy “The Forum” and Cornell’s Alliance for Science. We held panels and live sessions with Synthetic Biology experts from USA, England and Mexico, to discuss the applications of this field and its ethical implications. The event was available online and it was seen in 30 different countries. We were honored to count with the participation of Juan Enriquez Cabot from Excel Venture Management, who mainly opened the discussion regarding singularity and how the emerging technologies are changing what it means to be a human.
Some of the experts who also participated in the event were: Michael Hecht from Princeton's Chemistry Department; Richard Kitney from Imperial College London Bioengineering Department; Luis Figueroa and Oscar Aguilar from Jalisco's Center for Research and Assistance in Technology and Design; Luis Ochoa from the Mexican Biosafety Association; Morris Schwarzblat from Jalisco's Secretariat of Innovation and Monserrat Mora from the Startup Biomentum.

These were all digested at 37 degrees C for 10 hours, heatshocked at 80 degress C for 10 mins, and then held at 4 degrees C using the thermal cycler.  The amounts of DNA included in each reaction were calculated precisely based upon concentration of the miniprep and the desired amount of DNA to give a molar ratio of 3:1 for insert to vector (thus, the mass of each part was normalized to its length).  These calculations are included on a spreadsheet.

Need to run a gel of restriction digest products from last night, with the hope of extracting the results.  Took a picture of the gel.  Saw clear bands around 2000-3000 for the activator parts, which is expected.  Cut these out of the gel.  Also saw a distinct band for the PSB1AK3 restriction digest slightly larger than 3000.  This corresponds to the known length of this plasmid of 3189 bp.  Did not see bands for either mZifA or mGliA, though this could simply be due to the fact that the gel was not run long enough to show resolution for pieces of DNA as small as these (318 bp and 422 bp, respectively).  Attempted to re-run the remaining gel after extracting the other parts, but this did not show any results.  Will thus have to redo these restriction digests, as all 30 uL from last night's reaction were run on the gel.

How to extract the metals from the cell?
How can we get metalloproteins into the cells?
Sporulation is induced due to stress, how much metal can we get into the cell?

Minutes of the Meeting (18/03/09)
Craig, Matthew and Arun presented our project idea to the team and guest advisor Nigel Robinson
Nigel Robinson posted some questions
What metals are we interested in?
Cadmium, Mercury, Arsenic >> Red List metals
Will be difficult to import the red list metals, normally imports Mg, Zn, etc instead and not the red list metals >> Switch"
Tsinghua,2014,Team:Tsinghua#Human practice#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"inghua undergraduates. We told the story of iGEM, synthetic biology, and discussed various aspects of our projects. Hopefully we have persuaded even more fellow scholars to join the ranks of iGEMer's.

During 8.3-8.7, one of our teammate, Zhang Xinyi, attended the 2014 iGem Formosa in NCTU .
During the Formosa, we communicated with teams from universities all over China. Posters and presentations were made to introduce every team’s design and progress; questions were raised as well as good advices. Every one attended really touched the thrill of iGemer’s happiness, and got home fully load.
Pic1. Introducing our project
With lots of exchange of ideas, we received a good many suggestions, as well as listened to and raised advice to other team’s work. Some teams encountered similar experiment problems as ours, so we gave some of our experiences to them.
Pic 2. People come around our poster and listen to the explanation of our project
Though the time we were together was short, everyone attending the conference really enjoyed the time and developed good relationships. We established a WeChat group after the conference, talking about everything about iGem on it. It’s still active now!

Week 10 8/18 - 8/22
Transformation results from 8/15 for IPTG+GFP+mutL (IGML),  IPTG+GFP+mutD (IGMD),  IPTG+GFP (IGIG), and negative control:
Low transformation efficiency suggests that the transformation was unsuccessful but mutD appears to be successful from the following colony PCR gel:
gel key: Well 1: 4 µl of ladder Well 2: 8 µl of IPTG+GFP Well 3: Sample 1 Well 4: Sample 2 Well 5: Sample 3 Well 6: Sample 4 Well 7: Sample 5 Well 8: Sample 6 Well 9: Sample 7 Well 10: Sample 8
mutD gel:
mutL gel:
Transformation of IPTG+GFP+mutL appears to be unsuccessful but samples 4-8 of mutD appear to have the mutD insert as they have higher base pair count.
Quikchange of mutY and DinB was attempted but likely unsuccessful due to lack of any appropriate bands on the below gel and insufficient signal from sequencing
1: Ladder 2: Neg control 3: MutY 4: DinB Quikchange results transformed into XL1Blue cells. Overnight ligation of 10:1 TyrR:promoter(plasmid) attempted. Transformed ParC3, MutY7, DinB1, MutS8, MutH2, MutD5, and MutD8 into XL1Blue Mutation rate assay: Measured OD600 of XL1B wt overnight culture at 12:20: 1.617 (roughly 1.29x10^9 cells/mL) and made an inoculum with 5000 cells/mL in LB (with 1mM IPTG). Made 20 200ul aliquots of inoculum +IPTG and put into incubator at 1:16 pm.
Tuesday
Transformed mCherry+paroF, promoter+TyrR, mCherry+ligase, promoter+ligase, mCherry cut, promoter cut. No growth on mutY and DinB quikchange transformant plates. Attempted 2 more protocols for quikchange for mutY (2-step and 60oC annealing temperature). Both appeared to fail.

Sorting cells - A method is needed to sort cells by their ability to bind the venom proteins - One such method would be to have the cells secrete their anti-venom proteins and then flood the cells with venom. The best cells would survive and the weak ones would be killed. However, this may cause the production of proteins that bind the venom components that are less dangerous such as phospholipases and oxidases. It would be more important for the anti-venom to inhibit the neuro-muscular disruptive proteins
- One effective method would be to use Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, which is able to sort cells by their fluorescence. See: http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/method/FACS.html - This would require a system that expresses a fluorescent reporter in response to the binding of venom proteins to the cell-surface proteins, but I cannot be too specific until I know how the anti-venom proteins are going to be expressed - Yet another method would cause the death of any cells that do not bind to the venom with high enough affinity - it would be similar to the methods employed in T-cell selection in eukaryotic immune systems, but would be more tricky as it has to occur in a bacterium - The ideal then, would be to have all the cells that have little or no binding affinity killed, and then those that do bind express GFP so that the fluorescence can be quantified and the binding can be rated - Again, I'd need to understand the anti-venom proteins before I could suggest any particular systems - Perhaps a second species of bacteria could be used to express the venom proteins on their surface, and come into contact with the anti-venom producing cells, causing contact-dependant stimulation, so that those that interact by the venom-antivenom complexes will be stimulated to divide whilst the remaining cells will potentially be killed See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085179 (Text by Frank)
In vivo mutagenesis - we need a method for random mutagenesis of peptides to create high affinity binding proteins to the multiple components of venom - PCR based mutagenesis is namely used for site directed mutagenesis and has several biases that make it not ideal for random mutation - in vivo homologous recombination inherent to yeast can be exploited for protein mutagenesis (Pirakiticulr et al., 2010) MAGE (multiplex automated genome engineering) See: http://www.nature.com/nature"

July 16 – 22, 2012
Finally the primers necessary for biobricking ADF-3 arrived! And we have got other important material: we talked with Dr. Hugo Olguin, and he is willing to share with us his anti-FLAG antibody. Furthermore, he allowed us to do the western blot in his laboratory.
Additionally, we achieved significant advances in the wiki, especially in the section Human Practices. Unfortunately, we still lack of salmonella.
July 23 – 29, 2012
After some research we found the promising projects of the Japanese iGEM team HokkaidoU 2010 and 2011. They used the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024, from Salmonella Genetic Stock Center(SGSC) in University of Calgary, Canada  ( http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kesander/index.html ). This strain carries a pBeloBAC11 vector encoding a genome fragment of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 which covers the SPI-2 region [B_STM07H21 SGSC4024 1464540～1562427]
We asked the iGEM team members of HokkaidoU 2011 if the E. Coli (k-12) strain SGSC4024 is capable of secreting proteins to the external environment. But unfortunately it seems that is only capable of injecting molecules into other cells, and that is not what we need.
In the lab we did PCR to amplify ADF-3 and ADF-3+ (i.e. ADF-3 with the tags included in the plasmid that Christopher Voigt sent to us). Unfortunately the PCR did not work.
The next day we tried to amplify the backbone pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF-3 with touch-down PCR. The two first amplicons seemed to be all right. Nevertheless, later we purificated and digested the DNA to verificate if the amplicons corresponded to our parts, but the size sequences resulted to be incoherent. We have to try again.
July 30 – August 5, 2012
This week we did PCR of the backbone pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and ADF-3 again. It failed again. Are our primers wrong?
However, we persisted tirelessly with another PCR of pSB1C3, ADF-3+ and A"

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.

We got in touch with a factory in Maanshan(Maanshan Steel Plant), and a six-rotor drone was provided by the model team, as shown in Fig.8

Zhao Lei, who has studied embedded programming development in the team, has developed a carbon dioxide detection device that can be mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle with different gas sensors (The gas sensor can detect the mass of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other gases in each liter.) and STM32 ARM microcontroller. As shown in Fig.9:
Fig.9 Gas detection device
We used this drone to carry the detection device into the air and tested it near the end of the factory's exhaust system. It was found that the concentration of carbon dioxide near the smoke extraction device was extremely high, 5-20 times greater than the normal value. According to the document ""National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting and Reporting and Other 11 Greenhouse Gas Management National Standards Released"", the proportion of various costs in the exhaust gas from such a plant's production process is: oxygen: carbon dioxide: sulfur dioxide: vulcanization Hydrogen: Carbon monoxide: Hydrogen chloride: Fluoride: Nitrogen oxides: Other = 14:10:3:3:3:2:3:8:54, We have measured the composition, content and mass percentage of each gas in the factory exhaust gas after averaging as follows:

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"RET. Our game received lots of positive feedback from kids and parents alike which proves that our demonstration tool was very effective in conveying the information we wanted!
3D Printing
At some point, every lab faces limitations when it comes to resources for experiments. For some, this limit is much lower than others, to the extent where even basic experiments become difficult to complete. To address this problem, iGEM Waterloo has begun creating a catalogue of 3D-printable lab equipment for teams to download and print for their own use.
Assessing the Need
From communicating with teams at last year’s Jamboree, we became cognizant about financial barriers many teams faced over the year. In some cases, these barriers significantly limited the experiments teams are able to perform.
We hypothesized that there are teams in the iGEM community who would benefit from an inexpensive, yet performance grade alternative to obtain simple lab equipment. To confirm this, we sent out surveys to all iGEM teams asking about their opinions on 3D printing lab equipment, past uses and accessibility to 3D Printers, how much they spent on resources, and the importance of having sufficient lab equipment.
Based on survey responses, the general consensus was that the expense of lab equipment could be reduced by using 3D printed lab equipment as long as it could meet specific performance criteria. This provided validity to our hypothesis, and we continued with the development of this project.
3D Printing
To start, we needed ideas on what we could 3D print. Ideally what we made would have to be useful and have a geometry that is feasible to make using 3D printers of different qualities. We consulted our lab team about what sorts of equipment they were lacking in the lab or what types of contraptions would help with their experiments. In addition, we asked the iGEM teams we surveyed for examples of equipment we could print as well. Throughout the design process, our lab team tested out the prototypes and provided feedback, which helped us improve designs and increase effectiveness and quality of the printed equipment.
Above is the schematic for a test tube rack we designed and printed. We designed many different combs for different sized gel rigs and with different numbers of teeth to create gels with different numbers of well.
The main limitation with using 3D printing plastics, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyactic acid (PLA), include sterility, porousness, and strength. The plastics must be able to withstand the heat from an autoclave in order to be sterilized, they cannot be used"
NTNU_Trondheim,2014,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," in Biotechnology. I am now in my fourth year, and have just started working on my master's thesis. My thesis involves developing a new genome-scale metabolic modelling approach to study patterns of adaptation when using a massively-parallel experimental evolution platform.
Going into the project, my knowledge of iGEM and synthetic biology was limited, but the learning experience has been very rewarding, even with all the frustration involved.
Camilla Marstrander Reehorst
I completed my Master of Science degree in 2014 at Norwegian University of Science and Technology located in Trondheim. My specialisation was biopolymer chemistry and the focus of my master thesis was drug penetration and bioavailability through the mucus barrier. My main research area interest is medical biotechnology. I have now moved to Melbourne, Australia, and will hopefully commence a PhD at the University of Melbourne within the medical field from the start of 2015.
In relation to my focus area, the iGEM project has been rather peripheral; however, I have enjoyed the new techniques and experiences. I also think that as a researcher it pays off to have an basic understanding about the mechanics of multiple research areas, not only the one you’ve submerged yourself in.
Eivind Bøe Drejer
I'm currently finishing my master's degree in Biotechnology, specializing in Systems Biology. My master thesis involves metabolic modelling of Salmonella enterica during osmotic stress, and is done in collaboration with the Institute for Food Research in Norwich, UK. I have been interested in science from an early age, and settled on biotechnology in 2010. Synthetic biology has fascinated me ever since I started understanding the complex dynamics that govern cells. Being able to design new functions for living cells is a testimony to how far the science has come, and I am proud to play a small part in it.
Working on designing an expression system for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been exciting and educating. I have thoroughly enjoyed the iGEM experience so far, and can't wait to see what the other teams have accomplished.

We are very proud to be as part of the Life to Lake Burdur Project.  We support it because this project mainly focuses on saving Lake Burdur which is vanishing day by day.  Lake Burdur is famous for its rich biological life. Aphanius burduricus, a species of fish that is prevalent in Turkey and found in Lake Burdur, is under threat as the water in the lake continues to vanish due to rapid evaporation and senseless irrigation. According to statistics, the lake loses 330 million tons of its 4.3 billion-ton capacity each year. Each year the lake shrinks by one meter. If the evaporation and drought continue at this rate, Lake Burdur is expected to disappear within 20 years.  As a Biological Science Students , we aware of it and we always give messages about environmental issues.  Here you can see Official Facebook page of the Life to Lake Burdur Project shared our video and they thanked a lot for our effort !
iGEM Picnic
iGEMers knows, this project is a lifestyle. It takes all your time, tires you so much, needs your attention, doesn’t accept any fault… However, with iGEM, you enter a different world. You start to live and do everything with your team members and at the end, they became your family..   As an example of this strong friendship, in a hot august day, we decided to go to picnic. It was a wonderful day, we ate great stuff, passed a great day and saved energy for our future studies!

Valencia_UPV,2018,Team:Valencia UPV#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," team has been working on the development of a new biomaterial to speed up the healing in bone injures. This biomaterial called C-lastine, is based on the cross-linking of bacterial cellulose and the fusion protein CBD cipA-BMP2. This cross-linking is mediated by a carbohydrate binding domain (CBD cipA) while the osteogenic activity by a potent osteoblasts differentiation inducer (BMP2). To achieve this objective they are using E.Coli as a biofactory, specifically BL21(DE3) strain which is resistant to some toxic proteins such as cellulose synthase operon protein D, codified by gene bcsD and responsible of pore formation in the membrane allowing cellulose to exit the cell. The final result is a bandage matrix that can be applied to the wound during a surgical intervention.
Collaboration
If we think about it, Printeria is a kind of biofactory so, we thought that trying to make Ecuador's team biomaterial in Printeria would be a good trial to show that Printeria is ready to become something greater in the biotechnological industry and why not, it could be used in hospitals as well. However, due to the fact that there were problems with the size of the parts for Golden Gate and with the customs, it could not become a reality. This idea would be developed with Imperial College. Instead, we did several things.
We did a survey to get some feedback from the potential users of both projects. It consisted in a video in spanish and then a survey to fill out. In our case, the survey was made to know what do users think about Printeria and synthetic biology. In any case this survey represents the collective of users (only 15 people were surveyed) it was just made to have an idea. Here you can download the results of both surveys:

Furthermore we provide them with a special strain called BL21(DE3). This was really important for them due to the fact that without it, they could not continue with their iGEM project.

NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," picked contains a consensus sequence, 5’-CCCUC-3’, which can base pair with the SD sequence due to complementary binding. This sRNA, as expected, effectively regulates gene expression by reducing translation efficiency and recruiting Hfq. In addition, this sRNA shows high specificity against its targeted gene, OmpF, as it doesn't hold significant activity against other genes from E. coli genome (Sharma and others, 2011).
The sRNA picked is competent, but we hoped that it can target any desired gene. Therefore, we designed a RBS by employing the sRNA targeting region from OmpF and making the AUG codon sufficiently apart from the SD sequence for ribosome binding. By adding this RBS to the upstream of any desired gene, the gene can be regulated by sRNA.

First, we integrate a gRNA responsive promoter (pGRR) which controls GFP production. Then, we insert a 9Cas9-Mxi1 plasmid in W303 yeast strain. Finally, we integrate two gRNA sequences complementary to pGRR. The production of each gRNA is controlled by synthetic inducible promoters, GAL4 and Tet-O. dCas9-Mxi1 complexes with either gRNAs and hybridizes to pGRR which suppresses the production of GFP. Overall, the project poses no health and environmental risks, given that the synthetic genetic network has no phenotypic effects on other organisms. Furthermore, no project-related material will leave the laboratory for reasons other than sterilization for discarding.
Safeguarding gene drive experiments in the laboratory
As per iGEM's Safety Committee regulations, our laboratory and team strictly adhere to the recommendations proposed by Akbari et al in “Safeguarding gene drive experiments in the laboratory”.
According to Akbari et al., our experimental design, as explained above, “[does] not risk creating a gene drive system because cassettes encoding [dCas9] and sgRNA are not inserted into the cut site or located adjacent to one another in the genome and can thus be safely used by researchers without additional precautions.” [dCas9 will be maintained as a plasmid. There is no cut site due to the lack of endonuclease activity in dCas9.] Furthermore, our transformations are conducted on a haploid strain of yeast. The yeast will not be crossed. There will be thus no risk of conversion of heterozygotes into homozygotes within the population. Finally, the study involves the introduction of genetic parts with synthetic sequences in laboratory mutant strain of yeast and is not introduced to the wild strain.

UGA-Georgia Human Practices
The University of Georgia iGEM team has engaged in numerous activities to promote scientific collaboration, help increase awareness synthetic biology in the local community and throughout the world, and engage with administrators to ensure proper biosafety practice.
Collaboration
Since early 2015, the University of Georgia iGEM team has been working on establishing a sound, effective, and universal protocol and logistics system to circulate mCherry samples on a largescale circuit for fluorescence measurements. We decided to contact iGEM headquarters officially early June 2015 with a formal proposal to motion for a new Archaeal InterLab study modeled after the current E. coli InterLab administered by iGEM. We suggested that we send out our own collection of mCherry protein extracts from our methanococcus experiments. iGEM Headquarters and the Measurement Division advised us to pursue a sort of ‘pilot’ InterLab, which we began calling the Archaeal Collaboration Study. After a few weeks of carefully refining our proposal, gaining proper clearance from the biosafety office, developing the shipment system, creating registration and data input forms, and creating a universal protocol for measuring mCherry protein florescence, we were ready to contact an assortment of iGEM research teams across the United States gauging general interest in our collaboration study. We were truly inspired by the level of interest we received from the feedback and began to slowly build up the network of participating teams we have today. Slowly but surely, we built up a network of 9 participating teams: University of Georgia, MIT, Stony Brook, University of California at San Francisco, Carnegie Mellon, William and Mary, GenSpace, Columbia, and Vanderbilt. We can’t thank our participating teams enough for their support and efforts toward our study.
Our collaboration study not only functions as a system of support that adds validity to our findings with the work we’ve done in the lab—it not only functions as an educational teaching tool that has brought awareness of the capabilities of methanococcus to anyone that read our proposal and knowledge of the methods of reading mCherry fluorescence—but we believe it helps the scientific community as a whole. By creating the logistics and protocol schedule, we’ve created a system that can be used by anyone to distribute protein samples"

In the conference, each team conducted in-depth communication and exchanged ideas on their own                     projects. The inspiring spark collided by thoughts and innovation among the teams made the attendees                     reap substantial benefits. After careful preparation, we showed our project roundly to the whole                     attendees from the aspects of background, project, design, modeling and human practice. In the                     meantime, we also held open attitude towards the sincere suggestions and comments from other teams.
Fig.10 Our iGEMers are in CCiC in Guangzhou.
In the conference, not only did we strengthen the relationship with                     FAFU-CHINA, but we made many new friends as well. And the communication and mutual learning among                     the teams provided us with the opportunity to broad our horizon and help us acquaint more people                     with our project.
Orienteering game
What's the game
In order to facilitate the communication between the students and to help students to get a deeper                     understanding of iGEM. We designed and organized an orienteering activity ""running of biology"" in                     the campus. The rules of the orienteering are designed to bring our ideas to more people. The                     destinations were set at several typical buildings in the campus and was named by some                     representative chemical compound we have used or produced in the experiment, such as alpha protein,                     beta protein, N terminal of luciferase, c terminal of luciferase and some other organic molecular.                     The students were divided into several teams to compete with each other. Each team should find their                     destination by the description written on the task card to get a chemical compound. And then the                     team will obtain the task card leading to the next destination. The team that uses the less time to                     collect all the chemical compound will win the game.
Feedback
The orienteering is entrusted but full of joy and meanings. To start with, as a                         freshman who has little impression to the campus, the orienteering makes me feel more familiar                         to the college. What's more, the seniors in our team is so cute and my teammates is so bright                         and cheerful. Yesterday, we were strangers passing by each other but today we become a group,                         running and laughing in the school. At last the seniors took us to visit the laboratory, showing                         the ideas of iGEM, and I found it is really fascinating. I wish I can join in this group next                         year.
How time files! The orienteering has already ended. In"

Environmental safety
Even though it is it is generally assumed that E. coli would be out-competed by natural strains once it is outside of a lab, we assume the fact that in case of accidental release of any GEB, it would raise safety issues because we don't know the potential effects. So any Genetically Engineered Bacteria (GEB) can be potentially dangerous if released in the environment, either on purpose or by accident. The concern about Horizontal Gene Transfer or spread of GEB lead us to develop this project to protect the environment from synthetic devices.  During the work on our Biosafety system, we protected the environment from contamination by waste products: all hazardous waste was placed in the correct container (e.g. biohazard containers for biological waste such as E. coli colonies), autoclaved and disposed of responsibly by the university. Team members were taught proper molecular biology skills and aseptic techniques. Team members followed all necessary procedures like washing their hands with disinfectant before leaving the laboratory to avoid transmitting potentially harmful material to the public/environment.
Public safety
Apart from the general concern about the potential harm of GEB to the Environment and Public upon release outside of the lab, none of our designs have the potential to harm the public if released by design or accident. Our lab is especially equipped for microbial manipulation and everything is done to avoid the release. Public safety is ensured, as no member of the public is permitted access within the labs unless approved by the university, and team members followed all necessary procedures like washing their hands with disinfectant before leaving the laboratory to avoid transmitting potentially harmful material to the public/environment. However, we are conscious that as any"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
The model should impact your project design in a meaningful way. Modeling may include, but is not limited to, deterministic, exploratory, molecular dynamic, and stochastic models. Teams may also explore the physical modeling of a single component within a system or utilize mathematical modeling for predicting function of a more complex device.

Furthermore, after performing Wageningen's  protocol, TU Delft shared a list of suggestions for its improvement as certain steps (such as scraping the dried kaolin containing the bacteria or counting the colonies in plates with kaolin) were both laborious and difficult to reproduce accurately.
Munich
A few months before our European Symposium had taken place, TU Delft shared a project description on Facebook featuring a summary of all the science behind our project. Shortly after, the team of Munich contacted us indicating that, coincidentally enough, our two teams were to make use of the protein Cas13a in our projects. Because of this, TU Delft and Munich saw a great window of opportunity opening, as the possibility of collaborations that could substantially help both projects was there.
Wet lab Collaboration iGEM Munich 2017
Both TU Delft and Munich's project had a common goal: the realisation of a detection device featuring Cas13a. Consequently, the stability of their Cas13a in their device was also one of the challenges in their design, as it would determine the shelf life and storability of their final product. As a part of this year’s project, TU Delft was also researching and developing an alternative stabilization method by making use of the tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). Therefore, TU Delft shipped a purified batch of TDPs to iGEM Munich, so that they could also assay and evaluate these; and, perhaps, eventually integrate them into their project.
TDPs in Munich!
However, the collaboration with Munich evolved after TU Delft had realised the first experiments with their purified Cas13a and TDPs and had observed that whenever our Cas13a was dried in combination with the TDP CAHS 94205, the resuspended Cas13a+TDP solution would start cleaving RNA  with and without target RNA at a similar rate, thus losing its specificity (see Figure 1).

We asked  Munich to assist us by repeating a similar drying experiment with the same CAHS protein and their Cas13a, in order corroborate our results and help us find the cause of such an unexpected finding. As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," residues leaking from pharmaceutical manufacturing [3],[4]. Excretion of active pharmaceutical substances after human usage is documented to be the primary source of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment [4]. From Figure 1 presented below, it becomes apparent that this route would not have been the main one if WWTPs were capable of removing pharmaceuticals adequately from sewage. In the words of Christian Baresel expert, research coordinator and project manager at IVL (Swedish Environmental Research Institute): “There are pharmaceuticals in the effluent of WWTPs. Today there is a high removal of microplastics, but not for pharmaceuticals’’ (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
Figure 1. Entry routes of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment. (Redesigned from Boxal AB 2004 [5])
One of the most significant implications of pharmaceutical pollution in the water is the development of antibiotic resistance, posing an apparent and substantial danger to human health. The presence of antibiotics in the environment promotes acquisition or independent evolution of resistance from bacteria that normally lack innate antibiotic capacity [6].
It is worth noting that resistance in bacteria can be developed even in exposure levels lower than the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) [7]. Thus, aquatic environment contaminated with antibiotics can serve as a reservoir for resistance that can be transferred to clinically vital bacteria through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms [8]. Eventually, these resistant bacteria with clinical importance disseminate and reach humans either via food or direct exposure to animal hosts [9, 10].
Another important implication of pharmaceuticals in the water is the ecotoxic effects they have on marine organisms. Pharmaceuticals are designed to intervene in biological pathways, some of which are evolutionary conserved across different species. Hence, pharmaceuticals that were designed to have an effect on some species (including humans) may also exert significant effects on the physiological function of other organisms [11]. Due to their low but consistent concentrations, concerns arise primarily for the chronic rather than the acute ecotoxic effects, which are substantially more difficult to be defined and proved [12]. In addition, mixtures of active substances are present simultaneously in the aquatic environment and generally cause higher effects than each of their comprising components alone (synergistic effect), increasing the combined toxicity [13].
In the Baltic Sea, the effects of pharmaceutical pollution in the ecosystem are remarkably high due to the low water exchange rate, low biodiversity and the physiological stress induced by brackish water conditions. Therefore, the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particularly susceptible to hazardous pharmaceutical substances [14].

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

Expression of GFP by CRP-GFP cells in different media
CRP activity in different media
Background
We are using the PcstA promoter (BBa_K118011) to activate module 2 when the concentration of glucose is low.  The cell then metabolises the secondary carbon source.
We have ligated the PcstA Biobrick (BBa_K118011) to the GFP reporter.  This allows us to follow PcstA promoter activity by GFP fluorescence.
Aims
To characterise the activity of PcstA under different secondary carbon sources
Consequently, to select our secondary carbon source for further experiments where glucose concentrations can be varied
Experimental procedure
Cells were grown overnight for 18 hours at 225rpm shaking in the various different secondary carbon sources.
200ul of the cells were added to a 96 well plate.  Fluorescence and Absorbance readings were recorded.
Results
Corrected Fluorescence
After overnight culture, the corrected fluorescence of glucose is almost negligible, showing that glucose represses the PcstA promoter strongly.
For all the other secondary carbon sources, 10% Casamino Acids in M9 shows the highest corrected fluorescence at 22000, while 0.5% Lactose in M9 is second at almost half the fluorescence.
An interesting point is why the fluorescence of 20% Casamino Acids in M9 is so much lower.  We believe this to be due to toxicity of the overly high Casamino Acid content, shown also by the exceedingly low OD600 (refer below).
Cell growth
However, fluorescence is not the only consideration.
For effective encapsulation, not only must the promoter activity be strong, but there must also be enough cells expressing module 2 genes.  Therefore, OD600 is also a critical factor.
For OD 600, the growth in LB is the highest at 1.5, explaining why it is the preferred medium for cell growth.  OD600 of cells in 10% Casamino"

Efficiency of the Database Entries
86% of participants would like to see a ranking/rating      system for the parts by the other iGEM users which will be one indication      of if a part is working and how well in different laboratories. Few had concerns about how well the rating system will work for      rarely used parts while the widely used parts would even more popular      due the the rating system. Still many believes this would be one      futher towards a peer-reviewed quality control system for the parts.
61% of participants agreed that parts should be updated      regularly by the designers, where most agreed at least when there      is new information on the parts. It has also been suggested      to give permission to all the users of that part for updating information.
73% of participants have been agree with us that excluding      the low ranking parts or the parts with negative feedback from the      future plates will increase efficiency of the system. The      major concern about excluding any part is losing the variety of      parts in the database. Few recommends excluding only the parts that      are not working.
“Efficiency shouldn't be top priority in a database. First and foremost,     data is the top priority. Excluding those parts would make the system     more efficient”
“Some parts may be rare or new and have low efficiency, but can be very important! Getting rid of them would eliminate any chance of improvement     to these parts, which not only a qualifier for an iGEM gold medal, but     also one of the focuses of biobricks.”
We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or with     negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still archive     them and make their data available through the parts registry. So the     while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated, fully     working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on a more     exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the parts     stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be encouraged     as an collaborative effort.
New Options for the Parts Registry Database
96% of participants are like minded with us that it      will be useful to have a link out to the gene/protein information      of the parts and - %97 of participants have been agree that they      would like to know if a part is also involved in known biological      pathways.

Introduction
Biosafety is defined as ""the discipline addressing the safe handling and containment of infectious microorganisms and hazardous biological materials"" [1] According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC. For our team, the security and safety measures of our project have had the highest priority. Since there are many inherent risks of our work in the iGEM laboratory, we have decided to thoroughly present the dangers that we have analyzed while working at it. Firstly it is relevant to mention that  we used non-pathogenic E. coli strains like BL21 and Xl1-blue for the cloning part of the project, which are typical strains  used in the labs. Nevertheless, we have had an extreme caution to prevent any spreading of used living organisms, since this were S1 genetically modified organisms. The field of synthetic biology provides us with the possibility to work with living organisms and modify them. There are many safety measures that are very important to consider while investigating and working at the laboratory for this purpose. Since the base of synthetic biology is the work with genetically modified organisms (GMO), it is necessary to look"
NTU_SINGAPORE,2017,Team:NTU SINGAPORE#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a problem that researchers struggle with. The lack of efficient delivery severely restricts the therapeutic effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9. Similarly, the rate of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing is limited, although this rate has already been improved as compared to other gene editing technologies, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Additionally, there is an inefficient homology-directed repair (HDR) to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) ratio, which further decreases the rate specific gene editing. This results in the dependence on the time-consuming downstream isolation of clones which have successfully undergone targeted gene-editing.
Another important limitation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the presence of off-target effects, where non-target regions were observed to be genetically edited. Generally, the specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 decreases as the complexity of genome increases, supported by observations of a larger number of off-target effects in adult human cells as compared to bacterial, zebra fish and mice cells. It is important to note, however, that this percentage of off-target effects is relatively significantly lower as compared to older genetic editing technologies. Additionally, there have been a variety of technological advancements which have reportedly improved target site specificity, including the use of Cfp1 in place of Cas9 and the use of Cas9 nickases.
Nevertheless, in order to safeguard patient safety, absolute precision of the CRISPR/Cas9 system must be ensured before clinical use, particularly if this is being adopted for long-term treatment. This would require further characterisation the CRISPR/Cas9 system and improvements to its specificity.
Lastly, the advancement of the gene editing technology of CRISPR/Cas9 has triggered a debate on the ethicality of the use of this technique for germline gene editing. There are two main ethical issues with regards to this, namely, the use of human embryos in scientific research as well as gene editing in embryos. For the former, there are questions of the moral and legal status of developing human embryos and concerns about the source of embryos utilised in scientific research. For the latter, there are concerns about introducing heritable genetic alterations if manipulated embryos are utilised in reproduction, which may aggravate issues such as social inequality and sexism. The current consensus adopted by UNESCO’s International Bioethics Committee recommends that gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 should only be utilised for therapeutic, preventative and diagnostic purposes, without altering the germline cells of the patient.
Thus, we wanted to address some of these limitations in our project.
What do we hope to achieve"

The instructions in the kit advised 1-3 mL of E. coli potion for high copy DNA. We used 1 mL, so next time we will try 2-3 mL to see if we can get a higher concentration. We are unsure if we did something wrong, if there is something wrong with the kit, or if we just need to use more of the E. coli overnight potion. I need to become more familiar with the sequence of our plasmid, and we need to find out why our E.coli doesn’t glow. When I understand the plasmid sequence, hopefully we can know what is missing or defective in our E. coli that keeps it from glowing.

- KP Today we made a plan of exactly what we need to do in the next week and coming months. Our biggest priority at this time is sequencing the plasmid from last years iGEM team. I was reading in the iGEM registry, and I saw that there is a pIG78 A and B. We tried A, but we haven’t tried B. On Monday we will try to transfer B into E. Coli and see if B works better than A. Next week our goal is to completely sequence the plasmid to see if something is missing or incorrect. I also need to do more research to understand better what last years team did and also the specifics of how we are going to set up our phage and how we are going to induce the lytic cycle in the presence of cholera.
- KK Today we set out some long-term priorities for what we should do from here on out. Our priorities: 1. Determine is the QS circuit working? We aren’t getting RFP right now … what’s wrong? a. We need to determine what primers were used to amplify the HapR and Qrr4 out of cholera b. What is the difference between pIG78 A and pIG78 B? There are two plasmids that are the same? We hope to KNOW the answers to these questions by Thursday 2. Clone CI behind Qrr4 promoter; determine where in plasmid and order primers order primers 3. Clone CRO behind HapR promoter DONE by Mid-May 4"
