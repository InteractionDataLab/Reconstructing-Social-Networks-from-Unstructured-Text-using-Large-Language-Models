Cut Sites
Restriction Enzyme Cut sites are an essential element for creating protein chimers of any kind, not only for the creation of BioBrick Protein Chimers. As part of the protocol for creating these protein chimers, digestion and ligation will be involved. More often than not, digestion sites for restriction enzymes will be incorporated to the ends of the insert and the adjacent parts in order to ligate them together and into a plasmid. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that there are no cut sites present for the restriction enzymes that you will be using for digestion and ligation, otherwise it will be very difficult to get the full part ligated together with themselves and into the plasmid. For instance, if there is an EcoRI cut site present in the insert, then while you are digesting with the insert with EcoRI, the insert will be cut prematurely, and its function will likely be reduced.  Removing restriction enzyme cut sites can be a very simple, or a very difficult process, depending on the location of the cut site in the desired part. If the part is close to the beginning or the end of the desired part, it may be simple to do a site directed mutagenesis. In order to do so, you would need to create a primer that overlaps the desired cut site, and change one nucleotide (preferably one that causes a silent mutation in the protein), such that the primer will still anneal to the template DNA, but will induce a single base pair nucleotide change that will remove the cut site from the PCR product. While the former is a very simple process, if the cut site is far enough away from the ends of the template DNA, this process is unlikely to work, as the primers will be too long. In this case, the simplest way to remove the cut site will be to have the DNA directly synthesized, although this can end up being a very costly process.

Team Leader
Binglin Liu is the team leader. As a team leader, he was responsible for the coordination of the team, and supervised experimental details to promote the experimental process. The role he played in the experiment was mainly to finish the design, construction and verification of vectors. At the meantime, he contacted with bio companies to buy related reagents.
Plasmids Construction
Licong He , Jianzhe Yang and Demin Xu were mainly responsible for plasmids construction. They constructed all the plasmids needed for the project, which were transformated into tobacco by agrobacterium. They also constructed biological bricks. In addition, Licong He completed the construction of the mutants and biological bricks of the mutants.
Plant Tissue Culture
Ang Chen and Wei Liu were mainly responsible for plant tissue culture and agrobacterium-mediated tobacco transformation. They tried hard to make the plant in good condition and kept the providing of the plant material. After vector construction, they begun to transform these vectors to the plants and screened out positive plants. They also made the hydroponics to get data for detecting the conversion of TCP to GLY in vivo. By the way, the cooperation with Zhejiang University was done by them.
Positive Detection
Mengyao Li was mainly responsible for positive detection including extracting the genomic DNA or RNA of NT, and reversing transcription. Also she did partial enzyme assay to support data for modeling.
Enzyme Assay
Tingting Dong, Yuhong Wang and Demin Xu were mainly responsible for enzyme assay. They detected the multi-enzyme conversion of TCP in transgenic tobacco by gas chromatograph, and used the leaves of transgenic tobacco to detect enzymes activity in vitro. The method of hydroponics was also used to detect the conversion of TCP to GLY in vivo.
Human Practices

ERRATA: The band present in the negative control is not due to the water used, or LB, as confirmed by Fasih, who performed colony PCR and negative control using LB. The prime candidates for this band are contamination in the primers or in the Taq Red, both of which are shared by all the members in iGEM.
BsaI Digestion for M1-AB, BC, CA and M2-AB, BC, CA
Digested 5 ug of each plasmid in 50 uL reactions with 4 uL of BsaI.

M1-AB, BC, CA were excised for subsequent purification.
M2-AB, BC, CA were NOT excised. The band pattern had a double band near the 100 bp mark, and the resulting digestion was unusable. The plasmid stocks used for digestion for M2-AB, BC, CA were dilute (~100 ng/uL), which may account for this result.

Initiation of Individual Chromoprotein and Regulator Plasmid Design
A standard procedure in the Tacoma RAINmakers project is PCR amplification. This process is listed under the protocol page as “Insert PCR Amplification.” In preparation for ligation of inserts (amilCP, spisPink, and PcArsR) into the vector, all insert DNA must be amplified from its original limited stock. Once the PCR reaction has exited the thermocycler, gel electrophoresis must be employed to assess the efficacy of the amplification. As pictured in Figure 3, both the spisPink and amilCP bands successfully appeared at about 1000bp, and the PcArsR expressed at about 550bp. Unfortunately, the PcArsR negative control produced DNA bands, which suggested contamination during the PCR amplification process.
Following a successful PCR amplification confirmed by the gel, Tacoma RAINmakers performed a standard gel extraction. With much more insert DNA, RAINmakers were prepared to design three additional plasmids containing single inserts for isolated testing.

Week 4
Transformation of Arsenic Construct and PCR Screening
TThe positive control (pSB1C3 + Insert) and negative control (pSB1C3 only) were transformed using DH5 Alpha Competent E. coli cells. Although the iGEM protocol for transformation states that 1µL of DNA is sufficient, 2µL of DNA were used for both the positive and negative control plates to ensure enough DNA existed for multiple colonies to grow. Transformation reactions were incubated overnight at 37ºC within a 14-18 hour time period. An extended description of the standard transformation process is listed under the protocol page.
The RAINmakers ran a PCR screening for both the positive (vector and insert) and negative (vector only) controls. This PCR allows us to amplify our cloned DNA, which is necessary to do because it will help us determine whether or not the ligation of the vector and insert was successful. The product after our PCR will be used to run a gel, which will help us see which colonies have the vector and insert and which only have the vector. After determining the volumes of the reagents, we decided to add an extra 20% uncertainty to each reagent in the master mix since small volumes of liquid can get stuck in the pipette. We did all these calculations based on the fact that we planned on doing 8 PCR reactions (8 PCR tubes). Before"

International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM)
Desde 2003 o Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), uma das melhores universidades do mundo, organiza o iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition), uma competição na qual estudantes de universidades mundialmente reconhecidas direcionam a aplicação de técnicas de engenharia genética para a solução de problemas da atualidade nas áreas industrial, ambiental ou da saúde, por exemplo. Os participantes competem pela construção das melhores “máquinas” biológicas, capazes de exercer funções que não fazem parte de sua natureza. Essas “máquinas” são construídas a partir da inserção de genes capazes de modificar o organismo escolhido, geralmente microorganismos como bactérias e leveduras, e fazê-los trabalhar de acordo com os desejos de seus idealizadores.

Broader Applications
With a project that is primarily focused on space exploration and colonization, it is hard to identify what tangible effects our project, as well as many other space exploration ventures, have on people back on Earth. We decided, with some guidance from Emily Hicks of FREDsense, to take a look at how innovation from space technology development helped impact our societies through spin-off technologies. This gave us an idea of how our own project can still be of use to those back on Earth, despite not reaping the direct rewards of a Martian colony.
Space Age Spin-Offs: An Overivew
As space exploration is furthered, innovative technologies are continually being produced in order to aid in the efficiency of space travel. These technologies can be integrated in fields beyond space sciences, introducing inventive solutions to problems faced in these fields.  Examples include firefighter gear and LEDs or Light-emitting diodes. The development of firefighting gear was inspired by the lightweight materials and design included in astronaut space suits. . Light emitting diodes are inspired by a technology that works in space to grow plants, while on earth it is utilized to aid in medicine. Ultimately, investing in Spin-Off Technologies that aid in space exploration should be considered. There are arguments that put forward the question of why bother to invest in space travel? However, the unique challenges of space leads to the development of technologies which have practical applications on Earth as spin-off technologies.
Artificial Limbs: A Spin-Off Technology
Improvements in artificial limb technologies has been a byproduct of the research put into robotics and shock-absorbent materials. Continued funding into these fields of research and the unique challenges of space travel has led to the development of technologies which have benefitted prosthetics. The artificial muscle systems used to improve robotic technologies was adapted to produce functionally dynamic artificial limbs while custom-mouldable materials have functions in reducing moisture build up and friction between the prosthetic and the skin. These materials also allow limbs to be made to look more lifelike"

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html," water accessibility and sanitation regarding gender inequality. In developing countries significant responsibility for acquisition and distribution of water is placed upon women and children of the family. Difficulties in access result in many hours lost that could instead be used for income generation, caring for family members or education (UNDP 2006). This reinforces the cycle of gender disempowerment and inequality. In rural parts of eastern Africa, women and girls spend significant amounts of their day trying to access water sources. Their journey may take them through treacherous places and increases risk of violence and sexual abuse. Women are more likely to voice concerns regarding water and sanitation compared to their male counterparts, however due to their inferior social standing such concerns often go unheard. (Mengistu 2012).
Water stress can reinforce or increase inequality. Solutions to the water crisis are necessary not just for a healthier, more peaceful world, but also a fairer one.
Economic Implications
Water is a key input in the smallest of businesses and the largest of corporations alike. Without water it is impossible to generate energy or produce goods. Therefore the economic welfare of a state relies on its water resources, it sustains the backbone of the economy. Corporations are increasingly forced to take water availability into account. For example the Coca Cola plant in Mehdiganj, India, chose to close due to the increasing water stress in the region (Guardian 2014). The socioeconomic impacts of water stress are considered in case studies below.
Case Study: BRICs
The BRIC countries (Brazil, India, China and Russia) are large, developing economies, distinguished from other emerging markets by their demographic and developmental potential. These four countries are home to more than 2.5 billion people, 40% of the world’s population, cover 25% of the world’s area, and account for 25% of the global GDP.
Expanding economies such as these require increased energy production which in turn relies significantly on water. One third of global energy needs are currently met by oil, an immensely water-expensive fuel source. Natural gas is currently the most popular alternative to oil due to the “shale gas revolution” and is cleaner in terms of emissions. Shale gas is even more water intensive however and prospective shale-producing countries like China and India will face constraints due to inadequate water supplies (Cohen & Siu 2013).
Additionally, an expanding middle class in these countries causes shifts in dietary preference that have a significant impact on water use and management. Vegetable-oriented diets are turning into meat and dairy-oriented ones that are significantly more water intensive increasing stress on"

Magnesium Riboswitch Plate-Reader Assay
Plate reader assay set up with magnesium riboswitch construct made over the last few days.
Mg2+ concentrations used:
5μM, 10μM, 20μM, 50μM, 100μM, 200μM, 500μM, 1mM, 2mM, 5mM, 10mM, 20mM
IPTG concentrations used:
0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.2mM, 0.5mM, 1mM, 2mM, 5mM, 10mM
Magnesium free medium B used as growth medium
Results: fluorescence curves are constant, except for a distinct dip during the exponential phase of bacterial growth. After looking at various cultures under the fluorescence microscope and discussing the results with our advisors, we have decided that this is because the amino acids in the medium are fluorescing. Our bacteria are then degrading these, causing the dip observed. We will switch to M9 minimal medium for our assays in the future,"

Emerging Use of Phage
Phage as a delivery system: One of the newest research areas, and one that we as an iGEM team have tried to tap into is the use of bacteriophages as delivery systems. Even if the phage itself isn't being used as an antimicrobial agent, its specific properties can be altered to deliver treatments to an area infected with a specific pathogenic bacteria.
Phage and Antibiotics: Antibiotics, when first discovered were something of a miracle. Bacterial infections could be cured quickly and effectively with a simple shot in the arm. But what where antibiotics have been seen to fall short, bacteriophages may be a viable solution. Antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria can be combated with use in conjunction with bacteriophage therapy.
Phage used to induce bacteria: Another emerging use of phage that our team has tried to incorporate into our research is the use of bacteriophage in bacterial induction. Bacteriophages can be used to induce genes in a bacterial cell to be turned on or off, which allows us to alter the function of the cell.
Cholera
Cholera, the Disease
Cholera is a disease that affects three to five million people each year with approximately 100,000 deaths. Transmitted mainly by the drinking-water supply, it causes an infection in the small intestine leading to severe diarrhea and vomiting. If left untreated, it can cause death within hours. The disease is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae which was first isolated by Filippo Pacini in 1854. Vibrio cholerae is gram negative, comma shaped, and flagellated. It is easily treated with modern water purification techniques, and as such it is most prevalent in developing countries that lack this infrastructure.  Countries that are recovering from natural disasters are especially vulnerable. One of the first documented outbreaks occurred in 1817 near the Ganges River. British trade ships unknowingly spread the disease by transporting infected bilgewater from the Bay of Bengal. Several major outbreaks followed in places including as London, New York, and several parts of Russia.
Quorum Sensing
Quorum sensing is the cell-to-cell signaling system that allows for coordinated behavior between bacteria through the secretion and detection of signaling molecules termed autoinducers. Some autoinducers are specific to a certain bacteria, while others are detectable by a broad range of bacteria. The N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are a class of autoind"

Currently we have finished two subprojects. We have cloned two genes, dxs from another bacteria  and IspG, into the E. coli. These genes are the limiting steps in the synthesis of IPP and are introduced into the bacteria to optimise the IPP production. Furthermore we have sequenced the dxs gene of E. coli in order to improve a preexisting biobrick.

Modeling
What is modeling? This year it can mean building a model to describe the growth curve, it can mean describing a potential signaling pathway,    or, it can mean an attempt at building an organism-scale model of B. subtilis. Each of these definitions is realized through a separate    initiative. If you came directly to this page from the Project menu, then you may be more interested in the techniques and algorithms used in the models.    Skip ahead to the presentation below, and feel free to request a copy of the source code. If you navigated to this page from the Growth section of the     Sticker page, then you're probably expecting some sort of computer simulation predicting real-world growth behavior. Head on down to the Quantification of    Initial Medium Composition. However, if you're interested in learning how to balance complexity with usefulness, read it all. You will see that    complexity is introduced only where necessary (FBA to fill in literature gaps and discover relationships, the organism-scale model to try and discover other    behavior from the GC and gene-expression data). Unless you're designing a Rube Goldberg machine, it is always best to keep things as simple as possible.
Initiatives
This year, the modeling portion of the project was tasked with providing tangible support for the rest of the team.     Theory is all well and good, but a project with such a limited timeframe required focus. The result was three major initiatives:
1. Quantify the initial medium composition which would:
a. Germinate the spores
b. Raise the population to reporter-required levels within the smallest possible spoilage time-frame
c. Maintain an active population at that level for a prolonged period of time, avoiding the onset of dormancy or sporulation
2. The creation of a succinct explanation of TnrA activation, according to current"

Meeting with Tomer Malchi (CultivAid, The Hebrewu University)
Tomer mentioned the  KOW value (hydro/lipo-philic qualities, polarity) which can be used to predict how well molecules will be able to diffuse through root membranes.
Molecules that are between 2-3 can penetrate easily through the membrane while higher or lower values may have trouble:
a. Molecules that are bigger than 500 D will also have trouble passing through the membrane.
b. Molecules that have net charge can't [easily/passively] pass passively through the membrane.
c.  Molecules PKA  effects the charge, and as such soil pH can play a role in determining uptake(causing the plant to affect pH may help us uptake molecules).
Specifically, TCDD has KOW of 4.5 meaning it won't enter a plant in a passively. When we checked the dechlorinated version of the molecule we saw that its KOW is 3 meaning the plant should be able to absorb it [passively].
Moreover, Tomer suggested to check if we can enhance oxygenation in soil and by doing so, we can boost the degradation of different compounds.
When Tomer was asked about different methods to measure how well a plant absorbed/ broke down a certain molecule he said that we the machinery to check how well a chemical is present in soil solution or plant solution he said that we need to check if someone made a protocol for it before. If we can find a protocol, we probably have the machinery needed in the faculty (HPLC chromatography)
Further on Tomer mentioned that he has a special pump that can measure the ratio between the concentration of chemical in plant phloem to the solution that the plant was based in (while using aquaponics).
Furthermore, we understood that in order to build a system to detoxify TCDD in Vietnamese soil we need to pay attention to the soil properties (clay % and organic matter concentration).
Tomer recommended to discuss our idea with Baruch Robin, professor from the agriculture faculty that work in the field of herbicides.
Also, Tomer recommended to discuss our idea"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," it was also found to have a growth-promoting effect, that is, the growth rate of the strains introduced the plasmid was higher than that of the control group. It proves that the gene loop can make the strains containing the gene expressing the target product have a growth advantage, thereby achieving high yield. However, since the plasmid may still be lost, we need other means to help retain the plasmid. The experiments have shown that low concentrations of antibiotics can retain plasmids, and we have learned that low concentrations of antibiotics do not have much cost and downstream separation burden in actual production, so we envisage assisting in the retention of plasmids by adding lower concentrations of antibiotics. Since the plasmid-containing strains have a large growth advantage, we can think to a certain extent that the growth rate can indirectly reflect the plasmid retention rate, and the two are positively correlated. In addition, in the presence of antibiotic selection pressure, the retention rate of the plasmid increases with increasing antibiotic concentration, but at the same time, it will also exert pressure on the growth of the strain, which will slow down the growth rate of bacteria. Therefore, in order to obtain the optimum concentration of antibiotics to maximize the growth rate, we set up experiments with different antibiotic concentration gradients to repeatedly measure growth curves. Therefore, the concentration of antibiotics with the highest plasmid retention rate can be determined indirectly by the concentration of antibiotics that can grow bacteria fastest.
Results
It can be seen from the experimental data that the growth rate of the strain increases with the increase of antibiotic concentration within a certain range, but after reaching an optimal concentration, the increase of antibiotic concentration will cause the growth curve to decline. This is because, when antibiotic concentration has little stress on growth, as the concentration of antibiotics increases, the growth advantage of the strain gradually appears, and the retention rate of the plasmid gradually increases. Therefore, before the concentration of the antibiotic reaches the optimum concentration, the growth curve gradually rises. But after the concentration of the antibiotic reaches the optimum concentration, the pressure of the antibiotic on the growth exceeds the positive effect of the growth advantage of the retained plasmid on the growth rate. Therefore, as the concentration of the antibiotic is increased, the growth rate declines.

I. Project Demonstration
According to our human practice and research of bibliography, we find out that the main problems causing traditional biological methods to be inefficient are their disperse concentration, ineffective enzyme and high mortality of bacteria. Our project successfully improve the biological method of treating sewage in all these three aspects.
Our project mainly consist with two parts: CsgA + Spytag and CotA laccase + Spycatcher. These two parts will form a biofilm that provide shelter and for the bacteria and help them share nutrition. At the same time, this design will increase the concentration of laccase. Our experiments sufficiently demonstrate the feasibility of this prosperous project.
II. Parts Demonstration
The combination of our parts is generally satisfactory in efficiency. We choose B. subtilis to produce laccase, which is efficient multi-copper oxidase. This enzyme has robust properties and is widely applied in industrial fields that required harsh treatment conditions (Tian-Nyu Wang, 2016).
a. Engineering I
We transfer CotA laccase genome into E.coli. In order to produce laccase extracellularly, our team also fuse signal peptide into the genome. Afterward, we measure the enzyme activity of our designed part, and our engineering turn out to be effective.
We have tried three type of signal peptide, PelB is the most effective one
This signal peptide could improve the enzyme activity by more than 100%
b. Engineering II
In order to demonstrate that our Spytag could successfully bind with Spycatcher, we add the gene of GFP into the genome and compare the fluorescence of the biofilm between two groups: one contains Spycatcher, while the other group are not. After we separate biofilm from supernatant, we find out that the fluorescence in the liquid of the Spycatcher added group is significantly lower than the Spycatcher absent one. The result shows that most Spytag+CsgA and Spycatcher+GFP are bond onto the biofilm, and this is removed from the liquid, suggesting that the Spycatcher and Spytag could firmly connect with each other, and our bacteria could therefore be suspended on the biofilm.
Also, we do further experiments to prove that the connection of Spycatcher and Spytag could largely improve the enzyme activity. We find that, comparing"

The result and figures are:
Therefore, the correlation coefficient between the three interspaced mismatches cleavage activity and CRISPR-X mismatch score is 0.6092. And the fitting equation of the straight line is: Y=0.0065*X-0.0018. (X stands for mismatch score).
In summary, the correlation coefficient of the above-mentioned five different conditions (single mismatch, two concatenated mismatches, two interspaced mismatches, three concatenated mismatches and three interspaced mismatches) respectively are: 0.8840, 0.8902, 0.7688, 0.8566, and 0.6092. The correlation coefficients are all over 0.6, and three correlation coefficients are over 0.85. In some extent, this result demonstrated the validity and availability of our scoring algorithm.

6. Visit to Elementary School
Our team members (Paniti, Ayaka, Ryu, and Miyabi) took part in a catered lecture on September 8th at Ohyamaguchi Elementary School. The aim of this visit was to let children know how important DNA and protein are for our human beings, as well as the essence of synthetic biology, which is: combining genes.
6-1 iGEM card game
For this event, we created “iGEM card game” which represents the essence of synthetic biology by combiningcards. This card game has several series of cards. Each series consists of 3 to 5 cards, each card represents the key parts of an iGEM project.
Fig. 6-1-6. Group picture with the students
 
The rule of this game is like poker. When we gather a whole series of cards, we can get points. By gathering them together, the player can understand how the combination of different genetic parts can be used to create living organisms with new and desired function.
Fig. 6-1-6-1. Our group member playing iGEM cards with the students
 
For example, one series represented Tokyo_Tech 2013’s project, “Mutant Ninja coli”. The aim of this project was to design a story by using a state switching circuit in E. coli to represent the life of ninja: switching between the state of mimicking civilian and battling with samurai. There are three characters, E. ninja, E. Samurai, and E. civilian in this story. This series consists of three parts: “state switching”,”receiving signal molecule from E. Samurai” and ”attacking E. Samurai with Shuriken”. Each of the cards represents one of the three parts (Fig. 6-1-6-2).
These cards not only represent the nature of synthetic biology, but also has many illustrations. Therefore, the card game became very popular among the students. Some students played the game many times and asked us if they can keep the cards for themselves.
Fig. 6-1-6-2. iGEM CARD GAME
 
To make sure the students understood the essence of the card game, we also explained the team’s project by using slides (Fig. 6-1-6-3).

Collaborate with BIT
This year we communicated with team BIT-China, helping each other at several aspects.
1.  We assisted BIT-China with their modeling
It's our pleasure to assist team BIT-China with their modeling part. We mainly helped them to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, we built a model to link six chemical reactions together, all of which were controlled by pH switch. There is only one chemical reaction with a specific pH, and with the pH changing, the chemical reaction will change subsequently, which makes the pH range from 5 to 7 smoothly. They prove us the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and we are responsible for the realization of the procedure during the entire process.
The difficulty that BIT-China met was how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the pH switch to find out the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, in order to draw a image to reflect the pH variation trend with time. Because some of our team members are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, we have plenty experience in the solution of differential equations, application of MATLAB and design of procedure. With these resources, we have helped them solve their problems successfully.
The differential reaction equations of the chemical reactions are as follows:

This year, we chose BBa_K381001 (PyeaR-GFP) as                     an alternative to our inflammatory sensor, due to promoter PyeaR is sensitive to nitrate and                     nitrite. When nitrate and nitrite enter E. coli, they will be converted to nitric oxide. Then                     nitric oxide will bind to the repressor protein NsrR that inactivates PyeaR to inhibit                     transcription of downstream genes.
We learned that the iGEM 2010 Team BCCS-Bristol had used BBa_K381001 to detect the soil nitrate and                     nitrite to demonstrate the fertility of soil. Thus, farmers can determine which soils are                     fertilized by detecting the fluorescence of GFP reporter gene. In this way, farmers only need to                     apply fertilizer in places where there is no fertility, which can save excess fertilizer. Given the                     economic costs and the impact of eutrophication on ecosystems, the use of BBa_K381001 has great                     benefits for both agriculture and the environment. However, due to the influence of outdoor                     temperature, GFP fluorescence density fluctuated significantly. This instability is unfavorable                     for the detection of soil fertility. In addition, the detection of GFP fluorescence signal requires                     special equipment that is not readily available for farmers. Therefore, we replaced GFP with blue                     chromop"

SDS-PAGE
5ul sample is loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE separation gel. We use 250kDa marker Precision Plus Protein? Dual Color Standards #161-0374. Parameters can be seen in protocols.
According to the result of SDS-PAGE (figure 6), target protein Plu0840 (72kDa) is strongly expressed (line 3) compared with the negative control, native BL21 (DE3) strain without engineering (line 1).

We fed the same amount of termites separately with Plu0840-expressing BL21, Plu0840-expressing BL21 embedded with CNCs and control group: mCherry-expressing BL21. For more details please go to our Protocol
In six days, three termites died in Plu0840-expressing group and two in CNCs group. We conclude that Plu0840 may have weak oral toxicity on termites, which also corresponds with results of related research. However, more experimental proof is needed to further confirm the toxicity of Plu0840.

Synthetic biology is a newly emerged interdiscipline in need of novel concepts and creations, which calls for the participation of young people. In 2011, iGEM brought High School Division into being. We believe that the high school participants will bring a new perspective to this new field.
Tsinghua-A team 2012 communicated with high school students on such issues as the concepts of synthetic biology ,the applications and the prospects ,with the help of ITCCC(International Teenager Competition and Communication Center), a Chinese organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology competitions for young people, on August 17,2012 . They high school students showed great interest and enthusiasm for iGEM and synthetic biology. Meanwhile Mao Yong, the vice director of ITCCC, who is preparing to organize iGEM HS, communicated with us on issues about out laboratory, the advantage and major of our team members , their scientific research experience, etc.. Also, we exchanged opinions on the responsibilities and obligations when undergraduate iGEM participants served as a director for high school students.
Besides, we collaborated with our sister teams, Tsinghua team and Tsinghua-D team, the other two iGEM 2012 teams in Tsinghua University. These three teams are composed of members from different colleges in Tsinghua. Our team members come from School of Information Science and Technology and the School of Science, while the other two teams are comprised of students from School of Life Sciences. On September 21,2012 we held a joint lecture on synthetic biology for students from different domains, organized by the Association of Science and Technology of School of Life Sciences. In the lecture, we reviewed our experience on the iGEM project and how we combined the research of synthetic biology with our respective majors. The audience were quite impressed and attracted by this project and synthetic biology.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,") one could expect sufficient bacterial surface attachment. However, in these low-shear regions chemotaxis may be compromised. Fortunately, in our Quorum Sensing Model, our bacterial communication through the AHL molecule does not affect bacterial locomotion thus chemotaxis in our case is not an issue.
It is interesting to notice that the shear stress values on the tumor boundaries are within the low-shear region limits and thus, we expect a considerable number of our bacteria to attach to the tumor surface.

6- Climate change conversation with Mr Pauthier working as terroir Project Manager at Comité champagne - 07/01/2017
The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France. We discussed about the dangers of cold temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost with the help of particular devices.
This year, the frost during the spring resulted in a loss of 70% of the grapevines in the region of Bordeaux and a loss of 25% in Champagne. Several techniques to counter these losses are used by professionals in this sector. However it is often expensive and water consuming.
At the end of the meeting, Mr Pauthier offers to us the possibility to do some experimentation in their institution. If the proof of concept is successful, a partnership will be done between the iGEM Paris Ionis team and the Comité Champagne in order to perform some tests in the field.

He told us that there is a need for ready-to-use devices with individually sealed one-time-use components, which is exactly how CascAID is designed. In developing countries, running a diagnostic test in such a device should cost less than $1 so that people with no access to a close medical center can benefit from it. Our cost estimation is of $0.85 per test reaction, assuming that we can scale up the production of the parts and use our detector for approximately 1,000 tests.

Meeting with GE Healthcare
We met with representatives from GE Healthcare to show them our lab and present them our project. Since most of us have a biochemical background, we did not have experience working with paperstrips so we asked them for advice. They gave us useful information which we incorporated into our final design. Namely, we thought on using basic filter paper at the beginning, but they explained us that for our project goals we would have to use cellulose, nitrocellulose or glass-fiber filter paper. They kindly gave us samples from each of those materials to test them. However, we found that the first two show autofluorescence and thus would interfere with our fluorescent readout. For that reason, we did our final experiments on glass-fiber filter paper that now makes up the reaction environment for our readout.

3rd Meeting of Youth Organizations organized by the General Secretariat for Lifelong Learning, Greek Ministry of Education & Research
Representatives of the Greek Ministry of Education & Research gathered university student teams of Thessaloniki, state agents and major social partners at national policy level, aiming to get a better understanding of the voluntary and research actions. We got a better grasp of the initiatives in our city and joined forces to reach out to a larger audience. The representatives were more than excited to learn about our efforts to promote interdisciplinary research in Greece,  such as exposing high school and university students to fundamental Synthetic Biology principles. They encouraged us to keep at our efforts and we discussed on how to kick-start a campaign next year to visit schools all around the country. Last but not least, we engaged in in-depth discussions on the possibility to secure financial support from the Ministry of Education & Research for the next iGEM team, thus rendering participation in iGEM for Greek teams somewhat like a tradition.
REACHING OUT TO UNIVERSITY PEERS
AUTH Student Week Presentation
Our first public appearance was during the Student Week organised by Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH) back in May. Student Week stretches across multiple days, where AUTH teams can participate and present their work, which can include theatrical plays, concerts, sports, painting exhibitions as well as many cultural activities. However, scientific teams have exponentially established their presence throughout the years.  We had the pleasure to present our initiative and progress to an audience of roughly 60 students who warmly welcomed us, appeared to be quite interested in Synthetic Biology and actively participated by asking questions or having conversations with team members directly after our presentation.  That was our first major event and we received positive feedback from all those enthusiastic students, that were intrigued both by our innovative approach to cancer treatment as well as by Synthetic Biology, as they were not familiar with the term, let alone its principles.

Osaka,2010,Team:Osaka#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,") participated in this project.   We Kyoto team led other teams in the project, and successfully got over 1,500 answers in total!  From the survey, we found that opinions differ between students and non-students.   To our little surprise, the survey also showed that the majority of Japanese regard biotechnology favorably, while at the same time they worry very much about the safety.
Introduction
This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practices” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
Motivation
According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose ""negative"" or ""neutral"" than the other nationalities [1] . In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food [2] . We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
Advantages
By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practices activities.
This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.
[ This is the common Introduction article of participating universities of “iGEM Japan Human Practices”( KIT-Kyoto , Kyoto , Osaka , Tokyo_Metropolitan , and UT-Tokyo ). iGEM Kyoto has the responsibility for the wording. ]

KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven#Project#Synthetic Biology_-_-_TEXT.html," is a new challenge in biosciences. It combines biology and engineering principles to design and build new biological functions and systems. Examples are abound: cancer cell invading bacteria(1), microbes that take pictures(2), antimalarial drug producers(3), ... The advantage of using living systems for these purposes is that, once they are designed and built, they are self-reproducible. The challenge, however lies exactly within the design and construction: making biological circuits and devices as robust and predictive as their electrical counterparts. Creating foundation technologies for engineering biology is the major goal of one of the founders of the iGEM competition, Drew Endy (who made a great comic on synthetic biology  !)
Indeed, although synthetic biology may sound as old wine in new bottles, it is clearly different from the genetic engineering we know so far. Whereas recombinant DNA technology is applied ad hoc and hardly ever predictable, synthetic biology builds on standardization and abstraction. You first design what you want to make, you test it to see if it will do what you want it to do, and then you build it, for instance with standardized BioBricks . The underlying goal of synthetic biology is to make it easier to engineer biology. And since biology is that complex, the only way to see if biological systems can be truly engineered, is to try it out. Hence the iGEM competion!
iGEM - Competition
The international Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) or iGEM competition is a synthetic biology competition for multidisciplinary teams of undergraduate students. It was first organized in 2004 by Drew Endy, Randy Rettberg and Tom Knight of MIT with two goals in mind: to yield new ideas in synthetic biology and to form the future researchers in this new scientific community. Whereas 5 US teams competed in 2004, the 2007 edition already had 750 students and advisors grouped in 54 teams from 19 countries. This year, the competition already counts 83 teams!
The core of the iGEM competition is to design and build a “new genetic machine” with BioBricks . BioBricks are standardized, off the shelf biological parts that are used by genetic network designers. All BioBricks that were made during previous iGEM competitions are registered and documented in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Each iGEM competition thus starts from the efforts of the previous years.
The main iGEM activity happens during the summer holidays, when all teams build their ""new genetic machine"" in their home university. These new biological systems are first carefully designed with computer simulations"

Going beyond trying to clone the unsuccessful sequences.
Group A - If J sequence successful, can probably QuikChange G and J tomorrow. Time to also look at submission to BioBrick Registry for successful sequences, etc.
Group B - If C# sequencing successful, it is essentially ready. Time to consider: transform to MG1655 (is this the LuxS(-) strain?) → how to isolate AI-2 to induce pLsr → design fluorescence experiment (collaborate with Group D in designing, probably).
Group C - E# is DsbA DNase. If sequencing successful, time to look at how UCL 2012 assayed this part. H# is MccS. For starters, maybe we can see if transforming the part into MG1655 kills our cells…P# is plain DNase. Look at how to experiment on protein isolation through the His tag?
Group D - look at the iGEM website for InterLab. What are the experimental requirements (species of E. coli, etc?)

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Figure 2: CO2 uptake as a function of glucose oxidase flux in an optimal FBA solution.
The FBA solution then predicts that the CO2 uptake increases as the glucose oxidase flux increases. In accordance with the previous observation that the reduction in growth rate would be at least -0.0089/h per per unit of the flux the CO2 uptake was increased by, the reduction in growth rate was found to be -0.0533 per unit of CO2 uptake flux.

The construct chosen to express glucose odxidase (GOx) is a lac promotor regulated by LacI. GOx is therefore inducible by the addition of IPTG. The genetic circuit can be modelled by the following chemical reaction equations:

Quantify the midi-prep samples
Run the midi-prep samples on agarose gel through DNA gel electrophoresis
Run products from a PCR reaction involving arsR and cadA DNA on gel
Run PCR products on gel
If successful, clean up fragments, run on gel again, cut with restriction enzymes NheI and BamHI, clean and then ligate together fragments.
Procedure
The following procedures were carried out:
Freeze the kinA and cotC-GFP-smtA transformant cells
Instead of preparing mini-prep samples from the two groups of transformant E.coli cells (i.e. kinA transformed E.coli cells and cotC-GFP-smtA transformed cells), we instead took the decision to use the inoculated 5ml LB tubes in freezing the cells. Analysis of the midi-prep samples will be used to determine whether the BioBricks have been truly transformed - this decision will both save time and also provide a back-up stock of cells for future work. This procedure was carried out by James using the protocol
PCR the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick with pMK15 and pMK16
Midi-prep cotC-GFP-smtA, kinA, pGFP-rrnB, pMUTIN4 and pSB1AT3
The midi-preps were conducted, as usual, using the Sigma-Aldrich Midi-prep kit and protocol. There were no changes to the protocol and 10ul samples of the five midi-prepped plasmids were loaded onto 0.8% agarose gel (see the 'Results' section below). The midi-prepped DNA samples were also assessed for DNA concentration using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
cotC-GFP-smtA
The following diagram shows the concentration of the cotC midi-prep sample as well as the DNA to Protein ratios; at 89.7 ng/ul the DNA concentration is at a suitable level for further processing. When analysed through DNA gel electrophoresis (see 'Results' section below) it can be seen that the band produced by the cotC-GFP-smtA within the uncut pMK-RQ plasmid lies just below the 2027bp fragment of the HindIII ladder.
Whilst the plasmid + BioBrick is 3,663bp the plasmid was uncut so it appears as a shorter fragment in the gel. To prove that the midi-prepped DNA is 3,663bp, we should carry out restriction"

The promoter pPhlF is another promoter needed repressed by PhlF for the translation of Cre. It will only produce Cre when it is not bound and repressed by PhlF.
Under no induction, only the mRNA transcript for PhlF production is produced. Upon receiving (LuxR_AHL)2 inducer, the mRNA transcript is translated to produce cI molecules. Under induction, however, cI will be translated from the mRNA transcript and will inhibit pcI in its dimer form cI2 . This will lead to decreased production of PhlF and this in turn will allow pPhlF to produce Cre.
PhlF repressor repressing pPhlfp promoter. There will be no Cre recombinase produced here
Upon an induction, cI inhibits pcI in its dimer form. There will be Cre recombinase production here
2 System of Reactions
We can describe the Sensing module as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
Note that in this simulation, since pLuxR is treated as being induced at its maximum level, we simply use its induced transcription rate as its transcription rate.
Reactions which we treat as a regular ﬁrst order reaction are represented with a one-way arrow ( → ), while those that we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation to are represented with a two-way arrow ( ←→ ).
3 Approximations
3.1 Quasi-Steady-State Approximation
To simplify our model, we apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA). Because the rate of binding and dissociation are much faster than the rate of transcription and translation, we can simplify the set of reactions by treating some reactions as being in steady-state equilibrium.
We apply this approximation to the following reactions:
pcI and cI
PhlF and pPhlF
Furthermore, we also make the approximation that the promoters are much fewer than the number of repressors, so we make the approximation that reaction of a repressor binding to a promoter does not reduce the repressor’s concentration. We can make this approximation because the number of promoters is equal to the plasmid copy number while the number of repressor is usually much higher for any signiﬁcant concentration.
3.2 Non-Cooperativity Approximation
Because modelling the eﬀects of cooperativity of the two binding sites on pcI would add"
ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,": 4-para-aminobenzoic acid, natural occuring UV light absorbing molecule used in sunscreens
As an output of either our direct or our indirect sun detection we are planing to produce para-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is able to absorb UVB light and therefore will act as an active ingredient in our intelligent sunscreen.
In paralel to PABA we are going to produce a violet pigment. This will serve as a warning signal to avoid further sun exposure.

Evry Paris-Saclay : Golden Gate Assembly for HMWP2
We had problems from the very beginning with restricting/ligating and transforming one of our main genes. Namely HMWP2, this gene encodes for a fairly big synthetase that catalyzes the first part of yersiniabactin, which is identical to N-Pch, therefore we wanted to utilize the catalytic functions of HMWP2 to synthesize our main target.
However, since it is a fairly big protein with 6.5 kb encoding for it, we could not order it as a single DNA part from IDT, instead we had to break it up in 3 parts, inexperienced as we were we thought well, let’s split it up in three parts, as the maximum size we could order was 3 kb. This approach implied, that we would need to include restriction sites for single cutting enzymes, which we did, XmaI and MaubI where the enzymes of choice and we tried to ligate and transform all three parts into psB1C3.
As it turned out it is quite hard to achieve a ligation that complicated, still we tried our approach for several weeks, fueled by some false positive results we thought well we might make it. In the end though we gave up and admitted that we would need some help to finish our most important BioBrick.
So, we reached out to our fellow iGEM teams first we had a discussion with Heidelberg, which proposed to use the Golden Gate method as well as Evry did later then. The collaboration with Evry sprung from a personal conversation between our team leader Shanti and Evry’s head of human practices Yanis, who established the contact with their head of science Jérémy.
Jérémy showed us how to design a golden gate assembly, while also providing us an entire protocol to ensure our ligation step, with the planned assembly a transformation is almost guaranteed to work, however the correct order of the fragments is not therefore a relatively extensive screening process is needed to find the colonies that carry the designed fragment.                  Additionally, we had ongoing support by Jérémy to"

This chip was designed and routed in an improved version of Fluigi in which the updated design rules had been implemented.
This output is much cleaner, having significantly less unnecessary kinks and bends, and includes portions of the chip design not previously possible; for example, two ports were placed and routed in locations not previously possible in earlier iterations due to ports being pushed to the edge.
Besides these software improvements and updates, our 2017 work with Fluigi and Neptune brought other issues and suggestions to light as well. Many of these will be implemented in future iterations of Fluigi. A short list of these can be seen below.
Issues
Bend penalties are not clearly characterized
Random “kinks” will be added to straight channel connections
Channels will overlap when they are not supposed to
Primitives will overlap when they are not supposed to
Nesting trees within each other leads to spacing issues
Suggestions
Requiring all primitive dimensions to be evenly divisible by lambda (scaling value) so that scaling back up after routing retains exact primitive dimensions
Adding the ability to reflect modules horizontally and/or vertically
Through our work on Fluigi, the 2017 BostonU HW team improved upon both Fluigi and Neptune. We identified issues and limitations associated the Fluigi place and route tool, an  integral portion of the Neptune software workflow. By helping to improve Fluigi, we have also built upon  the 2016 BostonU HW project Neptune.

Testing of nuc on isolated DNA
Assessment of nuc activity on S.aureus biofilm
Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is released by bacteria through autolysis (self-degradation) and serves as a matrix component of biofilm. eDNA is involved in various biofilm processes including adhesion, aggregation of bacterial cells and as a nutrient source. Enzymatic degradation of eDNA can weaken the biofilm and make the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics and biocides. [10] Numerous studies have shown that biofilm-degradation can be achieved by a variety of DNases, enzymes that cleave single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. [11] In our project we aimed to degrade biofilm formed by S. aureus which has previously been shown to be susceptible to DNase treatment. [12] The DNase we used in the scope of this project was a nuclease (nuc).
Figure 1: Mechanism of Nuc
In addition to eDNA, nuclease may also cleave neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which  are secreted by white blood cells in wounds as a response to bacterial infection. [10] Thus nucleases may interact negatively with the body’s own immune system and it would be of great advantage to create a nuclease that targets bacterial, but not human DNA. Eucaryotic and procaryotic DNA typically exhibit different methylation pattern and some studies have taken advantage of this difference to specifically target bacerial DNA using methylation-dependent nucleases. [13]
The nuc used in our project is no methlyation specific , to limit degradation of NETs and other bodily functions and the plan is to avoid the wound edges when applying the nuclease to wounds.
To target biofilm, we ordered a nuclease BioBrick (BBaK729004). Together with a T7 promoter (BBaI719005), a previous iGEM team demonstrated nuclease’s capability to digest DNA.
Additionally to testing nuc’s ability to"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPT"

An initial attempt was made to make a construct composed of the LacI promoter BBa_J04500 followed by the RFC25 fusion standard GFP (BBa_K648013). This construction produced few viable colonies. One colony appeared to have the expected band size after colony PCR (Figure 4) however this result could not be replicated. This construction will be attempted again in the future.
Figure 4. A colony PCR of potential colonies containing the part J04500 + K648013. Standard BioBrick primers were used. The band about 1100-bp in size indicates the successful amplification of this part. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1300-bp when using BioBrick primers. No contamination is observed in the NTC (no template control). The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Also received this week were the synthesized coil genes ordered from BioBasic . These genes are the K-coil, E-coil, K-coil with a His-tag, and E-coil with a His-tag. These genes were successfully transformed into our E. coli cells and were miniprepped successfully. These genes are in the pUC57 ( pUC57 PDF Information Sheet ) vector and will have to be plasmid switched into pSB1C3 for submission to the registry.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
Confirmation digests were performed upon the coil parts miniprepped last week in order to confirm the presence of the coils (Figures 5). These coils can be seen as the faint bands at approximately 100-bp in size on the gel. Digestions like these could be performed as the synthesized genes contain the RFC 25 prefix and suffix. These digestions revealed that the coil genes are indeed present in the minipreps produced. Glycerol stocks were made of our transformed cells for organized long term storage.

Newcastle,2010,Team:Newcastle#E-Science_-_-_TEXT.html," and returns it in CellML as a simulatable model. The service can return the CellML to the client, but it can also simulate the model using JSim, a Java based software application. Three services, a database service, a web service and a simulating service were established. Finally a Taverna workflow was created that use these services in order to create a generic simulatable model. The parts of the generic model can, for the moment, be replaced manually with specific parts. Ideally the service should be extended to replace parts automatically so that minimal input is required from the user.
Although all of the above mentioned services were installed on one server it is possible to develop these services such that they can be run on different servers and off course in different locations on the Internet.
A variation on the waterfall software development life cycle was suggested and it was illustrated how this method can successfully be used to guide the design process. It is, however, a very old method and software engineering has produced many alternatives since. It would be worth while investigating some of the newer methods that might prove to be even more successful if applied to the Synthetic Biology development life cycle.
Putting it all together
Figure 1 shows, from start to finish, the internal flow of information in an ideal workflow that would produce a complete and simulated model of the requested part or motif. The workflow includes the workflows already created as well as the services provided by BioBrickIt. To actually be able to implement the complete workflow both BioBrickIt and the Taverna workflows created will need extending.
The process is started with input by the user (Figure 1(a)), specifying which motif and which specific parts are required.
The next step. (Figure 1(b)), is to retrieve the motif with generic parts from the database. The motif is composed of virtual part and assembled according to the rules which are also capture in the database. This motif is simulatable as is, but contains no specific parts as yet.
Step 3, (Figure 1(c)), uses a service, such as BioBrickIt, that can use the generated motif and replace generic virtual parts with specified parts of the same type. For instance, a generic constitutive promoter can be replaced by pspaRK.
Step 4, (Figure 1(d)), uses a service such as JSim to simulate the model. To make sense of the simulation results it is usually required to visualise it in some form. Visualisation is done in step 5.
Step 5, (Figure 1(e)), produces human readable formats of the simulation results. Visualisation is usually in the format of"

This design includes the expression of a light sensor, which, when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, triggers transcription of a lysis cassette.  A few of the parts which we experimented with are BBa_K952000 , BBa_K592016 , and BBa_K124017 .
Copper Etching
Our project is to revamp a chemical and mechanical manufacturing process, so in addition to working with DNA, we also worked on macro-scale batches of copper foil, the bacteria A. ferrooxidans. Using our liquid media, we were able to grow ferrooxidans and simultaneously etch copper foil much faster than the basal rate (i.e. copper in the liquid media without ferrooxidans). Since our PCB manufacturing process requires the ferrooxidans to ""stay put"", we have been developing a solid agar-based media, on which the ferrooxidans grow, and below which the copper is etched, again faster than the basal rate.  Click here for details.
Biobrick
Our team submitted multiple composite parts, which were built from preexisting Biobricks and used in our project. We also submitted a novel red light sensing protein domain, FphA753s, which was constructed to conform to the RFC25 – Freiburg fusion standard, and is intended for future use to allow light based control of transcription. Click here for a full list of our submitted parts.
Outreach
Our team organized a booth at the 2012 Maker Faire in New York City to share the work we've been doing with the public. We also made 3 interactive games to teach children about recombinant DNA and the various forms of bacterial transformation. Click here for more info.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KaraNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," It was the sequence from the dummy data sheet we made for testing purposes, and it was being used because unless users explicitly requested the data sheet, the parts never pulled their data from the registry. Pretty serious! One of the dangers of running in-house testing with dummy data all the time. That was pretty much taken care of, but understanding the logic behind the Primer Designer was a bit of a fight. A fight that still continues...
02 Aug 2012
Last day! Veronica made really cute thank-you cards (more like books actually) for Orit and Consuelo, and the lab went in to a separate room one at a time to sign them. We got coached on spieling for an hour or two before presentations, and then we went down. We were in a tight little corner and though we had organized shifts, the MoClo planner group seemed to be passing in and out of poster-manning pretty freely. Or maybe that was just me? There were a lot of interesting presentations, though, and I was glad to have a chance to read the posters and talk to the other presenters about their work for the summer. Once the presentation two hours were up, we headed out for a zombie lab photo and then to El Oriental de Cuba for some great food! I couldn't enjoy the food I'd ordered, though, because I'd already filled up on the empanadas and yuca and plantains we got as appetizers. It was loud, the food was delicious, and it was a great time. Couldn't ask for a better way to wrap up the last ten weeks.
03 Aug 2012
So not quite wrapped up. Went in to redo Primer Designer based on Traci's actual work and not our misconception of it. Had to draw several diagrams and pore over the spreadsheets and powerpoints she gave us to make sure I understood. It ended up being a lot more data than we originally had shown! I tried adding several buttons that would not only show primers for a selected part, but also those of the destination vectors it will be included in.

Meeting with Başkent Team
Being located in the same city has its advantages for iGEM teams. Last year we met with the Başkent team for a barbeque and have been friends from there on. Apart from all the part exchanges and protocol updates from both sides, we decided to take a night out and have fun together. Working hard during the day gives one the privilege to drink a beer or two right? What better way to discuss synthetic biology, classes, the problems in the lab and the general funding problems then drinking at a rock bar after a long day right?
 
 
Meeting with ITU MOBGAM team
After we heard a team from İstanbul is participating, we gathered up to visit them. Not because we love the beautiful city of İstanbul and needed an excuse to get there! The hospitality of the İstanbul team outshined the rainy cold weather and friendships were established while having a breakfast with an epic view over the bosphorous. We visited the laboratory of the ITU team, discussed our projects, talked about potential problems in the lab or modelling part and enjoyed our new formed friendship.

Note that the backbone plasmids have a significantly lower concentration than the GFP-LVA generator strain. This is partly because the GFP-LVA strain had a higher cell density (longer incubation). But also the lysate was much clearer than the other strains. This is also reflected in the 260 nm ratios, which are much lower (=better) for the K145280 strain.  The 30 ml cultures were divided into 15 ml fractions and centrifuged. Elution was done with 50 µl and these fractions were then combined to get the (approx.) 95µl end product. This yield will allow approximately 14 assemblies per backbone.

Team experience sharing
New team
NWPU is a newly founded iGEM team this year. We had a meetup with them on May 22th and shared our experience in team organizing, training, project preparing and some tips on attending the Giant Jamboree abroad.
We are glad to be helpful for them to their participation in iGEM this year, and we look forward to their performance in the Giant Jamboree.
Shanhai-Tech is also a new team this year. We made acquaintance with them during iGEM HUST-Cheering （ click here if interested to know more ） and kept close contact with each other afterwards. They were impressed by our passion during the meetups and we gave them detailed suggestions on part submissions, part documents and and filling of judging form. And we also shared some experience on how to get important information from official website and some reminders of the due-date. We expect to meet them again at the Jamboree!
Wuhan iGEM Committee
After the frequent communications and collaborations last year, we had established Wuhan iGEM Committee with HAZU-China and WHU-China. Earlier this year, on April 17th, members from the three teams met together at HUST. We exchanged our preliminary ideas of our 2016 project and discussed the matters on interlab collaboration among three teams.
Wetlab cooperation
Experimental design help out
In order to test our engineered strain in a more elegant way, we planned to make a time gradient visual aid. We set GFP and RFP as report genes to detect the switch function through time.Team JSNU-China knew about our project and they are interested in this characterization, so they volunteered to do a pre-experiment for us. We delivered our test samples to them and their feedbacks are promising. They proved the possibility of the method and suggested that we improve the detailed process to make the result more convincing and concrete. We really appreciated their contributions!
Equipment help out
Team HZAU-China has always been good at modeling and measurement. We have been in good connection and often discussed problems about team construction and experiment with each other. During the iGEM HUST-Cheering! meetup, we put up our suggestions on their circuit design to help them build more concrete regulations on bacteria movement. And we also helped each other on experiments.
Owing to limitation of experimental conditions, we got a problem of measurement this year. HZAU-China generously offered access to their lab and microplate reader"
REC-CHENNAI,2018,Team:REC-CHENNAI#humanpractices_-_-_TEXT.html," One recurrent question that we were asked was how we were planning to eliminate the false positive and negative results that could arise from the binding of a single primer as opposed to two primers amidst other encouraging comments. The meet was a very fruitful experience with invaluable inputs for our project.
IHP with Mr Phaneeshwar Rao
On the 14th of August 2018, our team had a very productive discussion with Mr Phaneeshwar Rao of **. The inputs he gave our team were twofold, first being that we add two primers, one for the sense strand and the other for the antisense strand of a double stranded plasmid. The second input was about how we could compare the efficiency of primers binding to a single stranded plasmid and double stranded plasmid and a suggestion to add the studies to the modelling objectives. This input arose from the doubts on the stability of single stranded plasmid, which he believed could be unstable upon laboratory handling. Another valid consideration he gave us was about the decrease in gene expression levels upon increased number of mutations to one sequence. He suggested that we further study the decrease in gene expression levels upon mutation.
Science Sketch
In collaboration with NYU Abu Dhabi, our team created a sketch highlighting the basic details of our project ‘FluoroScreen’. The video started with a brief introduction about mutagenesis. It explained in length the conventional process of inducing mutations using the pALTER system and the reversal in antibiotic sensitivities upon mutagenesis which is used for screening. The video proceeded to explain our intended procedure which involves the use of a gene expressing Dual Fluorescence Protein (DFP) that fluoresces in both green and red colours. Upon inducing a point mutation, the gene expresses a Green Fluorescence Protein and loses its ability to express dual fluorescence. The video caters to all eyes and its deep narration enthralls all ears. Simple depictions such as scissors for restriction endonucleases and glue for ligases made the video understandable."

We drafted a petition to have residents of our city sign, indicating that signatories support urban beekeeping in Lethbridge. As we talked to residents, they agreed that bees play a crucial role in our lives and that we need them in order to survive.
After petitioning city residents, we presented to our city council about what we wanted to change in our city.
Meeting with MLA—Shannon Phillips
Team members with Shannon Phillips
Shannon Phillips, the Member of Legislative Assembly for Lethbridge West, and the Minister of Environment, as well as the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women is a local representative for the provincial government. Minister Phillips showed support for our project. She showed respect for our work as well as that of other scientists, stating that “there needs to be a healthy respect for scientific method, [and] for evidence based decision making”. She also recognized that our society may be entering “a phase of people being skeptical of science”. She felt that the only way to overcome this obstacle is through education. Minister Phillips also showed support for genetic engineering in general, stating that she “[doesn’t] see any problem with genetic engineering at large and in most of its applications”.
Integrated Human Practices
Beekeepers Visit and Interview
Team members visiting bees
Following this interview, we were able to get in contact with two urban beekeepers. They allowed two of our team members and an advisor to tour their beehives and to speak with them about their experience with urban beekeeping. The beehives were surprisingly inconspicuous. Both of their neighbours are aware of their beekeeping practice, and have not had any issues with the bees, noting that they rarely notice them. The beekeepers did mention that in urban beekeeping, in comparison to commercial beekeeping, you need to be “really diligent with hive management” in order to control swarms, which may instill fear in citizens.
