Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Beyond Basics_-_-_TEXT.html," When the chance evolved to start an iGEM team in Aachen I was directly very positive. The interests of students and the idea of teaching are combined in the iGEM competition. Also I am very happy to see how the iGEM competition developed in the past few years, and I am excited how it will continue. I think it is also good that many students participate with fun and passion. In total iGEM is a great experience for me.
Can You tell us something about the atmosphere in Boston and at the Giant Jamboree?
The atmosphere is unique. All the teams live in the same hotel and when you enter into the convention centre, you can feel the iGEM spirit immediately. You will be very focused before you present your project in front of people, but afterwards you will just feel relieved and can enjoy the atmosphere. Besides it is great to represent the RWTH Aachen University and spend time with your team members. It is important to be recognized as iGEM team Aachen till the competition is over. Moreover, it is great to feel the international spirit. You can learn about so many projects and you have the chance to talk to many other teams about their iGEM experiences. Do not only look at the well-known teams, but talk also to teams with very difficult working conditions. Their enthusiasm is truly inspiring. In summary, enjoy Boston!

Harvard,2010,Team:Harvard#flavor#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," after digesting all three inserts and vector and running them on a gel, we did not see any NosT + stop DNA.  Therefore, on Monday June 21, we began by digesting more NosT + stop and V0120 vector with xba1 and pstI fast digestive enzymes.  The gel showed DNA length to be consistent with the given parts.  (See gel below)

Gel Lanes (both inserts and vector were digested with xbaI/pstI): 1. 1kb plus ladder. 2. NosT + stop terminator.  3. V0120 digested.
Upon gel extraction and gel purification, we ligated the inserts into the vectors with a 2:1 insert to vector ratio (previously we had been using a 4:1 insert to vector ratio).  We then transformed the plasmids into e.coli and plated; no colony growth was seen the next morning.
We used Team Vector's R3 ligation (they have successfully ligated and transformed) as a positive control. However, the bacteria containing the ligated plasmids were plated on Ampicillin plates, which turned out to be the wrong resistance.
Troubleshooting
In order to get a better understanding of the problem with our ligation, we ran a diagnostic gel with the V0120 backbone and vectors B15 and B21.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week3_-_-_TEXT.html," a functional activator-GFP fusion.
Western blotting: a second idea is to add an N-terminal flag tag to the activator proteins, and then add the C-terminal degradation tag.  We could measure the amount of activator using Western blotting and an anti-flag antibody by taking samples over time.  However, Western blotting isn't that easy.
Finally, what we're really doing is solving a problem found in the Cambridge 2007 team's system.  If we can show that overnight bacterial growth is less hindered with our tagged activators, then we are effectively showing that because of the degradation tags, the activators are indeed  being degraded.
We could also attempt to see what this effect has on amplification
Modelling potential - activator half life, change in Pops out?
First we need to dig up the 2007 work and recreate their data, this time with a plate reader that can take OD and fluorescence readings simultaneously.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Growing Back Nerves_-_-_TEXT.html,"F is a neurotrophic or an apoptotic factor [8]. Many articles are still in contradiction on this matter and part of the reason is linked with the biological pathways by which both proteins act on neurons. Two receptors are involved in their signaling: tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). The two proteins (proNGF and β-NGF) are able to bind both receptors, but it is globally accepted that β-NGF has a higher affinity for TrkA and proNGF has a higher affinity for p75NTR. Figure 2 shows a big picture of how the two signaling pathways are thought to work.
Figure 2: NGF versus proNGF signaling pathways. Adapted from Wang, 2014.
At this point, it might seem that choosing to clone β-NGF in the bacteria of our interface would be a better idea than proNGF. However, a few other information led us to think the other way around. First, despite the existing controversy, proNGF has been proven to exhibit a neurotrophic activity on some neural cells, even though it is not as strong as mature β-NGF (there is a fivefold activity difference) [10]. This neurotrophic activity is likely generated by a p75NTR-dependent mechanism and depends on the proportion of TrkA and p75NTR in the neural cells [11]. Moreover, TrkA is mainly expressed in three types of neurons: peripheral sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, whereas p75NTR is more evenly dispersed in different types of neurons [9]. Thus, expressing proNGF in our case seems like a good choice. Furthermore, several articles support the idea that the pro-sequence of NGF facilitates, and is even absolutely necessary, for the proper folding of the protein when it is recombinantly expressed in bacteria. This is particularly relevant as this protein contains three disulfide bonds and is particularly difficult to express using synthetic biology while keeping its function [12] [13].
Considering all this information, we finally chose to clone proNGF in our interface.

3.Reporting part
        Because cell lysis process usually happens extremely fast, we set a threshold that when the degradation of outer membrane is over 0.5, the cell lyses and intracellular proteins come into the system completely. After the cell lysis, β-galactosidase comes out of the cell, accumulates to a relatively high concentration and produces oNP, a colored substrate which can be easily detected by any kind of photographic equipment.
4.The whole process
        Eventually, we put all the four parts together, and finished the buildup of the model, which is shown in the flow chart.
        Getting such a flow chart isn't a hard work, but parameters fitting can recede one's hairline. Table below is the theoretical fitted value of the parameters used in the model. The match result of the model and the wet lab data is shown in the figure.
        As a result, our model successfully predicted the result of wet lab, not only that the protein concentration of SRRz matches the real value, but also that our model realizes a cell lysis process at about 3.6x103, which is approximately an hour, matching the wet lab data. We must greatly thank the Simbiology program of matlab for the help of the modeling work.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Treatement modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"Once in contact with the cell, the cell vector has two possible ways of action.
The vector fix then it detaches from the cell.
The vector fix then it is internalized within the cell.
We can model this according time and the association constant (kon) and dissociation constant (koff) and internalization constant(Kint).
This gives:
With kon = 5.10^3 M-1s-1, koff = 8.10^-3 s-1 and Kint = 5,78.10^-4 s-1. If we calculate the global constant K', such as IDP = K' xt, we obtain K'= 361.5 s-1. Thus more than 360 phages are internalized per second in contact with a wall.
If we compare the time required to internalize a phage compared to waiting times before the cell enters apoptosis in response to the entrance of a vector cell (1 hour), it appears logical to neglect the internalization of cell vectors (IDP = constant = 360 phages/s) in the final equation.
Thus, with a total efficiency of the phage diffusion, and a neglected internalization time, we can say that the efficiency constant λ is equal to 1.

- Npl, the number of cell vectors released by bacteria .
We can neglected (differences between the time or space scales)  some factors:
- Kdeg, the degradation constant of the phage, because all the phages were internalized in 10s.

They not only provided us information and an overview about the whole project, they also provided us a culture of Escherichia Coli K-12 DH5 Alpha and 96 well plates for the Interlab-study. We are in contact all the time and very thankful for the support and the mentoring.
CeBiTec and HSHL students after a lovely afternoon filled with information and getting to know each other.
Erlangen - Video Project
iGEM Erlangen created an educational animation movie, which was published on YouTube. We are grateful that we had the opportunity to provide Viatnamese subtitles to this movie and therefor were able to help out iGEM Erlangen in their intention to ensure that anyone regardless of their linguistic background can enjoy this movie.
Networking
Collabarating with teams is great, but networking is a big part of iGEM, too. To interact with others to exchange information and develop e.g. social contacts is an enrichment for anyone involved.
June, 22. - 24. 2018 - German meet up in Marburg
The German meet up was our first opportunity to present our work to anyone outside of our University. It was a great chance to get to know the other teams and to meet some true iGEM experts.
July, 20. - 22. 2018 - European meet up in Munich
After the German meet up in June, we decided to join the European meet up in Munich as well. Six of us spend a few days in the beautiful city and got the chance to present our project idea and work to even more teams.

RBS Tuning
One of the more familiar ways of tuning a biological circuit is to change the strength of a Ribosome binding site (RBS).          Changing the strength of an RBS allows for the alteration of the amplitude of a given transfer function. While this is          a familiar concept to most iGEM teams, it takes on a special importance in the context of the Circuit Control Toolbox.          This is because while transfer functions are preserved when shifted, the amplitude of those transfer functions is          oftentimes reduced due to increased metabolic load. So we characterized a library of variable strength RBSs for use          in amplitude tuning in the Circuit Control Toolbox.
While it would have been possible to construct brand new RBSs for use in the Circuit Control Toolbox, we thought that          it would be more useful to characterize existing commonly used RBSs on the registry. So we chose to characterize the          Community Collection, which is made up of 8 variable strength RBSs, and is commonly used by most iGEM teams.
For our characterization we chose to emulate the methods of Lou et al. 2012 (“Ribozyme-based insulator parts buffer           synthetic circuits from genetic context”) and used a super folder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP) with RiboJ under           the control of pLacO1 (Bba_K2066014). The use of the IPTG inducible promoter pLacO1 allowed us to characterize the           functions over an induction curve, and the use of RiboJ, a self cleaving ribozyme from Lou et al. 2012 prevented the 5’           untranslated region of the promoter from effecting the translational efficiency of the mRNA transcript (Figure 1).           That means that unlike past iGEM characterization, our results are generalizable beyond the promoter pLacO1. (See the           RiboJ section for more details)
Figure 1: RiboJ acts to homogenize translational efficiency between promoters by cleaving the 5’ region upstream from          RiboJ. -35 and -10 boxes are shown in bold, and transcription factor binding sites are underlined. Note how there is          an operator sequence located within the transcribed region of the pTac promoter (BBa_K864400), and that pSal and pBad          include transcribed regions. These untranslated regions can change translational efficiency of the downstream protein"

Cell-Based Method (MTT) (2008)
Cell-based method MTT appeared in the same period as CAA. Their ideas and strategy are similar                         and don't need not be detailed here. MTT improved the disadvantage that CAA can only throw a                         single species of radical into cells. And the detection process is simpler. However, it was                         criticized because the text conditions is too extreme for living cells, which may not be                         representative of physiological settings.
This critical voice also reminds us that modest cell survival is necessary"

Berkeley_Software,2009,Team:Berkeley Software#JoannaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," let go of the mouse.  However, this turned out to be a very difficult task in Java/Netbeans Visual Library.  Netbeans Visual Library uses ImageWidgets to attach images to Scenes.  Each pane that I had was its own Scene.  Conceptually, I wanted an ImageWidget to detect a mouse drag gesture and make a copy of itself, then the Scene of the working pane to detect where the drag was released to place the ImageWidget there.  However, there is no easy way to do that with the Visual Library.
After spending a good portion of the week trying to do the above, I tried ways of mimicking the drag and drop behavior by storing information about the thumbnail the mouse was pressed on and then retrieving that information to create a new ImageWidget when the mouse was released over the other Scene.  However, I also ran into several problems with that.  One was that the mouse released mouse listener didn't seem to work for some reason.  I also had trouble storing the information for the new widget somewhere such that the other Scene could access it.
I finally had limited success on Thursday afternoon.  I was able to double-click on a thumbnail and have it pop up a new ImageWidget in a default location on the working pane.  (The mouse listener for the double-click actually creates the new ImageWidget in the other Scene, so I didn't need to worry about storing information.)
Friday morning Richard told me about the MoveProvider class in org.netbeans.api.visual.action, which allowed me to create the ImageWidget in the working pane after the mouse was dragged from a thumbnail and released.  However, the ImageWidget will be dropped regardless of the ending location of the mouse, so even if the mouse is dropped outside of the visualization window, an ImageWidget will still be created.  Another unintended behavior is that simply clicking on a thumbnail will trigger the creation of a new ImageWidget in the working pane.  These should be fixed so that ImageWidgets are only dropped when the mouse is released in the working pane.
Friday afternoon, Richard merged the code he had been working on this week with what I had come up with for the thumbnail ""drag"".  We now have a visualization piece in which one can click/drag thumbnails to create new ImageWidgets in the working pane and reorder them on a grid.
Week of June 29, 2009
This week we named the visualization piece Spectacles.  I have been working on integrating Eugene (the language piece) into Spectacles.  With some help from Adam and Lesia, I got the Eugene lexer and parser running from Netbeans."

Compared with chemical molecules, optical signal is more efficient for both the macrocosm and the microcosm. We wonder whether we can change the induced signal into light, which is visible and easy to control. It propagates much faster and has countless channels, as each wavelength is a different channel.
Introduction
Recently, there has been increasing interest in visible light controlled system. Optogenetics, a seven-year-old field branching out from molecular biology and neuroscience, is leading the trend of creating novel synthesized proteins as “tools”
helping people understand the brain mechanism. These “opsins” with light-activated domain borrowed from microbes or plants, were transferred into model animal organisms. These controllers are acting in the central part of the light system. Unlike the drug treatment, light can be delivered by lasers with extremely high spatial precision; therefore, one can manipulate only target cells.
Our Biowave project is more than performing “Optogenetics can solve controversies that have been going on for many, many years.”light control. By establishing the light depending feedback system within the cell we have realized a light communication system. This is the very first time that putting the intracellular and intercellular light communication together in the biological system. Using the fundamental gene circuit and brand new parts we created, each cell becomes a communication node.
The first Biowave circuit we have created is the Negative Feedback Biowave. The circuit comprising light sensor and light generator established the negative feedback between them. The properties of time delay, caused by gene expression or the accumulation of the element’s concentration, and negative feedback could form an oscillation of light output within a single cell or the neighbouring cells. By placing the bacteria on a Petri dish and letting them evenly distributed, each cell could sense the light of others equally. With the certain condition and observation analysis, the whole dish could form a detectable synchronized oscillation. In a macroscopic view, this kind of synchronization could be distracted by the attenuation of light. So we could expect a wave like pattern on this level.
The Positive Feedback Biowave is another attempt for the intracellular and intercellular light communication. Thus the positive feedback under this situation makes the system a bistable circuit; each cell can remain in either a light state or a dark state. But the light irradiation across the colony makes things different. The bacteria would form a static strip or other bistable system caused patterns within or beyond our"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Conjugation Modeling
Our conjugation modeling work is based on the paper A model for bacterial conjugal gene transfer on solid surfaces [10]. Using a slightly modified model we simulated our conjugation protocol for R751 cells conjugating on a 0.2 μm filter placed on agar for a period of one hour.
Assumptions
The cells are distributed randomly on the filter at the start.
The conjugation times used in our simulations are less than the time required to exhaust the nutrients in the medium.
All cells form a colony (are CFU).
All cell types (donors, recipients and transconjugants) have identical colony radial growth rates and specific growth rates.
Conjugation occurs instantly when a donor colony touches a recipient colony. Future versions of the model will integrate a conjugation delay time once two colonies meet.
Plasmid loss is not taken into account.
Cells can not move over the surface except through expansion of the colony.
Parameters
The parameters needed for this model are:
Surface area of media (A)
Initial colony radius (r0)
Specific growth rate (gn)
Colony radial growth rate (gr)
Maximum numbers of cells sustained by system (Nmax)
Initial number of donors (Nd) and recipients (Nr)
Default values for these parameters can be found on the parameters page.
Spatial distribution of bacteria
The bacteria are initially distributed at random on the medium, so a distribution function to find the closest cell r would be:
where λ is the intensity (cells per unit area).
Growth of colonies
While the original model presented in the paper used an exponentially increasing rate for the colony radius, this was changed to a linear rate of expansion for our model. The radius at a point in time is given by:
Contact between colonies
Two colonies with radius r touch if their centers are less then 2r apart. The model checks this through an iterative process were it examines the separation distance between recipients and donors/transconjugants. Once this distance is less than "

We did both! Firstly, we improved the characterization of pCYC yeast promoter, BBa_K124000 , by providing information on activation and repression of this promoter when targeted with different scRNA.
Secondly, we improved the function of other BioBricks from the 2015 EPFL team, like BBa_K1723009 for example. This BioBrick is a repressing gRNA targeting the pCYC promoter. We added to it a so-called effector protein recruitment site that can recruit a transcriptional repressor, Mxi1, fused with an RNA binding module, and it became BBa_K1941003 . This BioBrick can repress efficiently and reliably pCYC in yeasts.
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project.
We constructed a galactose-inducible NOT gate, using GAL1 promoter ( BBa_I766214 ), dCas9 ( BBa_K1150000 ), CYC promoter ( BBa_K124000 ) and two of our new BioBricks, the first one being a fusion between a RNA binding protein (PCP) and a repressor; Mxi1 ( BBa_K1941000 ). The second one is a scRNA targeting CYC ( BBa_K1941003 ) and represses it by recruiting Mxi1 fused to PCP. We obtained great results and could show that when galactose was not present, GFP was expressed. When galactose was present however, CYC was repressed and expression of GFP was decreased by manifold.

Marcus Podewski
Marcus was smuggled into the Heidelberg iGEM team by a fundamentalist animal protection and anti-genetic engineering movement to destroy the system from within, to burn it to the ground and to leave all participants with angst (Hegels 'Weltgeist' is descending and it will confuse all of you!) ... Besides such community services, he's studying History and Philosophy at the Universitiy of Heidelberg within the old system for a Magister (graduate degree) and a teaching degree. In order to pay his rent, Marcus works as a museum education officer in the UNESCO-World Heritage Monastery Lorsch and previously in the concentration camp memorial Mittelbau-Dora. He joined iGEM to elevate his philosophical studies to a more practical level and to apply his knowledge in bio- and technology ethics.
Philipp Bayer
Philipp was part of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2008 and since then knows the obvious reason to join the competition again: iGEM simply is the most beautiful competition existing in biology and its mix of constructive creativity and team work guarantees a uniquely inspiring science experience. Philipp's beyond-iGEM scientific interests are in neuroscience and after finishing his bachelor thesis at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Neuroscience at University of Heidelberg, he will start his master studies in Neuroscience. Since Philipp has been mentoring science projects for high school kids for years, he also enjoys the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the Human Practice Projects in science communication in which he's involved.

Our headquarters for the development of this project were the facilities at the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. At this center, we were kindly given access to the Laboratory of Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Diagnostics, which became our main workplace throughout the summer. It was in this laboratory that we had all the necessary equipment to perform most of our experiments: DNA extractions, gel electrophoresis, ligations, digestions and gel purifications, as well as space to carry out research for the development of the project.
We also had access to the Fifth Floor Research Facilities at the Biotechnology Center, where we performed the part of the project that demanded much more sophisticated equipment, such as transformations by electroporation, quantifications and fluorescence assays.

Fig.4 Highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation with Spychatcher and Spytag.
We used this feature of Spytag and Spycatcher to design a handy tool for protein purification. In the magnetic bacterium AMB-1, Spycatcher-Mms13 fusion protein is expressed and the Mms13 part can tightly associate with the Magnetosome. As a result, the Spycatcher in the fusion protein is anchored in the Magnetosome, which can be isolated from AMB-1 bacterial through sonication and centrifugation. Due to fast growing and easy genetic engineering of E. coli we utilize it to produce recombinant proteins of interest with a Spytag at either the N- or C- terminus. To easily release a captured recombinant protein, we add a cleaving site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease between the protein of interest and Spytag. Now the isolated magnetosome linked by Spycatcher can be used to specifically bind to the Spytag tagged recombinant protein in bacterial lysate of E. coli. After Spytag and Spycatcher form an irreversible covalent bond via spontaneous isopeptide linkage, they can be brought down together with the Magnetosome in a magnetic field. Extensive and stringent washing can be applied to remove proteins of nonspecific binding and the protein of interest can be released by cleavage of TEV protease.
Fig.5 Steps to purify protein in a new way
One caveat in the design above is that the TEV protease is still present in the final elution of the recombinant protein. The following two strategies can be used to circumvent this problem.
First, in the design shown above, we can express a TEV protease-Mms13 fusion protein in AMB-1; thus, the TEV protease can be easily removed after it fulfills its task. Second, we can use a self-cleavable sequence, intein, to replace the TEV site. In this case, the recombinant protein can be released by DTT(DL-Dithiothreitol)-mediated cleavage.

Regulation of gene expression involves changing the expression of protein or RNA produced by a particular gene. Various mechanisms exist, for doing the same allowing for control at various stages of the expression of the gene. For instance, if the control/regulation is such that it does not allow transcription to happen, it is termed as transcriptional control. Similarly, translational, post translational and several other layers of control exist.
The simplest and most commonly employed mode of regulation is the transcriptional control by repressor proteins. These are protein molecules that can bind to specific “operator” sites in the promoter region, and stop the promoter to recruit RNA polymerase successfully, thereby inhibiting transcription. Common examples of such systems are LacI, TetR and cI, which can inhibit transcription from the pLac, pTet and pCI promoter respectively. This mode of control is also commonly referred to as repression, and should not be confused with inhibition, which is a separate control mechanism.
Here, let us try to model what regulated gene expression looks like, by looking at a typical example of transcriptional activation. Consider the following case -
We have a protein X, that can exist in two states, the native (inactive) state X, and an active form X*. The molecule X* can bind to the promoter (say P), and promote transcription of the gene by helping the promoter to recruit RNA polymerase.
Lets look at another case, where we have transcriptional repression -
Here we are given 2 proteins, A and B. The protein A is produced and degraded, and is a transcriptional repressor for the gene B. A has its own production and degradation rates, described by alpha and gamma, and B also has its own production and degradation rates, given by beta and gamma respectively. Further, DA and Do represent the two states that the DNA region of the promoter PB can have. DA represents the state where A is bound to the operator, and Do represents the state where A is unbound.
The system can be represented by a set of reactions as follows –
Based on these reactions, we can write the mass action model for the system. This can be represented by the following differential equations –
Further, we have a 5th equation in the model, which is based on the conservation of DNA. Since all of the DNA of the promoter can either be bound by transcription factor A (DA state) or be unbound (Do state), therefore, the total DNA (DT), at any time, can be represented as –
Thus, the model of the system, based on mass action kinetics and"

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," recognize an external signal, then send  it forward to bacteria nearby using AHL signals, causing the same reaction in  cells nearby. Since each bacterium may affect tens or even hundreds of  surrounding bacteria, the signal amplifies exponentially. Thus, the signal will  be transmitted and amplified step by step.
As an upgrade of the basic modules, a  multi-signal system is designed, starting with two distinct AHL signals working  independently, so as to achieve the logic gating and calculation functions. Specifically  speaking, distinct information processing functions, or logic gates, such as ‘AND’, ‘AND NOT’, ‘XOR’ can be realized by unique biological circuitries, and  the assembly of these modules shows promise for obtaining complex computation  functions.
Taken together, our project aims to establish a  novel information processing system in bacterial community, based on the logic  of domino effect and quorum sensing system, which possesses the capability of  information transmission, amplification and logic gating.
3 Design
The designs of our project are illustrated as  followed.
3.1 Basic modules
3.1.1 Signal reception and  output:
The basic function of signal reception and  release is realized by a simple pathway including AHL as signal molecule, LuxR  as signal reception part and RFP as a sign of signal reception and subsequent  release. The AHL molecules may come from two sources: external (i.e. AHL solution  we drop into the system) and internal (i.e. AHL from neighboring stimulated  cells).
Here we used two kinds of AHL molecules from  two species, with the same functioning mechanism and no cross-linking: 3OC6HSL  from V. fischeri used in Lux system  and 3OC12HSL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa used in Las system. The binding of AHL to LuxR will form “the dimer of dimer”,  which consists of two AHL molecules and two LuxR protein molecules. This  complex will activate the transcription from the promoter PLuxR, leading to  subsequent expression of RFP. RFP, or other such proteins, serves as an output  of the input information. In this part, two signal pathways using two different  kinds of AHL molecules are constructed.
3.1.2 Signal transmission and  amplification:
One property of quorum sensing signals is that  the chemical molecules are able to freely move across membranes, which is also critical  for our project in the signal transmission module. The concept of positive  feedback is also applied in this module, making it possible to intensify signal  strength and avoid"

Firstly. We ordered original pDawn and pDusk system, and tested them with light and dark condition at the same time and cultured them over 17h. The results showed that pDwan system worked well, but pDusk did work (Fig.20). And then I tested fluorescence value (mcherry 575nm, 601nm) of pDawn and pDusk samples with three replicates. Also, we co-transformed BBa_K592020 (Blue fluorescence protein controlled by original Fixk2) with light sensor generator BBa_K1913034, but under 12h dark condition, we got blue colony which suggested that Fixk2 promoter (BBa_K546000,) did not work well(Fig.21). last, I co-transformed each hybrid promoter plus E1010 part with light sensor generator BBa_K1913034, and cultured them under dark condition over 24h with controls. And I tested fluorescence value and absorbance OD600 with three replicates. The results show on Fig.22.

large internal surface
Anode
In order to be used for an anode, a material has to be highly conductive, biocompatible and chemically stable under the conditions present inside the fuel cell. Many traditional materials, like copper, are not suitable, because they corrode or have a toxic effect on the bacteria. Platinum works excellent, but is extremely expensive. Several carbon-based materials provide a cheap but practical alternative. Regardless of the type of material, the electrodes surface area is a very important factor for current production. Previous investigations showed that current increases with the overall internal surface in the following order: carbon felt > carbon foam > graphite ( Chaudhuri and Lovley, 2003 ).
Requirements:
high conductivity
good biocompatibility
long-term physical and chemical stability
Cathode
Because of its low overpotential in combination with carbon electrodes and the resulting working potential, which is close to its open circuit potential, potassium ferricyanide (K3)[Fe(CN) 6]) is the most frequently used electron acceptor in microbial fuel cells in research scenarios ( Logan et al., 2006 ). However, one has to consider that the reoxidation by oxygen is very low and the diffusion through the PEM is not negligible, so the oxidation of this substance can affect the performance of the MFC when operated for long periods of time ( Rabaey et al., 2005 ). Alternatively, oxygen can be used as a very effective electron acceptor in combination with an open-air electrode. For an effective oxygen reduction, however, high-cost platinum catalysts are necessary. For this reason, this option is rarely used ( Sell et al., 1989 ).
Requirements:
good reduction performance
good reoxidation
high long term stability
Compartment separation
Although almost all microbial fuel cells use proton exchange membranes as the separation element between anode and cathode compartment, it is possible to use more simple constructions like salt or agarose bridges. These basic separation systems, however, do not reach the power output of membrane based systems because of their high internal resistance. Cation exchange membranes offer defined properties and ensure a better current output because of their high selectivity for the passage of positive charged ions. However, in this context it has to be considered that the PEM could be permeable to chemicals and oxygen, which might influence the long term performance of the fuel cell ( Logan et al., 2006 ).
Requirements:
high selectivity for positive ions
impermeability for chemicals and oxygen

--------------------------------------------------
Came in today to find that all transformations were successful!  All four plates had yeast colonies, which appeared red to the naked eye.  This might be good, except that one cannot determine at the present time whether the red appearance stems from the production of mCherry or from another biochemical process (Richard Bennett mentioned that the W303 strain natrually turns red in the absence of adenine).  If the former, this would be bad, as it would indicate an issue with either our media, our strain, or leakiness in our promoters.  Looked at plates under fluorescent microscope.  Note that there is a distinction between the number of visible colonies in brightfield and those seen in either yellow or green filter (for RFP and YFP, respectively).  RFP and YFP fluorescence was observed for the null repressor (Z0411).  For this part, one would expect to see YFP because it is under control of a constitutively active promoter.  The YFP fluorescence was significantly less pronounced for the activators, which is also according to expectations.  Should remember to take pictures of the fluorescence later in the week.  However, note that there was significant red fluorescence in all colonies, which is against our expectations seeing as the plates had a fair amount of methionine"

A few factors have been taken into consideration for the design of the hybrid promoters. The consensus sequence known as the “G-box”, a highly conserved direct-repeat motif located 109 and 108 bases upstream of the transcription start site in N. Punctiforme and S. 6803, is a region where CcaR binds to PcpcG2 as an activator [4]. We choose to use Ptrc1O and keep the whole sequence intact because it is shown to be a constitutive promoter in E. coli, and has been reported to be leaky in S. 6803 [5]. By combining the upstream components (CcaR binding site) of PcpcG2 with Ptrc1O, while keeping the Ptrc1O -35 and -10 sequences intact, our hybrid PcpcG2/trc1O promoter in E. coli should be highly expressed in (green) light with basal levels of transcription during the dark.
As described above, the hybrid promoter functions the opposite of how we eventually want it to; namely, we want nitrogenase to be highly repressed in light conditions (where a lot of oxygen will be present to poison nitrogenase), and highly expressed in the dark. Therefore we need to create a genetic switch that functions essentially as a NOT gate, where in high light conditions, our product (currently EYFP), will be highly repressed.
Different switches based on RNA have been well documented in E. coli; we have several options. First we are testing the repression mechanism using a basic pTet/TetR, repression mechanism. By expressing TetR, the system driven by the hybrid promoter should show strong repression in light, and strong expression in dark.
We planned our next step to swap out the pTet/TetR repression with a system of CRISPR interference to block transcription initiation or elongation based on binding to the template or non-template strand of a chosen sequence [9]. In our case, we would tune the sgRNA to bind to the -35 box of our hybrid promoter in order to block transcription. The reason we wanted to use CRISPRi is because it has been shown to be functional in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, although slightly more complex, this becomes a much more powerful tool once people transition to eukaryotic environments. We were unable to get far enough this summer to transition to a CRISPR system.
Meanwhile, once the other half of our iGem team gets nif cluster working in E. coli, we should be able to swap out the fluorescent"

In town planning it is crucial to not reduce a problem too much. Otherwise, the architectural intervention will be an isolated and foreign object in its surrounding. Such interventions have a high risk to fail, explained D. Übelhör. As urban systems, biological systems are highly complex. In order to understand them we tend to reduce them to single subunits. However, reductionist approaches run the risk of neglecting important information, especially when transferring behavior of subunits to the behavior of the whole. That is also what we learnt from D. Garcia, a member of the research team of Systems Design . He pointed out that in some situations reductionism is not only an unsuitable strategy but also unnecessary at the same time. Why should one struggle with details if they cannot explain the entity?
Unexplainable noise is jointly responsible for complexity. There might be ways to reduce the noise and thus increase the predictability of systems, however, we have to accept that we do not know everything. K. Chikkadi who studies micro- and nanosystems expressed this fact in a scientific context, while J. Fuisz highlighted the religious aspect of acceptance. The trust in a higher power helps to overcome complexity. Of course, this cannot be transferred to a research project literally. Anyhow, to accept that there is no human omnipotence can protect from frustration. We cannot - but we also do not have to - solve all complexity.
To not get lost while interpreting experimental data, we followed the advice of the physicist and philosopher E. Klein: we limited our ambitions in order to become efficient. Many times it is advisable to proceed in small steps rather than aiming at the full monty immediately. However, pedantic planning is always highly important especially when dealing with complexity, emphasized C. Veress, the philosophy teacher . Looking back on the past weeks and months we can only agree with that. Spending time with planning instead of rushing quite often saves time, money and work.
While spreading the word about synthetic biology we experienced the importance of a simple, comprehensible language. In fact, good communication and articulation is crucial for functional teamwork. Explaining concepts to high school students, interested visitors at the open house or during a science slam increased our awareness of the importance of communication and trained our skills at the same time.
Many participants of our survey on emergence on complexity encouraged us in our research project. They agreed on the importance of analyzing complexity and the emergence of patterns. We were very happy to get such a positive feedback and motivated to continue our studies.

Hear our story!
Paolo Marangio
Hi everyone! My name is Paolo and I come from Italy. I am currently enrolled in the MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. I like electronic music, football and swimming. I have laboratory experience in microbiology and cell biology. I am very interested in algal biotechnology, so working on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 6803 as part of the Edinburgh OG iGEM research project is really exciting for me!
Yu Yan
Hi, I'm Yu Yan and I come from China. I like playing volleyball, cooking and shopping. My major is Biotechnology and I have done Bioengineering before come here. This is my first time to study abroad and also the first time to take part in an iGEM competition. In this team, I'm using the MoClo to prototype the plasmids for our non-model organisms.
Tom Laidler
Hey, I'm Tom and I'm from Newcastle. I spent my undergraduate degree in Manchester studying neuroscience and have since seen the light and switched to synthetic biology. Less than a year ago I hadn't heard of iGEM and I'd only seen Penicillium roqueforti on plate. Now I'm getting used to seeing it in a petri dish. I'm looking forward to travelling to Boston and making the case that useful chassis can be found everywhere, even in your cheese!
Ibrahim Al Masoud
Hey guys! I am Ibrahim from Kuwait.  Together with Adair and Matin, we have designed and optimised a modular genetic toolkit for Rhodococcus, in the hope that researchers find it easier to genetically manipulate this potentially model industrial organism.  I have done my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and I am the only one here doing the MSc Biochemistry at Edinburgh!
Matin Nuhamunada
Hi people!I'm Matin and I'm from Indonesia. I study Synthetic Biology & Biotechnology in Edinburgh. I love sunshine and the warm tropical beach. Outside the lab, I am concerned with education of young scientist (age 12-18) in South East Asia by doing research"

Firstly, they prepared medium by mixing broth and water and prepared it in a microwave oven; this was intended for bacteria to be grown upon. Secondly, they poured the medium into two petri-dishes each. While the medium was solidifying, bacterial samples were collected by taping different surfaces and then touching the solid medium (agar) with the tape to stick bacteria to the plate. Some people gently pressed their thumb against the agar before and after washing their hands. On the other agar plate participants practiced streaking a bacterial culture (of bacteria from the mud outside the building). The plates were then incubated at room temperature and the results analyzed before the third workshop. The participants got to find out whether there is any difference in bacteria on the thumbs before and after washing their hands!
It is fun to see the participants slowly but steadily mastering basic lab techniques and becoming able to perform more advanced experiments.
Workshop 3 - Glowing E. coli
For this workshop, the participants were given the chance to do the ""Hello World"" of synthetic biology - making a glowing bacteria (bacteria producing the famous fluorescent protein GFP). The iGEM Stockholm team provided Makerspace's BSLI approved lab with competent cells, purified GFP-containing plasmid and antibiotics for the selectivity. Prior to and during the workshop, participants were reminded of the importance of being careful with antibiotics and making sure they are kept and disposed of correctly.

When transforming the bacteria, the protocol, found under Protocols on our wiki, were provided as the recipe for the workshop.
With these workshops, our goal was to reach out to the public and inform both theoretically and practically how to design, perform and analyse important experiments of varying difficulty in lab work. To present the success of the engagement with Makerspace, we have summarized statistics based on all surveys given out after each workshop. The participants were asked if they had learnt something new, if they would recommend the workshops to family and/or friends, if they were planning to join the next-coming workshop and if joining workshop 3, if they had also visited workshop 1 and 2. The results can be seen in the diagram below:
The participants were also asked how interesting and how fun the workshops were on a scale from 1 to 10 and these are the results:
Conclusively, the workshops were very successful and we are looking forward to arranging more workshops to make Makerspace evolve even more. Not only was this a great experience for the team in having to explain and instruct in the most pedagogical way possible -"

Figure 1: Random and biased walks.  Left:  A random walk in isotropic environments.  When the cell's motors rotate CCW, the flagellar filaments form a trailing bundle that pushes the cell forward.  When one or more of the flagellar motors reverses to CW rotation, that filament undergoes a shape change (owing to the torque reversal) that disrupts the bundle.  Until all motors once again turn in the CCW direction, the filaments act independently to push and pull the cell in a chaotic tumbling motion.  Tumbling episodes enable the cell to try new, randomly-determined swimming directions.  Right  A biased walk In a chemoeffector gradient.  Sensory information suppresses tumbling whenever the cell happens to head in a favorable direction.  The cells cannot head directly up-gradient because they are frequently knocked off course by Brownian motion..
The chemotaxis signaling pathway of E.coli
E. coli senses chemoeffector gradients in temporal fashion by comparing current concentrations to those encountered over the past few seconds of travel.  E. coli has four transmembrane chemoreceptors, known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), that have periplasmic ligand binding sites and conserved cytoplasmic signaling domains (Fig. 4).  MCPs record the cell's recent chemical past in the form of reversible methylation of specific glutamic acid residues in the cytoplasmic signaling domain (open and filled circles in Fig. 4).  Whenever current ligand occupancy state fails to coincide with the methylation record, the MCP initiates a motor control response and a feedback circuit that updates the methylation record to achieve sensory adaptation and cessation of the motor response. A fifth MCP-like protein, Aer, mediates aerotactic responses by monitoring redox changes in the electron transport chain.  Aer undergoes sensory adaptation through a poorly-understood, methylation-independent mechanism. The five MCP-family receptors in E. coli utilize a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins to control flagellar rotation and sensory adaptation (Fig. 4).  CheW and CheA generate receptor signals; CheY and CheZ control motor responses; CheR and CheB regulate MCP methylation state.
Figure 2: Signaling components and circuit logic.  E. coli receptors employ a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals"

Every year around 14,000 tons of sunscreen is washed into the oceans and seas.
A great number of commercially produced sunscreens contain chemical compounds with a broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are extremely toxic to the environment. Sunscreen washed into the ocean results in a dramatic increase of the toxicity level, causing a variety of pathologies to corals, including bleaching.
To prevent this we can use natural UV protection compounds, such as
mycosporine-like amino acids.
Our team is trying to produce MAA-s in yeast, using the genes from two different cyanobacterial species.                     We are expecting to obtain shinorine and porphyra-334 (MAAs).
They work not only as sunscreen but also are able to protect skin from photoaging, have the anti-inflammatory effect and antioxidant activity and even could be considered as anti-cancer agents.

We transformed the DspB in the pet15b plasmid into the BL21 strain of competent E. Coli cells. We then set up overnights of Colony 1 of DspB/pIG91 and Colony 1 of AmyA/pIG91.
We also set up overnights of V. cholerae in preparation for setting up and running our Enzyme Assay on Friday in order to test the enzymatic action of AmyA in breaking down V. cholerae biofilms. We will use various amounts of or purified AmyA protein with urea as a positive control and untreated biofilm as a negative control.
9/19/13
We ran plasmid preps for our DspB/pIG91 and AmyA/pIG91 overnights from yesterday using the plasmid prep protocol on the protocol page. The purified plasmids were labeled and placed in the freezer.
9/20/13
We revised our Enzyme Assay protocol today (see Enzyme Assay Revised on protocols page). Rather than growing our biofilms in the 96-well plate, we are going to grow them and run all the treatments in test tubes. In the 96-well plate we were seeing too much variation in growth conditions from the interior of the plate to the exterior as the wells have different air flows and evaporation rates. We will set up our assay to test AmyA enzymatic degradation of V. cholerae biofilms tomorrow.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Safety Jack_-_-_TEXT.html,"Formaldehyde Safe Lab Work
As mentioned within the policies section all of our lab work abided to the University regulation and Nationwide legislation and regulations. If there was anything any member of the team was unsure about they would ask other members of the team or supervisors to help or advise until they were confident. There are non-biological hazards within labs which are covered within the induction to the labs, they are similar for both labs as they are reviewed and set by university staff, complying with university standards.
All of the Labs within the university require smart card access, restricting members of the public and unqualified members access. This makes the labs a safer environment to work in and reduces the risk to the public. If biological materials required transportation between labs the appropriate policies were followed including safe storage and suitable labeling.
Sterilisation within the lab environment is particularly important as contamination and release can potentially cause a significant risk to the public and members of the lab. Sterile equipment is used and those which are taken out of their sterile packets are sterilised using the flame of a Bunsen burner or ethanol. When exiting the lab hands should be cleaned as even though gloves are worn it is important not to transfer potentially hazardous biological material to outside of the lab.
Waste was disposed of into hazardous yellow waste bins unless this was liquid waste in which case it was decanter into a waste flask which is autoclaved and disposed of. The University has its own waste disposal procedure which another member of the lab carries out. We are required to properly seal and label these bins for the safety of others as they contain sharps and hazardous materials.
A member of staff trained in first aid is always on call and first aid boxes are also in various locations within the lab along with eyewash stations which contain instructions of use. The methods of disposal and containment of spillages and broken glassware were covered upon induction into the lab.
Safe Shipment
As some members of our team and supervisors have participated in the iGEM completion previously they were already aware of the procedures involved in shipping DNA to the registry. All of our DNA poses no real risk as we were aware of shipping restrictions within the UK and to the U.S.. The standard submission kit was used to send off the"

The 366 bp long sacA sequence is selected from 1440 bp long sacA CDS. This sacA sequence is amplified by PCR with dangling end primers with EcoRI-NotI-XbaI restriction site at the 5’ and the SpeI at 3’ and inserted into a Biobrick compatible vector. The sequence is taken from B. subtilis strain 168 and the Genbank accession number is AL009126.
Primers
We used the following primers to amplify the sacA region:
Forward: GATCTGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGCACAGCGTTCTTTGTAAG
Reverse: TGTGACACTAGTAAGGATCGGATGTGCTGATTG
Degradation controller device
Finally we need to put all of our manual bricks into one plasmid to create our degradation controller device. When inserted into Bacillus subtilis integration vector, it will provide a single crossover site with arabinose controlled sspB expression.
Sac, araR promoter+RBS, and sspB biobricks are combined as a device into the Biobrick compatible vector pSB1AT3. The sequence of the device (without the biobrick prefix and suffix) is then amplified by PCR with dangling end primers with PacI at the 5’ and SacII at the 3’.  Pmutin4 is cut with PacI and SacII and the backbone of pmutin4 without terminator_0 and pspac is ligated with the PCR product.
Firstly digest plasmid part araR (pSB1AT3) with SpeI and PstI and digest plasmid part sspB (pSB1AT3) with XbaI and PstI. These fragments can then be ligated (Ligation will be tested by gel electrophoresis).
Now plasmid part sacA (pSB1AT3) can be cut with SpeI and PstI and plasmid part araR promoter+rbs+sspB (pSB1AT3)is cut with XbaI and PstI.

Started new dialysis on 2 silk samples (10 mL of LiBr silk, each)
START: 10:10 AM
Change 1: 11:10 AM
Change 2: 3:07 PM
Removed the silk from the concentration dialysis that was started yesterday at 900 AM
that is around 19 hrs, 20 minutes on the concentration
managed to only get around ~300 uL back from the cassette
4 mg in 20 uL = 200 mg/mL = 20g/100mL = 20% w/v.
I don't know how this managed to get so concentrated in less than 20 hrs.
I think concentration dialysis is to difficult and wasteful (20 hr dialysis to obtain less than 1 mL of silk)
going forward, HFIP is probably easier to work with
If we do do concentration, it will have to be for less than 19 hrs.

2008: Chinese Doctor Offers Gene Doping to Athletes
A German television report was brought out on the availability of gene doping in China shortly before the Beijing Olympics. In this documentary produced by ARD television, a Chinese doctor offers stem cell therapy to a reporter posing as an American swimming coach in return for $24,000, according to a translation provided by the ARD television. The documentary broadcast does not offer evidence that the hospital has provided gene doping to other athletes, but it does provide a shocking insight into the doping development scene.

2010: Gene Doping Detection: Evaluation of Approach for Direct Detection of Gene Transfer using Erythropoietin as a Model System
In two mouse studies, blood was positive for a plasmid in some animals for 1–2 days and up to 1 or 4 weeks after intramuscular or intravenous administration. The sensitivity of PCR methods used in these studies was 100 or 1000 vector copies per mg of gDNA. In another study with mice injected rAAV intramuscularly, 12 whole blood samples from a high-dose group tested positive for viral DNA until day 28, but viral DNA in plasma was cleared within 3–4 days. The sensitivity of the method for vector detection in this study is comparable to that for the assays developed here. ( Baoutina et al. 2010 )
2016: Officials Fear Some Olympic Athletes Might Be Altering Their Genes To Cheat In Rio
Sarah Everts reported for Chemical and Engineering News that officials planned to test 2016 Rio athletes' tissue samples for markers of gene doping. The most likely subject of a genetic hack appears to be the gene that codes for EPO. Therefore, this gene became what the officials planned to test for. ( Letzter et al. 2016 )
Athletes at Rio Olympics Face Advanced Antidoping Technology
According to the International Olympic Committee’s medical and scientific director, Richard Budgett, samples collected in Rio will be tested for gene doping at some point after the games, even though the test hasn’t been run during the Olympics itself. ( Everts, 2016 )

Therefore the only electricity requirement to emit 160-watts is the power consumption of the pump, which consists of 1.8watts. Thus to produce 60watts of light we require 0.675 watts of power [(60watts x 1.8watts) / 160watts] = 0.675watts.

The bulb will contain light-sensitive E. coli that detect levels of sunlight and regulate their bioluminescence (encoded by LuxCDABE gene cluster) to only be active during night time. LuxCDABE encodes the production of the proteins required for bacterial luminescence including luciferase and its substrates from Vibrio fischeri [4]. Naturally, Vibrio fischeri use additional regulatory proteins (encoded by LuxR and LuxI upstream) whose external concentration increases as a function of increasing cell-population density. Bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of these autoinducers and regulate the"

2. The molecular weight of a single polylactic acid monomer is 90 g/mol [42] whereas the molecular weight of the solid polylactic acid is around 59500 g/mol. [43] Therefore, the short-chain polylactic acid consists approximately 660 monomers. 660 molecules of lactic acid will be produced by degrading one chain of polymer.
3. Assumed the polylactic acid only contains one length of chain, however in reality the plastic chain has a range of lengths.
4. Considerations of temperature change and PH change are not included in the model. Therefore, the assumption is that they remain constant during the degradation
5. We also assumed a simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism for proteinase K.
""[Proteinase K]"" here is the concentration of the enzyme Proteinase K in mM, whereas ""[Polylactic acid]"" represents the concentration of polylactic acid in mM.

The efficiency of Secretion is assumed to be 90% secretion over 2 hours. [45] The rate of secretion in the model is therefore:
rate of secretion = 0.9[concentration of Proteinase K]/120 (mM/mins)
Simulations and Results
The initial concentration of Polylactic acid is 40mM, which can be converted to 2380g/L. The derivation is: 40*59500/1000 = 2380g/L. There is approximately 2kg of polylactic acid in the 1 litre bioreactor,  which is a really large amount. The simulation result is:
Results and explanations:The simulation shows a very fast degradation of large amount of polylactic acid by proteinase K. 2kg/L of the plastic can be completely degraded in 6 minutes. The reason for fast degradation is that we have relative large kinetic parameters for the enzyme. Polyl"
UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Model#EKD_-_-_TEXT.html," substrate reaching the sink over a 0.2 second time-frame was measured at multiple distances. The largest distance between enzymes was 1500 angstroms, with the smallest distance measured being 50 angstroms. The distance between enzymes was reduced by 50-angstrom increments to measure the effect of distance on final product yield. The model predicts a 5-fold improvement in IAA production when the enzymes are clustered together using prefoldin, compared to when they are free in solution (Figure 4).
Figure 4: From left to right, each graph represents a smaller distance between the two enzymes. The uppermost graph presents the concentration-time curve when the enzymes are separated by a distance of 50 angstroms, with the lowermost graph displaying the concentration-time curve for a distance of 1500 angstroms.
The graphs show a faster achievement of steady-state IAA production when the two enzymes are clustered together, and higher overall concentration of the second substrate at enzyme B.
By integrating under each curve, we calculated the amount of product formed at each distance over the same time period (Figure 5). As stated above, this calculation assumed perfect substrate to product conversion.
Figure 5: Each point represents the amount of IAA produced in micromoles when the enzymes are separated by a certain distance in angstroms.
We were less concerned with the exact values of product generated by the model, and more with the relationship between distance and amount of product formed. From this result the relationship between distance and product formation was made clear; product formation increases non-linearly as the separation between enzymes is reduced.
Taxol Synthesis
We met with Prof. Groundwater to discuss the potential of commercialising our scaffold who suggested that we look into the side-chain synthesis of Taxol as a potential application. We employed the kinetic parameters for the taxol enzymes in our mathematical model to control the rate of production and consumption of substrate at each enzyme. We found that clustering the enzymes on prefoldin resulted in an approximate 6-fold increase in taxol side-chain production (Figure 6).
Figure 6: Each point represents the amount of Taxol produced in micromoles when the enzymes are separated by a certain distance in angstroms.
MATLAB
The MATLAB PDE toolbox was used to solve the system.  The overall workflow involves generating a geometry of the model, creating a mesh, and solving the equations at relevant nodes in the mesh. For example, at the nodes surrounding the first enzyme, the flux value, J, is set to be the rate of production of the first enzyme based on Michaelis-Ment"

VirA receptor
Fig. 1: The VirA receptor of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
The VirA receptor is used by A. tumefaciens to detect acetosyringone and other phenolic substances which are secreted by plants after injury. In presence of these substances VirA phosphorylates itself and afterwards VirG, a response regulator which activates vir box containing promoters. These promoters control genes which are used for infecting the injured plant.  Actually we tried to use the VirA receptor already existing in the partsregistry (<partinfo>K238008</partinfo>). But due to sequence problems (compare results in characterization ) we had to isolate the virA gene from the Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens C58 ourselves and convert it into a BioBrick conform part. We removed an illegal PstI restriction site in the virA gene by site-directed mutagenesis.

Modern technology makes information acquisition more convenient, but there is no other way better than face-to-face communication. The conference provided teams with an opportunity to learn about each other. Meaningful exchanges in ideas enhanced the efficiency of problem solving. That’s why we tried our best to make a relaxing and pleasure atmosphere for participants, by providing delicious snacks and conference meals.
Attendance of CCiC helped all the teams acquire both reflections and inspiration from communicating, and improved the projects in the end. All in all, we believe that the conference will make a significant improvement for all CCiC attendees in the Giant Jamboree.
Communications
In addition to the Conference of China iGEMer held by Peking iGEM Team, we also attempted to communicate with other teams by various kinds of activities.
In April of 2015, the iGEM team of Ocean University of China (OUC) came to Peking University to take part in our discussions. At that time, both teams of PKU and OUC just had the core ideas of the project, with many details to be considered. Through the presentation of our idea and the brain storming, their participation has brought us some new ideas.
From May 16th to 17th, ZHANG Haoqian, our team instructor, visited Zhejiang University and gave their iGEM team members a speech about his insights into iGEM. As a predecessor, he shared his iGEM experience with the new iGEM team of Zhejiang University. The subsequent academic exchange between Zhang and the whole team has brought the talks to an end. Besides, having been invited as an instructor for the iGEM teams of several high schools in Hangzhou, he came to Hangzhou Technological Museum to provide theoretical and experimental references for them.

SYSU-CCiC conference also provided us with an opportunity to communicate with other teams. During the conference, we found both advantages and disadvantages in our project and acquire significant suggestions, such as biosafety, ethics, efficiency of parts, etc. when we communicated with others. In next 2 months, we tried to solve them and change into better. We sincerely hoped conference next year can attract more teams and be more influential.

Collaboration with SYSU_China
As a new team for iGEM competition, we had confronted various problems since we established our team. Consequently, we asked SYSU-China, SYSU’s first iGEM team, for help, such as details of registration and how to understand judging criteria. As for part submission, they provided us backbone plasmid, pSB1C3. In addition, we gave them reagent for Interlab. We were pleased to learn from each other.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," on/off ratio remains the same, the output is more consistent with a logical expression when one miRNA is high and the other is low.
Overall this analysis shows that LacI is more appropriate to implement logic gates. However, it is not a silver bullet. Its transition occurs at a point that might be inappropriate for some datasets, leaving even the miRNAs that are “low” on the positive side of the output.
miRNA Target Tandem Repeats
An interesting possibility is the adaptation of the number of target sites where each miRNA can attach to cause interference. It has been shown by [3] that there is little interaction between multiple miRNA and RISC complexes attaching next to each other, allowing us to model the overall dynamics additively. This assumption is challenged when there are low copy numbers of the participating molecules, but let’s follow it as a working hypothesis. Additive RNAi dynamics implies that, given an interference strength x by some miRNA for 1 repeat of the target site, if there are multiple repeats the interference becomes n*x.
To examine the effect of target site repeats, we’ll use an example dataset and circuit on the previous architectures.
Our Caco-2 and healthy dataset was obtained from the work by Cummins et al., 2006 [ 4 ]. The miRNA expression data regarding the HEK-293 and A549 cell lines were retrieved from the mammalian microRNA expression atlas [ 5 ]
Architecture & Circuit Optimization
We use the methods and insights derived so far to implement classifiers for our lab experiments. The experimental goal is to prove the ability of an optimized classifier to target cells from the Caco-2 cell line versus a healthy tissue control. Due to practical considerations, the controls on the actual experiments were the HEK-293 and A549 cell lines.
Running the circuit optimization algorithm on a dataset comprising Caco-2 and healthy samples [ 4 ] for the various architectures suggests the following circuits for each:
- where “cMargin” is the logarithm of the fold change
Apparently the best architectures are indeed the ones that use LacI in the middle layer and don’t use FF4 (which overrules LacI’s influence).
The LacI architectures are optimal with a very small number of inputs. The others have more inputs, but due to the way the optimization works, many of those inputs might be of only marginal significance. It is then in our best interest from a designer's perspective to attempt to simplify the proposed circuits - a process called “pruning”. Taking cues from LacI, we attempt to prune the other architectures to the same small circuit"

Protein Nanocompartments
Overview
Our goal is to enable a wide range of bioengineering and biomedical applications by making a collection of protein nanocompartments (PNCs) that are modular, specific, standardized, and safe. With that in mind, we designed a number of PNCs for encapsulation of various cargo types, as well as application-specific surface modifiers and cargo-loading approaches.
The surface modifiers typically act as a targeting mechanism, which directs the PNC to desired cell types or other targets. However, some surface modifiers may change other PNC attributes, such as tendency for aggregation, which makes each PNC specific for each application. Ultimately, VINCEnT is intended to be a diverse tool for research, drug and vaccine development, gene therapy delivery, and many other applications.
Proper encapsulation of small molecule, nucleic acid, or protein cargos relies on stable and predictable protein-protein and protein-chemical interactions between the PNC and the intended cargo. Of particular relevance to nucleic acid encapsulation, PNCS derived from viruses have naturally evolved to have specific interactions with the viral nucleic acid genome. Though we are NOT using viruses, we are still able to exploit the natural strategies that these systems use for encapsulation.
In total, we have designed nine new parts:
P22 coat protein (PNC)
P22 scaffolding protein fused to Cas9 (CRISPR-associated cargo)
P22 scaffolding protein fused to sfGFP (reporter cargo)
P22 decoration protein, DecS134C (surface modifier for P22 PNC aggregation)
MS2 coat protein (PNC)
Polyarginine cell penetrating peptide (surface modifier)
GFP protein with an anionically charged peptide (cargo modified for MS2)
Arc (full-length) protein (PNC for RNA cargo, specifically)
Minimal Arc Gag (PNC for RNA cargo, specifically)
Figure 1. Schematic of our design. One single coat protein will be modified with a user-specified surface modification and a modification to the desired cargo to ensure it can be encapsulated. These will then assemble to form a full capsid or protein nanocompartment.

OUR INTERLAB OBJECTIVES
The iGEM Interlab 2018 aims to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements that were shown in previous interlab studies which use an optical density (O.D.) as the normalization method of fluorescence. Since O.D. is an approximation of cell number, the interlab this year attempts to address the problem by two orthogonal approaches. Hypothesized that silica beads have similar light scattering properties as the cells due to their similarities in size and shape, one of the approaches is to convert the absorbance of cells to the absorbance of a known concentration of silica beads [1]. Adopting a more direct normalization method, the other approach is to normalize the absorbance of cells by absolute cell counts or colony-forming units (CFU).
Method:
All procedures were performed according to the given iGEM protocol [2], except that the O.D. measurement setting was changed from OD600 to OD595, due to the limited options of plate reader in HKUST.  After further discussion with the iGEM headquarter, we retained the data to be OD595.

DpnII
DpnII comes from Streptococccus Pneumonia.
DpnII recognises the sequence GATC and cleave before G.
Cells of Streptococccus Pneumonia contain either DpnII, or the more well-known DpnI as part of their restriction machinery.  Both recognise the same sequence of GATC. However, DpnII only acts on the unmethylated strand, as opposed to DpnI that only cleaves methylated strands.
The DpnII restriction cassette contains 2 methylases and 1 endonuclease.
TaqI
TaqI comes from the thermophile thermus aquaticus.
TaqI recognises the sequence TCGA and cleaves after T.
Interestingly, the TaqI gene contains 7 TaqI sites, probably important in autoregulation of TaqI expression.
The TaqI restriction cassette contains 1 methylase and 1 endonuclease.

Model
In the modeling parts, we use bioinformatics tools (SignalP 4.1 Server, TMpred program and TMHMM) to assess the ability of Tmp1 and Sec2 to deliver apoptin across the cell membrane and simulate the three-dimensional structure of our proteins. Besides, we have applied two ecological models to study the interspecies relation between tumor cells and somatic cells, as well as the interspecies relation between tumor cells and bifidobacteria. Finally, we have established an ecological model to estimate the population curve of tumor cells and somatic cells when bifidobacteria are introduced into the tissue.
1.Models of signal peptides and protein structures
Prediction of signal peptides:
Through literature searching, we have identified two signal peptides, Tmp1 and Sec2, which might have the potential to facilitate the transmembrane of apoptin, and multiple bioinformatics tools have been applied to assess the ability of Tmp1 and Sec2 to deliver apoptin across the cell membrane (Figure 1).
Figure 1. The amino acid sequence of Tmp1 and Sec2
Model
First, the presences of signal peptides and the location of signal peptide cleavage sites in Tmp1 and Sec2 are analyzed with the SignalP 4.1 Server. According to the analysis, the Tmp1 and Sec2 sequences that we chose are indeed signal peptides, which could deliver proteins across the cell membrane. Moreover, the location of cleavage sites in Tmp1 is between amino acid 26 and 27, and the location of cleavage site in Sec2 is between amino acid 34 and 35 (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Analysis of the presences of signal peptides in Tmp1 and Sec2 with the SignalP 4.1 Server
Tmp1:
Sec:
Model
Next, the membrane-spanning regions and their orientation in Tmp1 and Sec2 were identified with TMpred program. Since the presence of transmembrance helixes is a classical feature of signal peptides, the presence of such structure in Tmp1 and Sec2 should be helpful to deliver apoptin across cell membranes. According to the results from TMpred analysis, Tmp1 and Sec2 both have possible transmembrane helixes"

Most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or tissue-specific pattern. Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site.
Results
After cloning the natural promoters in our screening plasmid pSMB_MEASURE, they were tested in different cell lines with appropriate induction substances. The transfected cells were measured by flow cytometry and TECAN. Thereby, the c-Jun promoter and the CYP1A1 promoter were tested by flow cytometry and the LDL receptor promoter, HSP70 promoter and HMG CoA synthase promoter were measured by TECAN. The CYP1A1 measurement could not be analyzed, due to the low cell number. In Fig. 2, the flow cytometry measurement data of the c-Jun promoter is displayed, which was induced by Epidermal Growth Factor for three hours. The results present an induction of more than 100%. Fig. 3 presents the TECAN results of the both SREBP responsive promoters, LDL receptor and HMG CoA synthase promoter.
Figure 2: Flow cytometry results of the natural promoter c-Jun (Ap-1). HeLa cells were cotransfected with the natural c-Jun promoter coupled to GFP and a reference plasmid including the promoter JeT coupled to mCherry. The relative fluorescence (REU) of GFP, relative to our reference promoter JeT, is measured 3 hours after induction with EGF (diluted 1:2000 in DMEM++). The standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
Figure 3: TECAN results of the natural LDL receptor promoter and HMG CoA synthase promoter. The natural LDL receptor promoter and HMG CoA synthase promoter are coupled to GFP and were cotransfected with a reference plasmid, which includes the standard promoter JeT coupled to mCherry, into HeLa cells. The GFP fluorescence relative to JeT is measured after the induction with Lipo Deficient Serum medium. The error bars represent the standard deviation.
Discussion
The evaluation of the c-Jun natural promoter looks very promising. The flow cytometry measurement should be repeated at least three times, which could not be accomplished in the given time frame. Besides, this measurement could be also analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and"

Phil Leighton is a local vet working for XL Farmcare. We hosted him at the university - his practical knowledge of TB testing in the field was eye-opening for the team and informed the design of our prototype TB test. He also offered us the opportunity to visit a farm and observe TB testing, which we gladly took up.
Richard Sibley is another local vet we have met with on several occasions. He has over 30 years of experience and runs myhealthyherd.co.uk, a tool designed for farmers and vets to help reduce disease among livestock. He provided an insight into the effects of bovine TB on both farmers and vets, and guided the design of our prototype TB test with practical knowledge.
George Eustice - MP for Camborne, Redruth, and Hayle, and appointed Minister of State at DEFRA, met with us in August to discuss the impact and awareness of bovine TB in the UK. We enjoyed meeting him and discussing the Ribonostics project.

And finally, we received help from many sources inside and out of the university and would like to acknowledge all that guided, advised, and generally dealt with us. Many thanks to:
Jonathan Fieldsend is a computer scientist based at the university, he helped on our project by offering advice and guidance on our model. His input was gained through numerous meetings and had vastly shaped how our model looks and works. In the first meeting we had with him we changed the coordinate generation, plotting facility and completely restructured our code into functions. This was all included to speed up and make our code more efficient. In following meetings he offered more specific advice to improve it even further. We now have a model capable of providing a visual simulation and numerical output.
Marian Littlejohn provided feedback and guidance on the graphic design aspect of the project, as well as general advice about our wiki.

Freiburg,2017,Team:Freiburg#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," Rice, which was produced in Freiburg (see text below). At the end of the survey people were asked to evaluate the same criteria again for GMF. We wanted to test, whether people’s acceptance towards genetic modification could be changed when they are faced with a concrete application for GMF. Our hypothesis was, that people tend to show a spontaneous emotional reaction to GMF, while in specific cases they are rather convincible by the potential of genetic modification in agriculture. This would result in positive attitudes towards Golden Rice compared to GMF in general, which would shift responses towards affirmation for genetic modification.
Introduction to Golden Rice
White polished rice is a staple food in many countries of Southeast Asia. It contains less nutrients, e.g. vitamin A, compared to brown unpolished rice. Combined with poverty and under-supply this can lead to life-threatening malnourishment, one of the main causes for high childhood mortality in these countries.
In 2000, rice containing beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, has been developed in Freiburg using genetic engineering. It is promoted for being a way to effectively decrease malnourishment in regions with rice as staple food. Still, it is seen only as one action among others to sustainably counteract under-supply in poor countries.
Introduction to genetically modified food
Genetically modified foods are defined as being produced by genetically modified organisms. Genetic material foreign to the species is inserted and provides the organism with additional qualities or avoids unwanted properties. Culturing genetically modified organisms is highly regulated in Germany but the USA and some European countries are more liberal on this issue.

Hans Jonas
The critical reading of Hans Jonas is part of the traditional approach, which is top-down structured.
The aim of this contribution is to explore the ideas of philosopher Hans Jonas to investigate the responsibilities of scientists, and more specific, synthetic biologists.
Taking Hans Jonas into Synthetic Biology
We developed a new additional approach, which is bottom-up structured. However, the traditional approach is still relevant and important nowadays, for example in politics. By using the work of this well-known philosopher, the traditional approach gets a strong foundation.
In 2008, Boldt and Müller published a commentary in the journal Nature Biotechnology in which they argued that synthetic biology poses several new ethical issues (Boldt & Muller, 2008)."

The Past
Situated in the heart of Western Europe, K.U.Leuven has been a centre of learning for almost six centuries. Founded in 1425 by Pope Martin V , K.U.Leuven bears the double honour of being the oldest existant Catholic university in the world and the oldest university in the Low Countries.
In its early days, our university was modelled on the universities of Paris, Cologne, and Vienna. In a short time, it grew into one of the largest and most renowned universities in Europe. Its academic fame attracted numerous scholars who made valuable contributions to European culture. In the sixteenth century the humanist Desiderius Erasmus lectured here, where he founded the Collegium Trilingue in 1517 for the study of Hebrew, Latin, and Greek - the first of its kind. The tutor of the young emperor Charles V , Adriaan Cardinal Florensz of Utrecht , was a professor here before being elected in 1522 as the last non-Italian Pope before Pope John Paul II . The philologist, legal scholar, and historian Justus Lipsius taught here for many years.
The mathematician Gemma Frisius helped to lay the foundations of modern science and tutored many famous scientists, including the cartographer Gerard Mercator , whose map projection is still in use, the botanist Rembert Dodoens , and the father of modern anatomy, Andreas Vesalius . In a later period, the theses of the Leuven theologian Cornel"

Future work
Although we made several innovative research in our project, there are still many other aspects to develop and optimize in the future. 1. We plan to find out biofilm parts of E.coli and modify several key point to reduce adhesion effect. 2. We need to further adjust ratio of our three-strain system to bring a quicker speed toward maximum. 3. Keeping power generation unchanged, we can reduce the volume of our device so that it will increase current density. 4. Making improvements in Shewanella for more electricity output. We intend to weaken any other unrelated functions except for power production in Shewanella and using co-culture system to produce necessary nutrition for its survival.
Proteolysis system
During the experiment, our MFC in anaerobic condition has been faced with unexpected lower pH harmful to microbe consortia. We aim to construct a more stable and robust MFC system, which will achieve the self-regulating and more sustainable output without excessive manipulation. So we have done some research on the acid-sensing and proteolysis system in bacteria. Based on the research, we attempt to build up “Sensing-Regulating” system. Our research and preliminary are as follows.
1 Sensing system—sensing the fluctuation of key metabolites
Every genus of cell has an optimum range of pH to live and Shewanella along with E. coliis no exception. Previous research has identified that Shewanella can maintain a maximal population density when pH keeps above 6.2 while E. colican survive in 5.6~8.1.[1] As an attempt to develop the superior sensing mechanism, we screen out promoter 170 (P170) and regulatory protein RcfB and introduce them into E. colifor adaption.

2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? No, we do not believe that the BioBrick parts made this year raise any safety issues. Our biobrick parts consist of genes in amino acid synthesis pathways, fluorescent proteins, and the Dsz desulfurization pathway. The amino acid components are easily found in the laboratory and in nature, while fluorescent proteins pose no threat to safety.  Desulfurization pathway enzymes were originally isolated in 1990 and have since been extensively characterized. Their specific activities are not expected to be harmful to researchers, the public or the environment.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?A and B. Does your institution have its own biosafety rules? Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee? Have you discussed your project with them? UBC's biosafety committee has the institutional biosafety rules on their biohazard policies website . They are part of the Risk Management Services at UBC which educates and ensures UBC staff follows safe laboratory procedures at all times. The biosafety committee governs whether or not research can be conducted at UBC. They are composed of UBC faculty, staff, a biosafety advisor and the manager of occupational safety. In order for research to be done, the principle investigator must submit an application that outlines: objectives, methods, procedures, biosafety, what work will be done and where, what materials will be used, and waste management procedures. After this is submitted, the UBC Biosafety Committee will either reject or approve the principle investigator to do his/her work. They are granted Biohazard Approval Certification for 4 years but they must renew their certification annually. We specifically spoke with the safety adviser at UBC. We have the appropriate biosafety approval to do the wet lab portion of our iGEM project in the Life Sciences Centre at UBC. We are working in a lab that already has its principle investigator approved to do similar research and we are not testing new procedures which have not been approved yet.C.

We then continued to support each other through meet-ups and Facebook Messenger group chats, and both teams agreed to inform each other of any funding opportunities that we discovered.
Our major collaboration with Macquarie was hosting a meet-up as part of running our well- attended symposium ‘Challenges for Synthetic Biology in the Australian Innovation Landscape’. We invited Macquarie to present their project for 10 minutes at the beginning of the evening as well, in order to practice their presentation skills, which they did. It also gave both teams an opportunity to get feedback on their presentation, and speak to industry and academic experts for further extension of the human practices requirements. Matthew Kearnes, one of the panellists, gave specific ideas and feedback to both teams about how they might incorporate philosophy and ethics into their human practices. Through our symposium, Macquarie were also able to introduce themselves to one of the panelitst, Hugh Goold, who they later went on to interview for their human practices.
Macquarie have also supported us in the lab, providing us with two of the transformed cell lines for the InterLab study (with BioBrick Parts 2L and 2N) due to technical issues on our end with our transformations. We also offered them help with the modelling of their project.
Towards the end of the competition, Macquarie asked if we could perform Confocal Microscopy for their project. Unfortunately, after looking into the facilities at our university our mentors and supervisors with experience using the equipment advised us that the required training to operate the equipment would take time both teams didn’t have.

Our teams also agreed to collaborate by sharing relevant purification and Tag/Catcher protocols and discussing the use of these Tag/Catcher systems. We also discussed possibly sending our scaffolds to each other, but this was not possible due to the strict Australian biosecurity regime.

--------------------------------------------------
Met with Richard Bennett.  He was quite informative.  He convinced us that it might be easier to find two more shuttle vectors than trying to put multiple parts on the same vector.  He put us in touch with the Laney lab to help acquire a yeast strain (W303?) and also to maybe get two more yeast plasmids.  He suggested that we find a vector with a HIS selection marker, and one more with a positive selection marker such as G418.  Another alternative would be to clone separate constructs into different types of haploid strains (e.g. three constructs in 'a', two in 'alpha') and then mate them to form a diploid strain.  This way, we could use the same shuttle vectors that we already have to build our construct.  Unfortunately, however, this process has the effect of making the ratio between all other endogenous genes in the yeast cell and those on our own device 2:1.  We should still consider this possiblity.  He also indicated that it might be possible to visualize how much protein we have using a Western blot, with antibodies for the mCherry region (which four of our constructs will share).  Then, if possible we separate them out on a gel and determine how much there is from that.
Note that for the yeast transformation we will be following the protocol outlined in this paper: http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v2/n1/pdf/nprot.2007.13.pdf

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

        (2)  Oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, abbreviation OAH, is the target gene segment of these experiments.

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from other i"
SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," Sun yat-set University choose the embryo with 21-trisomy.
Let’s think about another condition and question. Image the couple find that their baby dooms to have small eyes after gene detecting and they regard small eyes ugly. So they choose to modify the embryo’s gene to ensure their baby with big beautiful eyes. When the baby grows up to be a male adult and he thinks his eyes are ugly and starts to complain about his parents editing his gene without his “permission”. And finally, the male adult chooses to prosecute his parents. Well, if you are the judge, what would you do?
In this hypothesis, you may have the same question as me whether what the parents do is to protect or to infringe the unborn baby’s human right if we can edit human gene? Although it seems senseless to discuss such an unrealistic issue now, but sooner or later, with the development of synthetic biology and gene therapy, we must think about how to manage such a controversial issue and help to advance technology instead of being too strict to prevent the research that will make breakthrough in solving the underlying problem of unsolvable human disease such as cancer and genetic disease.
It’s the social development that decide the answer to these question whether its moral or fair to use gene editing and therapy, but not different hypotheses that decide the development of technology. We should remember that technique itself is innocent, whether it is an evil or a virtue depends on the users. [Quote from：Gene therapy: Regulations, ethics and its practicalities in liver disease]
Gene Discrimination and law making
In 2009 Foshan, Guangdong, three examinees were rejected to be admitted as civil servant for the reason that they are the carrier of thalassemia gene, which is a fairly common gene in south China provinces like Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan where the carriers can reach ten percent and above. After that, the three examinees prosecute Foshan human resources and social security bureau, and a verdict from Foshan Chancheng People’s Court declared the three people lose. And during the appeal, Foshan Intermediate People’s Court affirmed the orignal judgment. This case was regarded as the first gene discrimination case in China and raised some questions about genetic privacy and legislative gaps in gene.
According to this case, we can easily find something related to each of us ranging from employment to commerial insurance and from marriage to dignity. For example, if the insurance company get your gene information without your permission and detect that you may suffer from severe breast cancer in the future, and they choose to reject your insurance purchasing, and after"
