Chromoprotein Test: aeBlue and eforRed
The first step in testing our extracellular scaffold is attempting to attach a reporter protein to account for its presence and stability. For this purpose, we are using the chromoproteins submitted by the iGEM Uppsala University 2012 team. We chose the two chromoproteins aeBlue and eforRed (respectively BBa_K864401 and BBa_K592012 on the iGEM registry) and fused them to the dockerin domains from Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome to allow them to bind to the scaffold’s cohesins.
After incubation of the chromoprotein-dockerin fusions and the scaffold-expressing variant of Lactococcus lactis, the cells are washed by several rounds of centrifugation and resuspension so that unbound proteins are washed away. After washing, if the colour associated with the chromoproteins remains in the cell portion, the protein-fusions have successfully attached to the scaffold.
This proof of concept allows us to confirm the expression, secretion, and attachment of the scaffold; as well as the integrity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction under standard conditions.

Successes
Transformed and induced scaffold into L. lactis
Induced, purified and assayed LacZ fused with dockerins
Failure to:
Induce chromoproteins in E. coli (no colour was visible)
Purify SacC and pathway enzymes (assay did not work)
It is possible, that dockerin fusion changes our protein structure and thus caused no colour to appear in chromoproteins and the failure to assay enzymes

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," device can help E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. efficiently take up and retrieve glucose in the environment.
Part No.: BBa_K2230028
Type: Composite Part (device)
Cloning:
Promoter CP29-RBS-aeBlue (BBa_K1033280) was assembled with RBS-STM1128-TT/pSB1C3 (BBa_K2230025)
Function:
A facilitated low-affinity glucose transporter system. Promoter CP29 is a constitutive and strong promoter which works well in both E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. The blue protein encoded by aeBlue gene acts as indicator for the gene expression in the transgenic strain. This device can help E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. efficiently take up and retrieve glucose in the environment.
Experiment and Results
To measure glucose uptake by the engineered E. coli expressing PTS system or Na+/glucose cotransporter, the bacteria were culture in LB broth supplemented with 34μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 37°C overnight. The next day, the bacterial culture was adjusted to OD600 = 3 and exchanged with M9 minimal media with 20mM of glucose for 4 hours or at different time points.
Glucose concentration was analyzed with Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, glucose was phosphorylated (G6P) by hexokinase. Then G6P was further catalyzed by G6PDH and the reduced NAHD was formed from the oxidation of NAD, resulting in increasing in absorbance at 340 nm.
Result
As shown in Fig. 3, the growth of E. coli expressing the PTS reporter (i.e., crr and ptsG genes) was seriously retardant. As I mentioned earlier, the E. coli overexpressing glucose transporter may lose viability because of the toxic metabolites produced in glycolytic pathway. Not surprisingly, the PTS overexpression bacteria was almost unable to absorb glucose.
Fig 3. The cell growth overnight and glucose uptake of E. coli expressing the PTS transporter in 4 hours
Fig. 4 represented that the cell growth of E. coli expressing the Na+/Glucose transporter was comparable and even slightly higher than the control group. The glucose began to be absorbed at the 3rd hour. The glucose uptake efficiency was achieved upto 97% in Na+/Glu group and greater than in control group with 1.2 times difference.

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," above also demonstrates that the pH variation in the culture media of E.coli also fluctuate around 6.
We add the gene of P-asr before the gene of glsa and construct a plasmid with pet28 as the backbone. We then transform it into E.coli DH5α  and test the variation of pH during fermentation. The results is presented by the line graph below and we put it in comparison with the one with empty plasmid and the one with only GlsA. We can observe that the pH is maintaining at around 5.
We put the transformed E.coli in co-culture with the transformed G.xylinus, detected the BC film they produced. The data are as follows.
Control of Population Level
We worry that the if the cell concentration of E.coli is too high, E.coli will compete with G.xylinus for nutrients leading to an negative impact on its growth. Therefore, we introduce Quorum sensing system and autophagy gene φx174E in E.coli.
In order to control population levels , we engineered a synchronized lysis circuit (SLC) using cou- pled positive and negative feedback loops that have previously been used to generate robust oscillatory dynamics. The circuit(BBa_K2267040) consists of a common promoter that drives expression of both its own activator (positive feedback) and a lysis gene (negative feedback).
Specifically, the luxI promoter regulates production of autoinducer (AHL), which binds LuxR and enables it to transcriptionally activate the promoter. Negative feedback arises from cell death that is triggered by a bacteriophage lysis gene (φX174 E) which is also under control of the luxI promoter. AHL can diffuse to neighbouring cells and thus provides an intercellular synchronization mechanism.
Quorum-sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules termed autoinducers whose external concentration increases as a function of increasing cell-population density.
Bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of these autoinducers and alter gene expression, and therefore behavior, in response. Using these signal-response systems, bacteria synchronize particular behaviors on a population-wide scale and thus function as multicellular organisms.
We modify the plux hoping to increase its sensitivity and we choose to conduct point mutation in the region of -10 according to the literature. Down below is the exact mutaion point and we add an indicator gfp after plux. We try to acquire a plux with higher sensitivity via modelling.
The bacterial population dynamics arising from the synchronized lysis circuit can be conceptualized as a slow build"

Fusion protein functionality testing: integration assay
From previous reaction, we saw that we were able to amplify the specific integration product that we expected, which, together with the results of the negative control, confirmed the ability of our fusion protein to perform specific integration. In this experiment, we would like to confirm this further by using a longer target DNA. If specific integration indeed occur, one of the new amplified fragment should also get longer by the same increase. Moreover, more sgRNA were tested to check whether other parts of the target EPO is also accessible. The following will therefore be done:
Incubation time of 1 hour will be implemented
3 different EPO fragments were used. The original EPO cDNA, longer EPO with ""intron"" on the third junction, longer EPO with ""intron"" on the fourth junction
4 different sgRNA was used, targeting junction 1-4
reaction without gRNA, and reaction with Tn5 will be done in parallel as negative controls
The components of the reagents can be found on the protocol. The sequence of the adapter used in this assay is shown on table 1.

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)

Figure 3. A quick test of RNA thermometer A1 constructs in T7 - RNAT – EGFP (Enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter expression cascades. The validity of T7 - RNAT – EGFP was determined by treating the constructs containing strains at 30 celsius degrees and 37 celsius degrees.
Figure 4. This figure contained the raw data XJTLU-CHINA obtained regarding to the performance of promoter - RNAT - EGFP constructs
Figure 5.
As Figure 5 shows, the fluorescence of the sample at 37℃ was 12 times higher than the fluorescence of the sample at 30℃, which means the amount of protein expressed at 37℃ was 12 times bigger than at 30℃.  Hence, it can be said that W1 (J23119+A1) is the best RNAT, which has the most efficient function.
Figure 6
The result of A1 ribothermometer with pBad promoter is showed in Figure 6. As you can see, the result is not optimistic. Except the result of ? dilution ratio, all the fluorescence of the samples at 30℃ is higher than the fluorescence of the samples at 37℃.
The unsatisfactory result of W4 (pBad+A1) may be because of the misleading during the disruption.
Figure 7
Figure 7 shows the result of A1 ribothermometer with T7 promoter. It seems that A1 ribothermometer also worked well with T7 promoter. When IPTG is added as the inducer, the fluorescence of the samples at 37℃ was 6 times higher than the fluorescence of the samples at 30℃. On the contrary, in the absence of IPTG the fluorescence of each sample was really low, which means the amount of protein express is low.
As a result, J23119+A1 and T7+A1 could be used as effective ribothermometers.

Overview
Very often, the risks related to the safety of a genetically modified organism (GEO), except for a possible toxicity or pathogenicity of the organism, correspond to the spread of GEO. Most laws, ""guidelines"" and associations related to the Biosafety agree in trying to prevent the spread of any living modified organism. They suggest a precautionary approach whose main purpose is the protection of the environment and human health. This is clearly stipulated in the Cartagena protocol on Biosafety (international Convention on Biological Diversity): ""The Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential Risks Posed by living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting and from modern biotechnology"". Synthetic biology fits especially into the definition of ""modern biotechnology"". Indeed, biological machines designed in the iGEM competition, and more generally  in synthetic biology, do not exist in nature and can be randomly introduced into existing natural biomass through undesired cross interactions.
This is why the scientific community is unanimous in saying that the ""biosafety mechanisms"" are essential and will ensure the neutralization of the living device created outside the laboratory conditions under which it was generated. Thus, any alleged dissemination would be impossible.
These mechanisms can be of several types, the most famous examples are the suicide genes ( encoding RNAse, DNase ) and/or the establishment of a nutrient dependency, where the selected nutrient does not exist in the external environment.
We reviewed previous iGEM projects over the last decade and found that despite the crucial aspect of biosafety in synthetic biology and iGEM,
especially for projects registered in ""Environment"" and ""Health / Medicine"" track, often no biosafety mechanism is designed, or even considered. This may be due to a lack of time or resources on the part of teams preferring to focus on developing their basic idea by putting safety into the background. This reason is understandable given the complexity of the challenge of Biosafety.
Our solution
In this context, the 2015 iGEM Paris Saclay team decided to focus its project entirely on Biosafety. Our goals were multiple. First, we wanted to provide the iGEM community with a system able to prevent, or at least significantly reduce, the main risk: the spread of GEO. This system would include biological containment with parts that can be integrated in the genome of any Escherichia coli chassis and called Safet"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," and Calgary are significantly expanding the variety of nucleic acid biosensors in the iGEM registry.
In Figure 2, we can see that Calgary's approach of using non-living, in vitro protein components is not typical of biosensors in iGEM. We advocate this approach for two reasons. Firstly, we envision components such as our robust ferritin reporter as being more field stable compared to systems in living cells. Secondly, our system overcomes potential concerns of deploying synthetic bacteria in the broader environment since there are no living components in our sensor.
From Figure 3, we have can see that 5 DNA biosensors were added to the iGEM Parts Registry since 2007. This means that about one half a percent of projects since 2007 were DNA biosensors! Since Paris-Bettencourt and Calgary are launching two novel DNA sensing components, we are significantly expanding the variety of DNA biosensor tools in iGEM. Moreover, each of our respective systems are modular and can be modified to sense most any DNA segment of interest, which means that other teams could use apply these components to a variety of applications.
Future directions
Each of our system's are similar in how they are modular and can be adapted to sense various DNA sequences. We are considering developing Biobricks to implement each system to the other team's respective problem. Such work would serve as an example of how each system can be deployed as a modular, platform technology .

Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels of phospho-CheY.  Receptors in the CCW signaling state deactivate CheA, resulting in low levels of phospho-CheY. Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor signaling complexes in the kinase-on and kinase-off conformations. For example, attractant ligands drive receptors toward the kinase-off state; subsequent addition of methyl groups shift receptors toward the kinase-on state, reestablishing the steady-state (adapted) balance between the two states and restoring random walk movements.
Fig. 6  Chemotaxis pathway. Reactions and components that augment CW rotation are depicted in green; those that augment CCW rotation are depicted in red.
Left: The flagellar motors of E. coli spin CCW by default of Che-Y; the signaling pathway modulates the level of phospho-CheY, the signal for CW rotation.
Right: The cartoons depict receptor ternary complexes in kinase-active (on) and kinase-inactive (off) signaling states.  Changes in chemoeffector occupancy drive the complexes toward one state or the other.  During sensory adaptation, changes in receptor methylation level shift signaling complexes toward the opposing state to restore a balance between CCW and CW signal outputs.  The actual stoichiometry and structure of receptor signaling complexes are not known.  Note that receptor methyl groups are attached to specific glutamic acid (E) residues in the MCP cytoplasmic domain, forming glutamyl methyl esters and neutralizing the negative charge on the glutamyl carboxyl group.  Charge neutralization probably plays an important role in controlling receptor output state.

In order to be able to get a singe primer for amplifying all the different CDS after synthesis, we need to add a tail before the BsaI site that will allow us to create a universal primer.
We call this structure with the NNNNN + the BsaI site 5’ the extremity A (this will make sense later on, we promise).
When adding the extremity A to the sequence take into account that the extremity ends with a start codon, therefore eliminate the one from your CDS to get it in frame.
To the 3’- attach the His-tag and a BsaI recognition site. This will allow us to purify the protein and also fit the part in the Phytobrick.
Once again, take into account the fact that the sequence must be as follows to fit in the Phytobrick. If not designed like this the BsaI recognition site will continue to exist in our sequence after cloning and that could be a problem.
Before the BsaI 3’ recognition site, add a His-tag. Do not forget removing the STOP codon from the CDS to allow for fusion with the His-tag. This two together will create what we call the extremity C (once again, will make sense!).
/>
The extremities A and C will permit us to clone the entire CDS + His-tag in our plasmid. Nonetheless, we might not want to clone the His-tag in the iGEM Phytobricks. In order to clone the CDS without the his-tag we will design some specific primers.
The common primers FW and RV will allow us to amplify all our CDS with the His-tag and directly clone them in our desired vector. They will also allow cloning the entire part in the Phytobricks.
The common primer FW and the CDS-specific RV will allow to clone only the CDS without the His-tag into the Phytobricks, and will also allow to attach a CBD to our proteins.
Example of primers (ignore the sequence of BsaI that has been added to the CDS sequence, it is only there because it is easier to design the primers like that in the software, they will not exist in the synthesised DNA, they will be present as TAILS. Take the STOP codons always into account!

In my spare time I also enjoy boxing as a sport. This would be my first time doing both iGEM, as well as any actual research at all, and I must say I quite enjoyed it this summer! It was a good time getting to know the the team as well as doing the occasional lab help.
Himika Dastidar
Hi my name is Himika and I am a veteran iGEMer, I was on the Calgary team in 2010. This year I decided to rejoin the team. I recently graduated from Biomedical Sciences honours and will be starting a Masters degree in September 2013. In my free time I do martial arts and painting.
Iain George
I just completed my undergraduate degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology at the University of Calgary. Currently, I work in Dr. Howard Ceri and Dr. Ray Turner labs studying how bacterial biofilms can be used to cleanup toxic environments.  My research has focused two species of Pseudomonas that can interact with and possibly degrade naphthenic acids and chlorinated biphenyl while contending with heavy metal conditions. This fall I am beginning a Masters project studying functional genomics in yeast.  This is my first year working with the team and it has given me the great chance to mentor my teammates and learn new skills.  When I am not living in the lab, you'll find me in the amazing mountains and trying my hand at photography.
Jay Wang
I am a third year student in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Calgary.This is my first year in iGEM, but not my first year doing research. I had research experience in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular fields and astrophysics. I am super excited to be part of iGEM because I get the opportunity to explore micro-molecular biology! Unfortunately, I won't be working in wet lab; I will mainly work with the human practice and the business team. In my spare time, I love to volunteer, learn about any fields of science, collecting rocks, stamps, and coins, and watch movies.

Construction of OZ052 and OZ123: Joining the Finger with Homology regions
Previously, we did a PCR to reassemble the ultramers for OZ052 and OZ123, but they only coded strictly for F1/F2/F3 and did not have any overhang homology with any surrounding code.  Thus, we performed PCR to add these homology overhangs so that we can integrate them with the omega subunit as well as the spec backbone to create a final expression plasmid.

MEETUP WITH TEAM KOREA_U_SEOUL
We had a brief, but productive meeting with team Korea_U_Seoul to discuss about what each team aimed to accomplish. We shared different ideas and comments about the progress each team has made.
Collaboration with iGEM BGU team
Representative of BGU: Noa Weiss contacted us first and informed us about the a variety of mutations they were working on. They asked us to exchange data from experimental progress. Their team was also working on plastic degrading enzymes, so both of the teams thought it will be great to feedback each experiments and gain protocols of each experiment. They were working with LC cutinase and Putida.
They used an algorithm that improve enzymes by taking the protein and making mutations. The most stable protein is selected and it suppose to improve the activity.
They thought comparing the wild types of the enzymes could improve the experiments of both teams.  They told us that they are writing a protocol of detecting terephthalic acid, this way they  could see if the degradation of the PET worked.
Terephthalic acid detection protocol Dissolve Terephtalic acid (TA) in water with strong base (Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) in 1:2 concentration ratios.  Prepare a stock solution of 50 mL, 20 mM TA by adding:
   0.166 gr of TA
   2.0 mL of 1M NaOH solution
   48 mL double distilled water (DDW)
Vortex for five minutes until the TA powder is completely dissolved. Titrate the solution with 1M HCl solution to achieve a pH of 7.5.
For a calibration curve:
Prepare 10 mL size batches of different TA concentrations. Dilute the initial TA stock solution with DDW to the following final concentrations:
    -15mM, 10mM, 5mM, 1mM, 0.5mM, 0.1mM, 0.05mM, 0.01mM, 0.005mM, 0.001mM.

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a unique project. So how did they choose to design their project for this year’s competition circuit?
In the first month they began searching for problems and possible solutions as using the previous Eindhoven teams’ work as a guide as well. Through a series of presentations and small group discussions they realized that some of their proposed solutions to those problems were not possible due to lack of information, given the “new-ness” of the problems.
So what did they do?
They used the 2014 Eindhoven project for inspiration; inspired by Eindhoven 2014’s “Click Coli” project they used the previous year’s work as the foundation for a new type of Modular Biosensor! By making this decision early in the summer, they are able to not only come up with a feasible project idea, but also not cut into the bulk of summer time by overly focusing on a project idea.
Some can argue that designing a project at the start of the summer is not a practical idea, however we have seen that it is possible to still come up with a good project design by analysing and building on previous years’ work. At the jamboree we see many new and exciting projects, and while it is important to constantly explore new ideas, we must not forget that we can always improve upon previous years’ work. Whether it is improving the characteristic of a previous bio-brick or using a previous team’s project for inspiration, any improvement is a step forward.
We’ve seen two different approaches to project design from different teams, so how did we ,Team NAIT_Edmonton, design our project?
This year will our first time competing in the iGEM competition and despite looking at previous teams’ work we were having difficulty choosing a project. We started this planning in late spring and with summer quickly approaching, what would we do?
We decided to rely on our mentor Dr. Marcelo Marcet for inspiration for a project.  He provided us with a few ideas, and after reviewing them we decided on one that was both practical and had potential for future applications.
In an interview we had with Dr. Marcet, he had this advice to give; “For a good project design, you need two things, knowledge and experience. Knowledge comes from our education and experience comes from actually experiencing the challenges. By combining these two together we can not only come up with a solution to the problem but also appreciate it.”
As first time iGEM’s this advice resonated with us. By learning from him and gaining experience by practicing synthetic biology, we can apply this thinking to not only the iGEM competition but also"

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," mean curves in 2x IPTG condition
Both the figures 1 and 2 show the growth curves of control and negative cascade. They also show that the readings were taken till the stationary phase of growth (995 mins). Also both negative cascade and control have shown same growth pattern. This is very good for our fluorescence measurements interpretation.
In figure 3 the fluorescence (GFP) measurements of the control is shown. We can see very clearly that IPTG induction has an effect on the increasing change in fluorescence. Also the fluorescence decreases after a period which shows that GFP gets degraded since it has LVA tag and also IPTG has been fully consumed. Also in figure 4 the negative cascade starts to produce fluorescence very late, around 600 minutes.  This shows that Delay device works fine.
Also from the above graphs we found that the GFP is produced in non induced E.coli (K12) cells (both control and negative cascade containing cells) which is supposed to have LacI repressor. We think the reason could be the LacI repressor produced by the cells were not enough to repress the higher number of pLacI in the plasmids. hence to characterize the negative cascade plasmids we used relative mean (mean/mean at time of induction) and constructed the comparison graphs of control and negative cascade samples under the three conditions (No IPTG, 1xIPTG and 2xIPTG) which are shown in figures 5,6 and 7. From the figures it is clear that the change in measurement is statistically more than the change in noise.
Figure 5 shows that the non induced negative cascade sample has a high variability in GFP expression in initial stages, then it steadily increases higher than the control. This same behavior is seen in other 1xIPTG and 2xIPTG conditions. Also interestingly all the Negative Cascade samples starts to produce relatively higher amounts of GFP around 595 to 615th minute which is also possible according to the model developed. This showed there could be a condition when the delay time could reach high values if the cI produced is degraded slowly. Thus the experiment proves that the delay time caused by our transcriptional cascade is around 10 hours (600 min) with high transcriptional leakage of GFP.

Decided to remake EDTA solution as well as Tris-Hcl EDTA solution.
Around 3.72 g EDTA in 100 mL to make a 0.1 M solution.  Then took 1 mL of this and 1 mL of 1M Tris-HCl and added water until a final volume of 100 mL to create 10mM Tris-HCl 1mM EDTA solution.  Autoclaved both.
Also decided to remake YPD plates and media.  250 mL of liquid for each one
25.0024 g YPD broth
5.0015 g Bactoagar
Note that we used a much newer autoclave than the one we usually use.  This still resulted in darkening the mixture, which we discovered is typical of YPD media after it has been autoclaved.
Met with Jeff Laney today.  He provided us with some excellent advice concerning our construction strategy.  In particular, he helped to convince us that the easiest approach for inserting all five constructs into single yeast cells is to utilize two or three separate shuttle vectors to insert different constructs into different haploid yeast strains and then mate the two strains together.  For example, one can insert constructs #1-3 into the first yeast strain using pRS304, pRS305, and pRS306 (select using triple dropout of ura, leu, and trp) and then one can insert constructs #4 and 5 into the second yeast strain with pRS303 and pRS304 (select using double dropout of his and trp).  One would then mate the two strains and plate the resulting cells onto dropout for his and also for either leu or ura, using one selection marker that is unique to each strain.  This would ensure that only cells that had incorporated all inserts would survive, but also only necessitate the usage of four different auxotrophic markers rather than five.  He also generously provided us with two haploid yeast strains, W303_1a (3-9-1) and W303_1alpha (3-9-2), which can be mated together to produce a diploid W303.  W303 is auxotrophic for leu2, trp1, his2, ura3, and (possibly) ade. "

As can be seen from Fig. 3, in the butanol fermentation reaction, the first step is the slowest, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh steps are faster, so the rate-limiting step of the reaction is the reaction of glucose to acetyl-CoA. The enzyme concentration of the reaction was increased by 5% and decreased by 5%. The simulated butanol change curve is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that in the same time, when the enzyme concentration increased by 5%, the butanol production increased by 16.26%; when the enzyme concentration decreased by 5%, the butanol production decreased by 26.03%.

Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to determine the most appropriate parameters to produce the best impact on butanol fermentation.

Summary
In our dry lab, to improve the binding affinity, we have redesigned 3 receptor binding domains:
1.VEGF-scFv
2.KDR Ig domain 3
3.D-Dimer scFv
Also, we have redesigned the DNA sequence of the tTA promoter, to enhance downstream expression.

Methods
Computational macromolecule design
Figure 1. Computational macromolecule design
Aiming at enhancing the binding affinity of the signal molecule and the receptor by sequence redesigning, we should firstly make it clear:
WHAT DO WE HAVE?
To simulate the macromolecule interaction, the structure information is necessary. At best, the crystal structure of the signal-receptor complex is already tested by experiment. That means the interface of those two molecules is known, the interaction of the two molecules can be calculated, and further protein designing will be carried out. If there is only individual structures of the signal molecule and the receptor, we can use RosettaDock to simulate the binding process of the two molecules. If there are only amino acid sequences of those two molecules, we can still predict the structure by large-scale computations. If there is a homologous structure (for example, antibodies), this operation would be easier. Otherwise, modeling only with sequence is still a tough work.
Next step is to design the sequence with the complex structure. If the receptor is an antibody, or have Immunoglobulins as its binding site, we can use RosettaAntibodyDesign, an automatic application that designs antibodies with Monte Carlo method. Another thing we should remember is that before antibody design"

2.Codon Usage
When the sequence contains too many rare codons, which means the number of the homologous tRNA is extremely low in E.coli, the whole sequence can hardly express. In order to avoid the appearance of rare codons, each occurrence of rare codons will lead to penalty.
Selection
In each generation we sort the 200 sequences according to the scores of each single sequence. And we terminate the half of lower scores, the rest of them will have better fitness. Repeat the process of mutation and crossover, the average score of each generation will increase. (See Results.)
We repeat the process for 600 generations.
Simulated Annealing(SA)
-Introduction of Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing is a simple and general algorithm for finding global minima. It operates by simulating the cooling of a (usually fictitious) physical system whose possible energies correspond to the values of the objective function being minimized. The analogy works because physical systems occupy only the states with lowest energy as the temperature is lowered to absolute zero.
-Our Strategy
Mutation
We randomly choose 5 points on the sequence to mutate. To each single point, the process is the same with our computational mutation in genetic algorithm.
Scoring
The same as fitness scoring in genetic algorithm.
Parameters
The initial temperature T is 10000.0, after each generation, the temperature reduces to 99% of the former temperature. If the new generation has higher score, it will be accepted. Otherwise it will be accepted at a probability P(A)

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," use this energy it to break down carbon dioxide as well as molecular nitrogen, and create biologically available carbohydrates and nitrogen. We considered a design for a system that would ensure the cyanobacteria was well supplied and that could feed the products into the mycelium matrix.  The source of the nutrients required for cyanobacteria growth would in part be provided by the martian regolith as well as the atmosphere and would be supplemented with any lacking nutrients by fertilizer brought from earth. The mycelium layer provides the main functionality in the system, providing structural stability, radiation protection and insulation and can be functionalized to provide additional benefits such as water filtration. The mycelium from the species we used in our experiments as well as many others produces edible mushrooms which astronauts could eat. Our design requires some robotic assembly.
In order for our mission to succeed we have made some assumptions which are based on expert advice in the field. Talking to Planetary Geologist Jim Head, we came to the conclusion that a landing site in the Deuteronilus Mensae portion of Mars would be the most suitable. Deuteronilus mensae is near the equator so there is less seasonal temperature flux. It is still far enough from the equator that it can still recieve ice and dust accumulation and currently there is a strong hope that there is a large body of ice water within 10m of the surface in this area according to Head. The region also has a lower elevation and thus thicker atmosphere which will provide more nutrients and protection to our system as well as helping slow down any lander we send to the area.
Radiation Protection
Our group also considered the radiation environment on Mars as well as some possible solutions. Since Mars has little atmosphere nor a magnetic field to protect it from radiation, solar flares, solar ultraviolet radiation and galactic cosmic rays can bombard the surface and could cause serious damage to life forms (Zeitlin et al. 2004). For comparison, the amount of total radiation incident on an astronaut over the course of 180 day transit and 500 days on the martian surface is almost 200 times as much as a person who remained on earth would receive over an equal amount of time (Hassler et al. 2014). This amount of radiation incident is enough to rapidly kill any life form as we know it, and is thought to have sterilized the surface and some of the subsurface of Mars (Dartnell 2011). If humans are ever to live on the surface of Mars, the problem of radiation must be addressed.
While there are many proposed solutions to mitig"

In Vivo Protein Fusion Assembly Using Self Excising Ribozymes
ABSTRACT
Waterloo's 2012 iGEM project is a continuation of the 2011 project, In Vivo Protein Fusion Assembly Using Self Excising Ribozymes. This year our hope is to complete the project with the aim of potentially designing future projects which incorporate this system.
Self-excising ribozymes are RNA sequences with catalytic properties which allow them to remove themselves and the regions which they flank from an RNA sequence. These are introns; however, with ribozyme self-excision the introns are removed without the aid of protein enzymes. In our project we use self-excising ribozymes to remove an extraneous sequence, an intron, which interrupts the coding sequence of GFP. Upon successful removal of the intron, the two halves of GFP should be ligated together and be able to be translated into a fully functional GFP. By showing that functional fusion proteins can be assembled in-vivo using this system we open up possibilities such as the addition of recombination sites to allow gene shuffling, and regulatory sequences which function at the DNA level but that are removed at the RNA level to create functional proteins.

1.0 Abstract
The Group 1 introns are a widely spread group of ribozymes.  Many of them exhibit self-excising activity. These could be used to generate in vivo recombination libraries by incorporating them with a Cre-lox system, which can facilitate chromosomal gene transposition.  Below we outline a proof-of-concept experiment to display the feasibility of this experiment.
2.0 Introduction
2.1 Cre-lox system
The Cre-lox system is an in-vivo recombination system developed from P1 bacteriophage that is perhaps most familiar to students as a method of gene self-excision (1).  The Cre enzyme is a site specific recombinase.  It recognises loxP sites in DNA (34bp), and will either excise, invert or translocate DNA between them (Fig 1).  The Cre enzyme may be designed for expression under specific conditions (eg. IPTG induction), allowing some control over in vivo recombination.  The caveat to using any recombination system"

However, it was unlucky that in depression, most exhibitors did not offer to “invest” in our team although they were interested in iGEM. Fund-raising for the project of iGEM is one of the challenges In future. In Japan, companies are unwilling to invest in undergraduates, on the other hand, in America, the situation is quite different. So we Japan teams will challenge to change the state.
Future
Team UT-Tokyo and other teams in Japan will continue such activities after Jamboree. In addition, we will keep the heat on, in order to help raise the profile of iGEM, synthetic biology and BioBrick and establish the support system for junior members. Then, because only 9 teams participate even this year, we would like to make the system that enable far more teams to join freely.
Furthermore, our much bigger goal is to lead Japanese educational organization, government or companies to establish some support system for young researchers including undergraduate students. A few Japanese universities allow undergraduate students (in spite of 4th-year-students) to research on novel thesis by themselves. Researchers in Japan are likely to educate only juniors of their laboratories, feeling obligated. Our continuous activities would promote developing outstanding researchers, especially young ones, in Japan.
As well, we will participate the following events for the other two months of 2010.
・To make a presentation in Japanese Society for Cell Synthesis Research, that is a conference of synthetic biology led by Prof. Kiga, the instructor of Tokyo-tech team, and so on. (UT-Tokyo, TMU)
・To continue writing up in ‘in-cube’ that is a little magazine for young researchers told in the above. (UT-Tokyo, TMU)
・To give a lecture in Science agora and Leaveanest exposition of experiment demonstration, whose targets are high school and younger students .
Collaboration
We also achieved some projects that collaborated on with teams in Japan. Each team in Japan discusses with other teams regularly and actively, using Skype and Wiki on the Web. These collaborations enabled every team to share information of all teams in Japan and activate one another.
The concrete projects are these following things:
・Submitted a story to a magazine for young researchers (in-cube)
Particularly UT-Tokyo and TMU wrote up the story, but 7 teams in Japan completed it.
・iGEM Summer Meetup in Japan (in Kyoto)
6 teams in Japan met in Kyoto University in order to practice presentation in English.

Then, just as a biologist would pipette, mix, and eject the newly-infused plasmid onto the waiting biological vessel, SynFlo allows the user to place the now colored plasmid cube next to the awaiting E. coli cube and then flip the plasmid cube as if pouring or pipetting into the E. coli.
Deploy modified E.coli
Finally, users can deploy their E. coli to the testing environment by placing the E. coli cube on the Microsoft Surface and flipping the cube. The tabletop application is implemented on the Microsoft Surface SUR40 device using the Microsoft Surface 2.0 SDK. The communication between the Sifteo cubes and the SUR40 is implemented using Client-Server communication between the Surface and Sifteo applications.
Users can then interact with the E. coli by adding tangibles to the surface that represent different environmental toxins; the modified E. Coli sensitive to particular toxins will respond by changing their color. Touching the E. coli results in a color change.

We did a preliminary user study involving observations of 18 high school students who had some exposure to science but were largely unfamiliar with synthetic biology. The students were shown a presentation that explained basic synthetic concepts. After a demo of SynFlo, the users picked up the Sifteo interaction very quickly and found the Sifteo and tabletop interaction especially engaging. They also reflection on the connection between SynFlo and the synethic biology concepts discussed.

Future Work
Include more protocols from the E. chromi experiment like ice-shocking (where introducing ice into our E. coli cube would slow down its movement) and the heat bath
Add affordance by making cubes look like actual tools in the lab, e.g. petri dishes, flasks, test tubes, etc.
Add more modes of interaction for the E. coli, specifically enabling manipulation of E. coli by objects placed on the surface (where, if a user placed their arm on the Surface, the E. coli would bounce of that arm)
Evaluate the effectiveness of SynFlo in informal science learning settings

Such a mentality became true in the second half of the 20th century when the personal computer began to become a commercially viable commodity [7], and effectively anyone could start writing their own programs and developing hardware and software.. Certainly there are certain parallels to be drawn with regards to the open source nature of the software, but in terms of the hardware, and the potential for any real scientific discoveries to be made in the garage of an amateur hobbyist, the comparisons are much more strained. The level of understanding required and the scale of equipment needed to perform the necessary experiments will always be beyond the means of the average person. In fact in can be said with some confidence that the majority of “Biohackers” are university-educated. A recent survey of the DIYBio community found around a third of those conducting DIYBio were employed in Biotechnology, with almost all of the participants having a university education [8]. It should therefore be apparent that Synthetic Biology will never develop into the democratised structure seen in modern Computing. Rather it will continue to be performed by a relatively small community with sufficient expertise and interest. One of the respondents, when asked about the link between DIYBio and Synthetic Biology quoted “I'm sick of hearing about synthetic biology since this is not an area DIYers are likely to make a lot of progress progress in (not should they be allowed to in most cases)”.
A Monopoly over life?
In May 2010, a paper published entitled “Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome” changed the future of science. The authors designed and synthesised an artificial genome which was then placed in a bacterial cell which was subsequently controlled only by the implanted chromosome. Whether or not the paper describes the creation of “artificial life” or not is a moot point. The grounding is there and one man is on the brink of having absolute control over its future direction. J. Craig Venter is the leading figure in Synthetic Biology. It was at the J. Craig Venter Institute that the first artificial genome was created, and it is J. Craig Venter who intends to patent his “invention” and pave the way for future applications in the biochemical industry. Venter’s company Synthetic Genomics established in 2009 a $600 million collaboration with ExxonMobil in a venture whose ultimate outcome is the development of an algae biofuels for commercial use [9]. Were Venter to be successful in gaining his patents, the techniques and practices required to actively develop Synthetic Biology would be closed to all but those under the operation of Venter and his mass academic"

Learning about synthetic biology
To raise awareness about synthetic biology as well as promote iGEM as a competition, various lectures were held by our Uppsala team for students and professors at Uppsala university. Two of the lectures were scheduled for biotechnology students but was open for other students as well. A third lecture was held for professors at the university. During the hour-long lectures synthetic biology as a field of science was presented. Important aspects such as the potential of synthetic biology were discussed. It is followed by a explanation about iGEM as a competition and the history of the Uppsala team. The lecture also serves as a way to inspire students to join the iGEM community.
Newspapers
Despite being a rather big issue, the fact that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) cause cancer is not very well known to the general public. When ingested, PAHs can cause different stomach cancers and when inhaled it can cause lung cancer of different degrees . According to our survey the majority of the participants are aware of the benefits synthetic biology can contribute with and 53% even have a positive opinion about usages outside of the laboratory. We thought this was a perfect time to contact news papers with our newly acquired information.
iGEM Uppsala wanted to raise an awareness of PAHs and also promote the benefits with synthetic biology as a solution. We contacted different news papers and were published in the following:

This year we wanted to continue adding videos to the Uppsala iGEM youtube channel to hopefully spread the interest in synthetic biology in an easy and fun way. Youtube is a great tool to reach a bigger crowd and for people who do not know about this specific field of science, videos can be the perfect introduction. Of course we also hope to be able to further advertise our team and our project with the launching of the videos. This summer we have made one video about our project and how a summer in the lab can turn out. For all ambitious students competing in the iGEM competition we have"

Later, during a presentation at the Delft Health Initiative, CRISPR experts challenged our approach because of the on and off target effects of dxCas9, but praised our idea for its versatility and thereby its probably functionality.
Prof. Chirlmin Joo and Viktoria Globyte advised us on this functionality of our fusion protein in its early stages, providing us with a confident start of the wet lab fusion protein production.
“Cas9 scanning and kicking off from non-target DNA is faster than transposase cutting.”
Multiplexing and Barcoding
Professor Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pointed at the enrichment of our sample. This prompted us to focus on an extensive sample preparation. On top of this, prof. Bayley said that multiplexing and accompanying barcoding would be a big advantage, which we then set out to implement, improving upon an existing iGEM barcoding tool .
“ADOPE’s ingenious approach to foreign gene detection pushes the frontiers of forensic analysis. ”
Prescreen
Olivier de Hon, principal scientist at the Dutch Doping Authority, gave us highly valuable insights into the requirements that the doping authorities set for a detection method. A conversation with him resulted in our focus on the nanoparticle based prescreening method.
“The initial costs are not very important in doping detection development. What does matter is that we should be able to efficiently upscale the detection.”
Minimizing out of Competition Testing
As became apparent from the interviews with Moniek Nijhuis and Cameron Brodie , out of competition testing can be highly privacy invasive in the sense that athletes always need to keep track of where they go. Therefore, we found it important to assess how to reduce testing time and optimally schedule possible testing points to have least impact on the athletes every-day life. To determine the optimal detection point for gene doping, we developed a model of the human body response to EPO gene doping, incorporating the blood cell development in the bone marrow based a suggestion by the Dutch National blood bank Sanquin.
Furthermore, Prof. Paul Dimeo from Stirling University prompted us to focus on athlete behavior, to think with them and thereby be a step ahead. We focussed on different administration methods for gene doping (intravenous and intramuscular) and on the effects of microdosing EPO gene doping. In this way we determined that our method could best be included in out of competition testing. See our model .

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html," It has two advantages in observing: 1) Fold 3.5 to 4 times faster than regular GFP; 2) Yield up to four times more total Fluorescence than regular GFP.
The greater the fluorescence strength is, the shorter exposure time will be needed, thus can decrease the photobleaching (GFP will be eventually destroyed by the light exposure that tries to stimulate it into fluorescing) that will lead into lapses in data processing.
Besides, we also want to make a comparison between two different GFPs' performances in our oscillatory circuit. For example, peaks, troughs and periods in oscillatory curves. The following picture shows the difference between GFP and sfGFP both on colE1 backbone.(Fig. 2-4)

Three Plasmids in circuit construction
So we designed three plasmids to function as the three important parts in the oscillation circuit, and all of them are in the charge of the same quorum sensing promoter to make sure that all target genes share the same oscillatory period (Table 2-1).

Sensing Plasmid
The second half of our project revolved around an assembly that sensed the production of L-DOPA.
In our sensing assembly, we employed the transcriptional factor pp2551, a member of the lysr family of transcriptional factors,
Our sensing construct consisted of two primary transcriptional units: one with the pp2551 coding gene and one with the Venus fluorescent protein coding gene. We constructed this assembly using golden gate, gibson, and traditional cloning techniques.
We had some trouble cloning our sensing assembly, and as a result, we transitioned from using golden gate assembly methods to gibson assembly methods to traditional cloning techniques. Initially, we attempted to clone our assembly using gol

Introduction
Chemo-Repellent
Bacterial Concentration
Conclusions
Introduction
The goal of this model is to describe the processes inside the Flash Lab system:
- Change in the concentration of chemo-repellent.
- Change in the concentration of bacteria.
This model is based on the Keller – Segal equation of chemotaxis (1) in               a one dimensional problem (Thin channel).
It is important to notice that this model can show the overall behavior and not exact               values. The final system is supposed to detect a variety of materials in many different               solvents, each of them has its own diffusion properties. Also, some aspects such               as working conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) might change in widespread commercial               use and affect the results. Taking those into account, further fitting will be necessary.

Chemo-Repellent Concentration
Model
The basic assumptions of the model for the chemo-repellent are:
-There are no forces except for diffusion:
- Chemo-repellent concentration in the sample is relatively low and does not cause osmotic pressure.
- The changes in pressure due to loading the sample is negligible.
- No other significant external forces (for example, moving the chip while using).
- The bacteria do not consume the chemo-repellent and its concentration does not change with time. In contrast, in case of a chemo-attractant this assumption is not valid.
- Expect to detect small proteins and molecules (the ligands). The diffusion coefficient for such materials is about 10-9 [m2/s].
- Because of the geometric properties of the channel and the expected diffusion coefficient, this is approximately a semi-infinite one dimensional problem.
- Initial condition: no chemo-repellent is present in the chip at time zero (a).
- Boundary condition"

8th July 2009
Today we mainly discussed the plan that we had for the coming couple of months. We had an overall plan on when we will be doing what, and then each of the groups presented their own sub-part and what they were going to do. For the delay device, there were 4 different approaches that could be taken, and actually 2 of them were deemed useless to use, which already narrows down the options. Regarding the self-destructive plasmid, there was a design for it, but there are still some things to work out. Finally, for the conjugation, it seems that there is a pretty good idea of how it should be done.

Oh glorious day! Oh marvellous day! We finally decided the topic we will do, and this time we are certain this is the topic: self-destructive plasmid (the title is still in the working). We also established a complete research question and a division of the work. By next meeting, we decided to come up with an overview for each of the three parts we will be doing.

Dear Diary, today we had a pleasant field trip to Groningen, which is at the North of The Netherlands (we're in the centre, so it took about 2 hours to get there). We met there the iGEM team from Groningen, which were quite a nice bunch. We had a chance to present our own ideas for a project, and they presented theirs. After seeing their labs, and how organised they were in terms in of dividing the tasks between all of them, we decided to start pushing the project forward, and by the end of the next meeting to decide on the project idea and how we are going to divide the work between us. We also had much time to talk on the way back from Groningen, when we also decided to be more united as a team, for example by doing some activities together (e.g. playing soccer, paint-balling, and so forth).

Tec-Chihuahua,2017,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," effects have a short duration lacking long-term effectiveness(Adama México, 2016). Bayer, one of the major companies in the market, comes with its product SERENADE® MAX, a biological fungicide, natural product based on Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713, formulated as a wettable powder, for the control of diseases caused by fungi or bacteria in crops. This fungicide works better as a preventive use. It can be used in the presence of the disease but only if combined with antibiotics or other chemicals. Do not apply SERENADE® MAX when raining, against wind or during periods of strong wind. It is phytotoxic in some crops and should not be mixed with other fungicides(Bayer T., 2017). Some of these products work better than others, but lack of something else, the main objective of our product is to become the best biocontrol product in the market, fulfilling all the needs and being environmentally friendly with a long-term effectiveness that many agricultors want.
Pathway to commercialization
Erwinions is growing fast thanks to the prestigious entrepreneurship program, nationally recognized in Mexico, implemented by Nova Orión High Impact Business Incubator to identify the best way to commercialize our product seeking to solve those problems that afflict the fruit growers(Tecnológico de Monterrey, 2015). Once we have obtained our genetically modified bacteria, through which we will ensure the inhibition of its virulence factors, we will carry out the industrial process that will help us to obtain a commercial product. To achieve this, it is necessary a start-up capital or investment to lost funds. For this reason, the team went to different companies that desperately seek a solution to this disease, such as ""La Norteñita,"" which would invest to make our prototype a complete success and ready to be released. The marketing strategy for the launch of the final product will be based on selling volume to this company, which has 2,600 ha (Labs, S., 2017).  Once the other fruit growers notice that a company with such high prestige buys our product, everyone else will do it too. During the development of the project, Erwinions has generated a network within the fruit community and the biotechnology industry in its early stages, obtaining high amplitude in the agricultural market. The revenue stream model will be the percentage of profit for each product sold.

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," Germany dominated iGEM: 3 out of the 6 finalists came from the country. In Undergrad, the winner and 1st runner up were teams from German universities. There are many factors to which the success of Germany can be attributed. With 3 universities in the world top 100 according to QS, it is second only to Switzerland to non-English speaking countries with a strong presence in the rankings. Producing the 5nd highest number of citable publications, it is ranked 2nd to publication cites and enjoys the 2nd highest H index, it is a major player in the scientific community. It comes as no surprise that it attracts a large number of international students that seek to be educated in one of its institutions. Additionally, it is ranked 13th in the EF English Proficiency Index, with classification ‘High Proficiency’. Also, before the dawn of English in the 20th century, German held the status of lingua academica and a lot of core scientific knowledge is accessible to its speakers. All these facts combined make a strong case for well-rounded teams, that do not only come from a strong scientific background, but can also can effectively communicate their projects.
Japan versus the Netherlands
Japan and the Netherlands are two countries with a long history in the competition. Starting in 2007 and 2008 respectively, both have been consistently represented since. Japan has 5 universities in the top 100 (QS 2014) compared to the 6 in the Netherlands (QS, 2014). Japan is the 3rd country in the world in citable publications output, while the Netherlands is ranked 12th . The gap closed when we look into Cites rankings, where Japan ranks 4th and the Netherlands ranks 9th. Finally, in terms of H index, the countries are closely comparable with Japan placed 5th and the Netherlands 6th (SJR 2014).
Even though the academic performance of these countries in science/engineering generally, as well as Biotechnology specifically, is similar, their performance in iGEM is not. Japan has averaged 8 teams in the competition every year, while the Netherlands have had only 4, yet Japan has never been a finalist in the competition, while Netherlands has had a winner already (2012) and has been a finalist twice on top of this. It is perhaps a contributing factor that the Netherlands are ranked 3rd in the EF English Proficiency index, while Japan falls 26th out of 60 (EF English Proficiency Index 2014).

Prof. Dr. Gerhard Braus
Professor of Microbiology and Genetics
Dr. Gerhard Braus (1957) studied biology at the University of Freiburg. He earned a PhD degree (1987) and the habilitation (1992) at the ETH Zürich. He was appointed as Assoc. Professor of Biochemistry at University of Erlangen in 1993 and full Professor of Microbiology& Genetics in Göttingen in 1996. Additional periods included the Biocenter in Basel, the University of Georgia in Athens GA, and the BMS Institute of Functional Genomics, Princeton NJ. Braus' laboratory focuses on genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of eukaryotic microorganisms. The interplay between development (adhesion, filament formation, tissue formation) and secondary metabolism (acting as benign or toxic bioactive molecules) is analysed. A second line of research examines the impact of fungal pathogens on human health and agriculture.
Dr. rer. nat. Christoph Sasse
Postdoc
Dr. Christoph Sasse studied biology at the University of Göttingen. After he finished his diploma thesis (2004) in the department of Molecular Microbiology and Genetics of Prof. Braus, he worked as a scientific assistant in this department till 2008. Then he continued  with postdoc at the University of Würzburg at the IMIB, working on the topic of drug resistance and white opaque switching in C. albicans. Since 2012 he is a postdoc at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Genetics of Prof. Braus, working on the topic of drug resistance and stress response in A. fumigatus.

UConn,2018,Team:UConn#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," He loves computers, phones, cameras, and so much more - except printers; they are the bane of his existence. He also enjoys watching horror films, especially late at night. When he's not busy working on our awesome Wiki site, he can be found playing Farming Simulator, meticulously tending to his crops. Malik is a spicy guy, who puts hot sauce on almost anything, and likes to cover his pizza in crushed red peppers. To him, the spice of life is spice itself.
Shannon Doyle
Year: Graduated
Major: Molecular and Cell Biology
For assistance with deciding on an ice cream flavor, please consult Shannon. UConn’s famous Dairy Bar has taught her all the essential skills from how to sneak samples throughout her shift to how to keep ice cream frozen overnight. Although destined to be a Texas cowgirl, Shannon currently keeps the companionship of a sweet German Shepherd instead of a horse. In addition to iGEM, Shannon enjoys discussing the Bachelorette and cajun seasoning (but not on ice cream).
Liz Chamiec-Case
Year: Sophomore
Major: Physiology and Neurobiology
iGEM Position: Wiki Chair
This earthy crunchy, manual Honda Fit-driving, vegan member of UConn iGEM contributes to iGEM by dropping anything that she picks up (what a flubaroo!). She speaks in a sound-based language composed of grunts, extended consonant sounds, and squeaks. Did you know that, in Liz, “uh-uh” means serological pipettor? Fascinating. The quickest way to her heart is to put a squirrel on her shoulder, or squirrels in her bed, or just reference squirrels at all. She’s probably too busy laughing at the bad joke someone made to hear that squirrel reference though. Just watch out for her spinning keys, which have a ferocious bite.

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

Molecular Machines
The term “molecular machine” refers to a system that is able to perform mechanical movement on a nanoscopic scale by application of an external stimulus. In order to do so, such systems only consist of a small number of molecules. Depending on the nature of the used molecules, possible stimuli can be electrical energy (redox changes), electromagnetic energy (light) or chemical energy (change of pH value or addition of specific ions).                 Being an exceptionally novel field of science, starting in the mid 1980’s and just being rewarded with the Nobel prize of chemistry in 2016, the current applications of molecular machines are still rather few. However, a multitude of possible applications are being explored by the minute. Many mechanical devices can be mimicked, including rotors, oscillators, gears, paddle wheels, turnstiles, brakes, ratchets and gyroscopes.[1] One example of a more sophisticated system is a molecular motor[2] that can perform a 360° rotation by subsequent application of light and temperature, as can be seen in Figure 1. In another research group, four similar rotary systems have been combined on a larger molecule in order to create a four-wheeled nano-car that was able to move over a surface upon irradiation.[3]
In this project, azo dyes are used as molecular machines. Upon irradiation, the -N=N- azo group changes from a trans configuration to a cis configuration. As a consequence, the distance between the substituents R is shortened, resulting in a muscle-like contraction. The working principle of azo dyes as molecular machines can be seen in Figure 2.

We miniprepped pC13Z, pC13F, ‘’PpkiA’’, and ‘’TxlnD’’. ‘’PpkiA’’ and ‘’TxlnD’’ were submitted for sequencing to verify Wageningen had sent the correct parts. For some reason, the pC13BF cultures did not grow so we decided to give them another day to grow before miniprepping and sequencing (to confirm the success of the ligation). Finally, on carotenoids we miniprepped pAK13CS, pAK13AA, pC13DT, as well as ‘’PT7’’ and ‘’rbs’’ with ‘’crtEB’’, and ‘’PT7’’ with ‘’crtBI’’. After quantification, a PCR with extended an annealing time was run to confirm the sequence.
Sequencing results of Psal were inconclusive and will be resubmitted.  On carotenoids, we miniprepped the components from yesterday and ran a PCR for confirmation.

The heating pad which was ordered arrived, but integrating it with the arduino circuit did not seem to be a realistic goal within the time frame before competition.  Instead, multiple resistors were connected to the circuit, and it was found that a greater power supply was needed, along with more resistors of lower resistance.  Transistors, resistors, and breadboard adapter plugs were ordered.

Since even growth of the wild type BL21-AI cells appeared uninhibited by antifungals, the characterization attempt for pC13BC and pC13BV was inconclusive, likely due to some combination of antifungals having gone bad or to too much growth prior to addition of antifungals. We set up PCRs of inserts from pC13AT, pC13AU, pC13AV, pC13AY, pC13CC, and pC13CE constructs to append HindIII and KpnI cut sites using new primers. The plan is to transfer the inserts into pAg13H and pAh13EA vectors. Next, we digested pAg13H and the successful PCRs of pC13AT, pC13AU, and ‘’pC13AV’’ with HindIII and K"
Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#TheSwitchDesignedTALregulators_-_-_TEXT.html," bacterial plant pathogen transcription factors that bind to DNA by recognizing a specific DNA sequence in which each base pair binds to a single tandem repeat in the TAL DNA-binding domain (Figure 1A). A tandem TAL repeat contains 33 to 35 amino acids, where the 12th and the 13th amino acid, called a “repeat variable diresidue” (RVD), are responsible for specific interactions with the corresponding base pair (Scholze and Boch, 2011). As evident from the crystal structure of TAL effectors (Mak et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2012; Figure 1B), all TAL repeats have almost identical conformations, differing only in the RVDs. This modularity of TAL effector binding domains therefore makes them a perfect tool to target specific DNA sequences.
Figure 1.The structure of TAL effectors. (A) Schematic representation of TAL effector structure and its DNA-binding domain (red), containing multiple 34 aminoacid tandem repeats with RVDs at the 12th and 13th residue (Scholze and Boch, 2011). (B) 3D structure of a TAL effector.
Figure 2.Models of 3D structures of TAL DNA-binding domains fused with the KRAB repression domain (A) and VP16 activation domain (B).
TAL effectors have mostly been used as a tool for plant or mammalian genome editing. The basic idea is the same as with zinc finger nucleases, with TALs replacing zinc fingers as the specific DNA-binding domain (Miller et al., 2010). Several groups (Miller et al., 2011; Zhang et al, 2011; Garg et al., 2012; Cong et al., 2012) have also designed TAL effectors for specific gene activation, by fusing them with either the Herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain or its tetrameric derivative VP64 (Figure 2). After we already initiated the iGEM 2012 project, TAL repressors were reported by Garg et al., and Cong et al.,who created TAL effectors fused with the KRAB or SID transcriptional repression domain.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the medium is interesting for production optimization. We plan on testing the effect of the following parameters on Curdlan production:
❃ Different mediums (minimal and complete)
❃ Different stationary phase temperature: by reducing the temperature we might be able to reduce growth and obtain more Curdlan
❃ Glucose shot during stationary phase at different times
❃ Lowering pH in stationary phase to reduce cell division
Using Yeast:
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Yeast cell walls are naturally made up of various layers which are represented in the following diagram. First there is a layer of chitin, then a layer of β-glucans and finally a mixed layer of proteins and mannan. Commonly, the yeast cell wall is made of 5-10% of (1→6)-β-glucans and 50-55% of a mix of (1→3)-β-glucans and (1→3)-β-glucans.
Figure 3: Schematic representation of the yeast's cell wall
Since the layer of mannan and proteins as well as chitin is insoluble in alkali solutions, beta glucans are easily separated from the rest of the yeast cell wall. Therefore, the only alkali soluble components are a mix of (1→6)-β-glucans(1→3)-β-D-glucans. (aimanianda et al 2009) In order to separate the two compounds,  we plan on using (1→6)-β-glucanases in order to obtain a solution of (1→3)-β-glucans and therefore our Curdlan molecule.
We therefore decided to over-express the Curdlan metabolic pathway by inserting into yeast (INVSC1 strain ) an inducible promoter (Gal1) for the β-glucan synthase gene (Fks1)  hoping that this would allow the cell to produce Curdlan in greater quantities. This would allow us to compare our Curdlan production in E. coli to the natural production in an organism and the enhanced production through the addition of a promoter.
To do this , we will extract the FKS1 gene from yeast DNA by amplifying the genomic DNA by PCR. We will then insert FKS1pYES2 plasmid with the Gal1 inductive promoter to then integrate the modified plasmid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and boost the production of Curdlan. This strategy did not work. We then tried to put a inductive promoter ahead of the relevant gene by homologous recombination. We put"

Mercury Bioremediation
0 0
To design a system for biological remediation of not only mercury ions in contaminated waters, but also the more toxic form, methyl mercury, we’ve selected to use 5 genes of the mercury resistance (mer) operon of which over 10 genes have been identified and characterized in various strains of mercury resistant bacteria in the environment. This construct was assembled from the mer operon in Serratia marscecens in the plasmid pDU1358, and is designed to contain an upstream regulatory gene merR, two transport proteins merP (periplasmic) and merT (transmembrane), a gene encoding mercuric reductase MerA, and finally a gene encoding organomercurial lyase MerB. This system is regulated by a bidirectional promoter so that merR on one side of the operon is constitutively expressed and allows for the repression of the mer operon in the absence of mercury ions, and the downstream activation and transcription of merT, P, A, B when mercury ions are in close proximity.  MerT and MerP were selected as transporters for their high turnover rates to bring in mercury ions, which are subsequently bound by MerA to catalyze their conversion into volatile mercury eventually captured within a carbon filter in our device and disposed of sustainably. The organic and more toxic form, methylmercury, can diffuse into the cytosol of the bacteria where MerB catalyzes its conversion into mercury ions, which are then bound to MerA and converted into less toxic, volatile elemental mercury in an NADP dependent reaction. The system is very tightly regulated and allows for continuous turnover within our bacterial chassis as the mercury ions are volatalized and then captured externally rather than sequestered within our bacteria which would eventually lead to cell death and the requirement to replace the cells. Due to the NADP requirement of MerA, the cells are required to stay alive throughout this process,"

Then load Lane 2 to 14
Finally load Lane 15 with the lamba DNA ladder
Set the voltage to 120 and run the gel electrophoresis
After 5mins, drop the voltage to 90V.
Because the DNA is negatively charged, this voltage moved the DNAs on the gel towards the positive side. We then looked at the DNAs on the gel by ultraviolet light.
Results
The photographs above show the DNA forming bands within the lanes of the agarose gel.
Next Stage
Mathew innoculating LB broth with the two desired cultures; culture 2 containing the GFP BioBrick and culture 3 containing the RFP BioBrick
It was decided that larger plasmid preps should be carried out on cultures 2 and 3 (containing GFP and RFP respectively). The E.coli cells from these cultures were taken from premade agar plates containing all ten cultures and used to innoculate 50ml of LB each. The E.coli within the LB were then grown overnight.
Lab session: 15th July
Experiment Recap
Two agar plates containing the 10 original cultures of transformed E.coli. Today's procedure will see the cultures in divisions labelled '2' and '3' cultured for a large plasmid prep
In the previous experiment, we had carried out DNA gel electrophoresis on six plasmids from our transformed E.coli cells - the six plasmids were each divided into two sets with the first set of six being treated with EcoRI alone and the second set being treated with EcoRI and PstI:
First set - treated with EcoRI
Culture 2 (GFP) - Lane 3
Culture 3 (RFP) - Lane 4
Culture 4 (RFP) - Lane 5
Culture 5 (RFP) - Lane 6
Culture 6 (RFP) - Lane 7
Culture 7 (RFP) - Lane 8
Second set - treated with EcoRI and PstI
Culture 2 (GFP) - Lane 9
Culture 3 (RFP) - Lane 10
Culture 4 (RFP) - Lane 11
Culture 5 (RFP) - Lane 12
Culture 6 (RFP) - Lane 13
Culture 7 (RFP) - Lane 14

According to the different layer accurately sampling, the samples blood count determine different height body effusion layer cell number so as to reflect the situation of gas vesicle expression. The results were best visible with and cell density of OD600=2.382 in Liquid surface. And we find that in the test tube, in addition to liquid layer surface and bottom cell is dense in the rest of the liquid layer densities and roughly the same and surface bacteria volume density difference of an order of magnitude. From the control group of counting the results to the distribution of cells with normal cells in the test tube, the distribution so can also explain the experimental results is due to gas vesicle expression in cells. We also do each liquid layer absorbance inspection results and cell number experimental results high similarity from the side proved the correctness of blood count experiment.

We in the cultivation of the cells into logarithmic phase after transferring them to test tube, quiet place and culture 36 hours after using Trace stratified take liquid apparatus at the same time to each liquid layer for sampling. Then each layer of fluid samples of blood count the number of cells with statistics. Results show that gas vesicle due to the existence of the cell concentration in the test tube surface layer of fluid, and control group due to the action of gravity that most cells sedimentation in the test tube bottom.

Through experiment data f and significant t test. We draw conclusion that in the experimental group and control group on the surface of the liquid layer cell count there exist significant differences this difference is due to the experimental group cells express gas vesicle.
Besides detecting OD/600, we use blood counting method to get cell number in different water-courses. With the help of MATLAB analysis，we can get fitting function of cell number in different water-courses.

Coming from a background which is a mix of haute couture fashion , science, and business the linking thread in my work is a passion for understanding how things can be made, new materials and techniques in future and exploring what new applications will emerge.   I set up a bespoke leather label which pushes the boundaries of accessory evolution.  This gave me the time to study with coding, 3d design programs and 3d printing.  I have focussed on material structure development and the evolution of materials and material manufacture which has led me into areas of synthetic biology and the effect of the substructure on surface potential.

3) Photosynthesis
We human beings are heterotrophs, and it has long been a dream to make energy ourselves through photosynthesis. In recent years, some studies have been carried out in which genetically modified cyanobacteria are co-cultured with human cardiomyocytes to build a complete heart. These co-cultures aim to supply sufficient oxygen from cyanobacteria to all human cells, even when forming a three-dimensional structure [2].
In other words, if we could co-exist with photosynthetic bacteria, we could obtain energy by ourselves as well as constructing organs in three dimensions. In addition, if livestock animals and photosynthetic bacteria could co-exist,  the feed cost could be reduced drastically.
However, in the above scheme, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is inevitable, and the human cells are damaged by ROS. If photosynthetic bacteria co-exist in animals that originally do not possess photosynthetic functions, a mechanism to suppress photosynthesis is necessary. Therefore, by incorporating the co-culture system we established to the above scheme, it is expected that overgrowth and photosynthesis of photosynthetic bacteria and generation of ROS can be suppressed.

""Open Campus"" of TMU
In Japan, “Open Campus” means the college’s open day for high school students (usually in July or August). At this event, we exhibited posters and explained what is iGEM, gene recombination technology and our project to high school students. (The result shows, high school students tend to receive gene recombination technology “friendly”.) Some of them were enthusiastic about iGEM activity.
Science education for children
As a teacher, we participated in special “science-class” which was held by Leave a Nest, a company promoting biology education. In this class, elementary school students and junior high school students did experiments selected for science education for children (i.e. easy to understand and fun).
We charged ourselves with giving a lecture on synthetic biology and prepared for an easy experiment, through which children can understand everything, including DNA, is made of atoms and molecules. After that, we gave brief explanation of synthetic biology.    Official site is here (only Japanese page).
Opening meetings with other groups
There are many other groups beside our iGEM group, for example, “Formula Racing Team”, “Converted EV”. We have opened meetings regularly to exchange ideas with these teams. These meetings are good opportunities to explain iGEM and our teams to students from other fields (mechanical, electrical engineering, for instance).
2011 JAPAN Meetup
We participated Japan meetup three times, in Tokyo University, Kyoto University, and Tokyo Metroporitan University that we hosted. The details is here . We exchanged our own views and deepened our own visions. It is dependable that we could extend our knowledge and utilize each project.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"Enzyme kinetics can be entered into the Reaction Editor by double clicking on the small orange circle representing a reaction. First choose a Kinetic Law, then enter the kinetic values simbiology asks for. Simbiology will then use the Kinetic Law and kinetic values to produce a reaction rate.
The standard units for Vmax are micromol product/minute/milligram enzyme, however, Simbiology initially asks for Vmax in terms of micromole/minute. To the best of our knowledge the easiest way to include enzyme amount as a factor in your model is by manually changing the units of Vmax to micromole/minute/micromole by clicking on the unit drop down menu and selecting “Create new unit” (Vmax must be represented in units of micromole/minute/micromole because of dimensional analysis constraints in Matlab, but keep in mind that you will most likely enter enzyme amount as a mass value). After changing Vmax units, you must change the ReactionRate by multiplying the given formula by the name of your enzyme. At any point in the creation of your model, you may double click on the species representing your enzyme and enter an amount value (leave the enzyme amount in terms of micromole).
This stage of creating our Simbiology model presented a subtle, yet extremely significant stumbling block to our progress. The drop down menu for units allows one to select different prefixes for units. Unfortunately, it seems as though these prefixes were not properly integrated into the software, and Simbiology will not perform the necessary dimensional analyses to convert between micro and milli, for example. Therefore, it is crucial that all your analogous units employ identical units. For example, our modeling team decided to work exclusively with a “micro” prefix for concentration and molarity units. 56 nanomoles became 0.056 micromoles and 300 millimolarity became 300,000 micromolarity.
This leads us to an important piece of advice: do not implicitly trust everything the program claims to do. Our modeling team discovered this discrepancy in the Simbiology software by running models in parallel with certain hand done calculations. When our model did not remotely resemble our paper and pencil calculations, we knew there was an error in the way Simbiology handled units. We recommend that in addition to creating your desired model, you create a control model where the outcome is known, or perform hand-written calculations to check certain parts of your model.
From this point on, Simbiology runs fairly smoothly, so we’ll leave it to you to figure out the rest. Best of luck!
After we created the basic architecture for our"
TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," The ‘escaped’ microplastics are taken up by organisms living in rivers, lakes and the oceans, but also by human beings through the food chain. To date, no scalable approaches have been found to solve this problem.
Luckily, the iGEM team of Berlin is proposing a solution to this problem; a molecular filtering machine. Their proposed filters consist of a surface made of cellulose to which bacterial flagella will be immobilized. The attachment required for this will be achieved via a cellulose binding domain. The single flagella-subunits, also known as flagellin, will be interlinked with plastic-degrading enzymes. Thus, this system enables an increased specific surface with high catalytic activity.
We believe that combining our projects would open up even more opportunities. With our nanowires, we provide a stable structure to the bacteria used for the filtering machine. With our 3D printer, layers of bacteria can be formed in a predesigned way. Another advantage of this technique is that the enzymes produced by the bacteria can covalently bind to the nanowires (Botyanszki, Tay et al. 2015). In this case, the scaffold of cellulose is not required anymore. Moreover, the printer and nanowires generate a highly flexible machine, since any cell type and any enzyme could potentially be used. One of the requirements posed by Berlin’s team is that the filter is highly flexible in use, so that it can
iGEM Amsterdam
The iGEM team of Amsterdam is creating a self-sustaining bio-factory of cyanobacteria and chemotrophs. The cyanobacteria produce sugars and oxygen from CO2 , water and light; known as photosynthesis. In their prototype consortium the sugars are used as a carbon source for, E.coli, which uses it to create a desired end-product. In their proof-of-concept bio-factory this product will be isobutanol, a potential biofuel. That being said, their cyanobacterial carbon fixation module can be coupled to a multitude of biotechnological production processes to make these processes more sustainable.
The TU Delft iGEM team designed constructs that give bacteria the ability to form nanowires between each other, creating an extracellular matrix which forms a structure, and form a biofilm. In the project of Amsterdam, the E.coli and cyanobacteria will form the biofilms. The E.coli bacteria are producing the nanowires. The cyanobacteria will be trapped by these nanowires in such a way that specific structures of both E.coli and cyan"

Experimental Design
Choice of Technology
The main objective of our experimental project has been to develop a new method for quantifying promoter activities. We chose to do this by measuring the RNA concentration at steady state growth and by calculating the RNA formation rate. Thus, much of our work has concerned proof-of-concept of this new measuring method.
We decided to work with a new and promising technology: The Spinach aptamer. This RNA sequence is upon folding able to bind a fluorophore in a unique complex. The Spinach RNA sequence used in our project is a derivative of a Spinach aptamer developed at Cornell University by Paige et al . The Spinach RNA can bind and activate the fluorophore DFHBI as seen in Figure 1. Neither the unbound fluorophore nor the Spinach RNA fluoresces significantly on their own, but the complex of the two is highly fluorescent emitting a green fluorescence (505 nm).
Traditionally promoter activities have been measured either by measuring the concentration of a reporter protein, e.g. a fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), or by RNA quantification with quantitative PCR. The Spinach technology combines the best of both worlds:
Spinach concentration can be measured with an easy fluorescence assay using GFP filters
Promoter activity is measured directly on RNA instead of by proxy of a protein. This means that translation efficiency, a potential source of variation, can be disregarded.
The polymerase is in the process of transcription of the Spinach DNA sequence surrounded by the tRNA scaffold for increased stability. The black arrow indicates the promoter of which the activity is about to be determined.
Internal interactions within each Spinach molecule take place and eventually the correctly folded structure occur thus allowing the later formation of a fluorophore complex. This process is an equilibrium where about 50 to 60 percent of Spinach is in the proper folded state.

Safety
Our lab, an extension of the Lynch lab, follows the BSL-1 guidelines described as suitable for work involving well-characterized agents that are not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans. The guidelines include washing hands before leaving the laboratory, and careful management of needles and other sharps. Decontamination is strictly followed through autoclaving of solid trash, bleaching of cell waste solutions, and separately disposing of special waste, such as chloramphenicol. In terms of safety equipment, gloves are worn at all times and changed when contaminated. More details on the guidelines can be found at the CDC page and the Duke Safety page .
Safety Training
We received training on general laboratory safety, including personal protective equipment, proper handling of biological and hazardous waste, proper handling of sharps, use of fume hoods, and emergency procedures. We were also trained on general chemical safety, including identification and labeling of hazards, proper storage and use of common chemicals, regulations regarding more hazardous substances, waste disposal procedures, and basic first aid and emergency procedures. In addition, we also learned about fire and life safety, including emergency preparedness and policies.
This training was through various forms of online and in-person training, required by Duke, depending on the safety levels and hazards you are expected to face. For our purposes, we are required to complete online courses for General Laboratory Safety, General Chemical Safety, and Fire/Life Safety. These courses include online modules and a post-course quiz. A description of required training and the training policy is provided at the Duke Safety page .
In addition to these wet lab safety trainings, our members were also certified through the Duke Internal Review Board via the CITI Program to conduct a survey on human subjects. This training included topics such as: .

Afterwards, the activities drop to the initial levels (t=2h). The deviations of luminescence values (Lumi/OD600) in the beginning of the curves are an experimental artifact due to the small OD600 values. One clone of J23107 and J23114 showed significantly lower promoter activities. Therefore, additional clones need to be measured. In comparison to all the other evaluated Bacillus promoters, the Anderson promoters showed a rather low acitivity in B. subtilis.
β-galactosidase assays
To evaluate the activity not only with the lux reporter, four promoters of the Anderson collection were cloned into the reporter vector pSBBs1C-lacZ
to perform β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 2). The results were then compared to the data of the luminescence measurements.
Fig. 2: β-galactosidase assay (up) and growth curve (down) of the Anderson promoters J23100, J23102, J23103, J23106 in B. subtilis. Results derive from one experiment and are only shown for one Bacillus clone.
Verification of the promoter activity by β-galactosidase assays revealed that the Anderson promoters do not seem to be as weak as measured by luminescence (Fig. 1). For a direct comparison, we need to include a constitutive promoter, e.g. PliaG, and repeat the same experiment. But we think the luminescence measurements are more reliable, because they were repeated three times with two independent clones.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Sense_-_-_TEXT.html," However, a separate stream of research has identified another potential use for ethylene-oxidising bacteria – in regulating and monitoring fruit ripening.
As the key hormone responsible for the ripening of most fruits, ethylene levels need to be monitored at every step of the fruit packaging process, and there is a promising market for a cheap, portable and convenient ethylene sensor . Hence, we turned to Mycobacterium NBB4 , the best characterised ethylene-oxidising bacterium, with the aim of designing a cell-based biosensor for ethylene.
In Mycobacterium NBB4 , the enzymes required for ethylene metabolism are contained within an operon organised in two bidirectional gene clusters. One gene cluster encodes the catabolic enzymes required to convert ethylene into acetyl-CoA, the final product of the degradation pathway which is subsequently directed to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The other gene cluster encodes the enzymes responsible for synthesising coenzyme M, a cofactor required for the function of the second enzyme in the metabolic pathway.
While the enzymes required for ethylene metabolism have been investigated in detail (Coleman et al. 2011), the regulatory determinants of ethylene metabolism have yet to be characterised. Studies examining the expression of ethylene-oxidising genes in Mycobacterium NBB4 when grown on different substrates have demonstrated that these genes are only expressed when the strain is exposed to ethylene (Figure 1; Coleman et al. 2011). This suggests that these genes are under the control of an inducible, rather than constitutive, promoter.
Figure 1. SDS-PAGE gel showing induction of Mycobacterium NBB4 ethylene-oxidising genes when grown on ethene (adapted from Li, C. 2006). Lysates from cells grown on ethanol were used as a control. The bands labelled 1 to 3 correspond to enzymes required for ethylene degradation. Band 1 is EtnC, band 2 is epoxyalkane:coenzyme M transferase and band 3 is EtnA.
A promising candidate for regulation of this operon are two genes present in the gene clusters, designated EtnR1 and EtnR2 (Figure 2). We suspect that together, EtnR1 and EtnR2 represent a two-component regulatory system responsible for activating gene expression from the putative promoter EtnP upon exposure to ethylene. Such a two-component system is common in bacteria, involving a histidine protein kinase that phosphorylates another regulatory protein when it"

One of our goals this year, was to include some BioBricks into our flexosome, therefore optimising or combining their functions. As a starting point we decided to use the colourful reporters that Uppsala made in 2011.
We used their BioBricks amilCP , eforRed and cjBlue and fused these to different dockerin domains, which would bind to our construct. In the end, we managed to combine the new BioBrick for BCEL_Dockerin and eforRed from the Uppsala Team, to create a Biobrick ( BBa_K1865001 ), which can be used in conjunction with our flexosome."
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

d[cGMP]/dt = VsGC,maxD2- VPDE,max[cGMP]/(Km,PDE+[cGMP])
Inside,VsGC,max represents cGMP's maximum production rate when D2=1, which means all avaliable enzyme molecules participated in catalysis.VPDE,max is cGMP's maximum hydrolyzation rate.VsGC,maxis directly proportional to sGC's total concentration[D0], and D0 is constant in our model. Consequently, cGMP's production rate and degradation rate are:
Vp=VsGC,maxD2
and
Michaelis constant Km,PDE is measured in experiment by Turko et al. Recent studies show, during the process of hydrolyzation the basic level of PDE5A's bioactivation is relatively low. However, after cGMP combining NH2-end structure regulation by itself, this bioactivation is greatly improved(up to 9-11 times). Through cGMP, PDE5A's activated process can be discribed as PDEinact + cGMP↔ PDEact. Therefore, active PDE5A's concentration depends on the level of cGMP which because VPDE,max is directly proportional to active PDE5A's total concentration in Michaelis kinetics. Meanwhile, we suggest that active PDE5A's concentration is nearly proportional to cGMP's concentration. It's a reasonable approximation, if active PDE5A's level is relatively high, cGMP's level is relatively high accordingly. Thus, we consider cGMP's maximum hydrolyzation VPDE,max is directly proportional to [cGMP]:
