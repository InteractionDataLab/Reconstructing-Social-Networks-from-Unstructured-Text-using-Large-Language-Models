Protocols Used: Miniprep, Sequencing
Results: chrB (opt) showed HindIII restriction sites and was hence cleaved into partial inserts.
Next Steps: Use alternative cloning protocol for chrB and chrB (opt).
Week Beginning 20/07/2015
Summary
During this week an alternative cloning strategy for chrB and chrB (opt) was employed. Furthermore, the pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp - construct was cloned in a stepwise fashion.
20/07: Went back to the original plate of pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp for visualising colonies that do or do not express GFP.
Aim of experiment: To compare colonies on the patch plate of pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp by differentially visualising colonies that do or do not express GFP under UV light. The background of this experiment was that if there is one colony that has both inserts in the correct orientation with respect to each other, then there is perhaps one that also has them with the correct orientation with respect to the plasmid. Colonies identified as expressing GFP were patch plated and grown in liquid cultures over night in order to confirm the sequence of the insert.
Protocols Used: Patch-plating, overnight cultures
Results: Figure 15 pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp in E. coli JM110.
Next Steps: Sequence confirmation of newly selected colonies.

At the same time, HP has several process ongoing, the first short movie is about to playing out. Several people discuss about how to yield the biggest effect on that and how to motivate everyone to watch. Anyway, the transcript of the movie is great, all is about the sex determination process. BTW, the movie is actually one part of the whole series, the goal of which is to propaganda the knowledge related to biology, especially the synthetic biology. Fabullous painting, creative transcripts and effects, believe they will be very popular!
2013/3/23
The registration fee has been successfully wire transferred to the IGEM HQ, Then we are allowed by law~(sounds like get married, but it was totally 18 people, oh my goodness….)
But on the other side, the time is quite limited, it has already been the end of March, but the experiments hasn’t been carried out, the idea is incomplete, the other parts like human practice still need further developed. And the most essential thing, the judging criteria must been changed this year. So bad… what can we do?
2013/3/25
Another important motivation meeting after the beginning of this new semester. Several changes within the team now com out. Firstly, team has been divided into several small groups, experiment, model, wiki, poster&design, transaction. The team leader is in order to be Xiaochen&Jinyang, Binbin, Tianfang, maomao, Xiao bro~ And we promised every meeting every group leader should report their progress as well as the plan for next week. I admit that all about the changes is to lazy myself = =..Also, the other changes come to the design of the experiment, worry about the achievement of the new project, we do the experiments for both of the two project, though it might waste a lot of resources, just in case we cannot done everything.
2013/3/31
Yuning Wang reported the process about human practice: the transcript for the first part of the series, the sex determination has been translated into English, and are ready to be “action”! Good~
Binbin has designed the model for the first project, looks very dedicate and complex, but scientific and considerated.
About the experiments, plasmid has been transformed into E.coli. but the strange thing is every time the colonies filled in the plate and cannot pick up the single colonies, The antibiotic chloromycetin might be the one to blame. Next time when meet the plasmid with anti-chloro, be careful!

Expression of T1R2-T1R3
T1R2-T1R3 synthesis
Fig.1 The synthesis and expression of T1R2-T1R3
To synthesis human sweet receptor gene T1R2-T1R3, we firstly got its sequence from NCBI and used Snap Gene to optimize the sequence. Then we synthesized the target gene by using OLIGO (oligo design software).
To begin with, we designed 45 pairs of primers for each sweet receptor and each primer had a 15bp overlap region at each end. We divided the primers into 3 groups named block A, B and C, and mixed the primers of each group respectively with a final concentration of 10μM. We got 6 ideal fragments successfully after PCR and purification.
Fig.2 Oligo assembly. Overlap-Extension PCR.
protein tags
To verify whether the heterodimer had been expressed and located at the proper position successfully, we set different color proteins as tags to each sweet taste receptor. We chose blue, yellow and green fluorescent tags separately. For the primer design, we added another 20bp of N-terminal of each sweet taste receptor as the overlap region. The fluorescent tags were linked to each sweet taste receptor by OE-PCR.
Another way for verification was to add different epitope tags to each sweet taste receptor.
Fig.3 Human sweet receptor T1R2-T1R3 heterologous expression
Fig.4 Fused Myc & His tag separately at the N-terminal of the target protein
However, according to the protein expression process, adding color proteins on the N-terminal of the target protein may not provide enough time for color protein to fold at its functional state before being secreted. So we plan to use His tag along with antibody detection.
T1R2-T1R3 expression
In order to express the human receptor T1R2-T1R3, we chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2-1C as the host and pESC-Leu as the shuttle vector. We selected two restriction sites, BamHI and Sal"

Codes
We have calculated SIP words for each team and each year since 2007 using SIP.C (see the code menu for more information), for each them we have took the top sip valued words. We use TOP_SIP.C to make that, this software see what is the hight SIP value and then take N words with this hight SIP. When we got our words, we put in a software , to display them with graphical effect : words with hight frequencies has a big font, and words with low frequencies has a small font.
Just to give you a glimpse of what our software can do and how it can characterise a project, here is some examples we made on last years' winners and on the Paris 2007 team. The aim of all this is to try to extract the main ideas or key terms of a given wiki.

This is the analysis for team Paris 2007 .We have selected 60 words and filtered out all words like ""p1"", ""f23"". People name and miss-spelling words are removed to have a better display.
Just to let judge by yourself, here is the abstract of the 2007 Paris team :
""The aim of our project is to engineer the first synthetic multicellular bacterium, the SMB. This new organism is a novel tool for the engineering of complex biological systems. It consists in two interdependent cell lines. The first, dedicated to reproduction is the germ line (red cells in the simulation below). It is able to differentiate into the second line: the soma (green cells), which is sterile and dedicated to support the germ line. The germ line is auxotroph for DAP (diaminopimelate) which is provided by the soma. There is thus an interdependency relationship. The soma, being sterile, requires the germ line for its generation, while the germ line needs the soma to complement its auxotrophy. We provide here both experimental and computational evidences that this system can work, as well as the almost complete construction of the SMB.""

darwin
Results
We produced software which implemented the algorithms described in our novel approach on specially cleaned input files and ran them through a typical version control system. We performed experimentation on transformations between iterations 3-6 of our wetware team's yeast plasmids. As a control, we compared darwin's output running through the git version control system to simple processing with git (vanilla_git). We expected darwin to run faster and show fewer changed lines in the diff output than vanilla_git.
As expected, darwin's preprocessing produced a significantly faster diff, with an average speed of 5.763 seconds per file, as opposed to 10.640 seconds for the vanilla_git. However, against our assumptions, that performance did not seem to rely upon the reduction of changed lines reported by git, since darwin actually produced more changed lines. More research is required to find the correlation between the number of changed lines reported by git and the number of lines actually changed in the file.
Future Work
Future work mostly revolves around bringing darwin from a standalone diff-producing executable to an integrated system with a GUI usable by novices. The major challenge with that is parsing the plethora of different file types used to represent DNA although the implementation of other formats such as SBOL, ApE, etc., could be done easily by extracting the actual genetic sequence from the file.
In addition, the current algorithms are unable to deal with introns of any sort in the input DNA sequence, and will attempt to split the file into ORFs regardless. The ability to correctly identify non-coding regions like this would create a far more valuable piece of software, able to deal with prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike.

DcmR at the bidirectional promoter - A new tool for molecular biologists
Figure 3(PJ404-PdcmA-sfGFP or Pj404-PdcmA-sfGFP with or without POXON-2 (DcmR)) OD(600nm) growth curve for all transformed bacteria investigated. The effect of DcmR is measured on the relative stoichiometry of activation of PdcmA/PdcmR. This is shows in the bar charts for stationary phase and for exponential phase. The cut of for exponential phase was set at 600 minutes.
We can see from these results that at both growth stages the relative expression is weighted towards PdcmR. An interesting result is that in the presence of DcmR this ratio is reduced such that expression through PdcmR is relatively increased while expression through PdcmA is relatively decreased. This result is observed as a decrease in the PdcmA/PdcmR expression ratio. From our results this appears more statistically relevant in stationary phase. The cut off for exponential/stationary phase was set at 600 minutes as seen in the above graph.
Through analysing this new bidirectional promoter we have discovered a new tool for molecular biologists. Our new intergenic region is able to modulate different stoichiometries between genes inserted either side of it in response to the presence or absence of DcmR (available in our BioBrick BBa_K1446003). The relative stoichiometry (PdcmA/PdcmR activation) of ~0.9 being reduced to ~0.3 upon DcmR addition.

ComR/ComS Approach
BactaSun
Overview
Still with the aim of creating a rapid UV-response system, we elaborated a second approach based on a regulation pathway, the ComR and ComS system, originally found in Streptococcus thermophilius. Our goal is to produce a UV inducible promoter.
ComR and ComS mechanism
The ComR and ComS system controls natural competence and allows quorum sensing in S. thermophilius.  In molecular biology, natural competence is a genetically specified ability of a bacteria to integrate “naked” extracellular DNA from its environment under natural conditions (no pre-treated cells). This specific feature observed by some bacteria is an interesting and convenient tool in bioengineering because it allows to modify the host genome without needing to perform any transformation.
The quorum sensing (QS) is a set of regulatory mechanisms of synchronization of the expression of particular genes within a bacterial population and according to its local density. ComS is a small peptide encoded in the genome. After synthesis, it is matured and extruded from the cell into the medium. The peptide’s import allows other cells to sense the signal. When a threshold level is reached it will trigger the competent state in the whole population.  Indeed, once reimported in the cell ComS will be able to bind the ComR protein. This will allow the formation of a ternary complex (peptide-protein-DNA) with a specific DNA motif (ComR-box) and trigger the downstream gene’s expression (See schema here below).
Our little trick
ComS mature sequence is LPYFAGCL. An aromatic substitution by an alanine would block the binding to ComR. Hence our objective is to synthetize this peptide while replacing the tyrosine by an ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr). This should indeed prevent the binding unless there is some UV exposure and the ONB, or photocage, is released. This will result in the induction by exposure of the gene expression controlled by the ComR box."

Here, we want to thank our advisor Lorenz Adlung, who helped us with his great experience he shared in frequent lab-meeting discussions.
Indigoidine-Tag
The indigoidine-tag subproject was about developing an easily detectable, inert and universal tag for NRPs. The work on the module-chains comprising fusion peptides from the tyrocidine cluster were performed by Joshua Sachs, Philipp Walch, Tania Christiansen and Anja Riedel. Philipp Walch and Joshua Sachs performed the valine-indigoidine as well as the di- and tripeptide-indigoidine tagging; Anja Riedel took care of the linker variation. Joshua Sachs and Philipp Walch generated the ccdB-construct. Without the devotion of all of the people mentioned above, the project would not have been feasible. Philipp Walch performed the biobricking of the submitted parts.
We want to thank Dominik Niopek and Hannah Meyer for their expertise when writing the RFC100.
Tag Optimization
Ralf Beer, Konrad Herbst and Nikolaos Ignatiadis designed strategies for the optimization of the indigoidine-Tag, which includes the creation of 58 engineered indigoidine synthetases and the development of a quantitative time-resolved indigoidine assay. These hard-working fellows did not mind spending 48 hours in a row at the bench, generating and testing large plasmid libraries and performing hundreds of co-transformations, thereby establishing the RFC99. Meanwhile, Konrad proved that one can write a script for almost any purpose. He contributed most to the analysis of the indigoidine assay, the progress of the tag optimization strategy and the RFC99. Nikos was involved in the design of the first constructs and was a big help in the creation of the synthetic T-domains. Ralf focussed on plasmid and primer design as well as the labwork and was actually considered to be integrated into the NRPSDesigner as an alternative sequence-based domain prediction tool. But not only these three guys were infected by the blue fever - thanks to Hannah Meyer they always had an advisor at their side to engage in more and sometimes less scientific discussions.

Summary
VEGF（vascular endothelial growth factor）is a kind of ligand commonly used in research. It has various functions like increasing vascular permeability and promoting extracellular matrix degeneration. Using BBa_K2886007 , you can express and purify VEGF-165 which is most commonly used subtype of VEGF easily and construct receptors ( BBa_K2886002 or BBa_K2886003 ) that could recognize VEGF-165 efficiently. BBa_K2886001 is TEV protease functioning as inner-membrane domain that can recognize specific peptide sequence and cut it and then release transcription factors as a result for instance. BBa_K2886000 is transmembrane linker combining the outer-membrane domain and inner-membrane domain together to become a whole.
With this part collection and appropriate transcription factor, you could construct your own STEP system to recognize almost anything soluble you want（like VEGF as we do）and start the downstream reactions.

Demonstrate the L7Ae-C/Dbox conjugation inside OMVs
Our OMVs module is designed for siRNA delivery and then for cancer treatment. To demonstrate the conjugation of the L7Ae-C/Dbox inside OMVs, we linked ST/SC part with the box part (BBa_K2623027, see Figure 9) to form our total circuit (BBa_K2623032).
Figure 9. Genetic circuit of the Box part (BBa_K2623027).
The box part can code siRNA target for Kras in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with a C/Dbox RNA structure to bind with L7Ae.
Under the induction of arabinose at a 0.2% final concentration, we isolated the OMVs according to our protocols and then stained the OMVs isolates with SYTOTM RNASelectTM (selectively stain for RNA) at 10 μM (Figure 10). The stained isolates were analyzed by HSFCM (Figure 11).
Figure 10. a) Schematic illustration of our total circuit.
b) The spectrogram of SYTOTM RNASelectTM [1].
Figure 11. HSFCM analysis of OMVs stained with SYTOTM RNASelectTM.
Figure 11 are bivariate dot-plots of green fluorescence versus side scattering (SSC) for our OMVs isolates. E. coli BL21 transfected with BBa_K2623029 and BBa_K2623032 respectively were cultured in 100 mL OMVs-free LB culture for about 5 hours to get a OD600 at 0.6-0.8, in which BBa_K2623029 was set as negative control. Then Arabinose was added to a final concentration at 0.2% and after incubation for another 2 hours, IPTG was added to a final concentration at 0.5 mM and then nurtured the bacteria overnight. OMVs were isolated according to our protocols and stained with SYTOTM RNASelectTM. The stain OMVs were analyzed by HSFCM. As we expected, OMVs isolated from BBa_K2623032 could secret more OMVs containing with RNA stained positively by SYTOTM RNASelectTM (Figure 11b) than BBa_K2623029, indicating that our L7Ae and C/Dbox could fulfill their function. It’s a pity that we didn’t have cell culture experiment to test our siOMVs to silence Kras in"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation"

Week 4: June 17 - June 21
Monday, 6/17: After the big presentation to BU last Friday, Heather and I met up today ready to dive into the next stage of the design process. In the morning, we refreshed ourselves with everything that was said on Friday including suggestions, advice, and general comments. Afterwards, we met with Orit, who told us that today was a day of decisions. We were stuck between the glowing tree experiment and the time capsule idea, but in the end, we felt more excited about the latter and thus our project was chosen! The rest of the day was spent with power storyboarding – really mapping out the exact process, environment, and layout of how we envisioned our project unfolding. However, towards the end of the day, we were reminded that regionals were taking place in Canada! – there wasn’t really any way we could bring all the surfaces we had planned on using all the way to Toronto. Thus, we had to reconsider our plan to adapt to this problem of portability, which is what we spent the rest of the evening considering.
Initial website mockup screenshot.
Tuesday, 6/18: Because of the portability issue, Heather and I were forced to reevaluate how we envisioned our project, and thus wanted to meet with Orit to discuss this new facet. In the end, however, we were told that this was our decision, and that Orit would be fine with either or. After some further clarification with Consuelo and some advice from Diana, Heather and I decided to go with one core layout, but three different behaviors depending on which method people choose to interact with (ie: web application with simple mouse interaction; surface with touch sensors; projection from web application – mainly for the demo).  After coming to a decision, it was time to move onto the implementation. Heather started working on mockups, and I started researching the twitter API.
Wednesday, 6/19: Today, I spent the bulk of my working hours coding up the Twitter portion of our project. Since I had worked with APIs before in my web mashups course last semester, I was quite fortunate in that I had at least some experience working with APIs, if not the Twitter API specifically. After reading through their search API page, I had the base url figured out and the parameters that I wanted to use as well. From there, I was able to code up an initial draft that I am hoping to test tomorrow.

University of St Andrews 2010 iGEM Team
Welcome to the the University of St Andrews iGEM 2010 Team Website. We are the first University of St Andrews iGEM Team. Our work is mainly based on Quorum Sensing and trying to investigate possible applications in Synthetic Biology.
Comprised of 9 undergraduate students and guided by 5 advisors , our team stems from a variety of different scientific fields: Medicine, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science and Physics.
Cholera is a bacterial disease that infects approximately 5 million people worldwide each year, approximately 100,000 of which are fatal. Symptoms of an acute cholera infection including diarrhoea and severe dehydration that can kill within hours if left untreated.
Provision of safe water is critical to preventing cholera outbreaks however in many cases this is not feasible, particularly in areas recently hit by natural disaster. Our project involves investigating the basic science behind a potential means of preventing the disease through the application of synthetic biology. Lately Cholera outbreaks occurred in Pakistan and Haiti. In Haiti around 3500 confirmed causes have been reported news in spanish and news in english . Read more about our project .
We would like to thank our sponsors : multiple faculties of the University of St Andrews, biotech companies, etc., whose generosity has made this all possible.
Part of our project is also to help other iGEM teams (both current and future) by fine-tunning the control over protein expression by designing new ribosome binding sites.  We collaborated in iGEM 2010 with multiple teams in multiple contexts (wiki development ( Delft team), human practices data collection, exhange of DNA ( Sheffield team)...).
In order to complete our project several biobricks must be constructed. Through use of standard protocols and procedures we plan to construct a bistable switch based on the Lux quorum sensing system and a CAI-1 sender using the cqsa gene from Vibrio cholerae. Follow our progress in the laboratory.

Public Awareness Campaign
Biology Festival of Sun Yat-Sen University
We were invited to Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)to attend the Biology Festival . We caught this wonderful opportunity to promote the knowledge about synthetic biology and our iGEM project. When we arrived at the place, our poster and scientific games about synthetic biology attracted many students come to learn about our project. In this event, we also communicated with SYSU iGEM teams.
The Bauhinia Festival of Science(2017/2018)
The Bauhinia Festival of Science, and Technology is one of the biggest festival in our university, which attracts over 10,000 citizens in Guangzhou city gather together in SCAU to enjoy the beautiful flowers of bauhinia and new research in our university. We took advantage of this opportunity to introduce to the visitors about our CUPID projecta and synthetic biology. We showed the bacteria and cyanobacteria under microscope, had pleasant discussions with the public about transgnic food and genetic modification, gave out beautiful postcards desiged by our ream about iGEM and our project and made a survey to the public to investigate their attitudes towards desertification and genetic modification. Through this promotion, more and more people of different ages have learned about iGEM and have a deeper understanding of synthetic biology.
In 2017 we promoted iGEM and explained synthetic biology at our booth. We have designed some small games, such as building blocks to symbolize biobrick, to help ordinary people understand iGEM.
In 2018, we designed posters to illustrate our projects, iGEM and synthetic biology. At our booth, we also designed a desert puzzle game to explain the status quo of desertification. In addition, we also distributed over 300 questionnaires on “Public Cognition Survey on Desertification and Our Projects” to the public.
(The results and analysis of these questionnaires can be found on our Human Practices-Silver page)
Science Festival of SCAU Affiliated Primary School
The affiliated primary school of South China Agricultural University hold a annuallyscience festival , and we also took this opportunity to contact and communicate with primary school students. We came to the playground and set up our booth to introduce our project. After the opening ceremony, the students began to visit the booth."

In addition to research, Yale iGEM explored diverse questions beyond the bench, including industry applications of AMPs in shipping and the interface between research and entrepreneurship. We also engaged high school students in a classroom discussion on the history and importance of AMPs.
Exploring the Potential Impact of AMPs in the Shipping Industry
Over the summer, Yale iGEM member Cathy Ren interviewed Mr. James S.C. Tai, Technical Director and General Manager of Fleet Management Department, Orion Overseas Container Line Limited (OOCL). We asked about the importance of biofouling in the shipping industry and the possible application of our antimicrobial coating.
CR: What is biofouling and why does it matter to OOCL?
JT: Marine paint has always been focused on protecting against water damage, which is called anti-corrosive, but more recently has moved more towards anti-fouling.
Biofouling can be caused by both micro- and macro-organisms. Microorganisms like bacterial slime can adhere to ships' hulls, while the macro-organisms include barnacles and algae. Barnacles in particular can be extremely corrosive. They release a type of acid that will eat through the paint and even the metal, embedding themselves deep in the hulls so that even scraping them off may not be effective. Usually, after scraping, another layer of paint will be applied, but the paint cannot adhere well to a hull that still has these embedded barnacles attached, as the organisms chemically react with the paint.
""...the organisms that attach to the hull will increase the weight of the ship, sometimes enough to double fuel costs...""
Biofouling is an important problem because the organisms that attach to the hull will increase the weight of the ship, sometimes enough to double fuel costs if the ship remains in warm waters for an extended period of time and organisms really begin to build up. In just a few days, barnacles can attach and build up enough to pose an enormous challenge to the removal process.
CR: What are the anti-fouling methods that OOCL employs?
JT: There are two main anti-fouling methods currently in use. One is application of a particularly slippery paint, to make the"

3.1 Transcription
Transcription is the first step of gene expression. It involves the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the formation of mRNA. The transcription rate is dependent on a number of conditions like the promoter strength and the used strain. Our system has both constitutive promoters, which are always active, and inducable promoters, which can be activated or repressed.
Maximum Transcription rate
First we will try to find the maximum transcription rate. The prediction of the transcription rate has been an important hold-back in the past, even though Polymerases per Second was introduced as a unit. This is the amount of Polymerases that passes through a given position in the DNA per time unit and is essentially the transcription rate at a particular location on the DNA (open wetware http://openwetware.org/wiki/PoPS). We can use this value as the transciption rate of the whole gene because it is the value of the slowest and rate-defining step, the binding of polymerase on the promoter. The other step being the movement of polymerase over the gene. It remained difficult to measure in vivo but Kelly et al have introduced a way to measure the activity of promoters using an in vivo standard, promoter J23101. This gave rise to a new unit: Relative activity of promoter (RPU)$=\frac{PoPS_{phi}}{PoPS_{J23101}}$. By using relative units, the variability due to equipment and conditions was drastically decreased. The PoPS of J23101 was found to be 0.03.
As our constitutive promoter, we used J23114. On the iGEM website we found that the J constitutive promoter family had been characterized using RFP and we found that J23101 had a strength of 1791 au and J23114 had a strength of 256 au with J23112 as standard in this measurement. We conclude that J23114 has a PoPS of 0.00429. The iGEM team of UNIPV-Pavia 2010 also measured the activity of J23114 in E. coli in LB with a high copy number. The RPU is equal to around 0.05. This means that J23114 has a PoPS of 0.0015"

Conclusions
In answering whether or not genetic sequences should be patentable, a large portion of respondents assumed the discussion involved naturally occurring genetic sequences and thus identified that option as unacceptable. However, interestingly enough, most respondents agreed that should a patent exist, it should be applicable everywhere around the world. This perhaps suggests a perceived significance of intellectual property. Also appearing of very high significance to student respondents are scientific advancement and the general good. All but one of those surveyed agreed that a patent should be restricted if either scientific advancement or the public good is affected. Among the suggestions for encouraging collaboration between synthetic biologists, one recurring idea called for an open-access database of genetic sequences. Here, we cannot help but think of the Registry of Standard Parts and the role that it is playing in performing this exact function internationally. Finally, 17 out of 23 respondents agreed that our lab should not submit the sequence we received from a US colleague (refer to paragraph one on this page), at least not without permission of the lab who sent it to us. This aligns with our team’s perceptions as well, as discussed earlier

Munich,2017,Team:Munich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEMers who came to meet us. We were very happy to have them in our lab and to get to know each other's team.
iGEM Bristol
Team Bristol have a project called BREATHE, in which they modify E.coli cells to metabolize NOx compounds from the atmosphere into ammonia. With help from a bioreactor, the ammonia can be oxidized to molecular nitrogen, producing electricity. This way, BREATHE not only reduces air pollution, but provides energy too. As a side project, team Bristol developed the iGEM Development Environment (IDE) to help other teams edit their wiki faster and efficiently. When we found out about this tool, we wanted to try it out and reached them, who happily explained us how to use it. The IDE helped us speed up our wiki editing, specially in the initial steps, and made working on the wiki more convenient and easy. In turn, we provided them feedback about the software, so they can further develop this useful tool for future iGEM teams.
iGEM Berlin diagnostX
Their iGEM project is called Wormspotter, where they want to use a toehold switch to diagnose tape worm infections. Tape worm infections are very common in many countries in Asia and Africa, and Team Berlin wants to help make the detection of such infections rapid and affordable. We have some similarities in the project regarding the use of RNA and paper strips. They are also working a lot on RNA extraction and on amplification of the RNA product. They also want to have a visible readout on the paper to detect the presence of tapeworm RNA as we do. Therefore we decided to help each other by addressing each other's problems and by helping to solve them. We had Skype meeting sessions and exchanged emails to keep each other updated. We also talked on how the challenges of RNA amplification could be optimized and how we can make good use of each other's detection system.
iGEM UCL
Their project is called LIT (Light Induced Technologies)and they work with light-activated gene networks in mammalian cells and aim to create a novel transmembrane protein. For that reason, they were looking for a signal peptide to deliver their protein of interest to the ER as well as a transmembrane domain to ensure its embedding inside the plasma membrane. We sent them two BioBricks from last year's team that were not released yet by the iGEM Registry: BM-40 (BBa_K2170214) and TMD-EGFR (BBa_K2170214) . They were able to integrate"

Overview
Methods and Results
Conclusions
The        fifth InterLab study has launched and it further attempts to develop        a standard procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) measurements        to reduce variability across laboratories in the world. This year the        attempt is to normalize fluorescence measurements to colony forming        units (CFU) instead of optical density of the culture since it is a        great source of variability among labs. Two approaches were used to        compute the cell number in the samples:
Converting         absorbance of cells to absorbance of known concentration beads;
Counting         CFU in the samples.
Methods and Results
1. Calibration protocols
At        firstly, we measured absorbance (Abs600)        of weakly scattering LUDOX CL-X to obtain a multiplication factor of        Abs600 to transform absorbance values to the comparable OD600 units.
Following        that, we prepared serial dilutions of monodisperse silica        microspheres and obtained standard particle curve (Fig.        1) which allows to        convert Abs600 measurements to        an estimated number of cells.
Figure        1. Standard particle curve obtained by using microspheres that        are similar size to a cell displayed in (A) a linear scale and        (B) a log scale.
The        final calibration was that of fluorescein concentration. We generated        a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration by,        again, making serial dilutions of fluorescein (Fig.        2). This way we        could convert our cell based readings of fluorescence to an        equivalent fluorescein concentration.  The measurements were taken        with the same setting as those which would be used measuring cell        fluorescence.

Human Practice
A Step Towards Our Community - The HKUST iGEM 2013 team had three main objectives in mind for human practice: safe application of our project, bioethics and biosafety, and provision of synthetic biology information for the general public. Each objective was considered carefully and human practice events were developed according to these objectives.
Novel Human Practice Approach: Country Profile , Comparison in Synthetic Biology Development and Blog
Presentation
Presentations are one way to share information about our project and iGEM to other people, whether it is to fellow scholars or to the general public. Find out more about our past and upcoming presentations on synthetic biology.
Country Profile
This is a novel human practice project that we performed. Our country profile provides information on synthetic biology in Asian countries to facilitate a more holistic understanding of synthetic biology around the world.
Gene Therapy Article
It is necessary to think about how our project could actually be applied. Since gene therapy was mentioned as a mean to deliver our DNA into human liver cells, we thought it was necessary to research on current gene therapy procedures.
Videos
We have made several videos to inform the general public about synthetic biology and our project. We tried to make the content relatively easy to understand so that people with no background knowledge in biology understand the content.
Blog
While working on the Country Profile, we could not find any webpage or blog specifically made to update people about synthetic biology for Hong Kong viewers. So, we decided to make a simple, but interactive blog for the public in Hong Kong written in Cantonese.
Interview
To discuss the possible safe application of our project, we met with prominent individuals in Hong Kong society. The interviews allowed us to gain a better understanding of how our project could actually work as a product.
Safe application
We thought safe application of our project was a very important aspect of our project because we thought that in the future our project will probably be directly applied on humans. We tried to incorporate a foreign inducible metabolic process into human liver cells; therefore we had to consider how to eliminate possible complications that"
UCLouvain,2017,Team:UCLouvain#Badge_-_-_TEXT.html," hole in the capsule, this one serves as an opening to fill the ring and as the second cooperating part regarding the biosafety mechanism. You can also find a little bump on top of the ring, which is hanging inside. This ring is placed around the capsule, which is already inside the support. The ring needs to be able to turn freely around the capsule, only limited by the small bumps.
A seal is needed in-between the last two parts to ensure that there are no leaks. Once the three parts are assembled and filled with their respective liquids, the badge is finished and ready to be used.
In order to secure the capsule into the support, you need to put the capsule into the support first, by matching the teeth with the grooves. Then you add the safety ring around the capsule, making sure that the holes are not facing each other. Finally, you turn the safety ring clock wise. When the bumps on the capsule and on the ring come into contact, continuing turning will force the capsule to turn with the ring. It will be secured inside the support, thanks to the groove at the bottom. The badge is now assembled and ready to be used as a UV sensor.
Once the capsule has been used, it needs replacing. To do so, simply turn the ring anticlockwise. Once the small bumps are in contact, keep turning. The small capsule will turn too, enabling it to leave the support with the ring. When the small bumps get in touch, both hole in the capsule and in the safety ring will perfectly match. This means that the solution of each compartment will be mixed together. The bleach will kill all the bacteria, leaving nothing but dead cell fragments and protein aggregate. Using this mechanism, we ensure that every time a capsule is replaced, the bacteria inside the old capsule are killed. The capsule can then be trashed safely or recovered to replenish it with bacteria.
Our prototype was printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2X Experimental 3D Printer and with polylactic acid (PLA) as a polymer. The top of the capsule was not printed due to some technical limitation. Nevertheless, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) could be used as it allows light transmittance in the visible range and at our desired wavelength (365 nm)[1].

Peter Rahbæk Juel - Mayor of Odense
The core philosophy of our Integrated Human Practices has been to incorporate local experts in the development of our project. We wanted to examine how results produced in the laboratory, could be used to shape a product that corresponds with the green values of Odense.
We sought the advice of experts in other fields, e.g. expert in plastics to design the best possible exterior of our device. Furthermore, we met with business developer Ann Zahle Andersen to investigate the core value of our product from a business perspective.
We believe that Human Practices have played an essential role in our iGEM project. Everything from the design of our prototype to ethical considerations have been influenced by the people we engaged with.
Interviewing Smart City Odense
For the possible implementation of the PowerLeaf in the local environment of Odense, we decided to reach out to Kristina Dienhart, project manager of Smart City Odense. Smart City Odense is a project within Odense Municipality, that seeks to combine urban planning with new technologies and open-data toward creating a smarter, more sustainable city.
This made us aware of necessities essential to Odense and its citizens. She gave us feedback that we integrated into numerous areas of our overall project.
Changeability - From Mrs. Dienhart’s point of view, one of the most advantageous attributes of our device is the potential for changeability in the size and shape of the design. We had yet to consider the PowerLeaf as a device not limited by physical dimensions. This has been the most significant element we took with us from the interview. Changeability is a necessity to a city planner, as various laws and aesthetic considerations need to be taken into account, when altering or creating an urban environment.
Accessibility - She also discussed accessibility with us. The citizen will not use our device unless it is easily accessible. This means that the overall design of the PowerLeaf, regardless of its aesthetics, always needs to be designed with a user in mind. Reflecting on the advice of Mrs. Dienhart, we decided to reevaluate the means of implementation of the PowerLeaf to ensure that the need for accessibility and user-comfort is met.
Essentiality - She supported our notion if the needs for accessibility and changeability are met, the PowerLeaf could help ensure that citizens of Odense use and remain in the public space for a longer amount of time. Something that is valuable, not only to the individual citizen, but also to the community as a whole, as it creates a sense of city cohesion and hence a high quality of city life"

One might argue that the material past and the material future are exactly the same just wrapped in different semantic paradigms. It is actually impossible to be in the future, but the future is constituted by the immediate past, and the now is impossible to grasp. So is the past actually the future?

For the runs simulating activation, the data generated at the end of a dormancy run was used as initial value and deactivated expression of RelE. When the concentration of free RelE decreases to below 15 copies, a cell is considered active. This value was probably set too low, but tests displayed marginal difference between 15 and 45 copies, where the lower limit was chosen to decrease uncertainty of the cell state.
All runs simulated 1000 cells, which should be sufficient to get stable averages and the model assumed well-mixed conditions in every cell and considered each cell independently. Furthermore, the model has no cut-off for maximum values of RelE, as the exact relation between RelE concentration and dormancy state is unknown, yet a functional cut-off was found through activation times.

Modeling
Modeling in synthetic biology is a crucial tool that helps us to get a comprehensive vision of                   biological systems and the working principles while providing ways to improve the system. In our case, it significantly led to the design of our project while improving the part choices.                    In our project we aimed to improve the second generation bioethanol production in which pretreatment process are constructed, from microbial fermentation by increasing the lifespan and productivity of bacteria. In our project, we used E.coli KO11 which is an ethanologenic bacteria thus appropriate for our goal. However, because we designed our gene circuit not just for KO11 but also for other E.coli strains, the modeling was constructed while considering the overall properties of them. While doing so, we used kinetic and visual models to design our gene circuit, calculating the expected behaviours and demonstrating our system.
What we have achieved
1- We constructed our gene circuit with the help of toxicity analysis and enzymatic reaction kinetics.
2- We used microbial growth and fermentation kinetics to simulate the expected behaviors of our system and the effects of our genes with the data obtained from our wet lab team.
3- We improved the understanding of our project by demonstrating the pathways and effects of our genes .
Formation of Our Kinetic Models
Cell Growth Kinetics
We decided to use Monod equation for the cell growth to demonstrate the effects of our genes in which the cell concentration over time depends on the number of cells (X) and the substrate concentration (S) along with several parameters such as Monod Constant (Ks) and maximum specific growth rate (μmax).

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Notebook#week5_-_-_TEXT.html," been up to here. The new addition to   our team, Kiran, did his first transformation today.... Until next time
Friday, 5th July
Today, we presented our newest progress report to the professors.
Frank's security containment device (kill switch) design was improved by   Tom's feedback. Chris Salkowsky reagent'd different auxin concentrations   successfully. Nick did A LOT. He poured plates, practiced how to use capillary   slides. What else did he do? He didn't do much, man. Today he really hasn't done   much.
Kiran helped Nick do his stuff and set up his own experiments. Yuanwei was   busy re-writing the wiki in HTML and is waiting on Koby's template help, which   should arrive soon. Ming and Rebekka set up slides for confocal imaging and   imaged bacteria inside roots (BOOM)! Si modelled the security containment   device. Nina finished the chemotaxis modelling video and has started developing   a root branching model. Nikki purified the vectors.
There was cake.

    PCA sorted the data after analysis, and the top 10 are showed here because 61 data are too much. The first five genes with the proportion greater than 0.2 are experimentally verified. The experimental results show that LLNZ_RS02280 (msmK) has the best anti-acid capability. This is almost identical to the direct experimental validation from 61 common differential genes.
    With these two principal components, we improved the accuracy of the result to 0.98. Although LLNA_RS02280 (msmK) is not the first in the model, it is in the top five, which shows that the model still has great reference.

    Now that the acid-resistant component is obtained, it is not enough for scientific research. We also need to explore the mechanism of acid resistance. This model attempts to analyze the mechanisms through GO analysis and pathway analysis. Here we analyze the data of 266 deferentially expressed genes. GO analysis shows that deferentially expressed genes are mainly involved in catalytic activity, binding activity in molecular function and metabolic process, cellular process in biological process. And pathway analysis shows that deferentially expressed genes are mainly involved in amino acid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways,"

We incubate the samples at 37C for a minimum of two hours.
The restriction results are checked by running the samples on agarose gel. If the samples are needed for a following step, we perform gel extraction.
Gel Extraction (MN Plasmid NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit was used during these experiments)
After cutting the needed bands out of the agarose gel we weigh them.
We add NTI buffer twice the amount of micrograms measured in uL and incubate the samples at 50C 450rpm for 5-10 minutes.
We take 700uL form those samples and add on top of NucleoSpin columns. They are centrifuged at 14000rpm for 1 minute then we discard the flow through. If there is any remaining solution from the samples we repeat this step.
We add 700uL NT3 (with EtOH) and centrifuge at 14000rpm for 1 minute. The flow through is discarded.
Step 4 is repeated.
We centrifuge the columns at 14000rpm again for 3 minutes to dry.
We put the column into new eppendorfs at 65C and incubate approximately 3 minutes.
We add 20mL ddH2O -warmed to 65C beforehand- to the columns and centrifuge them at 14000rpm for 3 minutes after waiting for 3 minutes at room temperature.
Step 8 is repeated.
The concentrations are measured after the process with NanoDrop with 2 uL from the sample.
Induction
We pick colonies from our plates and put them in 3mL (or 5 or 10mL depending on necessity) LB medium with 1:1000 appropriate antibiotics.
The diluted samples are incubated at 37C until OD600 value reaches approximately 0.6.
The samples are then induced with 0.02% arabinose (from %10 stock) and 1X 1M IPTG (from 1000X stock). Uninduced and competent cells are used as controls.
We place them back into the incubator either at 37C for 4hours, 30C for 6h or 18C overnight.

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#PolicyAndPractices#PolicyAndPractices_-_-_TEXT.html,", biotechnology, computer science and molecular biology.
The synthetic biology can be defined by their objectives. This definition encompasses four points. One goal is to gain new scientific knowledge about the processes within cells by trying to build cells from the bottom up or the top down. Another goal is to open up new fields of possible applications for synthetic modified organisms for example in medicine. A key issue involves the creation of novel, non-naturally occurring organisms and structures, as well as modularization and standardization of repeatedly compassable components: Biobricks.(TESSY).
Before discussing the definitions of „artificial cell“ and „living machine“ it is crucial to define to what extend can ever be spoken about a creation of life in synthetic biology.
The currently pursued research approaches in the synthetic biology do not aspire the creation of life ""de novo"". “De novo” can be explained from the Latin term “newly create, invent”(Pons). In connection with synthetic biology this implies the creation of new organisms without any foundation in already existing organisms. Up to this day researchers are working with organisms found in nature.
However, in the future scientist attempt to design and manufacture new biological systems, with no origin in nature. (Boldt et al. 2009). Creating new life is consequently one main goal of synthetic biology.
There are three different approaches aiming at the goal: the DNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell engineering and protocell creation (O´Malley et al. 2008).
The DNA-based device construction approach engages with the method of modularization, standardization and abstraction of biological constructs (Arkin 2008). Building a collection of biobricks and inserting them in organisms gives these new functions. Creating new, not in nature occurring species (European Commission 2003).
Model for this is the technical field. Genetic sequences are intended to function like a construction kit, working in every desired organism. For the following discussion, the sematic analogy between the genetic constructs and man made machines is further investigated. Apparent are the used terms „bioengineering product“ or „living machines“ (Deplazes ans Huppenbauer 2009; Tucker/Zilinskas 2006).
The genome-driven cell engineering approach aims to create a so-called „minimal cell“. Parts of the cell should be reduced to a minimal extend, leaving only necessary properties for survival. Minimizing the genome after the top-down-approach pursues the creation of an organisms as a „cassis“. A variable frame where every biobrick can be introduced into the genome. (Gibson et al. "

3.4.2 Make CI-PDMS&PDMS mixed layer and support layer
1) Remove the CI-PDMS film from the wafer and flatten it on the foil
2) Use a 8mm round punch to punch 6 holes on the foil paper
3) Align the holes according to the desired position and place them on top of the mask that has been cut.
4) The mask is reversed and the CI-PDMS layer magnetic film on the mask is attached to the silicon wafer in the original position (note the position of the entire chip)
5) Configure PDMS: curing agent = 10:1 mixture and vacuum (can be operated in parallel with step 4)
6) Place the silicon wafer with the CI-PDMS layer attached to the corresponding position of the silicone machine and pour it into the PDMS to wait for its bubbles to disappear  and is placed in a 60 ° C heating box for 1 h.
7) Add some PDMS to another silicon wafer, wait for the bubbles to disappear, and put them in a 90 °C heating box for 1 hour.
3.4.3 First bond
1) Remove the pure PDMS layer from the silicon wafer with a blade and then buckle it on the foil that has been masked.
2) Remove the extra parts
3) Cover the PDMS layer that needs plasma with tin foil and put it into the plasma cleaner for plasma cleaning.
4) After completing 3), return to the ultra-clean workbench, reverse the layer covered with silicon wafer, and then align the holes, and then bond them. After bonding, the silicon wafers are placed in a 90 °C heating box for 30 minutes, then removed spare.
3.4.4 Channel layer fabrication, second bonding
1) Wrap the channel layer mold with tin foil paper, pour the glue (pay attention to the dosage), put it into the 90 °C heating box and heat it for 1h30min after the bubble disappears, then take it out ( step 4 should start within 30min after step 2 )
2) The 3-step spare bonded part is opposite to the 4-step channel layer chip, plasma-cleaned after plasma plasma cleaning, and then bonded after the chamber is aligned.
2) After heating, put it in a 60 ° C heating box for 1 h, remove, and the experiment is complete

Our result is too much to write all on this page. So we write only graphs on this page and upload all result data. We analyzed mainly following points.
compare between arts and science(*) in college student
compare between ""genetic engineering"" and ""biotechnology""
compare between people with different jobs
compare between college student and the others
(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html," aqua regia is not necessarily the best choice of leaching agent to be used at industrial scale, because of the high cost of the necessary equipment (special stainless steel) [18]. There are also toxic by-products, such as chlorine gas, especially if plastic is not separated from the metals in an initial step. Thus, the environmental friendliness could be further improved for example by using bacteria to recycle the fantastic plastic, as has been done in different iGEM projects .
It is important to note again that the method proposed here only requires the existence of Gold ions in a fairly neutral solution. Thus, new developments in ecologically friendly leaching agents or even bioleaching agents [17] could be immediately coupled to the delftibactin process. In fact, it could easily replace the gold extraction step in most industrially used processes in a plug-and-play fashion, whereas the chemical isolation steps would have to be extensively readjusted to the new conditions.
Finally, it has to be mentioned that efficient industrial processes consist of closed-loop systems [19] and pipelines, which try to isolate as many metals as possible, e.g. by iterative steps of electrolysis at different voltages to precipitate and reduce the various metals. Such processes of course appear optimal from an economic perspective, but are difficult to compare to our suggestion in a quantitative manner. Of course, further developments could allow the creation of similar pipelines based almost exclusively on bioengineering and chelating NRP molecules in particular.
Constraint-based modeling
One of the main assumptions of FBA based modeling is that E.coli bacteria have been engineered to maximize the delftibactin production rate. In fact, the simulated points for the maximal delftibactin production lie on the pareto frontier (product envelope) and they place an upper bound to what is theoretically possible, simply due to stoichiometric considerations.
In order to get an insight into the resulting quantities, a comparison with another recent approach that modelled NRPS/PKS systems in a similar way appears useful. Huang et al. [20] used metabolic flux analysis in order to simulate the production of the antibiotic Daptomycin by Streptomyces roseosporus. Here the maximum daptomycin production was approximately equal to 0.06 $\frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h}$ for a glucose uptake rate of 0.7 $\frac{mmol}{g_{dw}h}$. Thus, the yield of daptomycin per glucose is appropriately equal to 0.086. This is in a comperable range to"

Introduction
The 2016 UCLA iGEM Team is proud to participate in the Third International InterLab Measurement Study in synthetic biology. As members of the synthetic biology community, we are committed to providing robust data for the development of novel characterization methods in the rapidly growing biological design fields of synthetic biology. The purpose of the 2016 InterLab study is to examine the precision and accuracy of fluorescence data and information processing from active iGEM teams participating around the world. By collecting fluorescence data from multiple teams in absolute units, variability in measurement and consistency of data collected from instrumentation following a uniform procedure can be determined within a high degree of accuracy. This notebook will record all protocols, daily experiments, relevant images, as well as the raw data and graphs used in the Interlab Submission Form.

The following results are the fluorescence calibration curve (FITC) and the cell sampling OD600 and fluorescence results. The graphs were generated from the Excel spreadsheet provided by iGEM.
FITC Fluorescence Calibration Curve
Cultures were sampled at the t=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hour marks in 100uL aliquots from 5mL cultures and stored on ice to arrest growth until ready for measurement. These results are almost as expected, there was highly stagnated growth for both replicates of Device 1; we attribute this discrepancy to human/experimental error.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Edinburgh 2014 iGEM Team: RewirED
How it all began: Making sense of antisense together!
The RewirED Edinburgh Team focused on the creation of a metabolic wiring system as a novel way of connecting logic gates in different bacterial strains. They developed a software tool to analyze sequences of antisense RNA for gene silencing which identifies the optimal sequence (~100bp, covering RBS and start codon) and analyses the structure to find the most stable antisense RNA.
In this collaboration they provided the sequence of the antisense gene which, according to their model, has the fewest secondary structures in the core regions and analysed the behaviour of our design of an antisense gene.
From our side we provided real world data  on the behaviour of the antisense gene silencing  in order to test the accuracy of their model and efficacy of their software. Specifically we analysed the growth in different media of E. coli engineered with the antisense gene silencing BioBrick . The silenced gene is core for the survival of E. coli and the reduction in growth corresponds to the efficacy of the antisense. We sent them all the data we gathered that they could then compare to their in silico prediction.
The sequence we designed didn't effectively repress growth in E.coli as modelled by the software. We designed new primers to amplify the sequence suggested by Edinburgh: a smaller fragment with better predicted functionality, and we are now in the stage of cloning and testing it to provide them with more data on their software's effectiveness.

BIOLOGICAL SAFETY
Our project does not raise any safety issues beyond the standard safety concerns of working in a molecular biology wetlab for the researcher, the public or the environment since we are not working with any cytotoxic BioBrick parts (beyond the cell death gene ccdB used for negative selection during the construction of BioBrick circuits).
While there is a Biosafety group that focuses on the safety and well being of researchers as well as an ethical review board at the University of Calgary, neither of these two entities were concerned about the potential safety issues arising from our project. As we were dealing with Escherichia coli as our model organism, ethical approval was not required for our project. Furthermore, since E. coli is used as a standard chassis for genetic engineering, only standard Biosafety and WHMIS training was needed for our team to carry out our research.  Finally, as mentioned above, we do not feel that any of the BioBrick parts that we have submitted to the Registry raise any safety issues. Nonetheless, we do recognize that while creating a synthetic bacterial cell-to-cell communication system shouldn’t bring the issue of safety into the picture, our system might be coupled with other systems that could be used for harmful applications. Indeed, coordinating the behavior of entire populations of bacteria in a way that might be used for bioterrorism or other harmful applications is an issue that we have examined in our ethics"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#labblog_-_-_TEXT.html," encapsulate our cells and use a microfluidic chip. Therefore we will try to develop this possibility in parallel with the 3D-printed agar chip.
We have set up a modeling pipeline. We divided the modeling project into 3 parts :
diffusion,
parameter fitting,
modeling of the genetic circuit itself, which comprises
a deterministic model
a stochastic model.
We know that the modeling challenges will be to model how integrases work, and to model the delay between reception of a quorum sensing signal and production of a quorum sensing signal by the receiver cell. Indeed, a colony could switch itself OFF when it should be ON, if it receives QS1 and produces QS2, for example. If a delay is present between reception of QS1 and production of QS2, the colony will produce GFP before it is switched OFF, and as GFP is stable enough, it will stay visible during a long time and the self-switching OFF won't be observed. This delay should be modeled.

Week 1 : Project selected
Wednesday, May 28th
After more than one month of endless meetings and passionate debates, we finally chose the project that will keep us occupied in the next five months. From the beautiful pattern made by the Sierpinski triangles, we will focus on cellular automata and try to implement one.
Sierpinski triangles appear when the rule 90 is followed by every cell on the grid :
Pattern given by rule 90 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
Ideally we will use a microfluidic chip. We could also use a 3D printed agar plate like this one to load the colonies. On this grid we can implement the rule 6, which is the simplification of rule 90 considered as a rule with 2 inputs : each cell computes a simple XOR gate of its two parents.
Arrangement of p and q cells on the chip
Pattern given by rule 6 if only one cell is switched on in the first row at the beginning. The pattern appears row by row.
The logic part will be built with integrases and the colony-to-colony communication will use quorum sensing.
Every colony will receive two quorum sensing signals (QSp and QSq) from the two cells above it. These two signals trigger the production of two different integrases r and s in the colony. Integrases enable to build biological XOR logic gates by switching twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the"

Logic Design
Before we begin our discussion of the circuit logic, let us first review what must be accomplished by this circuit:
Input
As explained in the Overview section, we desire the input to the cell to be light. Because light cannot alone activate or repress a promoter, the circuit must in some way be able to translate the light signal to a molecule that can regulate transcription. Additionally, using light as input implies a change in light state - from OFF to ON or vise versa. Thus, the molecule that provides the interface between light and the circuit must be able to switch between active and inactive states.
Processing
Given a molecule that toggles between active and inactive, it is easy to imagine a circuit that switches between one state of production and a second. However, we desire to achieve a progression of four states! In order to accomplish this, our circuit, unlike the light responsive molecule, cannot return to its original state when the light turns back OFF. Clearly, our circuit must be able to hold ""memory!""
Output
We want our circuit to have distinct states - when possible, we would like a state to turn off after a new state has been turned on (with the exception of the memory, of course!).
Consideration of these requirements clearly gives rise to a handful of modules. The first is the Conversion Module , which takes light ON/OFF and converts it to transcription ON/OFF.
The conversion module. In a change from a) to b), the presence of light modifies a molecule that in turn effects a transcriptional change from a)OFF to b)ON
This module involves a molecule that is directly modified by the presence or absence of light, and a component that effects a transcriptional change depending on the state of the light responsive molecule.
Second is the Memory Module , which ""remembers"" that light has been changed in the past. This Memory Module is a crucial way-point in the circuit, as without it the circuit would merely return to its original state when the light turns back OFF.

Donny
This week, I learned the basics of the python programming language. I spend most of my time working with the Kegg API to access data via the SOAP protocol. I was able to utilize this new information to create a module that converts the common name to a usable kegg_id and also to convert the kegg_id back to a name. One concern I have is that even these simple functions are somewhat slow. Perhaps we will find ways to speed these processes up in the weeks to come. I looked into the possibility of Google App Engine. The one shortcoming (although it is pretty cool) was that there were some restrictions as to which libraries can be used. I foresee this as a problem and am looking into other options.
Riyad
We got Cobra working so I spent the majority of the week getting used to how Python and Cobra worked.
Palak
I began working with the various functions in COBRA.  I spent a lot of time understanding the output of COBRA and determining what aspects are necessary in creating an optimal pathway. I also looked at the inputs required for various COBRA functions and looked into ways that we can pass information from the KEGG database into COBRA. I figured out how to use the KEGG API. Additionally, I spend some time looking at the COBRA source code to see what we could modify to fit the needs of our program.
Nate
Since last week, I had some difficulties with installing python modules, specifically the ones that would allow us to graphically represent our program's outputs.  Tried to get a program called Easy_Install to work, which would make installing modules easy, but it was difficult to figure out how to get Easy_Install to install...  Fortunately, Donny was able to find an easy way to install the modules via MS-DOS prompt on windows. Now I am able to install any module...almost. I ended up installing these modules:
-Networkx
-Pydot
-Matplotlib
As well as these additional programs:
-Graphviz
-Cytoscape
Up to this point we have been using Python 2.6, but unfortunately I was unable to get all of the above modules to install correctly for Python 2.6.  I downgraded to Python 2.5,"

Figure 2.3.4 Diagram of TAL1-His Tag
This part is a first second of connectee, which we used to check the connection between connectee and connector in our basic test.
The structure is based on the BBa_K1453006 and the recognition sequence is T-TCGATATCAAGC-T. Therefore, the TAL-Protein DiRepeats protein we need are BBa_K747013, BBa_K747024, BBa_K747044, BBa_K747061, BBa_K747064 and BBa_K747089.
USB
We make two kinds of USB. One is TAL USB, the other is Enzyme USB. They can help us easily and quickly insert our target  TALE or Enzyme, respectively.
TAL USB (BBa_K1453000)
Figure 2.3.5 Diagram of TAL USB
We design a sequence which can be used together with 2012 Freiburg's part. The TAL USB can make two specific sticky ends. The two ends are the same as the first part and the last part of Freiburg design. So when we digest and ligate them together, we can get a whole TALE. But unluckily, since the sticky ends designed by Freiburg are too similar, we can just have some mismatch sequence by using these TAL USB.
Enzyme USB (BBa_K1453400) (BBa_K1453401)
In order to easily and quickly insert the target function enzyme into our system, we design two enzyme-USBs. The enzyme USB have three fundamental components, flexible linker- enzyme adaptor-flexible linker.
Figure 2.3.6 Diagram of two kinds of enzyme USB: AarI and BsmBI
The first flexible linker has deleted the PstI recognition site. And at the beginning of the sequence there is a Bsu36I recognition site. The second flexible linker we replace the original PstI site with a isocaudamer SduI, since our part can not have a PstI recognition site.
On the other hand, the enzyme adaptor has two same restriction enzyme recognition sites. In one of our enzyme-USB, it is the AarI recognition site; The other enzyme-USB is the BsmAI recognition site. The AarI and BsmAI are similar to BsmBI which all can make a 4bp sticky end designed by ourselves.

Friday, August 9, 2013
Investigators: Kerstin, Laura
The final Prhl inducible construct (K1073035) was retransformed into E. coli Top10F'.
The prepped DNA of the final Plas inducible construct (K1073034) and the Plas inducible amilGFP cassette (B0015-K091117-B0032-ampR-B0015-J23100-B0032-C0079-B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015) was sequenced. While the sequence of the Plas inducible amilGFP cassette could not be verified, the sequence of the final Plas inducible construct containing aeBlue expression cassette was finally verified!
We prepared liquid cultures of the final Prhl construct (K1073035) in different E. coli strains (XL1 Blue MRF’, Top10F') for a growth curve experiment.
Saturday, August 10, 2013
Investigators: Kerstin, Laura
Some of the liquid culture was used for prepping and sequencing the Prhl inducible construct in E. coli Top10F' cells. The sequence was confirmed.
We measured our first successful growth curve showing the difference in growth between induced and non-induced versions of the Prhl inducible construct. The eforRed expression cassette in E. coli Top10F' was miniprepped and glycerol stocks of this strain were made. The main cultures (induced and not induced) of the final PRhl inducible construct were inoculated to a start OD520 of 0.05 in 75 ml 2xYT containing ampicillin with cells of the pre-culture. In order to induce the expression of ampR N-3-butyryl homoserine lactone was added to a final concentration of 10 µM. Samples were taken at appropriate times depending on the growth phase until the induced culture reached the stationary phase. OD was determined at 520 nm to avoid absorptions by chromoproteins.

This week was dominated by testing our constructs in continuous as well as in batch culture for inducibility and regulation. Unregulated growth in chloramphenicol containing medium and regulated growth in ampicillin containing"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#20 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,", it is becoming very urgent to make the second life project publicly presentable! I spent today getting organized and nailing down the design for the last big feature that will live in the Biobrick Simulator heads up display object: levels.
The simulator is not a game (though it will be fun), but the 'playing through levels' concept is widely known amongst young people these days, and it's much more appealing than something like 'concepts', or 'chapters', even though those terms are better descriptions of what a 'level' will be. Each level is a self contained set of parts, with the goal of introducing one or two new features of the simulator and concepts in molecular biology to the user. The preliminary list of levels is a good illustration of the progression I'm looking for:
First Transcription
Activators (a simple activatable device, and an activator)
Repressors (a simple repressable device)
External Activator (the activator/repressor is produced by a device, instead of given)
External Repressor
Negative Autoregulation (Control)
Positive Autoregulation (Memory)
Or Gates
Inverters (Not Gate)
And Gates (two inverters w. dual repressed promoter)
Bistable Toggle Switch
Tristable Toggle Switch (See Brown's 2007 project. )
Repressilator
Unfortunately, there are also a good number of systems I had wanted to make into levels, but whose features aren't yet supported by the simulator's engine! Including, but not limited to:
Lac Operon
Tet Operon
And Gates (additional varieties)
Lux Operon / Quorum Sensing
Feedforward systems (various types)
XOR Gates
Ara Operon?
In addition, a number of the levels I will be building would benefit from features these other systems require, especially inducers for LacI and TetR. Inducers make a huge amount of sense for systems like the toggle switches, for getting from one state to another; and also for positive autoregulation, for turning on/off cellular memory. That's to say nothing of incorporating environmental signals like temperature, osmolarity, and light, each of which have sensor parts within the registry, leading to more systems and more levels... but I digress! In a perfect world I'd have a chance to implement all of these things before putting together a selection of levels. But since I would like a version of the simulator with most of its *features* in place before the end of summer, choices have to be made about content. And who"

Flow CytoMetry (FCM)
From the result of fluorescence microscopy, the expression of HRH4-mcherry fusion proteins can be observed roughly, for measuring the expression level of HRH4-mcherry, FCM is performed. From the result, a distinct peak value can be observed. Though it can’t representative all the functional HRH4 that locates in the membrane, it can be indicated that most of them are correctly located from the fluorescence microscopy result, this data is enough to support our modeling.
Result
The test of this composite part set the foundation of our project, it proved that HRH4 can be expressed in high level under the trigger of a constitutive promoter-ADH1 promoter. Besides, the HRH4 can locate in the yeasts’ membrane without adding other sequence. It can be indicated that if mcherry is removed, functional HRH4 can still be expressed and locate in the membrane.

Protecting Our Technology and Our Business
In order to remain competitive in the market, protecting our technology is extremely important. To this end, developing a comprehensive intellectual property protection plan was critical. With our technology stemming from a previous iGEM project, we faced unique issues in terms of identifying key stakeholders and dealing with previously made disclosures.
Intellectual Property Protection
The technology platform which is being commercially developed was originally produced from the Calgary iGEM team in 2012.  This produced a unique intellectual property (IP) situation, as the technology came out of a collective project by a large team composed of professors, students, and numerous funding sources.  Additionally, all of the work which was completed was disclosed publicly through a variety of posters, presentations, and the 2012 iGEM Calgary Wiki .  This has created numerous questions surrounding the protection of our invention, and the type of IP protection to take.  The protection strategy that we have taken for our technology platform and business development is detailed below.
Figure 1. Overview of our intellectual property protection of which there are three major categories, regarding protection of our project, the right to operate within this intellectual space through our business development, and to assess the legal protection and ownership protection we require being a former iGEM project.

""Collaboration leads to a better and more accepted technology""
Consultation with both university specialists and beekeepers has pointed out the main cause of the Colony Collapse Disorder: Varroa destructor. Our collaboration with the Design Academy Eindhoven has led to a design of our final application, and in collaboration with Synenergene and Resource Wageningen we created a magazine of the future where we illustrated the techno-moral consequences of our technology. We invited the other Dutch iGEM teams for a national meetup. Finally, we organized and attended multiple events related to synthetic biology.
We contacted the NBV, Dutch Association for Beekeepers, in order to understand the impact of V. destructor on bees and beekeepers. In addition, Bob Mulder, the communication specialist of Wageningen UR and team adviser, pointed out the following principle: ""Don’t change the consumer, change"

iGEM Australia Meet Up
iGEM USYD hosted the other Australian teams from the University of New South Wales, Macquarie University and the University of Melbourne to share and discuss the hard work done by each team. All of the teams exchanged ideas about progress and the content of the wiki, poster and presentations. We also explored avenues through which we could collaboratively help each other such as through research, modelling and outreach. Each team brought something new to the table, and we rounded up proceedings with a good old sausage sizzle and social drinks. Thank you to all the other teams for coming and having such a great time!

UNSW, Australia: Protein Expression + His-Tag and GMO Legalities Collaboration
We traded expertise in protein work with the UNSW team. We attempted to express two of their proteins (G3P and PP3) using our pET28c plasmid in BL21 (DE3, pGro7) E. coli. given our success in expressing our two mycobacterial proteins EtnR1 and EtnR2 using this system. We also gave them strains of E. coli. that overexpress membrane proteins for their work on outer membrane vesicles. The UNSW team performed a Western Blot for us using anti-His antibody conjugated to HRP to verify our proteins were expressed with a His6-Tag.  Additionally we both looked"

Safety
The Safety Level of our lab is Level 1 (low risk), our work areas to handle biological materials include open bench and biosafety cabinet. All of our team members have received biosafety training from CMUQ’s biosafety office prior to entering the lab. The training topics included, Lab access and rules, responsible individuals, difference between biosafety levels, biosafety equipment, good microbial technique and chemicals, fire and electrical safety.
Dr. Ravichandra Bachu (rbachu@qatar.cmu.edu) is in charge of the Safety of the labs in CMUQ. The laboratory biosafety guidelines followed by us are the same as Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh. The link to these guidelines is here . Fortunately, we didn’t encounter any uncertainties concerning institutional, regional, national or international rules and regulations.
Regarding our project, the team intends to clone a bacterium which will respond differently to different salt concentrations in its surrounding. As a result of this, we will use the determined salt concentrations to estimate the Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) populations in the sea water at any given time. Based on this estimate, it will be easier to decide the amount of biocide that should be added to kill the SRB in order to prevent Microbial Induced Corrosion (MIC).
Our project could be applied in the natural environment, as the engineered cells are a strain of E. Coli, which are abundantly found in the environment . Therefore, they do not have any health hazards for the Marine life. Our project does not include the use of gene drives nor animals. Antimicrobial resistance factors are used as they are commonly used in research and all parts used are included in the whitelist.
During the project, only bacteria will be used, DH5a strain of E.coli will be transformed with a proU osmolarity promoter that will detect high salt in the extracellular environment. To avoid any uncertainties or gaps in our project safety, we have worked with one of our PI, who is a Microbiologist and also received guidance from the laboratory technicians."
Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Forensic Toolkit#Chromate_-_-_TEXT.html,") . Over the last 10 years the group that discovered it started working out the underlying mechanisms of this set of characteristics. A transposon located set of genes that lead to chromate resistance (TnOtChr) was uncovered. This operon, expressed from the Pchr - promoter led to the expression of the downstream genes chrA, chrB, chrC, and chrF. chrA was found to express and efflux pump, whereas the gene product of chrB was identified as being a chromate-inducible regulator of Pchr. Additionally, chrC and chrF were found to confer tolerance to superoxides. Deleting chrC and chrF was shown to have no significant effect on chromate resistance which at first seemed unusual, but considering that Cr(VI) is often reduced via Cr(V) and Cr(IV) intermediates which can lead to the generation of superoxides, these 2 genes are suspected to act as a second line of defense (4) .
Figure 1: Plasmid map of the original biobrick system, (BBa_K1058008) .
To make the system more modular, we aimed to modify and improve this existing biobrick by taking it apart and using its constituent parts in a new arrangement (Fig. 2). This has the advantage that each part can be modified individually and the level of the reporter, GFP, and/or the repressor can be modulated more easily by subcloning either of them.
Figure 2: Plasmid map of the modified biobrick system, (submitted to registry under BBa_K1590003 , and BBa_K1590004 .
↑
How did we test it?
To ensure that the modified system was valid we used mathematical modelling to compare the original biobrick and our modified system (Fig. 3). We also looked at GFP production with varying levels of chromate added to the system (Fig. 4). The models of both the original and modified pathways revealed two key points; the modified pathway is just as reliable as the original pathway, and the level of GFP produced does not change. However the response will be faster for increasing levels of chromate added to the system.
Figure 3: Plot comparing the likelihood of false positives in the form of genetic leakiness of both plasmid systems. If leakiness is considered a small amount of GFP will be produced in the absence of chromate. Both systems are just as reliable as each other, confirming the feasibility of using the modified two plasmid system, to allow for modularity.

BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#H2O2DecompositionModel_-_-_TEXT.html," model accounted for intracellular and extracellular H2O2 levels, and the                     consumption of a finite                     antioxidant capacity using three rates:
1) The membrane permeability (k1).[2][3][4]
2) Intracellular slow degradation rate (k2).[5]
3) Intracellular fast degradation rate (k3) dependent upon a finite capacity (g), e.g. NADPH                         levels in naive cells.[6]
We reviewed the above literature and combined the results of the wet experiment, as shown in Fig.3,                     to determine the parameters required for the model simulation, listed in the table below.

Simulation result
We used MATLAB to simulate the kinetics of extracellular and intracellular H2O2 changes over time.                     (Fig. 2)
Fig.2 Simulation result
Experimental result
To verify the feasibility of the model and to confirm this dynamic process, we did some experiments                     using our system's output, roGFP2-Orp1. The results show that the fluorescence ratio value                     I405/I488, an oxidant condition indicator, decreased by time when S. cerevisiae exposed to                     different concentrations of H2O2. This ratio's decreasing stands for the                     increasing of                     intercellular H2O2 concentration. It also stopped at a stable concentration at last, which's                     correspond to our model's result.

Summary
In this model, we successfully simulated the kinetics of extracellular and intracellular H2O2 changes over time. Furthermore, the dynamic process of fluorescence ratio value by time was                     detected by using roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein in wet experiment, and the feasibility of                     the model was further verified.

Enzymatic Kill switch: Results
Characterisation
No difference in CFUs was observed between the control and the samples producing lysozyme. The results of the  EnzCheck lysozyme assay were inconclusive.
Horizontal Gene Transfer
The HGT experiment showed that DNA present in lysate can be successfully transformed into a different E. coli strain with an average of 4 colonies per transformation (stdev=3.38). The BL21 (DE3) competent cells  all gained the antibiotic resistance and RFP marker from the plasmid present in the lysed DH5α. 2 colonies from each  plate were cultured over night and showed a fluorescence value concordant with that of the original culture. The   starting cultures of DH5α had an average starting OD of 1.11 and fluorescence value of 258 arbitrary units (A.U) before lysis. The BL21   (DE3) cultures transformed with the lysate had an average OD of 0.75 and average fluorescence of 306 A.U. None of the   spread plated lysate produced any colonies, showing that all cells were killed in the lysis reaction.
DNase
DNase I is a nonspecific deoxyribonuclease originally extracted from bovine pancreatic tissue. It degrades both  double-stranded and single-stranded DNA resulting in the release of di-, tri- and oligonucleotide products with 5´  -phosphorylated and 3´-hydroxylated ends (Vanecko, 1961). DNase I has also been shown to work on chromatin and DNA:RNA   hybrids (Kunitz, 1950). DNase I degrades these target polymer molecules through the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in their backbone (Suck, 1986).
For a kill switch to be effective as a bio-containment device, the release of synthetic DNA must be mitigated.  We aimed to do this in our project using the expression of DNase I. DNase I is commonly used in a laboratory   setting to degrade unwanted DNA. It was shown by Worrall and Connolly (1990) that expression of DNase I is   possible in E. coli as long as it is under the control of a promoter with a strong off state. We constructed a   part with DNase I under the control of the T7 promoter. Unfortunately no transformations were successful and all colonies  produced contained empty plasmid backbone."
