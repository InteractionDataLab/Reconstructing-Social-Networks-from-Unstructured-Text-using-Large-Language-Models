TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html," bodies of water to less toxic forms. Glutathion S-transferases (GSTs), an eukaryotic and prokaryotic phase II metabolic isozymes-family, catalyze the conjugation of reduced form of gluthatione (GSH, nucleophil) and xenobiotics (electrophil) to gluthatione-S-Conjugate via nucleophilic attack (see Figure 4).
Figure 5: Equilibrium reaction of gluthation
The consequence is an increased solubility of the conjugates which leads to the removal of xenobiotics in form of conjugates via vacuole enclosure. The action of the specific transporters and the steady supply of GSH in the equilibrium reaction (see Figure 5) are the limited factors of the detoxification reaction. Along with the detoxification and cell signaling function GST’s act as transport proteins, which gave GST the previous name ligandin. Table 2 shows the 3 different superfamilies with their characteristics.

Generally the three superfamilies differ mostly in structure  and sequence as only the cytosolic and the mitochondrial superfamily have a thiorexin like domain in which the glutathione binding site (G-site) is located [ Oakley A.,2011 ]. The helix alpha 2 is the most variable secondary structure. Y-GST is the subgroup which activates glutathione via using tyrosine residues. S/C-GST uses serine/cysteine residues. GST binds the substrate at the hydrophobic H-site of the enzyme and GSH at the hydrophilic G-site which together form the active site of the enzyme (see Figure 6). In research techniques GST is used as so called GST-tags for separation, elucidation of direct protein-protein interaction and purification of the GST-fusion protein mostly by pull-down assay. So targeting GST"

Description & Design
Description about Esophageal Cancer
Esophageal cancer is cancer arising from the esophagus. It is the eighth most common cancer and sixth leading cause of cancer mortality in the world. Especially, nearly 90% of esophageal cancer patient are found in china. Chinese patients account for more than a half of all deaths caused by esophageal cancer worldwide. Genetic factors and bad eating habits (e.g. addiction to alcohol, addiction to tobacco, eating too fast and drinking hot liquids) can be the cause of esophageal cancer.
5-year survival rate of esophageal cancer declines sharply as stage of cancer increases. In Stage I, during which cancer cells haven’t transferred, the 5-year survival rate can reach 70%. When it comes to Stage II, this number dramatically drops under 50%. And for Stage III and IV, it is 20% and 10% respectively. Thus early diagnosis plays an important role in the treatment of esophageal cancer.
However, since the early symptoms are not significant and the methods for clinical diagnosis of esophageal cancer are expensive and inconvenient, which makes the early diagnosis become difficult. Prominent symptoms usually appear only when a patient is already in the advanced stage. Early symptoms like swallowing difficulty, pain when swallowing, reduced appetite and loss of weight are often considered a minor illness and easily ignored. The diagnosing method used in hospitals mainly depends on radiology and endoscopic biopsy, which seems to be invasive and uncomfortable. To help solve this dilemma our team aim to build a convenient and harmless method for early diagnosis of esophageal cancer.
miRNA as Potential Biomarkers
Studies have confirmed that miRNA expression is highly concordant cross individuals. And aberrant expression of miRNA may relate to diseases. Some studies have reported that specific miRNAs in tissue and plasma can be discriminatory bio-makers for detecting cancers. However, getting access to tissue of plasma means physical harm to the human body. So we turn to the easily accessible saliva. Since saliva is considered to be a terminal product of blood circulation, components like proteins and RNAs which are present in plasma are also present in saliva. In fact, both"

What We Do
The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.  The  community  will  be  involved  through  a  DNA  Code  Game  designed  for  middle  and  elementary  school  students  to  raise  awareness  of  synthetic  biology  and  iGEM.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

Overview
    In the last 4 years, the Measurement Committee has been developing a robust measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) though the Interlab study, aiming to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole. And this year, we are delighted to join the study to know if we can reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.

    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.

Then,                                     his biggest labor in the drylab was focused on the HLA-DQ sequences extraction                                     design: primers and PCR strategy. Afterward, he performed the genomic DNA                                     extraction and designed the PCR program to amplify it and reaching the basic parts.                                     He also worked on the seting of constructs and methodologies to achieve a proper                                     functional folded HLA protein. He also helped in social events and project                                     promotion.

She                                     contacted with experts and other stakeholders in order to improve the project in                                     terms of science-communication and ethics. She also worked in the launching of the                                     team presentation video and the dissemination of the crowdfunding platform.                                     Furthermore, she has participated in the organization and realization of different                                     divulgation activities to raise awareness of celiac disease and its consequences.                                     Regarding WetLab’'s part, she worked on the setting up of the PCR strategy to                                     isolate the HLA genes from genomics DNA.
Victor Maull
Victor worked on the design of the sensor with Coral from a theoretical point of view. Moreover, he developed strong theoretical background to                                     understand and predict the detection dynamics underlying the sensor. Consequently,                                     the exploration through mathematical models and computer simulations was achieved.                                     Furthermore, he lent a hand here and there, holistically speaking.
Marc Expòsit
Marc learned web development from scratch and created the wiki                                     editing tutorial examples and videos. He presented the project in multiple events                                     together with other team members. Marc loves science communication and programming,                                     so he designed and carried out the DNA information storage workshop. In the WetLab,                                     he performed the experiments to clone the basic parts in the pSB1C3 vector to register them as BioBricks. He also worked in editing the wiki and did his best to                                     coordinate the team and the progress of the project.

Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.

Transformed the remaining interesting kill switches without promoters into K12.  Also transformed 17F into EPI300 pIJ790 and DH5a pIJ790 cells to determine if previously failed plates were due to ineffective competent cells.  All transformed cultures were then plated onto appropriate antibiotic plates (+Amp or +Kan), along with a control for each.  An extra control plate was spread onto a Chlor plate from a batch that previously produced unclear results.  The plates were placed at 37ºC at noon and left them to grow overnight.
Made fresh batch of LB + Amp plates, which were used for half the Amp resistant samples from above.  Check control plate tomorrow for colonies to ensure plates work.
Grew two 250 mL cultures of EPI300 to make into competent cells.  Iced them when OD600 reached 0.34 and 0.30.  Finished glycerol stocks were stored in new freezer box ""iGEM 2012 Comp Cells.""

2.get all reagents (except for pfu)
3. make master mix, in centrifuge tube
4. aliquot into PCR tubes (Master Mix)
5. add into the remaining reagents, except the pfu (normally jus the enzyme, and when colony PCR, pick a colony in stead of adding DNA).
6. keep sterile, pick colony (using tips, 10µl), add into tubes

The Hallam lab is also out of empty plates. This is not good, for many of our knockouts are replaced by tetracycline resistance, and we have no tetracycline plates.

Service companies must see clear advantages in using our product over presently utilized competing technology, both financially and analytically. They will be the primary customer source in our market. See below for an assessment of potential customers in our market:
Figure 9: Potential customers who we would market our product to in the oil and gas industry.
FREDsense aims to acquire customers from the oil and gas environmental monitoring service industry as well as the analytical laboratories required for government regulated toxin monitoring.  We also hope to be able to expand into small- to medium-sized oil and gas companies that would have interest in self-reporting in order to internally regulate their waste water streams and monitor toxins which can lead to potential corrosion problems.
Customer Requirements
It is critical to assess the requirements of our customers in order for our product to be adopted. In order to assess these requirements, we have communicated with many industry players to determine what they would need from our system in order to adopt such a technology. Our group communicated with HydroQual Laboratories based out of Calgary: an analytical laboratory which routinely monitors oil and gas as well as other industry water samples. They demonstrated several key areas that would need to be shown to be incredibly effective with our technology in order to have interest in purchasing it. These include:
Regulatory Approval - The technology must achieve appropriate regulatory approval for the oil and gas industry.  Environmental Technology Verification, Environment Canada, and Health Canada approval.
Sensitivity - The technology must be shown to very adequately demonstrate when any toxic level of any chemical is in solution (i.e. no false negatives).
Accuracy - The identification of a toxic sample must be incredibly robust.
Track Record - The technology should have a proven track record with numerous samples of various different compositions to demonstrate reliability within the industry.  The more of this we make available to our customers the better.
It is also critical to evaluate changes that the customers would have to make within their operations in order to utilize our product, as these could be barriers to the adoption of the technology. Our product will require a change in the measurement platform currently used, however, using the device is simple and does not require any technical training. Therefore, this may represent an advantage of our system rather than a burden. It may require some changes in staffing however, if more individuals are required to take samples on site. The data will require server space within the system of the customer, but we plan to design our system to integrate into existing server providers and data management systems, making this a minimal barrier.

Design
Our Petal Death Protein (PDP) part (BBa_K179200) was design to produce a modest amount of Oxalic acid. The PDP gene was obtained from Dianthus caryophyllus (Carnation) (Clove pink). PDP catalyzes the production of Oxalic acid from Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate + H2O = oxalic acid + acetate. The first 3 amino acids represent a propeptide and are not included in the PDP sequence. The PDP gene is under control of the constitutively active medium transcription promoter (J23107) and a strong RBS (B0034). This combination was chosen to allow us to tune the amount of oxalic acid produced through control of PDP production. Mutation of the transcription promoter to strong or weak activity will result in more or less PDP production and subsequent changes in oxalic acid production. The same principle can be applied to the RBS from strong to medium to weak. We tuned the oxalic acid production to achieve mite death at the lowest possible concentration while preventing any possible harm to bee health."
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," transparency is incredibly important in equestrian sports. “Horse racing is built upon dreams” Mellegers says. If you are not completely transparent, people will mistrust any outcome and this will damage the sport greatly. All doping test results must be published immediately. Since transparency and being open source are values ADOPE embodies, we believe that our test will be a good match to the equestrian anti-doping policies.
“Horse racing is built from dreams.”
Camiel Mellegers, Doping official at the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association
To conclude, we will shortly discuss the potential of our detection method in the equestrian sports, motivated by the topics above. The threat of gene doping is real in equestrian sports ( Chesser, 2018 ) and no detection method is currently in place ( Wilkin et al, 2017 ). A continued ban of gene doping is highly probable based on the anti-doping values in equestrian sports. Adapting ADOPE to fit within the equestrian anti-doping policies is fairly uncomplicated. The current model gene EPO will need to be changed to a gene more relevant in horse physiology, which is what our versatile detection method was developed to do. The detection window analysis will need to be adapted to the new target genes. Our method is a good match to the equestrian anti-doping policies due to our fast result, stemming from our targeted sequencing approach. The distinction we make in an inexpensive and fast pre-screen and more expensive, highly precise screen fits well within the A-B sample method in equestrian testing. Our approach of complete transparency fits with the core values of the sport, ensuring that the dream of horseracing remains intact.
Dutch National Bloodbank Sanquin
We initially visited Dutch National Bloodbank Saunquin to learn more about our sample preparation method, and there met Ms Aïcha Ait Soussan, who’s main research interest is fetal DNA in maternal plasma. When discussing our detection method with her and her colleagues Onno Verhagen and Professor Ellen (C. E.) van der Schoot from the experimental immunohematology department, it became apparent that they are struggling with many of the same problems in isolating fetal DNA from the mother blood as were are with isolating gene doping DNA from an athletes blood. They are both present in only little amounts compared to an enormous background of genomic DNA. A targeted sequencing approach as we are developing would be precisely what they need.

In our case, the ribosome binding sites in the construct could be replaced by a stronger or weaker one depending on the situation. This fine tuning process would help regulate the overall strength to avoid any part from dominating.
2. The induction time would be extended. In this case, we could assume all the repressors produced in the last induction has degraded while enough time is provided to produce sufficient fluorescence proteins for the assay.

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," parts under two expression systems, pBAD and T7 in a hypervesicular cell line (JC8301) and a T7 expression line (BL21 DE3), respectively. Expression was run overnight at 37° C, and whole cell lysates, periplasm fractions, and purified OMV fractions (only for the hypervesicular line) were run on in a Western using an anti-His tag antibody against a cytosolic Cas9 negative control (no signal sequence) and a literature verified periplasm and OMV localized ClyA-GFP positive control. A Bradford assay was run on each fraction sample to control for overall protein content, and the same amount of total protein was loaded in our Western.
Our gel image shows no band at the expected size for saCas9 expression in any of the fractions, including the whole cell Cas9 control. Our result indicates that our expression conditions, the temperature for example, may not have been suitable for saCas9 protein expression. Another possibility is that the hypervesicular and T7 cell lines may not be suitable for saCas9 expression at detectable levels, since our previous Western showed expression in the TOP 10 cell line. There is a strong band where our positive ClyA-GFP controls are expected, indicating that the anti-His antibody functioned correctly and that some amount of protein was localized to the periplasm and OMVs (very faint band) of the hypervesicular cell line.
Figure 3: Our second Western blot indicated that while smaller proteins (GFP) targeted to OMVs in previous work 1 are present in both periplasm fractions and in OMV lysates, our Cas9 was not successfully translocated by any of the signal sequences or protein-fusions constructed.
Cas9 Functionality
Nuclease assay:
Having shown that Cas9 was expressed in our cells, we next wanted to evaluate if the saCas9 we were expressing was functional. To do so, we conducted a standard cutting assay using a previously validated gRNA against the fluorescent protein mCherry. In order to prove that saCas9 was active in our cells, we co-transformed a plasmid containing saCas9 and a separate plasmid containing mRFP and a guide RNA (mRFP-gRNA) targeting 20 base pairs in the middle of the mRFP coding sequence into TOP10 E. coli cells. As a control, we also co-transformed our saCas9 plasmid and plasmid containing mRFP and a control guide RNA (control-gRNA) that did not target any sequence on either"

Protein expression output
As mentioned in assumption, we assume that two colors that are equally distant in the color space are equally different in the amount of fluorescent protein, which means relationship between the RGB values and required protein quantity can be characterized by a linear function.
We believe the Hill function can describe the ligand-binding situation in our light-sensing system by determining the degree of cooperativeness of the ligand binding to receptors. This has also been demonstrated in previous papers.
P=b+(aI^n)/(I^n+k^n )
I-light intensity.
P-protein quantity produced by sensing light.
For red and blue sensor, required light intensity is thus
Ig=k(a/(P-b)-1)^((-1)/n)
Ib=k(a/(P-b)-1)^((-1)/n)
However the green sensor needs to grow under red light to perform a similar response as the red one.
For green sensor
Ir=k(a/(P-b)-1)^((-1)/n)+r0

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," discussions about regulation and safety are clearer.
Different regulations apply for different regions. In the European Union, the European Commission considers to apply the existing regulatory framework of GMOs (European Commission, 2010). In the USA, the regulatory framework of Biotechnology applies and adaptations are made to address SynBio novelty (Carter, 2014).
Worldwide, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 2011) targets three objectives that focus on:
Conserving biodiversity.
Sustainable use of biodiversity
Fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources.
The objectives concentrate on implications of releasing synthetic organisms, cells or genomes into the environment. However, despite the best intentions of this convention, their findings seem orientative, not leading to major changes in policy worldwide - countries and regions maintain their own way of regulating synthetic biology. For example, the USA is not bound by the CBD decisions, and other wealthy countries with strong biotech industries oppose them (UK, Australia, Brazil, etc.)
With respect to biofilms, specific regulations are almost non-existent. One of the causes for this regulatory gap is political and industrial lack of understanding of biofilms.
Regulations (of biofilms) are non-existent in North America, and still in their infancy in most of Europe.
Jonathan Tyler, CEO Tyler Advanced Corrosion Technologies, Questionnaire on Biofilms and 3D biofilm printing.
The biofilm industry is generally regulated with respect to bacteria present in the biofilm. Thus, diverse regulations may apply.  A special case appears when conducting clinical studies; regulations are very strict. Clinical studies are investigations on humans intended to discover or test the effects of medicinal products (European Commission, 2001). We found out from both interviews and regulatory documents that this type of studies are cumbersome because of regulations, research being possible on in strictly controlled and licensed environments.
Almost all microbiological research is currently based on in vitro models, which have nothing or very little to do with what is observed in clinical samples.
Steffen Eickhardt, Head of Biofilm Test Facility, The University of Copenhagen.
This is a gap that Biolink could fill - if bioprinted biofilm testing reliability could get closer to that of clinical testing, we would have an easier and safer way to test products. Instead of having to pass through strict regulations of clinical testing in order to ensure the highest quality of a test, artificial test conditions could be created with 3D-printed biofilms. The same regulations do not apply for printing biofilms, because experiments do not involve any human or other living test subjects (except bacteria)."

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Help with surveys
Penn State & Warsaw Team
This year Penn State iGEM team created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Agriculture. The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a lysis device, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs. USTC Software iGEMers are happy to be participants in the survey, and we wish a good result will come out! We also help team Warsaw fill out their survey forms.

Overview
This year, team Tsinghua-A utilized synthetic biology’s techniques to build up a system in S. cerevisiae to produce the H4 histamine receptor which is able to induce the pheromone responsive pathway and measure the histamine concentration in isolated human blood. The chassis in our project is a yeast strain derived from CEN.PK2-1C. To increase the coupling efficiency in the system, yeast Gpa1 gene was modified by substituting the five amino acids of its C terminal end with its mammalian Gα counterpart. Our professors, Zhen Xie, Xiaowo Wang, and Peng Li, are experienced in E. coli and S. cerevisiae genetic engineering experiments. (They all have been working as researcher or professor for at least 7 years.) They gathered us to learn the safety rules and to clean and sterilize the lab regularly. They also help us to learn how to use the toxic reagents, how to play sterile working.
General Safety Training
Before we started our experiments, all of our team members responsible for the wet-lab experiments received detailed and rigid training on biosafety and lab safety from Wang. The training included standard experimental procedures, usage of biosafety cabinets and normative disposal of experimental waste etc. As for the safe use of instruments, all the experiments are performed under the guidance of lab instructors which successfully lower the potential risk. As for the waste treatment, our lab is secure with a waste-dealing system that guarantee the waste fully decomposed or going to the right place.
Chassis Organism Safety
The escape of S. cerevisiae strain used in experiment may cause allergy to colleagues by forming aerosol in the air. But these deserters will not suffer long despite lab environment due to auxotroph characteristic of certain strain. As for E. coli, the same allergic effect, water pollution and pollution to other lab organic materials may act as a result of escaping and further generation. Since our strain does not hold a proliferate feature, dominance of"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Cameron Brodie
Cameron Brodie is a former professional swimmer, Scottish Record Holder (6x), British Champion (2015) and Commonwealth Games Medalist (2x), who performed at this top level next to his studies at the University of Stirling. He has only had experience with urine tests, the preferable testing method. However, he did say that blood tests would not be a huge problem, since as an athlete being in the competition is worth that.
Figure 7. The paths we travelled by train throughout The Netherlands to engage in discussions with people.
“If blood testing necessary that is just the way it is, the testing is just inherent to sports and as an athlete all you want is to be in the competition so you have to comply. ”
According to Brodie, the pressure to perform well is “really tough”. He can imagine young athletes being vulnerable to people approaching them with gene doping opportunities. It was only in lectures of his sport related University study program that he first learned about gene doping. He himself, would not like to use it though, because one cannot oversee the consequences.
Moniek Nijhuis
Being rewarded for your hard work is valuable for sporters. Moniek Nijhuis, finalist Olympic Games 2012 and medalist at multiple European and World Championships, told us her story about one of the bronze medals she won at the European Championships 2013. Two years later, this bronze medal turned out to be worth silver due to doping usage by one of her opponents. However, her moment of euphoria on the stage, which is the moment that sporters are striving for, will never return.
“I just wanted to know that what I achieved is purely due to my own power and efforts. That still makes me feel good and at peace.”

We contacted several sports organizations including the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a sports psychologist, Jef Brouwers. Both were not aware of any cases of Gene Doping. Mr. Brouwers did indicate however that he is aware of athletes carefully selecting their partners to have children that hopefully will perform well in sport again.

Fig.11 BLOOMING MODEL
This model is actually an extension of the previous model. Simplify the 5CB into one side of the                         polygons. As the molecular shells increases, the angle between the two sides of the polygon will                         tend to be 90°.
Calculation
1. Obtain the spacing of 5CB molecules
The forces between two molecules are covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metal bonds, hydrogen bonds and                         Van der Waals force. Because no other forces are present, the main force is Van der Waals force.                         The point at which the force becomes repulsive rather than attractive as two molecules near one                         another is called the van der Waals contact distance. Van der Waals force includes electrostatic                         force, dispersion force and induction force.
Fig.12 van der Waals potential energy
We can use a simplified formula: the Lennard-Jones potential[1].
$$E=\frac{A}{r^{12}}-\frac{B}{r^6}$$
where \(A=4\epsilon\sigma^{12}\), \(B=4\epsilon\sigma^6\).
However, there is no sigma Lennard-Jones parameters (Angstrom) epsilon Lennard-Jones parameters                         (kcal/mol) about 5CB, so we calculate the van der Waals contact distance(\(r_0\)) by statistical mechanics[2].
In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function \(g(r)\) in a system of particles                         (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from                         a reference particle.
Fig.13 The sketch map of radial distribution function
The radial distribution function:
$$\rho g(r)4\pi r^2=dN$$
where \(\rho\) is the density of 5CB, \(N\) is the total number of 5CB molecules. Integrate the                         above formula:
$$\int_0^\infty \rho g(r)4\pi r^2 \mathrm{d}r=\int_0^N\mathrm{d}N=N$$
$$g(r)=\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\rho 4\pi r^2}$$
Molecular dynamics calculation:

CAT-Seq Esterase homology model
In-silico description of CAT-Seq Esterase
First, we wanted to determine the type of Esterase enzyme we have. For that reason, we have performed an initial sequence and literature analysis. We have recognized that our enzyme contains a 29-amino acid tannase “signature” sequence starting with “GCSTGGR”, which was described by Banerjee et al:
Figure 1. Sequence alignment to tannase family HMM consensus (PFAM: PF07519)
Accordingly, the CAT-Seq Esterase is most similar to the currently known Tannases and Feruloyl Esterases.

Identifying the Active Site
The template search for the homology model using HHpred revealed two potential hits - two feruloyl esterases (PDB ID: 6G21 and 3WMT ) which had 43% and 40% sequence similarity to our Esterase. Yet, only one of the templates contained a corresponding article released by the time of our homology model generation, however as the templates are homologous, a more similar template, 6G21, was selected.
After choosing the template, initial sequence alignments were constructed using MODELLER. As the quality of homology models highly depend on the quality of their respective template-target alignments, we have performed minor adjustments to the template sequence by correcting the accidental gaps in secondary structures in order to ensure proper mapping of the target sequence to the template. Additionally, the calcium-coordinating motif cysteines C263-C280 and N-terminal C512-C534 were manually aligned to the template to ensure the disulfide bridge formation in the initial CAT-Seq Esterase homology model.
As described in literature, 3WMT template is a serine hydrolase with an Active Site catalytic triad consisting of Serine, Aspartate and Histidine. Since all three sequences align well, we could also identify the catalytic triads for the template 6G21 and our CAT-Seq Esterase, consisting of Ser195, Asp429, His467. The sequence similarities and the positions Catalytic Triad amino acids are highlighted in the illustration below (Fig. 2).

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Inhibition Model_-_-_TEXT.html," can be immediately primed again with random hexamers. The re-priming of DNA template happens every few iterations of synthesis. Each site housing a Guanine nucleotide acts as a potential spot for modified nucleotide incorporation.
The incorporation of nucleotides is based on the probabilities set by initial ratios of the substrate and reference nucleotides. The model assumes that incorporation of the modified nucleotide into a DNA sequence during replication initiates the termination and dissociation of the phi29 polymerase from the DNA template. Every incorporation of Substrate Nucleotides is followed by a probability recalculation.
Using different ratios of the substrate and reference nucleotides as an input, the distribution of DNA fragments was generated. Because the kinetics parameters and features of phi29 polymerase and multiple displacement amplification reaction are complex and not quite understood, the generated data was normalized to the output distribution of DNA fragment size when zero substrate of nucleotides.
Figure 1. Normalized mathematical model output DNA fragment distribution.
The distribution of DNA fragment size for different initial substrate and reference nucleotide ratios was generated using the mathematical phi29 model. The data is normalized to the distribution output generated with zero substrate nucleotides.
As seen from the distribution violin plots shown in figure 1, the increase of potentially inhibiting substrate nucleotide concentration (its ratio to reference nucleotides) decreases the fragment size distribution as expected. Such amplification inhibition and reduced DNA fragment size distribution could pose a difficult task during the Nanopore sequencing of amplified DNA product and short sequencing read mapping and analysis.
Experimental validation
Now that we are aware of such possible degree Substrate Nucleotide inhibition, we set out to test and titrate the possible nucleotide concentration and ratios used in CAT-Seq workflow for best possible DNA fragment distribution results.
Figure 2. Amplified DNA correlation to substrate nucleotide concentration in the reaction.
DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750µM dNTP concentration with varied substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of substrate nucleotides the amount of DNA amplified increases as seen by the increased intensity of the DNA band and smear.
First of all, the lower limit of substrate nucleotides (Sub-dCTP) was determined. MDA reactions were performed with different dNTP and substrate-dCTP concentrations and the amplified DNA was analyzed on agarose gel. Results shown on Fig. 2 hint that large concentrations of substrate-bound nucleotides might inhibit the reaction, as the larger amplified DNA product bands fade as more substrate nucleotides are added, just as the model predicted.

Background
Human existence on earth is almost impossible without the heavy metals. Even though important to mankind, exposure to them during production, usage and their uncontrolled discharge into the environment has caused lots of hazards to man, other organisms and the environment itself. Heavy metals can enter human tissues and organs via inhalation, diet, and manual handling. As the process of urbanization and industrialization goes deeper and deeper, heavy metal pollution, a noticeable threaten to almost all the creatures, has become an essential problem to solve.
According to our human practice, the situation of heavy metal pollution (copper and cadmium ions) is marked on a world map, and the severity of heavy metal pollution has been increasing all over this map. Places with serious pollution include middle Asia, eastern Asia, southern Europe, and Latin America. In addition, not only fresh water source, but also soil and crops are seriously contaminated by heavy metals. On average, during three out of ten suppers we have, we absorb excess heavy metals over the standard concentration.
Considering the rigorous situation we face, our team decided to design an advanced system for typical toxic heavy metal disposal based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Mating-type Switch and Mating Switcher
OVERVIEW
We found there might be revolutionary usage about the mating type switch (MTS) of yeasts in our heavy metal deposition system. Whereas, in laboratory, the species of budding yeast we usually use are BY4741 and BY4742, whose HO gene are knocked out. Therefore, we intended to use two groups of MATa yeasts to realize the mating switcher by a specially designed system.
One of these groups was required to achieve MTS. We decided to achieve MTS by introducing the HO gene into this group of yeasts— Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4741, in our lab, whose chromosome Ⅹ has been switched by synthetic chromosome Ⅹ. And it has been renamed as SynⅩ similarly hereinafter). To make the MTS controllable, it was necessary for us to adopt inducible promoters to initiate the expression of HO gene or create a pathway functioning as single gene regulator. Eventually, we landed on the Gal1 promoter first, for its convenience and efficiency. As"

We attempted to run the enzyme treatment on the 96-well plate seeded on 6/21, however in washing the cells the biofilms were significantly disturbed and a significant amount of biofilm was removed in the wash. Using a pipetter on the flat-bottom wells is not working well. We will attempt to use a syringe on the next washes to see if this will help limit the disruption and loss of biofilm during the washes.

We setup restriction digests for AmyA and pJG 648 (pet15b vector). Digests were left overnight in the 37 degree water bath. 30ul of each DNA plasmid was used along with 2ul of each restriction enzyme (BamH1 and Nde1.)

iGEM Hamburgo - Gérmenes resistentes y cómo combatirlos – Tec Chihuahua - Spanish
Las estimaciones de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, predicen un resurgimiento de las bacterias a su punto más antiguo perdido entre las enfermedades humanas más devastadoras. ¿Cómo llegó hasta aquí? El descubrimiento de la penicilina en 1928 por Alexander Fleming llevó a una drástica disminución de las muertes relacionadas con la infección durante el siglo 20, y desde entonces los científicos han desarrollado una amplia gama de antibióticos para tratar eficazmente las infecciones bacterianas. Durante mucho tiempo fuimos capaces de combatir la mayoría de las amenazas bacterianas, lo que conduce a una noción de falsa comodidad y de que todo está bajo control. Sin embargo, tenemos que hacer frente a una nueva era ‘post-antibióticos’, pues en bacterias, las resistencias a antibióticos han estado incrementando con una velocidad incomparable. Y esto se debe gracias a que los esfuerzos de investigación actuales, están dirigidos a continuar con métodos convencionales de antibióticos.  Ahora, estamos llegando al punto de inflexión en el que se requieren nuevas estrategias para superar la multi-resistencia e impedir una segunda era de infecciones mortales. En 2016, una de las primeras infecciones con resistencia a todo: Klebsi"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system.

Resistance increases in higher frequencies, because of the skin-effect in metals: the strip transforms into an antenna. But as we were going to use only low frequencies, this didn't affect us.
Frequency impact on membrane conductivity
Before measuring the conductivity of multiple membranes, we needed to have an overview of the impact of the frequency on the conductivity of a membrane. We tested two gold-coated membranes.Function generator was set on sine. The physical quantities measured here are Eg, the generator's tension amplitude and Ep, the voltage difference between the extremity of the platinum wire outside the well chip and a point on the edge of the membrane of the chip. the quantity calculated here is 20*log(Ep/Eg) for different frequencies.
Results
Figure 34: Conductivity of a platinum wire for different frequencies
Interpretation
Voltage difference calculated is very low, indicating a very good conductivity for the gold-coated membrane. Technically, we measured the conductivity of the system membrane+platinum wire, but we showed that the wire's conductivity could be neglected. Resistance increases in higher frequencies, again because of the skin-effect in metals. But as we were going to use only low frequencies, this doesn't affect us, and moreover, the frequency response is flat for wide range of low frequencies .
Membrane conductivity
We measured the conductivity of 6 membranes on PDMS well chips (2 gold-coated, 1 bare alumina oxide, 1 PEDOT:PSS-coated, 1 PEDOT:Cl-coated, 1 PEDOT:Ts-coated). Here we show the electric circuit that we used for the following experiments.
Figure 35: Electric circuit used for the different conductivity measurements
Function generator was set on square at 200 Hz. The physical quantities measured are Eg, the generator tension amplitude, and Ep, the amplitude of the voltage difference between a point on the membrane inside the well and the extremity of the platinium strip outside the well. Tension amplitude of the resistor is given by Er = Eg - Ep. Current flowing through the electric circuit is calculated with I = Er/R. Conductivity of the membrane is given by I/Ep. Conductivity of each membrane was measured 3 times.
Results

Interpretation
Bare alumina oxide and PEDOT:PSS-coated membranes show similar conductivities, indicating the incomplete coating of PEDOT:PSS on alumina oxide membranes."

Week 8 (June 19 - June 23, 2017): Run Controls and Digest gBlocks
We received streak plates of E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli DH5α containing pET29b(+) vectors from Dr. Wong’s lab. These stock plates were used to streak fresh plates of the E. coli. Glycerol stocks of these cells were also made to preserve them. We made overnight cultures of the E. coli DH5α and performed plasmid miniprep to obtain pET29b(+) vectors. When we tested the plasmids on the NanoDrop, the samples were contaminated and did not show high concentrations. We decided to re-make overnights of the E. coli DH5α and then perform plasmid miniprep again. This time, the NanoDrop results showed a successful miniprep of the pET29b(+) vectors. These pET29b(+) vectors were stored in the -20°C freezer.
Week 9 (June 26 - June 30, 2017):
We performed diagnostic testing of NotI in CutSmarttm buffer and HindIII in Fast Digest Buffer with RFP plasmids from the iGEM registry. Diagnostic testing was done because the manuals outlined digestion of NotI in Fast Digest Buffer and HindIII in CutSmart™. We wanted to see if one of the buffers would work for both restriction enzymes. We then ran the digests on 1% agarose gel. The results showed that the digest of NotI in CutSmart™ worked and that FastDigest Buffer did not work. This meant that we could use CutSmart™ buffer for both restriction enzymes. The resulting gel electrophoresis is shown below.

After we tested that the restriction enzymes are functional, we digested our PhaC and PhaBA gblocks from IDT and our pET29b(+) plasmid following the Restriction Digest protocol with the enzymes listed below and ligated the digested parts following the Ligation of DNA Inserts to Plasmid Backbone protocol.

Mentoring TMMU-China
It was the first time for TMMU-China to take part in iGEM, so they had something unfamiliar about it. We provided a vigorous support for their project from beginning to end.
In March of 2016, we attended a meet-up hosted by The Third Military Medical University (TMMU) to discuss on some issues about iGEM.
We introduced the concepts and rules for iGEM in detail, and we also talked about some crucial points that should be paid attention to. Having had two years’ experience of taking part in the iGEM, we also shared our own lessons that we got from iGEM.
During the meet-up, both teams communicated and exchanged each other’s ideas through presentation, brainstorm and other methods. This discussion had brought us some inspiration for our own project this year.
The connection between us has accelerated the project's improvement. Meanwhile, it let us understand one of iGEM’s core value---collaboration, sharing and community.
Collaboration with NEFU_China
In August of this year, we went to NEFU_China and carried out an issue communication. They took advantage of magnet tool to purify protein, which would improve the yield and purity of some protein. This idea may help us reduce the complexity of the protein cas9 purification, so as to focus more on the miRNA detection method developments. Besides, they are also very interested in our project and describe it open, close to the forefront and worth their studying. Briefly, we are pleasant to have the communication with NEFU_China.

Collaboration with iGEM headquarters
In addition to the usual team collaborations, we communicated with the iGEM headquarters and pointed out that we had difficulties with the pSB1C3 plasmid vector sequence. A restriction digest of the backbone yielded more fragments than expected. Therefore we sequenced the whole backbone and found 7 mutations. Although the vector replicated fine and the antibiotic resistance was functional, we feared potential future problems and sent the correct sequence to the iGEM headquarters. Based on these findings iGEM headquarters introduced versioning of the plasmid backbones and our pSB1C3 was named pSB1C3_001.

We established a collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team ESBS-Strasbourg, who asked for our assembled Biobricks of YFP and CFP cloned into the standard pSB1C3 backbone. We sent out the plasmids so that they could use and test the plasmids for their cloning purposes. To expand our collaboration, the Strasbourg team visited us at our laboratory. Both teams made a presentation of their project and exchanged impressions and ideas about iGEM and the daily laboratory work. After that, we spent time together having a nice barbecue.

Improve the tolerance to high levels of ROS
Overview:
To block the response of yeast to ROS, we knocked out the yeast-derived yca1 gene. Because Yca1                         is the only known yeast metacaspase, to demonstrate genetically that Ndi1 functions                         independently of Yca1, we overexpressed Ndi1 in yca1 mutant background. Consistently,Ndi1                         overexpression exacerbated cell death in the absence of Yca1

Based on the result, we determined that there was no mistake in the process of knocking out yca1 gene and that the yca1 gene was knocked out indeed.
verify whether knocking out gene yca1 can increase yeast tolerance to H2O2
If the growth of Δyca1 and yno1-Δyca1 was better than that of WT and yno1, it                         can be concluded that knocking out yca1 gene can improve yeast tolerance to H2O2.                         We diluted seed liquid to OD600 at 2, which was Saccharomyces Cerevisiae of overexpressing yno1                         gene and lacking the yca1 gene (yno1-Δyca1) and strains of overexpressing yno1                         gene (yno1) as control group. And then adjust the concentration of H2O2 in the seed                         liquid to 0 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM respectively. The yeasts were cultured for 16h. Take samples                         every 2-4h. Its OD600 was measured by the ultraviolet spectrophotometer. OD600 reflected a                         growth of yeasts which can judge whether yca1 knockout can improve yeast tolerance to                         H2O2. The results are shown as follow:

Introduction:  The gBlocks and primers have all arrived.  They will be resuspended, and the initial amplification will be done.
Procedures:
Both primers were resuspended in TE buffer to a total concentration of 100uM.  A 10uM stock was then made by diluting in ddH2O.  The gblocks were resuspended in 200uL TE buffer to a final concentration of 5ng/uL.  A working stock of 1ng/uL was then made using water.
PCR: From NEB, the annealing temperature determined was 65C, so a temperature gradient was ran for each gblock amplification at 61C, 65C, and 69C.
A master mix was created for 6 reactions with the following reagents per reaction. 5x Q5 buffer, 5uL 2mM dNTP, 2.5uL 10uM PCquad prime 3.0 primer F, 1.25uL 10uM PCquad prime 3.0 primer R, 1.25uL 0.25uL Q5 polymerase 0.25uL of 1ng/uL template Water up to 25uL.
The master mix was made without the template, and 24uL were aliquotted to 6 PCR tubes.  The template was added individually to each PCR tube.
Thermocycle conditions: Initial denaturation: 98C, 30s 25 cycles of the following: 98C, 10s; annealing temp, 15sec; 72C 30s Final extension: 72C 5min Hold: 4C

Results and Discussion
Colony forming unit per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
Replicates of a starting overnight cultures were all diluted to OD600 and then serial diluted and plated. CFUs (colony forming units) were counted and assuming 1 bacterial cell will give rise to 1 colony, number of CFUs should directly correlate to concentration of cell culture. Figure 5 show our results.
Figure 5. Estimated CFU in a starting 1 ml sample of OD600 = 0.1. 1.1-4.3 are replicates of BBa_R0040 and BBa_I20270 which are the positive (1.1-2.3) and negative controls (3.1-4.3) respectively. CFU/mL was calculated by dividing the colonies formed on plates by its dilution factor. D4 is a dilution factor of 1/(8x105,) and D5 is a dilution factor of 1/(8x106).

The expectation was such that without LuxO D47E, the KT1144 cells would have basal levels of fluorescence, but upon the addition of the mutant, fluorescence would increase. This is because LuxO D47E mimics the phosphorylated and thus active form of LuxO and should bind to the qrr4 promoter and induce expression of GFP. Below depicts the results of the fluorescent readings and the protocol can be found under the figure.
Figure 2. Fluorescent readings when testing LuxO D47E mutants in KT1144 cells and testing the reporter circuit with functional LuxO D47E mutants. This graph is divided into two lines of cells and a positive control. The left hand bars depict the KT1144 cells with and without LuxO D47E. This graph shows that without the LuxO D47E mutant in the KT1144 cells, fluorescence reads at 267, whereas with the mutant, fluorescence reads at 4219. This increase in fluorescence shows that the LuxO D47E mutant is functional. These mutants can now be used to test the reporter circuit, which is shown in the next line of cells that shows reporter circuit with and without LuxO D47E in order to determine whether the reporter circuit is functional. Fluorescences levels increase upon the addition of the LuxO D47E mutant and therefore the reporter circuit is functional. See 'reporter circuit' on the side bar for more information on testing the reporter. The positive control is the TetR promoter followd by an RBS and GFP.

The GDC (GlyDH-DAK-ceaS2) pathway was designed in order to improve the ability of chassis cells                         to convert glycerol to DHAP and finally synthesize acrylic acid. We also added NOX (NADH dehydrogenase)                         and CAT (Catalase) to this pathway to provide the required reducing power for GlyDH by two layers                         of substrate circulation. Ultimately, GNCDC (GlyDH-NOX-CAT-DAK-ceaS2) is our desired new biosynthetic                         pathway of acrylic acid.
In order to determine the effect of the new route on the yield of acrylic acid before the wet experiment                         and to analyze the stability and robustness of the new route, we asked SCAU-China to help us did                         the work of metabolic flow modeling. We analyzed the changes of carbon flux of the two key intermediates,                         DHAP and G3P, before and after joining the new pathway. The modeling results show that the new pathway                         can increase the carbon flow of DHAP and G3P, thereby contributing to the increase in the production                         of acrylic acid.
the GNCDC(GlyDH-NOX-CAT-DAK-ceaS2) pathway for E.coli
the GNDC(GlyDH-NOX-DAK-ceaS2) pathway for S.cerevisiae
We used whole cell catalysis to carry out the initial acrylic acid synthesis ""fermentation"" process.                         The advantage of whole cell catalysis is that the intracellular complete multi-enzyme system can                         achieve the cascade reaction of enzyme, so as to make up the deficiency of cascade reaction in reaction                         which only uses pure enzyme and improves the catalytic efficiency. While eliminating the complex process                         in enzyme purification, it is easier to carry out the reaction and lower production costs.
We optimized the reaction process, selected the carbon source, buffer, temperature, pH, reaction                         time and other conditions to optimize the production process of the cell factory.
We also made Hardware (Click Here) to simulate the industrial production process of acrylic acid!"

CRISPR Interference Model
Motivation
We decided to create a model of the CRISPR system for two main reasons:
Identifying the parts of the network that could be targeted by our lab team to improve repression efficiency
To approximate time-series mecA repression data for use in modelling the overall vulnerability of a S. aureus population
Model Construction
After a literature review we were able to construct the CRISPR interference system network. The targeted single guide RNA (sgRNA) associates with nuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9) to form a complex that binds with the DNA complementary to the sgRNA target
. The bound complex prevents transcription elongation by RNA polymerase, repressing YFP mRNA expression
. The chemical network is shown below:
IMG: reaction netowrk
Using standard mass-action kinetics, the network simplifies into the following set of differential equations:
Differential System Here
The choice of a largely first-order model is supported by findings of several recent studies
. To simplify the model further, we made a quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) about the formation of  of the dCas9-sgRNA complex b. That is, we assume that dCas9 and sgRNA associate on a faster timescale than the other reactions (i.e. transcription, translation and the binding of the complex to the DNA). Therefore, we disregard the kinetics of the complex formation reaction and assume that it is always at steady-state relative to the other time-dependent species concentrations.  Under the QSSA, the concentration of the complex is given by:  see latex 4 equation  This is the same assumption made by previous teams
. Our model then simplifies to:  see latex 4 equation
Modeling Incomplete Repression
A recent study by Bikard et al
. found that maximal repression (on the order of 100 fold) was achieved when the promoter was targeted. However, targeting the promoter is not viable in this project since an essential promoter from elsewhere in the genome has been harnessed to produce the fluorescent promoter. Instead, we model the incomplete repression (ranging from 6-fold to 35-fold) observed when the off-promoter regions, specifically on the non-coding strand, are targeted.
There are two possible approaches for modelling the incomplete repression, each reflecting a different physical mechanism that allows leaky YFP expression. In the first"

Paul Mallaband and Stuart Bell from the team made up sporulation and germination medium and carried out imaging of the spores. They also carried out all relevant pcr, gibson and restriction ligation reactions to make a biobrick of the part.
Paul Grant from the Haseloff lab was instrumental in helping with imaging spores and gave advice on staining, slide preparation and microscopy.
Instrumentation
Andreas Petrides from the team led the development of the instrumentation kit along with Paul Mallaband. Electronics and Arduino code was tackled by Andreas, python code by Paul whilst both took part in the mechanical design and sourcing of materials. The testing of the instrumentation was done by Andreas with the aid of Thomas Whittaker who prepared the biological samples.
The python code was based on that submitted at http://www.blendedtechnologies.com/realtime-plot-of-arduino-serial-data-using-python/231 . All arduino code was developed by Andreas and Paul. The android application was implemented by Andreas, based on Amarino projects' open-source code (General Public License).
Mr. Tim Love from the engineering department gave advice on software design and the Engineering department helped with supplying some of the materials required. The actual assembly of the kit was done entirely by Andreas and Paul.
Ribosense
The fluoride riboswitch, with β-galactosidase reporter, was generously supplied, both in plasmid form, and as transformed cells, by the Breaker laboratory (See references in the project page as well as the special thanks page) at the University of Yale.
The plasmid supplied was then transformed into 168 strain B. subtilis, and Top10 E. coli, by Jolyon Martin from the team. He also carried out the β-galactosidase and Miller Assays.
The magnesium riboswitch was amplified up, using primers of our own design, from a prepared B. subtilis genome sample. This sample was provided by PJ Steiner of the Haseloff lab. Oliver Meacock, from the team, then pieced this amplified DNA into pJS130, a shuttle vector also provided by PJ Steiner. Oliver Meacock also carried out the characterisation assay for the magnesium riboswitch.
All relevant primers for each riboswitch were designed by Jolyon Martin and Oliver Meacock in parallel. All PCR reactions, restriction digests, and other experiments using these parts were carried our by the pair.

Figure 12: Evolution of bioluminescence intensity for each replicate depending on the logarithm of the toluene concentration injected 5h30 before.
As shown on the graph, the obtained data differ from one replicates to another due to difference in the metabolism which is normal when working with living organism. However the curve profile stay is the same : the bioluminescence intensity of the sample increases until a toluene concentration of 10 µg/,  then it reaches a plateau for two replicates and continues to increase for the other replicate.
Those results were pooled in order to draw a standard curve and being able to predict toluene concentration in a sample according to the bioluminescence intensity.
Quantification of environmentally relevant toluene concentration
The Figure 13 shows the evolution of the bioluminescence intensity depending on the logarithm of toluene concentration. For a toluene concentration inferior to 10 µg/L (10,000 ng/L : log(4)) the curve increases steadily, then the curve reach a plateau. This can be due to gaussia accumulation in the cells.

Conclusion and Future Work
Further work is needed to optimize the conditions for the expression of haemoglobin A. This has proved difficult and has been one of the biggest challenges in the lab for the blood detector aspect of FluID. To do this we could alter growth conditions such as temperature to decrease the rate of protein synthesis and hopefully lead to a more soluble protein being expressed. We could also alter the concentration of IPTG added to induce protein over expression or add sucrose to help stabilize the protein structure, this works by increasing the osmotic pressure within the E. coli cells leading to the expression of osmoprotectants which stabilise native proteins.
We would also hope to thoroughly test the interaction of haptoglobin with haemoglobin both in vivo and in vivo as well as both attached to and separate from a flourosphere to see whether fusion of haptoglobin to a fluorescent particle might alter the protein-protein interaction in any way. This would involve competing our crosslinking experiments of haptoglobin to haemoglobin alpha and beta using two different fixing agents - DSS (disuccinimidyl suberate) and formaldehyde.
DSS reacts with primary amines which are generally found on lysine side chains and the N-terminal of the peptide chain to form amide bonds. While, formaldehyde, a classic fixative, also reacts with primary amines to form Schiff bases, and with amides to form hydroxymethyl compounds which can condense with another amide moiety to form methyl diamides.
To fully test the interaction in vivo our bacterial two hybrid screen would need to be completed. So far we have managed to test haemoglobin alpha with haemoglobin beta together and haptoglobin together with haemoglobin alpha. However, this has only been carried out in one configuration meaning we would need to repeat these experiments with our proteins fused to the opposite T18 or T25 fragment. Because the plasmids encoding these fragments have different copy numbers, the results from our assay could be affected by this. Steric hindrance may also occur in only one configuration so both need to be tested to avoid a false negative result due to this. We would also need to test haptoglobin against haemoglobin alpha to complete the bacterial two hybrid screen.
Finally, it would be great to be able to test our devices sensitivity. To do"

20% w/v dope extruded into 70% ethanol succeeded
nominal extrusion rate of 16 uL/min
I say nominal because the screw drive clearly isn’t advancing
I see now why professional fiber spinners use piston pressure instead of a drive screw syringe pump
I had to pull the coagulating mass out of the way of the dope that was continuing to advance out of the PEEK tubing
hence, at some points the fiber is thinner (but still intact)
nevertheless, even without pulling on the dope, a fiber would still form right out of the tubing
Some confounding variables:
I have no idea what pressure the pump is applying to the syringe since the drive block is not moving at all
Time may be a variable: this had been pumping for a long time before this particular experiment. Maybe all of the air bubbles from yesterday have already been purged?
Things to take care of next:
construct a robust set up where dope coming out of the tube will have adequate space so that it doesn’t hinder the dope coming out of the peek tubing
try it on silk!
construct a post-spin stretch system. This will alleviate the problem of coagulated dope interfering with dope that’s still coming out
additionally, we’ll need to have this set up anyway for silk
Once again, tried 20% w/v dope extruded into 70% ethanol, this time with the syringe pump oriented vertically
gravity pulled already forming fibers out of the way, allowing fibers to continue to form."

2. Prepare for salicylic acid induction verification
(1) The whole experiment can be done in 3-5 groups. In the ultra-clean platform, the cultured bacterial liquid is divided into several 20ml large centrifuge tubes, each tube is filled with 2ml. Note that when the bacteria is filled, the large centrifuge tube is placed. The lid is removed, wrapped with a sealing film, and the rubber band is tight (because the sealing film can be ventilated, if the lid is covered with oxygen, it will be insufficient)
(2) Add salicylic acid to make the salicylic acid concentration in the system 0mg/L、0.001mg/L、0.01mg/L、0.1mg/L、0.3mg/L、0.5mg/L、1mg/L.

3. Looking for the optimal concentration of salicylic acid induced expression
(1) After recording all the data, calculate the fluorescence intensity per unit OD of each sample (fluorescence intensity / OD)
(2) A scatter image of induced expression is obtained by plotting the fluorescence intensity per OD - salicylic acid concentration
(3) According to the obtained image, the optimal concentration of salicylic acid-induced expression is roughly judged, that is, the minimum concentration of salicylic acid when the fluorescence intensity per unit OD reaches the maximum value.
(4) If the value of the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the concentration of 0.001 mg/L is already the maximum value of the fluorescence intensity, then our gradient concentration setting is too high, the gradient concentration should be further set at 0.001 mg/concentration, and the above experimental procedure is repeated.

Despite the challenge of working on our iGEM project and carrying out these internships, we immersed ourselves in Cork’s synthetic biology community       and had an amazing summer. Our iGEM project was not just a research project - we became part of the community and have helped it to grow.
Interviews
Interview with Cathal Garvey
As we have mentioned above, IndieBio EU is a startup accelerator focused on biotechnology and synthetic biology based in Cork City. The Cork iGEM team and the Indie Bio wet labs are both based in University College Cork. IndieBio is an example of how the theoretical, ideological aspects of synthetic biology can become a practical and commercially-viable reality through funding and mentorship. This is interview is an attempt to learn about the person who runs the programme.
Cathal Garvey is the Director of IndieBio EU.
His work includes co-founding Forma Labs, a community lab in Cork City and Ireland’s first biohacker space and working as curator of Grow Your Own, an exhibit on DIY biology at the Science Gallery Dublin. He is also known as the inventor of the DremelFuge, a small 3D printable centrifuge. The plans are online for anyone to access.
Cathal discussing how he first got involved in DIY Biology
At the same time that he was feeling ""dissatisfied"" with his PhD work in cancer biology, Cathal encountered the DIY biology community online.     ""...I saw that there were people around the world just getting involved in biology under the heading DIY Bio and a lot of these people had not gone to university like I had. Now there’s two ways you can approach this – a lot of people who have become card carrying professors of whatever often feel that when their discipline gets co-opted outside academia, outside industry, or outside the normal strictures I think that they feel a bit threatened. They think, ‘I became an expert at this …and I became the sort of person that generalists come and talk to by working really hard for years so you shouldn’t be able to call yourself a molecular biologist without going through the same difficulty that I did. So… the other way of approaching this is ‘I love my field and I want to see it become more important in society and that’s never going to happen as long as people can only get involved after eight years in college.""

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.      It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",     and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,     and theological speculation throughout history.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

Cyanobacteria
Introduction
Cyanobacteria are gram negative photosynthetic bacteria that have the unique ability to also fix atmospheric nitrogen gas into a biologically useful form. As such they are one of the few truly autotrophic organisms in regards to carbon and nitrogen nutrition. In this project we are engineering the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC 6803, to provide glucose as a carbon source for a biofuel producing E. coli strain. The rationale behind this effort is that if successful we will be able to decrease the cost of growth medium and develop a self-sustaining feeder system that can be adapted to existing microbial fermentation systems that have been optimized for the production of biofuels and other high value compounds. Synechocystis PCC6803 was chosen for this project because it is widely used as a model cyanobacterial system. As such it, it has numerous resources available to the investigator including facile and established transformation protocols and a completely sequenced genome"

Resume
Notre projet a pour objectif de maximiser la productivité de la photosynthèse pour une culture de Rhodobacter sphaeroides à la fois élevés et faibles intensités de lumière dans un bioréacteur par la régulation de synthèse de la taille de la lumière-récolte antenne. Nous avons choisi d'entreprendre un tel projet dans R. sphaeroides en raison de son bien caractérisés et de génétique de la photosynthèse. Le système d'antenne fonctions d'étendre le spectre de la lumière disponible pour la photosynthèse en absorbant des longueurs d'ondes différentes de celle du centre réactionnel. Essentiellement, il est comme le plat autour du récepteur principal de toute l'antenne. Marine bactéries, telles que R. sphaeroides, a évolué très grande antenne complexes à absorber la lumière dans un milieu naturel où il existe une grande concurrence pour les photons. En conséquence, le mécanisme de photosynthèse est un peu saturé à faible intensité de la lumière en une synthèse de non-concurrence, comme un bioréacteur. Cela entraîne jusqu'à 95% des photons accessoires pour être dissipée sous forme de chaleur ou de fluorescence par les bactéries à l'extérieur d'un bioréacteur à travers un processus appelé Quenching non photochimique (NPQ) (Mussgnug et al., 2007). En substance, ces photons sont gaspillés comme NPQ réduit la pénétration de la lumière dans un bioréacteur et prive les cellules"

Remaking of Starter Culture and Miniprep of Expression Vector
Starter Culture from 5/17 had an OD 600 of 3.1 for tube #1 and 3.0 for tube #2
This is too high, as the desired range is around 0.5 to 1.5.
Remaking starter culture. Picked 3 colonies from plate #2 (P+S 2) and incubated in 3 tubes with 10 ml LB and 10 ul 1000X chloramphenicol
Incubated at 37C starting at noon. (200 rpm)
At 2 pm, the OD was still essentially 0.
So apparently, I was reading the spec incorrectly.  I was using cuvettes, but I had forgotten to change the setting to ""10 mm cuvettes""
At 7:30 pm, (7.5 hours of incubation), the OD600 was 1.21
This is a little too high, as 0.8 is about optimal, but I went with it anyways.
Added 5 ml of the starter culture to 245 ml Difco LB and 250 ul of 1000X chloromphenicol to a 1L flask with the little ridges in the bottom for better aeration (baffled flask)
Incubate at 37C 200 rpm starting at 8 pm
At 10:40pm OD600 = 0.336
At 11:05pm OD600 = 0.441
At this point I added 1 ml of 100 mM IPTG to make 0.4 mM final IPTG concentration.
Placed back into the incubator starting at 11:10 PM

In their dynamic range, there is a 2.99 fold change in Fluorescence for PphoA and a 1.88 fold change in Fluorescence for PphoBR.
Comparing activities of PphoA and PphoBR
Figure 3. Comparison between PphoA and PphoBR GFP expression.
We selected PphoA for our construct. We compared the activity difference of two promoters for 0 and 250 μM of phosphate, as they are the minimum and maximum dynamic range suggested by Tokyo Tech 2013 iGEM team . Having The fold change of PphoA GFP is 2.99, which is greater than 1.88 of PphoBR. Therefore, we chose PphoA as it has a greater range, so it is supposed to have larger difference within a certain range.

Visit To Nankai
Human Practice is not only a bridge that connects the world in iGEM, but also a dynamo to transmit the idea of Synthetic Biology to the majority. As a novel scientific discipline, Synthetic Biology is not widely spread among the public, even in the young students. Our Human Practice popularizes the idea of Biology and Biosafety to two prestigious schools, Nankai University and Nankai Middle School. To bring Nankai University, whose School of Life Sciences enjoys high reputation for its research capacity, into iGEM and high school students with interest in Biology, a series of academic lecture and collaboration had been organized, aiming to popularize iGEM and Synthetic Biology.
Our visit to Nankai University
Biosafety Handbook & Regulation Summary
To extend our values, Focusing on Genetic Pollution, Seeking for a Safer Future, a lot of effort had been made in academic area. Drawing the materials of safety in last 4 years' iGEM as a blueprint and taking the modern idea of preventing gene contamination as a reference, a safety handbook, focusing on operation, social impact, and Synthetic Biology method has been published to provide more safety options for the specific area. What’s more, we hope to share our ideas with other teams by analyzing the importance of our project, AegiSafe O-Key , in Gene Safety area. The aim of Synthetic Biology is to apply engineering system to enrich the functions of cell. The crucial point is that how can we perform the ability of modified cells completely. Dring the whole process, the most important step is the construction of the regulation system. Some of the team in 2011 concerned the method of regulation as core part, and the others proposed a new regulation routine. By generalizing these ideas, we hope to produce a summary as a reference.
The Map & Modeling
This section enjoys the most notable part of our Synthetic Biology Museum. Our iGEM team from TJU drew a Synthetic Biology Map according to the development history of Synthetic Biology and focusing on some major breakthroughs and key scientists, which attracted more attention and popularized the idea of Synthetic Biology, the novel discipline.  What's more, we have built five models to analyze and evaluate genetic pollution towards the hazard of gene contamination, the influence on public attitude, the universality of environment problem, the publicity degree of the project and the completeness of the project respectively.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," backbone via PCR with the iGEM specified primer design and specified RFP part. We were able to overcome this problem by carrying out some of their cloning in our lab using their AMP generator and our plasmid backbone which we made by restriction digest of uncut plasmid followed by gel cleanup. While we were doing this St Andrews carried out the same cloning cycle in paralell but using backbone they had generated by PCR. This confirmed that the source of the odd behaviour shown by the St Andrews ligation reactions and by their transformants was likely due to the method of backbone production.
Our troubleshooting experiments led to us being able to provide the St Andrews team with a plate of bacteria containing their part on the desired backbone. Further cooperation between the teams will take place over the coming weeks in order to determine why the PCR based backbone amplification procedure was not working as it should. It was really great to share our time and resources with them, and we hope there will be a good relationship between the two teams in future iGEM competitions. We wish them the best of luck for the Jamboree.
Software Advice for other European Teams
Our computer scientists were able to help the TUM iGEM team by offering software advice. Having had difficulties to embed Javascript on their wiki, the TUM team tweeted for assistance. The computer scientists on the Dundee University iGEM team were very happy to help. They tweeted back giving a detailed explanation of what needed to be done. Having followed our advice they tweeted back stating that it was successful. It was interesting to interact with another iGem team we hadn’t met, following the iGEM spirit. We’re excited to meet the team in Amsterdam.
Submitting Our Parts
When submitting our biobrick parts, we took care to make the parts easily accessible to teams of the future. With new research still carried out into the way the BMC is expressed, and which features are required to form a fully functioning BMC. We hope that by submitting the structural components separately we can encourage other teams to experiment further, for example with the order and composition of the operon.
Safety Concerns
Essentially our project is about safety, as we feel at its heart it addresses a fundamental area of synthetic Biology. Arguably one of the biggest problems associated with Synthetic biology is the potential release of genetically engineered machines (GEM) into the environment. We feel that this fear is sometimes justified, and sometimes not. We believed that any step that could reduce the reliance on released GEMs is a step in the right direction. We investigated the use of our Sphereactor as a cell free"
