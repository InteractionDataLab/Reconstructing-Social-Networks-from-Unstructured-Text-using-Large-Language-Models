Figure 5. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for defensin 1. a) B. subtilis challenged with low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with defensin 1 and total proteins of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3). b) S. pyogenes challenged with low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with defensin 1 and total proteins of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3).
With the development of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, it was observed that there was partial inhibition by both total protein extracts. It is probable that some proteins of E. coli BL21 (DE3) are toxic for B. subtilis and S. pyogenes, which allowed their inhibition. However, the protein extracts of the bacteria transformed with the composite for the expression of defensin 1 showed greater inhibition, supporting the premise that the peptide is present and its activity is as expected. B. subtilis was found to be more susceptible to total protein extract with defensin 1 than S. pyogenes at the end of 21 h. However, both bacteria were inhibited in a certain percentage by this extract compared to the negative control of the total protein extract of the non-transformed bacteria.
Apidaecin
B. subtilis (figure 2a) was treated with 28.52 μg/mL (LC) and 142.6 μg/mL (HC) of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with apidaecin. Also, it was treated with 29.565 μg/mL (LC) and 147.825 μg/mL (HC) of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) for negative control. A culture of B. subtilis was used as a negative control as well. At 21 h, both concentrations of apidaecin produced a decrease in OD600 compared to the untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) control. With the lowest concentration of total proteins with apidaecin OD600 decreases in 15.15% and with the highest one it decreases in 15.75%.
S. pyogenes (figure 2b) was treated with the same concentrations as B. subtilis. At 21 h"

Ligation
This procedure was adapted by the Northwestern iGEM 2012 team from OpenWetware . It doesn’t follow iGEM procedure on the Parts Registry .
Materials
1.0 μL 10X T4 ligase buffer
6:1 molar ratio of insert to vector
We used 10 ng of vector.
(8.5 - vector and insert volume) μl nuclease-free water
0.5 μL T4 Ligase
Procedure
Calculating Insert Amount
Insert Mass in ng = 6 x (Insert Length in bp/Vector Length in bp) x Vector Mass in ng
The insert to vector molar ratio can have a significant effect on the outcome of a ligation and subsequent transformation step. Molar ratios can vary from a 1:1 insert to vector molar ratio to 10:1. It may be necessary to try several ratios in parallel for best results.
If there is more than one insert (3A or Standard Assembly), calculate for the same amount of insert as you would if there were only one insert.
Procedure:
Add appropriate amount of deionized H2O to sterile microcentrifuge tube
Add 1 μL ligation buffer to the tube.
Vortex buffer before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
Remember that the buffer contains ATP so repeated freeze, thaw cycles can degrade the ATP thereby decreasing the efficiency of ligation.
Add appropriate amount of insert to the tube.
Add appropriate amount of vector to the tube.
Add 0.5 μL ligase.
Vortex ligase before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
Also, the ligase, like most enzymes, is in some percentage of glycerol which tends to stick to the sides of your tip. To ensure you add only 0.5 μL, just touch your tip to the surface of the liquid when pipetting.
Let the 10 μL solution sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Let the solution sit at 16°C for at least 2 hours.
Store at -20 degrees C.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," fragmented and quickly  degraded in the blood it is important to as quickly as possible after blood withdrawal process the blood into plasma or serum ( Wong et al, 2013 ). Processing blood into plasma or serum is done by centrifugation, separating the blood in three layers: the red blood cells, the buffycoat containing the white blood cells and the plasma, as shown in figure 2 ( Thurik, 2016 ). The difference between plasma and serum is that serum is the liquid of the blood left after clotting, whereas plasma still contains the clotting factors and needs to be kept in EDTA lined tubes to prevent clotting. Due to the clotting, which damages the white blood cells, the serum has a higher concentration of cfDNA than plasma, as shown in table 1 ( Lee et al, 2001 ). The protocol for processing blood into plasma can be found here . Plasma and serum containing cfDNA can be stored frozen and stable for longer periods of time, up to years, without significantly lowering the concentration of the cfDNA ( Ginkel et al, 2017 ).
Table 1. cfDNA concentrations in human serum and plasma. Values obtained from Zinkova et al, 2017 .

Due to extra safety measurements and permits required for working with blood, we performed background cfDNA extraction on adult bovine serum as a proof of concept, instead of using whole blood and processing that into plasma. Extraction was done using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, as recommended by Aïcha Ait Soussan of the Dutch blood bank Sanquin, who are experts in the extraction of cfDNA for prenatal screening and provided us with their optimized protocol for the low cfDNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini (QIAGEN). Since the concentration of cfDNA is so low in plasma, the extraction columns were loaded with more sample than recommended in standard protocol, building up the DNA on the column before eluting.
Multiple extractions were performed after which they were quantified and verified. Also spiking of samples with artificial gene doping DNA was performed before extraction using the values obtained by the Gene Doping Model .

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," are used to at home in Ireland. This may be highly beneficial for bringing the Limitless lactis vaccine to market in the country as vaccines could potentially get from initial design to the market in under a year.
This system would ensure that we would have a much better chance of avoiding failure during preformulation studies and clinical trials and reaching the market than in Ireland, where often as low as 1 in every 10,000 compounds make it to the market following drug safety and efficacy studies (1). It would also open the opportunity that the vaccine could reach the suffering population of Honduras many years earlier than in the developed world (12-15 years), in which time it could save many lives and prevent the suffering of millions. In addition to this, the reduced expenditure on clinical trials and documentation during development could contribute to a reduction in the cost of the vaccine to the government, hence having an economical benefit to the country. This is especially important as public healthcare in the country doesn’t cover everybody due to lack of funds. Taking these points into account, the potential for the Limitless lactis vaccine to be utilised by the country seems very promising.
However, even with such benefits in place, we learned that a system like this does impose some challenges. Because the regulatory system is so irregular, there is almost no concern present there among the local healthcare authority for the quality, safety and efficacy of these systems.
Regulation is particularly important in medicines as inadequate regulation may put lives at risk. Because of this, we believe that us scientists and developers in the developed world who produce vaccines such as this have an ethical responsibility to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine before bringing it to the market in countries such as Honduras. The poor populations of the world are not lab rats, they are human beings, just like us, who require just as high a standard of healthcare as we do.
Choluteca, Honduras
Having investigated the issue of leishmaniasis with some of the main stakeholders in the country, our next focus centred on what is it really like in an epidemic area ? This question set us off to Choluteca, a province in the south west of the country, where leishmaniasis is prevalent. It was here where we encountered Fyffes who were a major employer in the area. Fyffes have demonstrated loyalty to the community by building a school and a hospital for the local populace. While in choluteca, we gathered information on the prevalence of the disease, the number of patients who seek treatment and factors that are thought to be involved in the spread of the disease.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," colonizers left Africa, e.g. after the independence of Congo from Belgium, the health system collapsed and Sleeping Sickness re-emerged. This shows that these countries largely rely on western NGOs. To this day, the WHO, other NGOs, and companies are providing free diagnostics and treatment for HAT patients in Congo. This is expensive and costs US$ 100-200 per patient.
Currently mobile teams leave from a central point, after which they travel up to 20 days a month to remote villages on motorbikes or 4x4s. The tests they are carrying is either the Card Agglutination Test, with a high false positive rate, or an antibody dipstick test, without positive control. It is important that our device does not need much equipment, is stable at 40 degrees Celsius and has a positive control.
Moreover, he gave some technical details on the detection limit of current devices, and on HAT protein production. He showed us the current tests and explained how they are exactly performed. Finally, some suggestions for alternative use of our device were made. For example to test antibiotic resistance or to be used in reference laboratories. Here, sensitivity of detection is more important than speed of producing a result.
He endorsed our 3D-printed device prototype and was surprised by the ease of use and to observe the fluorescence. He thought it would be a nice addition to quantify the fluorescent signal and to add an LED-screen. This is in line with the opinions of prof. dr. Wim van de Poel and dr. Jeroen Kortekaas in previous talks. Finally, he suggested to increase the readability of the text on the device, and to indicate the place to insert the controls and the samples.
He mentioned that a lot of research has already been done on HAT and a new diagnostic device is needed but does not have a high priority. However, because of the high research levels, it is an excellent way to prove that our device can be used in combatting parasitic diseases as HAT is a suitable placeholder and proof-of-concept.

See how we implemented this in our roll-out plan!
In our roll-out plan , we focused on educating the local population and took the infrastructure into account.
See how we adapted our device!
We added sensors to measure the intensity of the fluorescent signal and to visualize it on the LED-screen. More can be read on the device page .

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," beekeeper made this meeting really beneficial for us.   We learned every important stages in a bee life and how the varroa affected it.   We also learned more about the beekeeping activity and the treatments used to fight against the parasite.   Furthermore we have been able to discuss our early genetic design and how to improve it.
The conclusion of this meeting was that   the bacteria should not produce both attractive and toxic molecules at the same time. These   productions should be cyclic to have the least effect on bees life cycle since formate is also toxic at a lesser extent for bees.
05/25
During the whole week we searched for ways to produce our molecules cyclically. We chose to implement   a circadian rhythm cycle which would allow us to produce toxic molecules during the night when bees are a lot less active.
We also convinced Louise Gody to create our logo because she is capable of drawing with talent using a graphical tablet.
We also started to organise our search for financial help. To do so we designed a booklet explaining our project and what iGEM is.
June
06/01
We first started searching for genes that we would like to have in our constructions on the iGEM registry.
After we successfully designed our construct we started thinking about what our device would look like. Since our bacteria needed to perceive red light we decided to place our device at the entry of the hive but outside.
06/05
We realised that our the cloning part would be quite long because of the number of genes needed to obtain... We therefore decided to order synthetic sequences for our synthetic pathway constructions.
06/06
Laetitia Chaumont, Benoit Pons and Mathilde Beraud went to a laboratory studying varroa(Vacbio EA 4357). Dr. Vetillard allowed us to test the actual effects of different concentrations of butyrate on Varroa. The results were inconclusive. However two parameters had to be improved because butyrate is a very volatile molecule and we conducted experiments in a petri dish thus diffusion complicated the interpretation. Therefore, we decided to set up a more optimised protocol to assess the attraction of varroa by butyrate.

Wet Lab Overview
To achieve the expected results we discussed and proposed four plans: A) Free ferritins combined with RNA thermometer. B) MTS (Membrane Targeting Sequence)-Ferritins combined with Two Component System. C) Free ferritins combined with free inteins. D) A fusion of ferritin subunit and intein. For Mag-receiver and Thermo-regulator, we chose to construct ferritin ftnA and RNA thermometer first.
Mag-receiver
To obtain ftnA gene by PCR, Top 10 cells were cultured in LB liquid medium. After failing in PCR for several days, Jinyang Liang and Qikai Qin decided to extract genome DNA from Top 10 instead of doing PCR directly.
Fig.1. Lane 7 is DL 2000 marker. Lane 1-6 are PCR peoducts(ftnA) cloned from Top 10, used different concentrations of culture. The Agarose gel electrophoresis shows bands between 500bpand750bp, the target sequence band is expected at 500bp. The sequencing results validated the correctness of the PCR products.
Qikai Qin tried to assemble ftnA into T-vector, then Cun Wei and Renjie Shang transformed the plasmids into Top 10 cells to amplificate ftnA gene. It’s a pity that there were false positive phenomenon when using blue-white screen.
Thermo-regulator
The experiments were designed to test the performance of three alternative RNA thermometers.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part)After setting our four plans, we started to search for references about ferritin and nanoparticles. We wanted to find a specific method to calculate the heating power of the ferritins and adjust it into our project.
(Device Part)For the need of electromagnetic field, we decided to make a device to generate it.

Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," between two plasmids in a cell. There is an important variability, which drives the system away from orthogonality. Plasmids with identical origin of replication are not orthogonal per se . Although we can introduce different resistances to tune the system, it  is hard to stabilize the system due to the large variability. Plasmids with different mechanisms of replication might solve it but it is not guaranteed. Certainly, new plasmids must be designed to make engineered cells more reliable and predictable.
Open License
We model the susceptibility to patent a human creation by  $$ P.I. = M \cdot N \cdot A ^{log(\frac{A+I}{2})},  $$ where P.I. is the patentability index, M is the morality, which is a non-legal term accepted in the E.U., and N refers to novelty. Both factors are described by a discrete variable which can be valued 0 or 1 depending on the results of a questionnaire. A is the inventive step and I is the industrial application which can be valued from 1 to 10 depending of the  results of a test.
The Inventive Step is the most relevant variable but is regulated by the industrial application. The highest inventive step can be reduced by almost a factor 2 with the lowest industrial application. On the contrary, the lowest inventive step is not affected by the industrial application. After computing all the discussed factors, the patentability index can run from 0 to 10. The reader can find a detailed discussion of the questionnaires, tests, analysis of the index and references in the Open License section .
Applications to other projects
In our project, we have developed a tool that allows us to predict the stability of E. coli carrying a reporter gene (in particular, the stability when subjected to different temperatures). The variation of activity with temperature was described by:
$$ \begin{equation} \frac{A_{c}}{A^0_{c}}  = \prod_i \frac{V_i}{V^0_i} , \end{equation} $$  where $V_i$ is a temperature dependent factor, and Ac0 is the activity in reference conditions (in this case, 37 ºC).
We found ( see Stability ): $$ \begin{equation} \frac{Ac}{Ac^0}  = \frac{N_Pr}{N^0_Pr} =\frac{r_T}{r^0_T} \frac{r_P}{r^0_P}, \end{equation} $$ with $$ \begin{equation}"

c. Did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project?If so, describe this training.
All the team members had already been through extensive lab training and biosafety rules, because of previous experimental projects at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, DTU. It was therefore decided that the laboratory work could be initiated after signing the formula concerning CMB’s safety rules and writing the project description without further laboratory training.
d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?If so, provide a link to them online if possible.
In Denmark, specific laws and guidelines exist, that are to be considered when working with GMO. These guidelines are based on “Bekendtgørelse om genteknologi og arbejdsmiljø” (“The Order of Gene Technology and Working Environment) from 2008, which is based on guidelines/rules determined by the European Union (1). Our project has followed the guidelines and laws set by the authority in Denmark and the European Union. In conclusion, the organisms and biobricks used in this project do not represent any hazard to the researchers, when working in the laboratory or to the public safety. If the safety standard procedure is followed there is also no risk for contamination of the environment.

Fortunately, none of the code that remains to be written for the levels is very complicated. The Level Selection screen makes the levels and their parts available, the Home screen gives some basic guidance for each level, and the Parts screen makes supplementary objects, and replacement objects in case you happen to delete the ones you're working with (or wish to combine multiple levels' parts together. That will work just fine!) All three screens are necessary for the levels to work, and none have new or complicated features, it's mostly a question of adapting code I've already written for other purposes.
And all of that isn't even the last major portion of the island that needs to be developed! To support all of this biobrickery, users will first visit a zone describing the basics of molecular biology and biochemistry (in Second Life's interactive style). Katie is already working on a display of DNA replication for this zone. Also fortunately, each of the exhibits I have in mind are more or less stand-alone displays, as compared to the biobrick simulator where every part interacts with half a dozen others, so I don't anticipate it taking as long.
But, with development as with biology, a good safe bet is to multiply all your time estimates by three...

I ran the gene-specifc PCR with aiiA-F/R primers and ran it with a 1% gel at 100V.
I had contaminated my negative control (which was just the mastermix) with my aiiA gene. Since all three bands are around 756 bp, we can say that the gene exists.

Again, I couldn't get hold of other companies by phone but I left a message with a call back number. I also emailed those companies with a follow- up email. The good news is that Beckman Coulter has generously donated $200.00 to our iGEM Team this year. Unfortuantely, Alda Phamaceuticals Corporation is unable to sponsor our team this year.

GABA permease, 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, and 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, which are expressed by gabP, gabT, and puuE, can degrade GABA in metabolic pathway (Li). It will be a stronger approach to knock out these genes in E. coli’s chromosome, so GABA will not be degraded. Scaffold proteins play an important role in regulating the signaling pathways, and can help the protein kinase and phosphatase to react with their specific substrates (Ferrell). Thus, if we can synthesize scaffold proteins to regulate the GABA synthesis pathway, the yield of GABA will be improved.

Autobiography
A wartime childhood
I was born on August 27, 1928, in the town of Fukuchiyama, Kyoto-Fu, Japan. My father Chikara was an army captain of the Fukuchiyama regiment. In the spring of 1933, my father took a post in Manchuria, which was under Japanese occupation. Because there were some insurgents in the Manchurian area, my mother Yukie, my younger brother Sadamu, and I chose to stay in Japan and moved to Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, where we lived with my grandmother, Tsuki Shimomura. After the insurgents were wiped out, we moved to Renzankan, Manchuria in March 1935. A sister, Toshiko, was born there, but she died of pneumonia one year after her birth. I remember my mother's deep sorrow after Toshiko's death.
In early 1938, my father was transferred to an army position near the Soviet border. The rest of my family moved back to Sasebo. Mother soon departed to Manchuria again to live with my father, and Sadamu and I were in the custody of grandmother Tsuki for about one year. Because I was the elder son, Tsuki raised me carefully and strictly as the heir of the Shimomura family. Since I was physically not very strong, she tried to feed me various nutritious foods like omelet with ground beef and soybean milk. Grandmother was very strict about manners and etiquette. I always had to keep a good posture in her presence. She often said, ""the samurai betrays no weakness when starving."" After I bathed, she would check behind my ears and neck for dirt. If she found any, she would say it would be ignominious to be dirty when I was beheaded (it is sometimes honorable for a samurai to commit hara-kiri and then be be"

Cooperation
with Hubei University of Technology
    We established a close relationship with two iGEM teams of the Hubei University of Technology and the Shandong University in China, respectively, on both experimental design and collaborative research.
    The Hubei University of Technology (HUBT) participated in the iGEM and won the Bronze Medal in 2017, which is in the same city, Wuhan, China with our university. Two formal meetings with HUBT were held in the Hubei University, with the first one on December 1, 2017, and the second one on July 13th, 2018. Besides, there are continuous communication along with the whole process of our iGEM project. In the first meeting, the mentor and captains of 2017 HBUT-iGEM team shared their iGEM experience with us, including the team assembly, project execution, and the problems they encountered. In addition, they also gave valuable suggestions of our proposed 2018 iGEM project to help us understand better of the iGEM concept. At the end of the day, both two teams agreed to communicate further to build a closer relationship. In the second meeting with HBUT-iGEM team, both the team discussed the current progress of the iGEM projects. The HBUT-iGEM team members were inspired by our project goal and achievements, emphasized the importance of the work on wiki, and suggested to enrich the biological parts of the iGEM registry with Zymomonas mobilis, a unique non-model industrial microorganism. He also mentioned.
Cooperation with Shandong University
    This year, Team SKLMT-China invited us to help testing their promoters in different laboratory condition. They construct a promoter library characterized by firefly luciferase to improve pseudomonas fluorescens pf-5. Since this is a brand-new chassis for us, the cloning method is significantly different from our teams, as well as the experimental conditions. Therefore, we discussed a lot during the cooperation in transformation methods. Even if there were some problems with the experiment result , we still learnt so much from each other and were so happy to cooperate with each other. It really enriched the experience of our team, a newborn calf 2018.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into"

Background
Why we need biofuels
World needs energy!
“The year 2013 saw an acceleration in the growth of global energy consumption, despite a stagnant global economy. Economic growth remained weak nearly everywhere and relative to recent history it was weaker in the emerging non-OECD economies. In line with that economic pattern, energy consumption growth was below average in the non-OECD, driven by China, and above average in the mature economies of the OECD, driven by the US. Emerging economies nonetheless continue to dominate global energy demand, accounting for 80% of growth last year and nearly 100% of growth over the past decade.
 While consumption growth accelerated globally, it has remained below average – this is again, consistent with the weak global economic picture. Regionally, energy consumption growth was below average everywhere except North America. EU consumption continued to decline, hitting the lowest level since 1995 (despite economic growth of 35% over this period). ”[By Bob Dudley  Group Chief Executive and director of BP ]

Collaboration with NJU-China
NJU-China performed a Cas9-digest assay to help us validating the effectiveness of their sgRNAs, since our team met some trouble in assessing the efficiency of the single guide RNAs we designed for our further experiments. Also, they helped us to optimize our own protocol for in vitro expression of sgRNAs, so that our project could be performed more smoothly.
In return, we performed TEM imaging of exosomes carrying KRAS siRNA and expressing iRGD peptide on their membrane for NJU-China, as well as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to help them to ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity.
Collaboration with NJU-China
After co-transfection of the two plasmids mentioned above, we performed a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the iRGD-modified siRNA-loaded exosomes. The TEM image showed that the exosomes presented normal morphological characteristics after outside modification and siRNA loading, with a diameter of approximately 200 nanometer and a double-layer membrane. These characteristics indicate that the exosome properties won’t be affected by our modifications.

Nanoparticle tracking analysis to ascertain the relationship between protein concentration and exosomes quantity
We then performed nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for a further evaluation of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the extracellular vesicles, as nanoparticles can be automatically tracked and sized based on Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient. The size of exosomes attained ranged around 270nm. Basing the particle size and relative intensity, we also created a 3D plot for a visual explanation. Under measurement condition listed, the exosomes extracted from HEK293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter. Then the relationship between particle number and protein was determined that ex"

Athlete Education
As a response to our debate in Stirling as well as to the athlete interviews, we identified the need for athlete education when it comes to gene doping. Therefore, we contacted the responsible doping authority to discuss the implementation of gene doping education for athletes. The Dutch Doping Authority however indicated that they don’t want to address it as a separate topic, but see it integrated with the current education material. In Scotland in the mean time, prof. Dimeo and Dr. Henning are continuing the implementation of specific gene doping education.

Public Outreach
Train Debates
With selective social media messages, people tend to be informed only about their immediate interests. It can be enlightning to talk to people and engage in an open debate, especially on a topic not many people from the general public know about: synthetic biology! On June 26th we decided to bring the Biotechnology Day from Belgium to the Netherlands by engaging people in a debate on gene technology on trains!
“Gene technology is beautiful for medical purposes, but I oppose to its use for luxury purposes as sports.”

Our team split up in three teams that travelled throughout the country. For mutual learning and engagement it is important to have a public as diverse as possible, and where to find this better than on trains that travel throughout a whole country?

Our project’s aim is to create a toolbox for manipulating and creating customizable peroxisomes as a first step towards synthetic organelles.
By modifying the import machinery of yeast peroxisomes only selected proteins will be imported into the peroxisomes leaving the researcher in full control over the content of the peroxisomal lumen. Furthermore our toolbox will include a secretion mechanism for the synthesized products, various intra-compartmental sensors, modules for the integration of proteins into the peroxisome membrane, as well as optogenetic control for some of these parts for a more precise spatiotemporal control.
As a proof of concept for the functionality of the toolbox and the customizable compartment two metabolic pathways will be integrated into the altered peroxisome: (i) Violacein biosynthesis and (ii) nootkatone biosynthesis. Violacein, a bisindole formed by condensation of two tryptophan molecules, is a violet pigment and thus easy to quantify in the cell. Nootkatone on the other side is a natural compound found inside the peel of the grapefruit, which gives it its characteristic taste and smell. In addition, nootkatone is a natural mosquito and tick repellent that is already being commercially used and industrially manufactured. Unfortunately, the production costs are extremely high. Furthermore, the production of nootkatone inside yeast is challenging as it is toxic for yeast and thus, the production efficiency is rather low. A successful implementation of the synthetic compartment will show increased yields in the production of these compounds and showcase the potential of this approach for similar future applications.
Cloning strategies and the Yeast Toolbox for Multipart-Assembly
While describing our cloning strategies we mentioned several levels, which stand for different stages of our plasmids. They are further described in the work of J.M. Dueber and colleagues, who designed the well established yeast toolkit we used in this project (Dueber) .  The toolkit offers the possibility to design plasmids with desired antibiotic resistances, promoters as well as terminators from standardized parts. It also provides fluorescence proteins, protein-tags and many more useful components as part plasmids. These part plasmids are distinguished in different part types due to their specific overhangs to ensure their combination in the correct order (e.g. promoter - gene of interest - terminator) all in a versatile one-pot Golden Gate reaction without time-consuming conventional cloning steps.

However, even at 1g/L the liquid was a little yellow, so quercetin was at least slightly soluble.
We thought that the little quantity of soluble quercetin could be enough for growth, as long as the medium is agitated and the quercetin constantly solubilized during the consumption.
So we decided to start the assay anyway. Me managed to have relatively homogenous plate.
Results after two days
Growth results in plate:
The control plates with M9 showed growth until 10^(-3), that means that if we want to avoid carbon contamination in plate, we need to dilute the samples at 10^(-3) at least
The plate with M9 G always showed growth. Even in the more diluted samples there was microorganisms.
The plates with M9 QG showed less growth than the plate with M9G and there was no growth after a dilution of 10^(-3), it could mean that quercetin is toxic for some organisms.
The plates with M9 QG showed growth until a dilution of 10^(-2) because of the carbon contamination.
This part of the experiment seemed compromised as there was no growth in the condition M9Q at a dilution were there was no carbon contamination (below 10^(-3))
Growth results in tubes:
M9 growth with a dilution of 10^-2, the carbon contamiation is avoided with a dilution of 10^-3 and below.
M9 G groth in every tube, there is always microorganisms in the samples.
M9 Q and M9 QG, it is difficult to say, the quercitin is precipitated and it seams that the experiment is a failure, that the quercetin cannot be used in liquide medium, maybe because the agitation is too low.
Week 01th - 7th August
Results after a week in solid medium
The results were surprising. In the plates with dilutions of 10^(-2) and 10^(-3), with or without glucose, we could see transparent circles. The quercetin seemed to have disappeared. In the middle of these circles, there were always some microorganisms that looked like filamentous fungi, with the hyphae in the middle and spores in the whole circle.
It is to be noted that it is written that the dilution is 10^(-1). This is an annotation mistake. At the beginning"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html,". Therefore, the T3 RNA polymerase previously characterized by iGEM Peking 2010 was deployed. The T3 RNA polymerase is highly specific to T3 promoters and orthogonal to the E. coli DNA polymerases and even to the T7 RNA polymerase. We decided not to use the T7 RNA polymerase, because it is already part of expression strains like BL21 and would therefore prevent the application in such strains. The construction of our designed composite part comprising a standard mRFP reporter is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Construction of the standard mRFP reporter and the genetic circuit for the amplification of mRFP expression. In construct 1 the CDS fot the mRFP transcript is downstream the CDS of the gene of interest. In construct 2 the CDS of the mRFP is downstream a T3 promoter and the CDS coding for the T3 RNA polymerase is downstream the CDS of the gene of interest.
Figure 2 shows two reporter constructs for gene expression quantification. The first one is the standard reporter for the gene expression of the target gene, using mRFP as reporter gene. If the gene of interest is expressed, the mRFP is expressed at nearly the same level. The mRFP fluorescence reveals the gene expression of the gene of interest. This system is suitable for but also limited to high expression rates. Low, expression of the target  gene is associated with a low expression of mRFP and thus not visible.
The second system is our genetic circuit consisting of a CDS of the target gene upstream of the CDS for a T3 DNA polymerase encoding sequence. Therefore, the expression of the reporter gene is nearly on the same level as the expression of the target gene. The expressed T3 RNA polymerase transcribes the mRFP under the control of the T3 promoter.       To demonstrate the advantages of our improved construct, we modelled the amount of mRFP transcript for both constructs.       If we assume the expression of the gene of interest is low and only one E. coli RNA polymerase with a chain elongation rate of 50 nucleotides per second translates the both products, construct 1 produces 1 mRFP transcript in 16 seconds. Construct 2 expresses 1 T3 RNA polymerase transcript every 52 seconds.

A summary of the steps were as follows:
50ml of culture 1 was spun down for 10 minutes at 5,000g. The supernatant was aspirated off and the pellet was resuspended in 4ml Resuspension/RNAse solution.
4ml of lysis solution was immediately applied and after inverting the falcon tube 6 times, the solution was allowed to sit on the bench for 4 minutes. 4ml neutralisation solution was added once the time had expired and the tube inverted 6 times again.
3ml of binding solution was added and after 2 inversions the solution was placed into the filter syringe. With the plunger removed from the syringe, the lysate remained in the syringe for 5 minutes. During this time, 4ml of Column Preparation Solution was allowed to be run through the midiprep binding column (by centrifugation).
The plunger was then applied to the syringe and half of the lysate (which had been sitting in the syringe barrel for 5 minutes) was injected into the midiprep binding column. The binding column was placed in the centrifuge at 3,000g for 2 minutes and once the eluate had filtered through the remaining half of the lysate was added and treated in the same way.
4ml of Wash Solution 1 was then added to the binding column and centrifuged for 2 minutes for 2 minutes before 4ml of Wash Solution 2 was added and then placed in the centrifuge for 2 minutes again.
1 ml of Elution solution was then added to the midiprep binding column before the column was spun for 5 minutes at 3,000g. The eluate was then harvested at the bottom of the binding column and transferred to the freezer for storage.

Abstract
This year the project of BIT is about the alarm of breast cancer, based on early detection of the factors, miRNA155 and miRNA21. In the last six months, the work of human practice based on the project, made different kinds of activities. The activities about the practice including:
1.Making a questionnaire aims at surveying the public perceptions for breast cancer;
2.In the hospital we have a survey in order to get the information about the diagnosis condition of breast cancer;
3.Introducing IGEM and the project of our team in a conference held in the college and a high school.
Besides,Team BIT builds relationship with 5 teams and has a interactive communication with other 2 teams, and joined two different communication meetings during the summer vacation, getting many appreciation and comments.
Questionnaire
In order to make more people know team’s project, the meaning of iGEM and get some feedback from different persons about their opinions to breast caner. This year Team BIT issues an questionnaire through the Internet, with both Chinese and English versions and gets information after collecting the questionnaire. The questions are centered on the personal health, physical examination, the understanding of breast cancer and the team’s products. The questionnaire was distributed online in March 2016, ended in October 2016 and received 299 valid feedback which are very helpful for the progress of project.
Because the questionnaire was spread to the public and more than half of persons investigated have not heard about iGEM and synthetic biology before. It’s a normal phenomenon existing in the public and it’s important to make more people know iGEM and synthetic biology.
-Q29.Do you know about Synthetic biology?*
A.YES
B.NO

On September 22, team BIT had a preach in the affiliated high school of Beijing Institute of technology. The main content was the introduction of Synthetic biology which was in order to let students know more about the emerging field of biological and the present biological technology and also introduced something of IGEM. During the Q&A time the classmates asked many questions about the biological and synthetic biology and believed that most of"

For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”

Table 3: The table above elaborately describes the input relations     based on promoters and the output products based on the functional genes     and RNAs which are included within the parts. Working condition simply     describes any influencing factor or circumstance which is directly related     with the functional properties of parts.
Third part of our standardization template includes parameters of     contingent input and output elements. These parameters are classified     into two groups for simplicity as presented on Table 3. This final part     of the standardization template includes the upmost important information     about the Biobricks that are required for the BioGuide Software to run     its searching algorithm.
Briefly, BioGuide application is designed to catch the input and     output relations of individual parts to examine possible Biobricks pathways     for specific input and output queries. In other words, at pre-experimental     stage, it helps wet lab biologists to design their unique constructs     by revealing possible alternative options for pre-determined purposes,     along with the primary paths. Our ultimate goal is to improve the algorithm     designed for iGEM 2010 and present a new version of the BioGuide in     iGEM 2011, which will provide optimum design of constructs for"

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

From figures 2-5,   and the data it can be deducted that especially the global alignment score is an important factor in distinguishing gene doping DNA. Therefore, we recommend to further optimize the weights starting with relatively higher global alignment weights.
We challenged our method at the Hackathon , where participants believed that the optimal doping strategy would be to design sequences on the boundary between doping sequences and other DNA. It will nevertheless be hard for doping creators to design further sequences that go undetected by our tool, given that the protein should still be functional as well.
Within the team we also had a competition to beat the algorithm by doping sequence design. Many of us submitted a sequence and the algorithm was able to distinguish more than 80% of them as gene doping. Additionally, the input of any other natural DNA than EPO has always been classified as such. All in all, the algorithm has a great predictive power. The extending database will in the future only even extend this power, which makes us confident that gene doping can in this way rightly be distinguished.
Further Applications
The early stage diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia has been a big challenge. Frontotemporal dementia has been associated with splicing defects in gene FTDP-17 ( Buee et al., 2000 ), resulting in mRNA coding for disfunctional proteins. Our tool can be extended to classify the mRNA sequences and thereby may provide many patients with an early stage diagnosis.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#MDC#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," procedures. Unlike these current methods, the ‘hands-off’ operation of MDCs with their free energy requirements make them accessible to both developed and developing countries alike.
What’s more is that MDCs can not only be used to desalinate water, but to produce electricity as well, economizing land use all the while (potentially) turning a profit.
Returning to the example above, linearly extrapolating on findings from a small proof-of-concept study on MDCs, by passing that same volume of water  (approximately 1/8th the size of Sydney Harbor) through an MDC one could potentially produce energy on the gigawatt scale, all the while removing 90% of salt content in a single run-through.
Though MDCs (like MFCs) typically rely on anodophilic and exoelectrogenic bacteria, by expressing shewanella-derived nanowires in our E. coli chassis, we are able to both greatly improve E. coli’s aptitude for desalination and open the door for further study with the model organism.
Microbial Fuel Cells
As briefly mentioned on our page for MDCs, clean water supply is one of the UN’s top sustainable development goals. Another one of these goals is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”. Although scientists and engineers are currently exploring many roads to meet that end -- be they solar, wind, nuclear, geothermal or otherwise -- one we believe that has yet to be studied to its full potential is microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology. While there has been significant engineering involved in the electrode design and physical construction of MFCs, preciously little has been done on the biological side. Because of this, we wanted to provide a platform for better MFC (and ergo transitively MDC) efficiency.
So, what exactly are they?
MIT’s professor Bruce Logan defines MFCs as “devices that use bacteria as [...] catalysts to oxidize organic and inorganic matter and generate current”. That is to say that even with the introduction of unconventional fuels such as wastewater, discarded foodstuffs, or compost, MFCs are capable of producing energy.
Are they effective?
While MFCs used to have a reputation for inefficiency, this came largely in part from the misconception that chemical mediators were absolutely necessary to transfer electrons from bacteria to the anodes of fuel cells. Since the 1970s however, the use of electrochemically active proteins, like seen in the Shewanella and Geobacter genera has removed the need for medi"

2.2 ssDNAp Effect on d-AuNPs’ Stability
Design: We tested the effect of single stranded DNA probe (ssDNAp) on d-AuNPs aggregation.
Results and interpretation: ssDNAp are known to stabilize d-AuNPs from aggregating ( Baetsen-Young, et al, 2018 ). We incubated the d-AuNP's with and without a ssDNAp and compared the d-AuNP aggregation at a range of NaCl concentrations. The stabilization effect can be observed on figure 6. The addition of ssDNAp causes a lower 620/520 ratio shift with increasing NaCl concentration.
Figure 6. Influence of ssDNAp on d-AuNPs aggregation. At a concentration of 133mM NaCl, the d-AuNPs start to destabilize while with presence of ssDNAp the destabilization occurs at higher NaCl concentrations. A) Wavelength ratios of 620/520 of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM with and without ssDNAp. B) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 333mM without (top) and with (bottom) ssDNAp.
To further evaluate the influence of ssDNAp concentration on the d-AuNPs stabilization, we measured the stability at different NaCl concentrations with varying ssDNAp concentrations. Increasing ssDNAp concentration stabilizes the d-AuNPs, reducing the aggregation and changing the color of the solution from red to purple.
Figure 7. Influence of ssDNAp concentration on stabilization of d-AuNPs. At higher primer concentrations, the d-AuNPs are more stabilized. A) Spectrum of d-AuNPs solutions with NaCl concentration of 333mM incubated with a ssDNAp concentration ranging from 0 nM to 2.5nM. B) Visual outcome of the d-AuNPs solution with NaCl concentration of 333mM with increasing ssDNAp concentrations.
2.3 Visual Difference between Target and non-Target DNA
Design: We incubated DNA with targeting ssDNAp or non-targeting ssDNAp to show the visual difference between the two.
Results and interpretation: The ssDNAp was incubated with the corresponding target gene doping DNA to let the ssDNAp anneal and form the secondary structure. Subsequently, the d-AuNPs were"

Future Work
More applications- Clotho is only as powerful as the applications that utilize the data model and the Clotho infrastructure. The proliferation of new Clotho applications will further Clotho's maturity and capability. Clotho's plugin architecture is optimal for collaboration in the community. Individual labs may continue to develop their specially tailored software and then disseminate those portions they would like to share as a Clotho tool.
Increased automation- Clotho tools will begin to incorporate elements of high level design commonly found in more established engineering disciplines. Clotho tools such as Trumpet allow users to move further away from sequence level information. Users can begin to just describe the characteristics of their construct, and then software will take care of the rest.
Continued testing and refinement- Poor software is often the fault of lenient testing. Clotho is a platform built for synthetic biologists. The platform can only achieve continued refinement if there is a dialogue between programmers and users. These two parties need to realize each others capabilities and needs so that a powerful platform can be built. We hope that the current generation of bioengineers will embrace both disciplines and leverage both for the advancement of science.

Applications
1) Coli watch
Cph1 of cyanobacteria is a transmembrane protein and has histidine kinase activity as AHK4 does. Histidine kinase activity of Cph1 is activated upon light exposure. If a chimera protein of Cph1 and AHK4 (Cph1-AHK4) is constructed and expressed in E. coli, this protein will work as a novel photoreceptor. The Cph1-AHK4 chimera protein will induce transcription from the cps operon in response to light exposure.
Taken together, when the Ptet-traI, Ptet-cph1/AHK4, and Pcps-rfp gene cassettes are introduced to E. coli, the cells change color depending on light.
By wearing the above mentioned E. coli cells on our wrist skin cells, we can see the color change according to the intensity of the light.We named this light sensible E. coli “Coli watch.”
Fig. 2 Coli watch
2) Therapy
Recently, we have found many studies on gene therapies and Drug Delivery System (DDS) to anaerobic solid cancer. These treatments were carried out using the anaerobic bacteria harboring anti-cancer drug genes. However, there are two problems for these treatments; (i) it is difficult to transduce genes to specific human cells, (ii) the effect of the anti-cancer bacteria is not permanent, because the anti-cancer bacteria lose niches by killing cancer cells. When the cancer recurs, re-administration of the anti-cancer bacteria is needed. Such repeated treatments involve pain and economic burden as well as putting patients in danger. Thus, through introducing the following genes, anti-cancer E. coli is expected to stay at a least concentration for a long period.
(i) introducing the chimeric transcription factor (relA-traR) and the iP synthesis enzymes (atIPT4, log1) to human cells.
(ii) introducing Ptet-traI, Ptet-AHK4, and Pcps-mazF to E. coli cells.
(iii) introducing a sensor protein gene to detect cancer cell-specific metabolites to E. coli cells. Concerning the above point (iii), one preceding study implies the existence of such metabolites that attract bacteria [1]. As a consequence, the E. coli cells promptly respond to cancerous recurrence. Therefore, patients will be released from the anxiety of recurrence or frequent checkup, improving the patients’ Q"

Pathomon Collaboration
During the development process of our Games app ""Pathomon"" , we faced many minor and major problems.             But through collaboration with other teams we managed to turn at least some of them into advantages.
We always wanted the social aspect of the game to be a key feature of the application and we decided to realize             it as a game, everybody can play during the Giant Jamboree.
As the whole game is based on the distribution of QR-codes, which you have to scan to achieve something,             it was essential to us to find a place where we can put them.             At first, we thought this would be no problem and asked the convention center for permission, just to receive the answer, that there is a strict             sticker policy around the center. Our whole idea seemed to fall apart and become useless, because nobody could play the game.
But we knew we still have a chance, we just had to collaborate with other teams!
We contacted almost every team and asked for their permission to attach our QR-codes to their poster in Boston.             The feedback was overwhelming and everybody who answered was willing to help and supported our idea.             What has been a workaround in the first place, turned out to be an improvement for our app and the Giant Jamboree. We had the possibility to introduce our app to the             other participants and at the conference the QR-codes will hopefully guide the attendees to the different posters.
But the QR-codes aren't the only way we want to bring the participants together. Our game ""Pathomon"" requires the direct interaction between the players, too.             To fight the so called giant outbreaks three ""scientists"" have to meet at the same place at the same time. To compare yourself with others you can have a look             at the leaderboard and see what university is the best"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.

UESTC-China,2017,Team:UESTC-China#test-team_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEMer, I’m lucky to be involved in creating a magic. What’s more, I have the honor to witness many legends in biology linking we humans with the nature. In my campus life, it is the iGEM that gives me a chance to learn many impossibilities in this world. I believe I can enjoy in this year’s competition and I’m looking forward to making friends with other like-minded people.
For me, participating in iGEM is an amazing journey during my school life. It’s not only a competition, but also a challenge for myself. As a university student, it’s important to apply our professional knowledge into real life. Now we are trying to solve the environment problem through ourselves. It’s really unbelievable! At the same time, to work with a group of friends is very wonderful. It’s iGEM that makes my campus more colorful.
Participating in iGEM is a fantastic experience more than a challenging competition. As one iGEMer, I am always wondering what else could we do to improve our project. I read some related papers and more important, use it in our own. IGEM is attractive to me because I can design the experiment on my own and solve problems during the process. By the way, the story of my life in iGEM: it’s a beautiful day outside, I still have a lot of work to do.
It’s my honor to be one of the iGEMers. In our team, we can not only know more about synthetic biology, but also get more happiness. In our team, we study together, we work together, we play together. In our team, we can learn a lot. For me, majoring in biology is an amazing journey more than an unexpected coincidence, doing experiments is not a dull thing, but a process of discovery. Thanks for give me the chance to learn more about synthetic biology. The iGEM makes my campus more interesting.
Oh,en,I’m an iGEMer.To be honest,I take about 2 years to make it.Majoring in biology is an amazing journey.I still can remember that I told my parents I want to a person studying biology.haha.Participating in iGEM is an indelible experience.Not only the result of the competition,but the process of preparing.It’s not a easy way.I once thought that if the work i did was significative in the hardest time.Just hold on,an iGEMer never give up.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

On Synthetic Biology
On IGEM
Synthetic biology is a new challenge in biosciences. It combines biology and engineering principles to design and build new biological functions and systems. Examples are abound: cancer cell invading bacteria, microbes that take pictures, antimalarial drug producers,... The advantage of using living systems for these purposes is that, once they are designed and built, they are self-reproducible. The challenge, however, lies exactly within the design and construction: making biological circuits and devices as robust and predictive as their electrical counterparts. ...

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," attracted to magnetic fields (Jordan et al. 2010, Wong et al. 1998). We were able to attain some general knowledge of magnetism in nano-scale material, including a basic understanding of blocking temperatures, superparamagnetism and magnetic moments, all magnetism-related measurements. But we are ill-equipped to model this system theoretically in terms of calculated forces. We also explore the possibility of alternative magnetic particles, in the case ferritin is too small to exhibit magnetic forces significant enough to move proteins.
Magnetosomes were found to be much larger, but unviable due to the complexity of their creation. The CCMV virus may also be an option, although there is currently little known about it and therefore further research into this topic is required. (Lohsse et al. 2011).
Because we also intend to scaffold proteins to ferritin as in our TALE DNA-binding proteins, we looked into fusions to both C- and N-terminals of ferritin. The N- and C- termini of ferritin subunits are present on the outside and inside of the nanoparticle respectively, and therefore N-terminal fusions are an obvious choice to ensure TALEs are present on the exterior of the nanoparticles (Dorner et al. 1985).
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
While we are unsure of exactly how ferritin will be used in our project, any capacity in which we use it requires isolating recombinant ferritin from E. coli. We investigated which terminus to locate purification tags (eg, His tags) on ferritin subunits. Ingrassia et al. (2006) found that small amino acid additions to the C-terminus of either heavy or light chain ferritin are not deleterious to its function. Thus, we are contemplating fusing proteins to the N-terminal of ferritin as discussed last week, and using the C-terminus for tags to isolate recombinant subunits.
We also contemplated methods for controlling expression in terms of proportions of H and L subunits in completed ferritin. This could influence iron dynamics of completed ferritin. Lee et al. (2002) overcame this issue by fusing the heavy and light chains together to ensure that completed nanoparticles have a 1:1 ratio of each subunit. We are trying to determine pitfalls of this expression strategy. Finally, we investigated methods for validating nanoparticle formation. Namely, we considered fluorescence spectroscopy as tested by Parker et al. (2008), where 410nm output was indicative of iron incorporation as per assembled"

'ello everybody!
My name is Tiffany Saw and I'd like to thank you for coming to my page! Next fall, I will be a freshman at UC San Diego where I will be majoring in Bioengineering: Biotechnology. Last year, I was a member of the UCSF iGEM team (you can check my page from last year if you want more random information about me) and I look forward to seeing most of my teammates and buddies again at the Jamboree!
My hobbies include eating, fencing, taking jumping pictures, and of course - mini-preps! I'm usually a very happy and upbeat person, but this summer I have discovered my worst enemy: mosquitoes. That isn't to say I haven't enjoyed PKU - the people here are great and I'm very thankful for it. Well, I guess that's all! Goodbye! :]

3. Marker free
In this part, we used Cre/loxP site-specific recombination method to delete the selective marker (Figure 5). To delete the selective resistance gene in transgenic rice, a marker-free element was used to assemble into four-gene multigene vector. This marker-free element was placed between two loxP sites, and consists of a HPT (hygromycin) resistance gene expression cassette and a Cre gene expression cassette controlled by anther-specific promoter. When Cre gene was expressed in transgenic rice anther, the Cre enzyme deleted the marker-free element between two loxP sites.

METHOD:
Competent E. coli were transformed with Biobricks expressing GlgX or GlgB under the control of the LacI promoter and firstly grown in 10 mL LB media overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Each culture was used to inoculate 2 x 10 mL of fresh media, grown to an OD of approximately 0.6 and then IPTG was added to one of each duplicate culture and the cultures continued to grow, with samples taken after 1 hour, 3 hours and overnight. At each timepoint a 1 mL extract was taken, spun down to pellet the cells and this pellet was re-suspended in Lugol solution, similar to a method previously used by the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team .
The expected colour upon Lugol addition to glycogen is a dark brown colour. However, as shown in Figures 1-5, no sample has turned this colour, with the majority of the colour seen identical to the orange/yellow of Lugol itself. We therefore repeated this method with nitrogen-limited, carbon rich minimal media M9 minimal media, which had previously been shown to lead to the accumulation of bacterial glycogen 2 .
Cells grew very slowly under these conditions and only reached an OD of approximately 0.6 after 24 hours.
RESULTS:
Figures 1 -5 show images of pelleted bacterial cells from LB media, resuspended in Lugol’s solution, and in every case it was not different to Lugol solution alone, even 18 hours after induction. The results from high carbon:nitrogen media are shown in Figure 6, in which every sample has a slightly darker, browner colour compared to the previous samples, indicating a higher glycogen presence compared to LB media. Unfortunately solid particulates remaining in the samples precluded quantifying the results by measuring the absorbance with a spectrophotometer. Whilst there was clearly more glycogen in these samples, it was not possible to distinguish colour differences between the branching and debranching enzymes or between the IPTG-induced and non-induced samples. Therefore it was decided to extract the glycogen from the bacterial cells to analyse it directly.

Coating of implants in combination with antimicrobial compounds ( Top )
Today’s implants could also be improved by a bactericidal coating of PHB. Implants used today are often made of titanium, which have no bactericidal effect. When inserted into the body, a bacterial contamination could create a biofilm, which could resolve in an infection and a necessity to remove the implant again Connaughton, A., et al. (2014). ""Biofilm disrupting technology for orthopedic Implants: What’s on the horizon?"" Frontiers in Medicine, 22. . PHB could be loaded on the surface of the implant as spherical micro- or nano particles loaded with antibiotics or bacteriocins, as suggested by Morten Østergaard Andersen . The bacteriocins will be released continuously and thereby prevent infections and biofilms.
Intracellular drug delivery ( Top )
One of today’s issues among drug delivery systems in the human body, is when a drug has to be transported intracellularly. PHB nanoparticles can cross the plasmalemma, thereby solving one of our treatment limitations Kapoor, S., et al. (2016). "" Intracellular delivery of peptide cargos using polyhydroxybutyrate based biodegradable nanoparticles: Studies on antitumor efficacy of BCL-2 converting peptide, NuBCP-9."" FInt J Pharm, 511, 876-89. .
There is, likewise, an increasing wish to create a personalized treatment to each patient. To avoid side effects and fulfill today’s wish, an in vivo drug delivery gel based on PHB could provide a non-invasive, local and steady release of medicine. In the example of cancer, the degradability of PHB is taken in advantage by incorporating the chemotherapeutic into the gel. As the gel is degraded, the medicine is released. Adding or changing components of the gel, changes the rate of which the medicine is released, thus allowing customization Wu, L. Y., et al. (2016).

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," two parts, however, compensated for the loss of capacity by making the association process irreversible. Simulation results tie in with data measured from synthetic gene regulatory circuits, showing the same conclusions. Furthermore, our models predict several conclusions under conditions we not yet have time to carry out, or even hard to achieve experimentally, and illuminates the way for future research and design.
Gillespie Algorithm Simulation
Gillespie Algorithm, a Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), can simulate biochemical reactions with small number of molecules accurately. Reactions in cells are full of random fluctuations due to low number of molecules present. For instance, there can be only one or two copies of a gene in one cell. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm for more details)
TCaption: an example simulation result of our script using Gillespie Algorithm. 100 cells are generated in this figure. We can see how the state of the cell (in this case, a one-dimension state space )
We use this algorithm to generate hundreds of sample trajectories at high and low inputs, each representing the dynamic changes in the amount of protein in a single cell. Afterwards, we find a time point when all reactions in cells have reached steady state, and ink down the states of the cells at that very moment. The approach resembles the flow cytometry experiment, in both of which we get a sample composed of cells with dissimilar protein levels.
From the simulated data, we can use methods in experiment data processing to calculate channel capacities.
We use ${k_{on}}$ and ${k_{off}}$, two parameters of dimer forming and disassociation, to characterize the process of dimerization. For split EBFP2 without intein, kon is relatively small due to low affinity, and ${k_{off}} > 0$. For split EBFP2 with intein, kon is larger and ${k_{off}} = 0$ because once they interact, they will not fall apart.
Under suitable parameter set, we obtained the following results shown in the table below. When ${k_{off}}$  comes down to zero, channel capacity increases in accordance to experimental results.
We computationally scan the two parameters in two-dimensional parameter space to explore the impacts of those kinetic constants.
In the heat map, warmer color stands for higher channel capacity, vice versa. The figure on the left stands for the case where both halves are driven by inducible promotors, the right for that where one of them is driven by constitutive promotor. The latter resemble chemical titration, so we legend it as above.

Ail
The 3D structure of the Ail Protein (PDB).
Ironically, in order to make our minicells as non-toxic and safe as possible we had to look toward the likes of the bacteria that caused the Black Plague. While it may seem strange, bacteria that have such success when infecting the human body have developed the best ways to avoid the traps of the immune system. For our innocuous minicells, the only source of harm to the body would come from an overreaction of its own immune system. Therefore, equipping our minicells with the immunoevasive tools of virulent bacteria actually makes them less harmful.
Our research led us to the Ail protein from Yersinia enterocolitica. Ail is just one of three invasion proteins cloned from Yersinia species, invasin probably being the most widely known.  When present on E. coli, Ail confers a phenotype of attachment and invasion"

Formal Lab Session - 28th August 2009
Overview
Stochastic Switch Team - ran the pSB1AT3 digest through agarose gel, excised fragment and purified. Additionally PCR reactions to amplify ara and sspb were carried out
Metal Sensor Team - purified the excised pSB1A2 plasmid(containing BBa_J33206) and also carried out another PCR attempt on B. subtilis genomic DNA
Promoter Library Sub-Project - ran 10ul of pGFP-rrnB treated with EcoRI and 10ul of pGFP-rrnB + NheI on some agarose gel for analysis. Additionally, 5ul of the 8Kb pGFP-rrnB digest fragment was ran on gel.
Stochastic Switch Team
Summary
Eppendorf tube containing pSB1A3 cut with EcoRI and SpeI
Today the pSB1AT3 DNA fragment cut from the gel yesterday was purified using the gel fragment cleaning kit, and as well as this a PCR was carried out with both the ara primers on Bacillus genomic DNA, and the sspb primers on E.coli genomic DNA prepared yesterday. We expected to see a ~170bp band for the ara regulatory sequence, and a ~570bp band for the sspb coding sequence.
We also continued to extract the plasmid backbone, pSB1AT3, cut with EcoRI and SpeI sites from the gel.

Standardization of MoDeL
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. Knowing the importance, USTC_Software puts a lot of effort on the standardization of MoDeL. We have requested BBF RFC55 for MoDeL, and constructed a beta version of XML schema to describe the XML structure of MoDeL.
BBF RFC55
BBF RFC55: Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) mainly describes the detailed language specifications of MoDeL with concrete examples, which provides enough information for serious database constructors to build up a database on his own. As a highlight of MoDeL, the concept and the syntax of Chain-Node Model are described in detail. The content of document is currently arranged as follows:
Figure 1: Draft document of RFC55 - Table of Contents
The document of RFC55 has already been submitted. You can find it on the webpage of The BioBricks Foundation:RFC . Following are some more previews at the draft document.
Figure 2: Preview at draft document of RFC55
Figure 3: Preview at draft document of RFC55
XML Schema
XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents. Being written in XML fashion, a Schema is perfect for MoDeL to allow software to perform check on syntax. Following is the preview of the beta version of XML Schema for MoDeL. The Schema can be downloaded at iGaME project page on SourceForge.

Orbital shaker/rocker
Procedure
Add 10µL 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer to 10µL of cell pellet and boil in a heat block at 95°C for 5 min (or at 70°C for 10 min) .
Assemble the BioRad apparatus by putting in the precasted gel and add 500 mL of 1X running buffer (dilute 50mL 10X stock with 450mL MQ H2O) so that the gel is completely covered.
Remove the comb from the top of the gel.
Load the samples on the gel slowly, so that they have time to settle evenly. The first well should be filled with 5µL of protein ladder.
Run the gel at RT for 50-60 min on 100V or until the blue dye reaches the end of the gel. Note. Make sure the electrical leads are in the right position (when correct, the bubbles will start to form).
After electrophoresis pop open the gel cassette and slide the gel into the MQ water.
Staining of the gel. Wash the gel three times in 200mL MQ H2O for 5 min.
Remove the water from the staining container and add 50mL of staining solution to cover the gel.
Agitate at RT for 1 hour.
Destaining. Rinse in 200 mL destaining solution for minimum 30 min or until destained. Filtered destaining solution can be reused. After destaining the gel can be stored in water.

Suspension of Cells in Lysis Buffer
The L culture is removed from the shaking incubator and split into three 50mL centrifuge compatible containers. A fourth 50mL container is filled with water and used as a balance. The four containers are spun at 5000g fro 15 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are weighed. 1X Lysis Buffer is added in a 1 to 3 weight of cell pellet to volume of buffer ratio. The cell pellets are then stored at -20 degrees Celsius."
