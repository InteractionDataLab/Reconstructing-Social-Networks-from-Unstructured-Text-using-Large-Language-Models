Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates#home&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html," our project from varying perspectives to better inform the design and launch of our project. To explore some highlights of our policies and practices team [insert navigation guide here].
K-12 Education
Building on past successes, our team was devoted to volunteering our services to the community in a number of educational venues. The team took our curriculum, first developed in 2013, and improved the structure and delivery of our lesson plans in hopes to encourage awareness and education on topics in synthetic biology. Since its inception, our educational outreach group ECORI (Educating Communities On Research Innovation) has taught our original curriculum to over 200 students (K-12); an exhibit-form of our curriculum to a number of children of all ages at the Science Museum of Minnesota, 3M; and has been represented at several STEM fairs within the metropolitan community. In the spirit of science, our curriculum has been ever evolving to constantly address salient topics and educational materials and is flexible in nature to be taught in a variety of settings.
Intellectual Property
Documentary
The University of Minnesota 2014 iGEM team proudly presents our documentary film discussing the background of our project and the bioethics relating to our device. The main purposes of this documentary film are to familiarize the audience with the global mercury contamination problem, to discuss the bioethical questions of synthetic biology and biotechnological products, and to evaluate the bioethical concerns of our device implementation.              To address the above missions, we have conducted interview with specialists from environmental toxicology, biotechnology, and philosophy at the University of Minnesota.  We explore the past incident of methylmercury contamination in Minamata, Japan, as well as the ongoing methylmercury contamination in the state of Minnesota. Through our collaboration with the 2014 Colombia iGEM Team, we further examine the current methylmercury contamination in Colombia because of illegal and informal gold mining using mercury as a reagent.              While GMOs are prevalent in today’s society in forms of food, products, and biotechnology, the public perception of GMOs still diverges. We pace through many different discussions in our video, including why GMOs are perceived differently in the public, why research on the effect of GMOs is usually time- and fund-intensive, and how policy-making corresponds with scientific findings to ensure the biosafety of GMOs.               So is it safe to implement our device that contains GMOs into the local, polluted water? How do we assess the benefits of implementing our device and how do we know if the benefits out-weight the potential risk of introducing a biohazard into the local water stream"

Note there’s just one LED - if you solder both the optical density and fluorescence LEDs seperately and use pin headers you can very quickly swap between them.
If you want to be able to switch quickly (and for increased durability) you could implement a toggle switch into the design. We decided against this due to the added cost, however the if you want to do this click here to view the circuit diagram.

In the cuvette holder the LEDs should be laid out as they were in the Aachen design; the fluorescence LED in the bottom, the optical density LED on one side and the light sensor opposite the optical density LED.
Once it’s all soldered, you’ll need to upload the code to the Digispark (you can actually do this before you solder, it doesn’t matter when). Follow the instructions on the Digistump wiki to get set up. We didn’t write them here too as it’s likely to go out of date quickly. In the unlikely event that the wiki does go down, we’ve made a save on the Wayback Machine here .
Do make sure you follow the steps exactly, don’t just skim them and assume it’ll be alright! Although Digisparks are generally pretty hardy, messing up could still fry them, making it harder to troubleshoot and wasting your time and money.
Once you’ve got your environment set up, simply copy our code into the Arduino window, click upload and plug in the Digispark when prompted. It’s just a one time set up, if you’re uploading to multiple chips at once it’s very quick - just repeat the upload step for each Digispark.
Now you should be able to use it on any device. Simply open the hardware interpreter page on your computer, laptop or phone and plug the Digispark in. It will take at least 5 seconds to start - up to 15 seconds on some devices.
Some devices might require adapters to connect to the Digispark, especially phones and tablets. If you’re not sure where to start, try searching for an 'OTG' (on the go) female USB adapter for the port"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html,"combine into the B. subtilis genome. (Khasanov et al) . determined that a minimal of 70 bp is required for homologous recombination to take place. Furthermore, it was determined that a linear relationship exists between target sequence length and recombination frequency (Khasanov et al) .  The target sequence length and transformation efficiencies we obtain using the supercompetent B. subtilis strain will play a significant role in our sample preparation. We can use our results from this experiment to determine how long our primers need to be for the target sequence within the pathogen(s) during isothermal amplification.
Currently, we have been optimizing transformation efficiency using the thrC vector digested with ScaI. When we digest the thrC vector with ScaI we have approximately 700 bp of “buffering DNA” on one side and 1800 on the other.  We have designed several primers for different sites within the thrC and thrC’ regions for the thrC vector (ID K823022).  These primers will give us products containing 500 bp of homologous sequence down to 50 bp. By using these primers we hope to determine how much buffering DNA and homology is necessary.
Week 17: August 18 - 22
We made the first batch of spores of the supercompetent B. subtilis strain this week using a standard sporulation protocol and stored them at 4 C for short-term storage and -20 C for long-term storage. In order to visualize the spores under the microscope, we performed Gram stains. Theoretically, spores should stain clear, vegetative B. subtilis cells should stain purple, while E. coli cells should stain red. This is because the Gram’s iodine reagent fixes the purple dye (crystal violet) to Gram positive species, while the purple is unable to adhere to Gram-negative species. Thus, B. subtilis, which is Gram-positive, will stain purple, while E. coli stains red (from Safranin). Spores lack the membranes that bind the colour, and so will not stain at all, and we see them as round, clear entities under the microscope.
A majority of the cells from the sporulated tube were in the spore form, being round-shaped and clear. Although E. coli stained red, vegetative B. subtilis cells also stained red instead of purple. However, the B. subtilis cells were rod-shaped so we assumed that the reagents we used for Gram staining were contaminated"
Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," difference in developed countries is relatively small, since the value of the raw ingredients comprise a small part of the total cost of processed food [4]. However, the reverse is true in undeveloped countries, where the diet is comprised of mainly unprocessed food, resulting in a market more sensitive to the price of these crops. Families below the poverty line spend upwards of 80 % of their income on food, leaving low margins for a price change of basic food goods.
Should environmental sustainability come before the basic needs of human beings? The future of all is of course predicated on the fact that there is a livable earth for us to inhabit. “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few” as the saying goes. But do the two goals need to be mutually exclusive? We certainly hope not.
Self-sustaining production system
How can the need for industrial substrate be limited and at the same time move the world onto a sustainable production of chemicals and fuels? Our answer: Create a production system that produces its own substrate. Photosynthesis was the key to this solution, as photosynthetic microorganisms have the ability to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into sugars by converting sunlight to bioavailable energy (ATP) to fuel this process. The use of cyanobacteria addresses both the substrate issue as well as decreasing the carbon footprint of the industry. A photosynthesis-based production system would not require the arable land that food crops need, since the microorganisms would be grown in contained bioreactor systems.
However, there are some disadvantages when working with cyanobacteria. One of them is their slower growth rate than most chemotrophs, making genetic engineering of them slower. Since a future expansion of the biosynthesis field certainly will require extensive genetic engineering, working with this organism is not ideal. Leaving the product synthesis to faster growing organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis, which already have already proven capable of viable production, could therefore be the better choice.
The approach we chose in our project was to modify the cyanobacteria to simply produce the substrate for the production organism. The genetic modifications performed in the cyanobacterium will therefore only be focused on one task - the production of substrate - and the organism will not have to be reengineered for each new product that one wishes to produce. Furthermore, dividing functions into different strains can lead to decreased metabolic load and prevent competition between the different functions within one organism [5].
How do we create a system that is self-regulating and at the same time avoid the risks discussed earlier?
To prevent one organism from outcompeting"

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"Tag (OmpA-ST) is transported to bacterial outer membrane and therefore OMVs. However, E. coli could produce natural OmpA and then transport it to its outer membrane and OMVs as well. It's necessary to know how much OmpA-ST is transported to OMVs or what the ratio of the OMVs-ST is in total OMVs. To evaluate the efficiency of its transport to outer membrane and OMVs, we fused wtGFP and our OmpA-ST (BBa_K2623022 and BBa_K2623024) together in order to construct OmpA-ST-GFP (BBa_K2623021 and BBa_K2623023) (Figure 2).
Figure 2. The spectrogram of wtGFP [1].
We cultured bacteria transfected with these four parts respectively in 10 mL OMVs-free LB broth culture and extracted the OMVs according to our protocols, in which two forms of non-GFP OMVs were set as negative controls. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pictures identified what we extracted were exactly OMVs with membrane structure and 100-nm diameter (Figure 3).
Figure 3. TEM figures identify our OMVs.
Building upon Yan's lab-built high-sensitivity flow cytometer [2-3], we successfully detected the OMVs labelled with GFP and evaluated the efficiency of its transport to OMVs (Figure 4). Herein, we'd like to extend our heartfelt thanks toward Yan's lab due to the very kind and selfless help during the experiment.
Figure 4. HSFCM analysis of OmpA-ST-GFP inside OMVs.
Figure 4 are bivariate dot-plots of GFP green fluorescence versus side scattering (SSC) for our OMVs isolates. E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623021 (Figure 4a) could secret more OMVs labeled with GFP than E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623022 (Figure 4b). Similarly, E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623023 (Figure 4c) would secret more OMVs labeled with GFP than E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623024 (Figure 4d). Moreover, we could see E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623021 (Figure 4a) would transport OmpA-ST to OMVs more efficiently than E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623023 (Figure 4c). The remarkable difference of GFP-OMVs ratio between these two parts might account for the different inserted site of ST. SpyTag"

Figure 5. Log scale of cell growth-rate at different Tyr concentrations
It was found that the cells depleted the nutrient quickly at low Tyr concentration, and for future experiments it is suggested to use lower initial cell concentrations to extend the time of its exponential growth phase. Also, the wild type has almost the exact growth rate as the autotroph when the the Try concentration is exceptionally high (0.01 M).

JUDGING FORM ⇗
The primary problems with martian habitat development are the cost of sending materials up to Mars–it costs approximately $2.78 million dollars to send a single kilogram of material up to space [1]–and access to new materials when in space.
Proposed 3D Printed Design crafted from a composite from Mars. [2]
Proposed 3D Printed Design crafted from a Martian Ice. [3]
Current ideas that are being explore by NASA involve sending large 3D printers up to Mars that will print with materials sourced from Mars. More specific examples include a composite material made from martian regolith, or using ice found on planet [2, 3]. However, as we interviewed Dr. Michael Meyer, the lead Scientist of NASA’s Mars exploration program, it was highlighted that there are number of issues with these designs. Issues range from designing reliable material from components sourced from Mars to the cost of sending up such a large 3D printer (both in the production of such a large printer, as well as the actual cost per kilogram). Additionally, the materials sourced from Mars would most likely need to be supplemented with binders brought from earth, and could not be applied to interior design elements.
Our proposal to design a martian habitat from mycelium is therefore a strong concept, as it addresses many of the large concerns regarding habitat development on Mars, and bypasses the drawbacks of other proposed designs.
Instead of a large 3D printing machine, we would just need to send up a few spores of mycelium, a few supplemental nutrients, and a light-weight mold. Depending on the habitat’s design, we could either grow algae with carbon dioxide sourced from Mars or use martian regolith as the substrate for growth & binding. Furthermore, the mycelium has the potential to be genetically engineered to enhance its properties or have it produce other vital materials. It is also an extremely versatile material, and its mechanical properties can be manipulated. This creates the potential for it to produce everything from the exterior of the habitat to the softer interior products such as furniture and clothes"

Current Challenges
We aimed to identify a few broad reasons why mammalian cells are not heavily used in the iGEM community.
Cost
We very quickly recognized that there is a high cost associated with performing research in mammalian cells. This cost comes at many levels.
Higher Cost of Equipment and Facilities
To use classic mammalian cell lines such as HEK293T cells, researchers require BSL2 certified spaces. The space itself may be difficult for individuals to obtain - working with multiple organisms in the same lab space may result in more chances for contamination, and thus for best results, researchers may want to have a designated space for mammalian use. Our iGEM team stems from a lab that has many researchers working with mammalian cells, and we were fortunate to be able to use dedicated BSL2 facilities for our research project.
Some notable facilities and equipment needed for mammalian cell work include:
CO2 Incubator: In order to keep mammalian cells alive and growing, they need to be incubated at a certain temperature and CO2 level. Our incubator was set at 37 C with a CO2 level of 5.0%.
O2 Tissue Culture Hood: It is imperative to work in a sterile environment when working with mammalian cells to prevent contamination. The tissue culture hood provided this sterile environment for us to transfect, passage, and plate mammalian cells in. The tissue culture hood provides laminar flow of air to keep objects sterile, and also includes UV light sterilization after usage.
Tissue Culture Plates: these are sterile plates upon which we plate mammalian cells for growth and transfection. The plates are treated with polystyrene such that cells can adhere on the bottom and spread out.
Higher Cost of Upkeep of Cells
Mammalian cell lines require a lot of upkeep. To do transient transfection, cells need to be in an actively dividing state. However, if cells are left in the same tissue culture dish for a few days, they will revert into a quiescent state and will not be adequate for experimental purposes. Thus, researchers need to passage cells every "

Functional Prototype
The functional prototype of our facilitated microfluidic workflow follows a fictitious researcher in synthetic biology, Dr. Ali. Dr. Ali is looking to automate and parallelize his ability to characterize a novel genetic part in terms of how cells express his reporter gene when various levels of inducer are present. The video below follows Dr. Ali through the entire process of creating a microfluidic device using the Neptune workflow, as well as controlling the chip with Neptune's parametric control hardware. This video demonstrates each portion of entire user-interface driven design flow and also how our control interface works in real time in conjunction with our servo-syringe control infrastructure.
{Disclaimer: The microfluidic device seen in this video is demonstrating the ability to perform biological experiments, but actual biological components are not used. Instead, colored water is used as a model for the inducer and suspended cell media.}

System design
""You have to think anyway, so why not think big?"" - Donald Trump
Original thought
The original design of the system making up the Edible coli contains the four elements listed below, in a K12 MG1655 strain of Escherichia coli:
Excreting cellulases for the degradation of cellulose to glucose:
Cellulose (C6H10O5)n consists of β-1,4 linked D-glucose units. For the Edible coli to gain nutrients from cellulose in the form of glucose units, the β-glucosidic bonds in-between must be broken by  hydrolysis. For this degradation three enzymatic activities are needed by the enzymes, collectively  known as cellulases: Endoglucanase, exoglucanase and β-glucosidase. Endoglucanase hydrolyses  internal β-1,4 glucosidic bonds in the cellulose fiber, while exoglucanase hydrolyses the external  bonds, releasing cellobiose disaccharides. The cellobiose disaccharides are then cleaved by β- glucosidase into two glucose molecules each. Source: Lynd, L.R., et al.: Microbial Cellulose Utilization: Fundamentals and Biotechnology.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Brazil_-_-_TEXT.html," belong to this broad universe of companies dedicated to bioscience activities, which carry out activities related to biotechnology. This number also includes companies that operate with other technical bases, for example, the pharmaceutical industry that keeps the central body of its activities in the production of chemical basis, but that has embedded business units dedicated to biotechnology (Bianchi, C. 2013). According to data from CEBRAP, the average age of Brazilian companies is low: 63% of them were founded after 2000; 40% of them after 2005 and most of the companies (77.4%) is in the Southeast (40% in São Paulo, 24% in Ontario and 13% in Rio de Janeiro). This is achieved by a logistics issue, since the industry is highly dependent on imports: 76.9% of Brazilian companies import reagents, 64.3% and 20% care equipment care services.
In general, one of the main strong points of biotechnology in Brazil is the use and development of crops genetically modified organisms (GMOs), biofuels and the development of agricultural biotechnology, where for many years Brazil is a pioneer. However, its capacity is less developed when it comes to health biotechnology (Pugatch Consilium, 2014).
Companies dedicated to agricultural biotechnology are generally more active than those of other areas of the activity scale. These companies have strong ties with various agents, such as the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), Universities and, in particular, are associated with Local Productive Arrangements (APLs) with producers who use the products or services they offer. Among companies in the agricultural area, include the dedicated biotechnology applied to the production of crops for energy generation, mainly sugar cane. In 2013, Brazil had 40.3 million hectares of biotech crop corn, soybeans and cotton; behind the United States (ISAAA, 2013). Brazil also has biofuels (ethanol from cane sugar) as the main source of energy for transportation since 1975 and the introduction of the National Alcohol Program (ProÁlcool).
The conditions for the success of biotech companies in the biofuels and agricultural biotechnology sector are directly linked to strong government leadership. For example, the Brazilian government, through EMBRAPA, is intimately involved in R&D (Production and development) and marketing of agricultural biotechnologies.
In Brazil there is a great importance of public support for the biotechnology industry: BrBiotec according to a study (2011), 78"
Stony_Brook,2017,Team:Stony Brook#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," but as shown by our graphs, people tended to have a better grasp of GMOs than synthetic biology. While a few people answered that they had never heard of synthetic biology, no one answered that they had never heard of GMOs. This is likely due to the media attention placed on GMOs. When we tested for regression, we found that the difference in response was statistically significant (p = 3 x 10-53), indicating that people had different understandings of synthetic biology and GMOs. People generally felt more negatively about the GMOs compared to synthetic biology (p = 2 x 10-17). Education levels did not significantly affect a person’s perceptions of synthetic biology (p = 0.10). As we compared the positive responses and negative response across the bars, the corresponding percentages stayed relatively the same for each education level. We found no correlation between people’s political leanings and their view of synthetic biology (p = 0.8).
Most of our independent variables were not strongly correlated in a pairwise manner, thereby supporting the statistical strength of our multiple regression models. Perceived understanding of synthetic biology and perceived understanding of genetically modified organisms were the variables indicating significant pairwise correlation. Our statistical results may have been affected by multiple biases, such as high amounts of politically liberal college students at Stony Brook. Reporting bias may have also been especially significant in the current political climate and the resulting responses for this survey.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT#Game_-_-_TEXT.html,": City with many factories+weapon system+invisible platform+enemies, meaning the elements of previous levels combine together. As the arsenic ions are mostly caused by factory wastewater in the city, so we set the background of this level to city. The genetic route is more complex in this level, divided into three parts, but in order to maintain the balance of the game, the genetic fragments which players need to collect did not increase actually.
Screenshot of the sixth level
The seventh level: detecting ralstonia solanacearum of rice. Principle of the level: We design a bacterial system which can control the cell density to detect and eliminate the damage of ralstonia solanacearum to plants. The design of the whole system is divided into two parts: a modular decive to detect disease and a constant plant-alarm device. There are two different ways to detect the disease. One detecting device is according to the fact that  3OH-PAME is the special responding molecular to ralstonia solanacearum, and the other us the device which use chitin as the index of fungal infection.
Molecular Response Devices Based on 3OH - PAME
Molecular Response Devices Based on Chitin
Feature of the level: To Simulate the process of infection, the level considered the design of ""catch insects"" game mode. Players capture the genetic fragments freely in a place full of windmills. We put artificial intelligence system in the program, so the genetic fragments can move around freely, and when players get close to them, they will escape very quickly, making the chase more difficult and interesting.
Screenshot of the seventh level
The eighth level: detecting miRNA to test breast cancer indirectly
Principle of the level: When the cancer occurs, the amount of miRNA in the body will change. So the genetic line can forecast the cancer by detecting the miRNA (the project of BIT team in 2016).
Genetic route about the detection of breast cancer
Feature of the level: The background of the level use mirror-design. The player stays in the night when the sky full of stars, but the stars which need to be collected are all hidden. The player is confused and looking for the stars in the unreal world, and the sky becomes darker and darker when time goes by. Players seem to be imprisoned in the virtual world - this is last level, in which there aren’t enemies, weapons and factories, and there are only the rules hided in the map and the target which is difficult to find.

Plated almost all parts on 2 plates, with 80% of volume on one and 20% of volume on another.  Ran out of plates, so divided one plate apiece for parts K0001 and L0101 that we believe to already have from another source (i.e. iGEM registry).  In each half of each plate for these parts, we streaked the same difference in volumes (20% AND 80%).

From both experiments we can conclude that while the optimized REPAIR enzyme showed higher A-to-I editing efficiency, unoptimized dCas13d-ADAR2DD constructs exhibited similar A-to-I editing activity level on mRNA on the PPIB loci. This shows great potential for the dCas13d-ADAR2DD construncts as it has significantly smaller size and there is still possibility for protein engineering and optimization.

The tool requires the sequence of your molecular cargo, the cell type you wish to target, and the approxiamte internal radius of the PNC. Moving forward, we plan to integrate IGSC compliant screening to ensure that the PNC recommendation is not used to distribute sequences of select agents, toxins, or other sequences of concern.
Future Directions
Full Parts Characterization
This iGEM season, we were only able to clone one part (the novel minimal Arc Gag construct) and begin characterizing it. We intend to finish characterizing our toolkit, which includes collecting additional data from transmission electron microscopy imaging, analytical ultracentrifugation, mass spectroscopy, and application experiments (including eukaryotic cell transfection, CRISPR system delivery, and protein delivery).
Complete Submission to the Parts Registry
We would like for our system to be accessible to other iGEM teams and researchers who may want to use these parts for their own projects. Therefore, we hope to eventually submit all nine of our designed parts to the registry (and more!).
Modifications to our Purification Methods
As most of our PNC purification methods include high speed centrifugation and specialized equipment, we intend to add His tags (or other purification tags) to all of our PNCs to make purifications easier and enable higher yield.
Expression in Different Systems
This year, because we only expressed parts in E. coli, our system was limited as to what types of cell-penetrating peptides could be tested due to lack of specificity and because the peptides often killed the host during expression. In the future, we would like to characterize PNCs with antimicrobial surface peptides as a possible novel antibiotic using yeast models.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Modeling#Model II_-_-_TEXT.html,". Thus, the change in growth also depends on the amount of free capacity ((C-(x1+...+xn))/C).
Experimental validation
A theoretically implemented model must always be validated with experimentally measured data. To improve model II we did a row of cultivation experiments. One part of the cultivation experiments was used for fitting the growth parameter r, and separate experiments were used for validating the model.
Cultivation experiments
For the determination of the experimental growth rate and for the production of a standard growth curve of the JS200 strain with an active error prone polymerase I we cultivated JS200 for around 18 hours at 37°C. We also wanted to investigate how a JS200 cell grows and, thus, beta-lactamase reacts, when it encounters different ampicillin concentrations. Therefore, the cultures were provided with a plasmid that carries a beta-lactamase sequence. Additionally, we let the cultures grow with 1, 3, 5 and 10 g ampicillin per liter, respectively (figure 1 (A)). As a control we also cultivated JS200 with an active wild-type polymerase I (figure 1 (B)). All experiments were done with three biological replicates. The measurements were taken every hour. The results can be seen here:
Figure 1: Cultivation of an E. coli culture with a plasmid that holds a wild-type polymerase and a culture with a plasmid that contains the error-prone polymerase. The cultivation was done with different ampicillin (amp) concentrations.
The cultivations were performed at 37°C in presence of 1, 3, 5 or 10 g ampicillin per liter, respectively.
Figure 2: The measarment curves were fitted with the fitting programm.Therefore, we get the different reproduction rates.
These measurements were used to calculate which reproduction rates can be reached. The maximal reproduction rate of the JS200 strain with the error prone polymerase is 0.67 h-1 . It were determined through fitting (figure 2) with the logistical function with the dynamical r.
A close look at our experimentally measured error prone growth curves (figure 1 (A)) led to the following interesting observation: Although the curves showed different growth behavior and diverging lag phases their rates seemed to undergo a shift, once the ampicillin was out of the system. Without ampicillin pressure the growth rates seem to be similar (figure 1 (A), exponential phase). To account for varying growth behavior at the beginning and an almost uniform behavior after a certain time,"

Induction: At 3:30PM (2 hours) 0.0477g of IPTG was dissolved in 1mL of LB, and added to the flask for a total concentration of 0.2mM. The OD600 was measured to be 0.165. Because there was no access to an 18C incubator, the flask was left in the 30C incubator.
Observations: OD600 should have been measured before induction, as the ideal OD600 at time of induction should be 0.6. Also, the flask should have been sterilized the day before in order to not have to leave the bacteria culture on the bench."

The first clinical trial was conducted by Rogers et al. to cure urea cycle disorder by introducing the gene for arginase using Shope papilloma virus. The result of the trial was negative. They later found out that was so because the Shope papilloma virus genome actually does not encode an arginase. Despite a string of negative results during clinical trials, gene therapy received great attention from many scientists until the death of Jesse Gelsinger. In 1999, Jesse Gelsinger, an omithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency patient, took part in a gene therapy clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. High doses of adenovirus were administered and Gelsinger’s immune system responded instantly. He died because of multi organ failure. This case was very important in the study of gene therapy because Gelsinger became the first patient who showed that viral vector for gene therapy can cause death to the patients (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013).
Currently more than 1800 approved gene therapy clinical trials have or are being conducted around the world. Cancer is the most common disease being investigated for gene therapy, being the topic of over 60% of clinical gene therapy trials worldwide. In 2003, China made history by becoming the first country to approve the commercial production of a gene therapy method.
Methods
In general, there are two categories of gene therapy: germ line cell gene therapy and somatic cell gene therapy. The difference is whether the genetic materials inserted will be passed on to the next generation. In somatic cell gene therapy, genetic material is not passed down while the genetic material is passed down in germ line gene therapy (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013). Both of these methods require a carrier called a vector that can transport the new gene into the desired cell (Handbook, 2013). Adenoviral vectors, retroviral vectors and naked plasmids have been used most for gene transfer vectors in clinical trials (Wirth, Parker & Ylä-Herttuala, 2013). When virus vectors are used they are modified so that they won’t infect the subjects. Different types of virus vectors can produce different outcomes. For example, if retroviruses are used as vectors, the genetic material gets integrated into the subject’s genome. If adenoviruses are used, DNA is introduced into the nucleus of the cell, but the DNA is not integrated into the genome (Handbook, 2013).
Non-viral vectors can also"

Arrival of gBlocks for all three devices
All three devices ordered as gBlocks arrived today! Refer to main lab notebook page for details regarding device specifications and FASTA sequence verification.
All three devices were briefly spun for 3-5 seconds at 3,000xg to ensure all DNA is at bottom of tube, resuspended in 100 uL of TE buffer, and briefly vortexed to mix. Tubes were then incubated at 50 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes to ensure elution of the total DNA, and briefly vortexed and centrifuged to homogenize and collect the samples.
gBlocks must be amplified before digestion to ligate into pSB1C3.  A set of primers were prepared and ordered via IDT to amplify all three devices based on the Prefix and Suffix sites.
Amplification Primers for all Interlab Devices
Primers created are as follows, with parameters of each primer individually and as a pair calculated via Benchling.

Synthetic Biology Promises
We believe in the potential of synthetic biology as a responsible force for good. The field is routinely mentioned as one of the most important emerging technologies that is likely to make a substantial impact in medicine, environmental remediation , agriculture, architecture and much more. Great examples that foreshadow what Synthetic Biology could become are Jay Keasling's Antimalarial drug or the brilliant FREDsense biosensors .
The BioBricks Foundation has done tremendous work in opening up Synthetic Biology to researchers around the world and iGEM in particular is inspiring and educating the synthetic biologists of the future.
How We Can Deliver
Our ability to keep the promises of Synthetic Biology will depend on the amount of talented people that can contribute. The tools and supplies for Synthetic Biology are still prohibitively expensive. This excludes all but the leading universities and companies from becoming involved.
In order to deliver on the potential, we need to radically increase access to working in Synthetic Biology. iGEM again is leading the way by expanding towards high schools and citizen science. But for, the tools of the trade have to become widely accessible.
Accessibility includes affordability, but it goes beyond it. This is where we come in. We have dedicated our organisation to the creation the accessible tools necessary to make synthetic biology as inclusive and powerful as possible. We want to contribute to the infrastructure that enables the growth of the field, so that in a few years we have not five or fifteen examples of real world Synthetic Biology applications, but hundreds or thousands.
The First Step
Ultimately, we want to provide tools that enable the synthetic biologist to think about functionality of the system and its social and ethical implications, without having to worry about cost or restrictions of biology.
Our first product is Darwin Toolbox, and it represents our first step in a long walk towards our goal. Darwin Toolbox is a user-friendly, affordable lab-in-a-box containing a PCR machine, a centrifuge, and a gel electrophoresis device and visualizer. Darwin Toolbox will be the ideal entry device for biotechnology citizen scientists, iGEM High School teams and undergraduate students. It aims to foster a new culture of curiosity and discovery for young synthetic biologists.

Winter Camp
After the Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share                                 their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the                                 cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire. All students in our school are welcomed.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about                                 synthetic biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students to know                                 more about the logic                                 design and skills required to start a project related to synthetic biology.
Based on their needs, we arranged several courses for someone maybe interested in:
(1) The history and development of synthetic biology (Chun Li)
(2) Literature searching and reading (Chenyi Li)
(3) Photoshop training (Mingming Cao)
(4) Academic writing and English presentation training (Hui Luo)
(5) Brainstorm introduction (Zeyan Li)
(6) System biology and mathematical model (Pengcheng Zhang)
After the course, we got some feedback from students. From preparation to implementation,                                 the whole winter camp lasted for two months.                                 Then,we welcomed students who showed great passion                                     to iGEM to take part in the brainstorm activity.
Communication with COFCO
What we designed is a product that might be used in large-scale                                 fermentation, to get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production, we visited COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about                                 synthetic biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students to know                                 more about the logic                                 design and skills required to start a project related to synthetic biology.
We introduced our project to the staff, getting many useful feedback.                                 Their suggestions helped us view our project in a different way,                                 and lead us to think more about application and the practical problems.                                 For example, they talked about whether we can give a false signal to                                 indicate the plasmid lost and kill the bacteria. In this way, they can                                 reduce the cost of treatment by not using heat treatment. Besides,                                 they raised a question about the distribution of inhibitor proteins                                 as well as the plasmids. The random distribution may also lead to the                                 signal delay,"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of the full balance equation (30) for various volumes of on-chip produced droplets. These solutions are shown in a figure X. As smaller droplets are being reinjected, we keep their volume constant through the range of volumes of produced droplets .
Figure 1. Droplet coalescence time dependence tcoal on fused droplet volumes V1 and V2
As we can see the coalescence time for the single value of V1 has some variation with a maximum. Scanning values from the smallest volume of produced droplet to the largest, there is a range of V2 (the produced droplet) with a longest coalescence time. When we look at the results for the larger droplets V1, the coalescence time increases. Also, we notice that the interval of coalescence times is shorter and variation is smaller. This means that if we are increasing the volume V1, the coalescence time increases, but the interval of possible droplet coalescence becomes smaller. If there’s no solution found, it means no coalescence is occurring for given conditions (droplet volumes, voltage and other).
Figure 2. Droplet coalescence time tcoal dependence on fused droplet volumes at different applied voltage Uapp values.
Next we compared the coalescence time results for various applied voltages Uapp. We chose 3 different values of the applied voltage (0.3V, 0.4V and 0.5V). We have found that even a small increase (0.1V) of voltage strongly affects the coalescence time. With our calculations, the tcoal reduces approximately by factor of 3 as we increase the voltage from 0.3V to 0.5V.
What is even more interesting, is that the interval of possible droplet coalescence does not shorten when we increase the voltage. It becomes shorter only when the volume V1 is increased as we discussed previously.
Having the results for various conditions (V1, V2, Uapp) we now need to determine which of these conditions are suitable for our droplet merging experiments. It is our goal to find a range of droplet volumes which can provide an efficient droplet coalescence.
Firstly, we need to have flow rates tuned appropriately so that the droplets do not pass the whole coalescence chamber without merging with a droplet from another droplet population. For that reason we chose tflow as an upper limit of the time it requires for the droplets to pass through the coalescence chamber. The flow time is"

Wild type supernatant is shown as a control (pink). Excitation wavelength for sfGFP was set to 480 nm and emission was recorded at 510 nm and for mCherry excitation wavelength was set to 585 nm and emission was recorded at 615 nm . The fluorescence was normalized over the optical density (OD600). Graphs show mean values and standard deviations of at least two biological and three technical replicates.
The sfGFP fusion proteins were visible in the supernatant when excited with blue light (Figure 7) and the typical red colour of mCherry could even be observed under daylight conditions (Figure 8). These protein rich supernatants were used for stability tests, spectral analysis, purification and SDS-PAGE.
Figure 7: Supernatants of B. subtilis cultures excited with blue light. Wild-type supernatant (left) and a SpyTag-sfGFP secreting strain (middle and right). The expression of the multi-copy sfGFP was induced with 1% Xylose and the supernatant was harvested after 16 h of incubation. The fluorescence was induced with a “Dark Reader Transilluminator”.

Stability:
After incubating the supernatants containing the fluorescent fusion protein for 24h they still showed the same fluorescence intensity, implying that the protein is quite stable in 2xYT medium (graph included in pdf below).  Using the B. subtilis strain WB800N as host contributes to an increased stability, as it is not secreting any proteases that may degrade the protein of interest.
Stability of secreted FP
Emission spectra:
The emission spectra of the supernatants containing fusion protein producing cultures were analysed to prove that the measured fluorescence’s originates from sfGFP or mCherry. In Figure 9 the emission spectra of the sfGFP-fusion protein is clearly visible, having an emission peak at ca. 510 nm. The mCherry-fusion protein displays the correct emission spectrum as well, having a peak at 615 nm.

● msmK ( BBa_K2606001 )
    It is a fragment cloned from Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 gene group, which is verified to be a new and effective anti-acid gene in Lactococcus lactis NZ3900.
    Usage and function
    The msmK overexpression strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one at pH 4.0 after 3 hours.
Fig 1 Survival rate at acid stress (pH 4.0).
    The result shows that msmK is an effective anti-acid gene, which can make the recombinant strain has 213-fold higher survival rate than parent one.
Fig 2 Electron microscopy of L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2-gfp and L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149 before and after acid stress.
    Before the acid stress, the cell structure of the control strain and the recombinant strain remained intact. After 3 hours of pH 4.0 stress, the cell membrane thickness became thinner and the surface became rough, and the cell membrane of some control strains ruptured. In comparison, the cell structure of the recombinant strain remains more intact, thereby effectively reducing the damage caused by acid stress on the cells.

In addition to searching for a pathogenic E. coli marker, we also started working on the TALE sequence and its construction. The TALE sequence chosen has a truncation in both N- and C-terminus. The truncated N-terminus has 111 residues and the C-terminus has 42 residues (Meckler et al., 2013). The sequence was codon optimized for E.coli. NEBCutter 2.0 was used to screen restriction sites for PstI, EcoRI, NotI, XbaI, SpeI, NgoMIV and AgeI, all present in the RFC 25. Cut sites for BsaI and Esp3I were also removed to pave the road for Golden Gate Assembly method. The original TALE sequence has 11 cut sites: BsaI (3), PstI (1), EcoRI (1), Esp3I (4), AgeI (2). The restriction sites were then eliminated with silent mutations, based on a E. coli codon usage table (San Diego State University, 2012 modified from Maloy, Stewart & Taylor, 1996).
The large size of the TALE prevents simple cloning, therefore we looked to Golden Gate Assembly. Golden Gate Assembly is a subcloning strategy that uses type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence allowing ligation into a final product that lacks any specific scar sites (Engler, Kandzia & Marillonnet, 2008).
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
This week also mostly spent on literature research.
The next step after optimization of TALEs and their target sequence is to locate this system’s niche in the beef industry. Many of the current high fidelity methods for pathogenic E. coli detection require cell cultures, which increases turnaround time up to 4 days (Blais et al., 2012 & Gill et al., 2013).
A 2013 paper by Jeon et al. explores the genetic and physiological effects of the cattle on the amount of the O157 it excretes. According to this paper, 90% of the bacteria excreted from the cattle comes from the super-shedders. Super-shedders are cattle that excrete more than more than 10 000 CFU/g and have long term recto anal junction colonization. Higher excretion is detected in bulls, pen raised cattle, and certain breeds"

NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"’ve decided to make our own yeast knockout strain – something I’m excited about because I’ll get to learn something new! We’re going to use the FY4 wild-type strain because the entire genomic sequence is available online, making it very easy to manipulate the genome thanks to yeast DSB recombination pathways. To this end I designed and ordered primers for the KanMX gene (an antibiotic-selectable gene) with trp1 extensions flanking the KanMX coding region. After PCRing the KanMX CDS, we can transform the PCR product and the yeast will take it from there, inserting the KanMX CDS into the trp1 locus. Because this will konckout trp1 function, we’ll have to grow this strain with tryptophan as well as G148 to select for KanMX transcription.
I also ordered primers for genomic integration at the Ura3 locus of any biobrick part. Using sequences complementary to the biobrick prefix and suffix, these oligos will make it possible to insert any fully-assembled biobrick construct into this locus. We will post these sequences to the Registry after we get a successful integration.

Russell
We’ve had some success with the PCR amplification of biobrick parts for assembly. Instead of growing up large quantities of a 2.5kb plasmid and using ~100bp, we’ve decided to amplify the part via PCR and then use the PCR product in our assemblies. This has helped us manage stocks of biobrick parts because each team member can have their own PCR product to do their assemblies while working off of the Biobrick reservoir that I maintain. Because each person has their own PCR product from the original stock PCR-induced mutations are less likely to occur, but they are still a possibility. Because of this we are maintaining a rigorous (and costly) Quality Control program by sequencing every assembly.
In an effort to conserve funds we have moved from Qiagen spin columns to those offered by Epoch Life Sciences. We have begun to make our own buffers (or use those leftover from Qiagen kits) to do our purifications. We chose this tack because it is"

For more information and discussion on these experiments, please visit our sequencing results .
Further improvements and prospective applications
We obtained a proof of principle that indicates how library preparation is enriched towards a specific DNA sequence. However, the method will still need to be optimized before it can be used for detection applications. One of the major improvements to be made is the optimization of the protocol for integration of our fusion protein. Buffer composition must be altered to favour reaction kinetics of both dxCas9 binding to target and Tn5 integration. Another improvement of the method should include the design of optimal adapters compatible with ONT library preparation. This could be done by interacting with sequencing experts from ONT because the specific adapter sequences are not known due to corporate secrets. For our prospective collaboration with Oxford Nanopore technologies, please visit our Entrepreneurship page .
This method was designed and developed while searching for a solution in detection methods for gene doping, but the application scope is much broader than that. By simply interchanging the sgRNA with one of your own interest the target can be changed unlimitedly. The ability to enrich samples for specific DNA molecules prior to sequencing can be used in research areas that require highly detailed information of DNA mutations. Such studies could include single point mutations to large structural variations or copy number alterations, detection of viral infections, fetal DNA screening and food safety maintenance ( Gabrieli, Sharim, Michaeli & Ebanstein, 2017 ).

UCC iGEM 2017
Human Practices Summary:
The team contacted two groups in our community that would be impacted by our project; local dairy farmers and a micro-distiller. By contacting local dairy farmers we were granted an insight into how our project be applied in their work. A biosensor that can detect antibiotics precisely, quickly and inexpensively would take great pressure off farmers, who would worry that their home tests were inadequate, causing penalties from regulatory authorities. Our goal to create an easily accessible biosensor for antibiotic contamination in food products such a milk would provide a benefit to producers in less developed or regulated countries to test their produce with an ultimate goal to reduce antibiotics in the human food chain. With methanol poisoning still a worldwide cause of death and disability, producing a similarly inexpensive and accessible biosensor for methanol could save lives. Both deemed our projects ethical and of potential benefit regarding regulations and healthcare.
Integrated Human Practices:
Environment & Sustainability
We believe that our project would in the long run be a more eco-friendly alternative to the some of the “use and throw” tests currently employed by our target market. The slider device which is used has a rechargeable battery and our overall system will not result in any biohazard released into the environment. The slider device can be reused continuously so will add to the sustainability of our product.
Social Justice
Upon contacting local dairy farmers, we were informed that even if there is accidental contamination of milk (for example when one farmer’s cow managed to drink a bucket of anti-biotic contaminated milk that was due to be discarded!) or through a faulty detection test, the farmer will incur heavy penalties. Our product aims to be more accurate and inexpensive to prevent unjust costs on these farmers. We also determined that by making a more accessible test for methanol, we could allow more entry to the market as some regulators won’t allow the alcohol to be sold without a safe test (testing by taste was not exactly an approved method!). As identified by BordBia, taxation alone impedes entry to the market to starter companies, so any way to lower the cost can help.
Collaboration
We skyped iGEM teams in Newcastle and Exeter, and exchanged information about cell free systems and our methods with EFPL Switzerland.

June 29th to July 5th: Second round of promoters are completed and are being confirmed. Promoters with varying numbers of sites were now being constructed in order to have promoters with sufficient expression. It was found that modifying so close the TATA box significantly reduced promoter activity.
July
July 6th to July 12th: More transformations of promoter constructs that we had created into different strains of yeast that were previously created in the lab. In doing so, we could appreciate the effects that the already modified genes in the various strains of yeast would have on the regulation of the promoters. Within our spare time of course, we amplified more of the same monomers that we had used to create the tested constructs, so that if worse came to worst we could easily re-create the construct again or modify it in numerous ways.
July 13th to July 19th: Many constructs confirmed from previous transformations, full gradients were conducted in order to characterise the first round of promoters created.
July 20th to July 26th: Final round of promoters were completed and transformed. Testing of colonies continues.
July 27th to August 2nd: We had achieved the final promoter test strains that we had sought after for the entire summer thus far. Of course we knew it would probably need to be modified and possibly be re-created if the testing of it proved it to be feeble. Thus, upon transforming it into different strains of yeast we tested many colonies and used many different drug concentrations over the course of our analysis of the final construct. We created entire new constructs just in case anything were to fail.

Correct cloning was verified by digestions with EcoRI and PstI. Correct plasmids were cotransformed into E.coli BL21 and single colonies were streaked on LB-Amp.
Plasmid isolation was performed with colonies from last week’s Gibson assembly. The gained plasmids were cut in different combinations (Fig.1) to check for the correct assembly of pCERI. One clone showed correct bands for all different approaches and was sent for sequencing.
The putatively correct pCERI was transformed into E.coli BL21 and E.coli Nissle 1917 and single colonies were streaked on LB-Amp.
pSB3C5_J04421 and pSB3C5_J04450 were also transformed into E.coli BL21 to be used as positive controls later on.
This week colonies from TOPO transformation were inoculated over the weekend and grown overnight for analysis on Monday. Colonies after one day were only observed in TYR TOPO, empty vector control plates showed colonies after two days whereas there was no growth in overnight cultures of TH TOPO.
Both TOPO TYR and empty TOPO cultures were miniprepped and digested with EcoRI + PstI and XbaI + SpeI for analysis. Gel analysis of digestions revealed only a single band the size of the vector in the EP digestion and a band the size of the vector plus insert in XS digestion (Fig. 2). The decision was made to repeat digestion overnight and to perform single as well as double digestions.

Presentations and Feedback -- Participants present their experimental design and rationale.
PANEL:
To engage the minds of the public on the topic of synthetic biology and its environmental, legal, social, and ethical implications. As audience members entered, they completed a short questionnaire which illustrated their preconceived notions of synthetic biology and their opinion on our project. After the panel, participants were asked to conduct a post-panel survey to measure the efficacy of the information conveyed during the panel. iGEM Team Member - Carla Hamady - 4th-year molecular genetics and genome biology double major. iGEM Head of Research & Design iGEM Team Member - Adnan Sharif - 3rd year in a double major in Cell Bio and Chemistry. PnP Lead DIYBio- Ranvir ‘Rana’ Chaudhri - has a masters of biochemical engineering            and is the co-founder and vice president of DIYBio. He works on unique ideas            and strives to push the boundaries of science and what it is capable of.            He believes in do-it-yourself for whatever you’re into, the joys of self-directed            learning, and friendly sharing of knowledge to better people’s lives. DIYBio Toronto            is a non-profit organization that runs a biology and chemistry laboratory for startups            and personal projects. BioZone Graduate Student - Patrick Diep - a biochemist who completed his undergraduate at the            University of Waterloo and is now transitioning to the Ph.D. stream at the Department of Chemical            Engineering at the University of Toronto. His research concerns the bioengineering of microbes to            remove and recover heavy metals from mine waste. The SynBio Forum was conducted to measure public acceptance and assess the public’s concern for our            project. It was our hope the audience will discover that synthetic biology is very complex and can be            beneficial if practiced in a responsible way. Furthermore, I hope the public and the student body will            learn about iGEM, iGEM Toronto, and our present work, achievements, and consideration for the environment            and society.
PRE & POST PANEL SURVEY
To measure the information the audience had received we conducted a pre and post-panel questionnaire. Although the survey does not have statistical significance due to the small number of participants and the lack of randomization of the participants’ demographic. For example, 78.6% of participants were between the age of 19 and 30 years of age and 85.7% of participants earned a high school diploma or equal degree.

--CS-- Today I helped Julie a little with plasmid preps of the overnights that she had made from our successful colonies. Since P. aeruginosa came in today, we streaked out some of the bacteria on a normal LB plate. We also isolated DNA directly from stock by sticking a tip into the bacterial stock, putting that in 50 μl water, and boiling the water; we also streaked out a plate using the tip that we pulled the bacteria out of the stock with. We then used PCR to amplify the 4 denitrification genes (nirS, norB, norC, and nosZ) in 4 separate PCR reactions. We used Q5 as the polymerase since it is high-fidelity.

6. The plants are removed from the solution and wash.
7. Plants are wrapping with plastic cover, are laydown on their sides for 16-24 hours to maintain high humidity.
8. On the next day, remove the cover and keep it in a growth chamber.
9. Plant dry seeds collect using a sieve mesh.
Transformation
The transformation of the plant was made using V9(BBa_k382002) without  the construct, this was made by using the floral deeping protocol, this was using an agrobacterium culture transformed with the vector, the flowers of the plant were placed in the medium with agrobacterium and then let it rest.
The plant were placed in a room at 21 degrees but we werent able to prove if the vector was being expressed or not.
Modeling
In 2010  Harvard's 2010 iGarden  used its  V10 for Agrobacterium transformation and confirmed its presence with kanamycin.  This team showed their results  for V9 (BBa_K382002) and V10 (BBa_K382003). In their results the vectors were transformed into Arabidopsis, after Agrobacterium mediated transformation, and  confirmed their presence with  kanamycin.

BIT,2015,Team:BIT-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," pH Controller, is mainly applied in the field of industrial fermentation, which could keep the pH value of the fermentation in an artificial setting. Among the many types of fermentation, food fermentation can be the most direct impact on human health. However, in the face of food fermentation, the biggest potential risk of our project is the toxicity of acidic or alkaline products when regulating the pH of fermentation liquor. Consequently, we are committed to finding a simple, non-toxic and harmless substance as regulators from the beginning of the construction of our gene circuits. At present, only D-lactic acid catalyzed by ldhA may be toxic. But it is only used as a model gene. When used in the actual industrial fermentation, we will analyze factors including recycling rate and reaction among product, regulation acid and alkali since D-lactic acid is also an important fermentation products. At the same time, we have found the gene which could catalyze pyruvic acid to produce L-lactic acid. In the subsequent industrial practice, we will select those harmless genes to avoid these risks.
2.Feasibility Assessment[Collapse]
Compared to the traditional methods, monitoring and adding acidic or alkaline substances, our project constructed self-regulating system using synthetic biology, which is more conducive to solve the problems, such as long-term detection, maintenance of equipment and so on. We focus on the design of the earlier stage. According to HP information feedback from companies and universities, we could choose a variety of ways to apply it in the actual industrial fermentation, such as mixed bacteria fermentation, immobilization, etc. For different fermentation industries, we will apply the appropriate fermentation method to get the maximum benefit. Application of our project will greatly save the cost of testing, maintenance, and mechanical conditioning system, and also with the expansion of scale and time, the advantages of our project will be more obvious. Our customers will be able to obtain higher returns based on the actual industrial scale. If our project will eventually be applied to industrial fermentation successfully and efficiently, maintenance staff will be reduced, but at the same time, it will provide more opportunities for those who have the ability to design biological regulation system.
3.End-User Considerations[Collapse]
The main application field of our project is industrial fermentation, so it is necessary for us to contact with fermentation companies. Depending on our previous experience, we decided to communicate with COFCO Institute of Nutrition and Health. On the one hand, companies usually focus more on final efficiency of the technology, which is helpful for us to collect important information about how we can apply it better, but on the other hand, it"

Overview: The green light producer
For the production of green light, we relied on tried and trusted firefly luciferase from P. pyralis. This has a recorded luminescence emission peak of roughly 557nm, as recorded in Shapiro et al. (2009) and other references ( Figure 1 ). This part was originally submitted by Ljubljana 2007. The sequence analysis revealed that there were 6 bases inserted upstream of the coding sequence. The distance between the ribosome binding site and the start codon was thus not optimal, and this resulted in a decreased luminescence intensity of the cells. We removed these 6 bases by PCR and resubmitted the part in pSB1C3.
Figure 1: Emission spectra of the P. pyralis luciferase (in solid black line).
Image: Shapiro et al. (2009)
An alternative approach was planned during the early stages of the project: the combination of LuxAB with another protein: YFP from Vibrio fischeri. This would shift the wavelength produced by LuxAB towards the green regions of the spectrum, to activate our green light sensor. During our discussions with UNAM-Genomics Mexico we realised that they planned on making the same part, so we stopped working on it, planning on testing its combination with our green light sensor later on. We unfortunately have not yet reached that stage, but the part is available in the registry as BBa_K360010 .
In addition to the above, we created"

Synthetic Transcriptional Cascade: The plan
Comparing advantages and disadvantages of both approaches (mainly the leakage problems), the negative synthetic transcriptional cascade was selected. The construction of the plasmids is as showed in figures 6 and 7.
Figure 6. Synthetic Transcriptional Cascade’s Plasmid 1. Before IPTG induction the constitutive expression of cI and RFP will repress the production of GFP and the culture will glow red. The construction was made using the Biobricks J13002 , C0051 and I13507 in a Cloramphenicol biobrick backbone pSB1C3 .
Figure 7. Synthetic Transcriptional Cascade’s Plasmid 2. With IPTG addition, the expression of the repressor TetR is induced which will stop the expression of cI in plasmid 1. Once the degradation of cI is enough to avoid the repression of lp, GFP will be expressed. The construction was made using the Biobricks R0010 , P0440 , R0051 and I13504 in an Ampicillin biobrick backbone pSB1A3 .
After addition of IPTG, the repressor LacI will change its configuration; this will allow the transcription of TetR in plasmid 2. This molecule will act as repressor of the promoter Ptet in plasmid 2, this stops the production of the repressor cI and red fluorescent protein (RFP). After these events, the promoter lp will be free to allow the production of GFP after a delay in time from the addition of IPTG to the final expression of GFP (Figure 8).

PPI fluorescent reporter based on split-GFP
(BBa_K1997014)
Since protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been reported to play important roles in signal transduction and gene expression, methods for monitoring PPIs in cells have been developed rapidly for years1. In our registered and submitted parts, we provide two split-GFP fluorescence reporter systems, split-HRP enzymatic-based reporter systems and split Luciferase chemiluminescence-based reporter system.
Our favorite basic part BBa_K1997014 is the core of the newly registered split-GFP reporter system as well as an important member of the collection PPI tool kit. Its function was based on tripartite association between two 20 amino-acids long GFP tags, GFP10 and GFP11 respectively, and the complementary GFP1-9 detector. When proteins interact, GFP10 and GFP11 self-associate with GFP1-9 to reconstitute a functional GFP (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Schematic representation of different approaches for split-GFP. Shown also were the method we stimulate the PPI in our experiments.
TO PROOF THE FUNTION of this part, a composite part (BBa_K1997018) with the addition of lac promoter, RBS and double terminator was constructed. After overnight expressed in E.coli, relative fluorescence intensity was calculated (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Evaluation of the Signal-Noise Ratio of split GFP system.
(A) Schematic representation of the evaluation protocol. The complete Zif-268 protein was introduced to simulate the condition where strong interaction among two proteins occur, whereas the split-zif protein was used to simulate the condition where no interaction exists. (B) Fluorescent assay showing the fluorescent intensity under two different conditions. Relative FI was calculated with normalization of the OD600 value. This experiment was run in three parallel reactions, and the data represent results obtained from at least three independent experiments. **p<0.01"

Analysis of questionnaire content
Which type of cancer treatments do you know?
Figure 8.
During your treatment, what kinds of treatment did you receive?
Figure 9.
Result of question 1 showed that, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy were the most well-known 3 treatments to patients and their families. Among the three, chemotherapy comprised 88.71%, accounting for the highest number of votes, showing that everyone considers ""cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"" closely linked.
It could be learnt from the question 2 that, chemotherapy plays highest application in cancer clinical treatment, accounting for 87.1% of all investigated patients, which made chemotherapy the most well-known one.
Now when it came to new drugs, it surprised us that around 1/4 of the patients already know about molecular targeted drugs and other new drugs, and 14.52% of patients have received new therapy treatment, showing that patients are no longer unfamiliar with targeted therapy and other new treatments now. Also, doctors would rationally suggest the appropriate patients to actively try new therapies including targeted therapy.
We also learned that, there exists many patients who tried target detection but at last not eligible for targeted therapy; For those who apply targeted therapy, only half of them are receiving good effect, while the other patients choose to give up targeted therapy and regress to traditional treatment due to trivial effect or unaffordable medical expenses.
For different treatment methods, which part do you think is more important?
Figure 10.
The results of question 3 showed that, regardless of treatment types, patients value the efficacy superior to other factors. Many patients and their families told us that they would still strive for an ideal treatment no matter how expensive it might be, as long as it can guarantee efficiency. ‘Side effects’ accounted for the second"

In this process membraneless organelles are formed, induced by variable domains of the Ddx4 protein. We want to investigate whether fusing the enzymes of the pathway with the Ddx4 protein enable droplet formation and thereby induces metabolic channeling.

Our three main methods
1. Gibson Assemblay
To design the needed constructs, we are using different cloning techniques. Regarding the first approach the construction of the plasmid containing the needed proteins and guide RNAs for the scaffolding is conducted by Gibson Assembly . Gibson Assembly is an isothermal, single reaction method to assemble multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By this a seamless construction of synthetic genes, pathways and entire genomes is possible. A precondition for the seamless combination of two DNA fragments are identical terminal DNA sequences. The overlapping DNA molecules are added to a reaction mixture containing the needed enzymes and are afterwards incubated at 50 °C. A T5 exonuclease removes the terminal nucleotides at the 5´end and creates sticky ends. This way formed complementary overhangs of the DNA fragments anneal to each other. A DNA Ligase seals the nicks while the gaps"

Our Bacillus subtilis transformation with psB4A5 failed; the only colony that grew was not pink, then we thought it was contamination and that our cells were not competent.
To elucidate what was the reason for what the bacteria did not grow, we plated our competent cells on LB media and transformed again but this time using puc19.
We also replated the only colony onto selective media.

Introduction
Silk fibers produced by the arachnid Nephila clavipes (Golden Silk-Orb Weavers) produce unique mechanical and immunogenic properties (Vepari et al., 2007). The highly tensile and elastic properties of these fibers, coupled with the non- immunogenic and non-allergenic phenomena observed with spider silk, make it a suitable candidate for a wide variety of biomedical applications (Schacht et al., 2014). In particular, studies into the use of the spider silk monomers MaSP1 and MaSP2 with fusions to select molecules or interactive binding domains have arisen to study the potential for spider silk as a seeding and drug delivery mechanism (Humenik et al., 2011).
However, large-scale production of spider silk has been hampered due to the poor sustainability of Golden Spider farming and subsequent silk collection procedures (Schiebel, 2004). Recent explorations into the use of recombinant silk proteins through bacterial chassis and microbiological vectors have shown tremendous promise, but are still hindered by a wide variety of issues, including (1) relatively low yield of recombinant protein relative to the amount of cell culture needed, (2) a complex and time-consuming process in constructing and troubleshooting modular forms of the silk-binding site fusions, (3) harsh chemical conditions during the purification of recombinant proteins that lead to potential denaturation of active peptides, (4) GC-rich hindrance of mRNA transcript stability and translational termination, and (5) poor scalability of recombinant silk production absent the use of large, relatively expressive bioreactors for bacterial fermentation (Winkler et al., 2000; Prince et al., 1995; Arcidiacono et al., 2002).
Studies investigating the potential for co-spinning, a process in which the terminal domains of the functional N. clavipes silk protein heavy chain are fused with genes encoding functional binding domains, and subsequently are combined with native silk proteins to form crystalline fibers, have shown some success (Sponner et al., 2005"
