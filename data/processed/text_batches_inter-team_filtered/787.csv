UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
In order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then"

Human Practices (Silver)
We contacted family members, friends, and representatives of the World Health Organization to discuss current issues with birth control. We sent out questionnaires to several grassroot organizations and advocacy groups around the world to gauge their interest in our product and learn about stigma, cost, and access issues. We also presented to local classes to teach them about iGEM and discuss potential ethical issues with our project. For more information, check out our Human Practices page !

future directions
Because plants take a long time to grow, we were unfortunately unable to verify the function of our parts in Arabidopsis. As soon as we have a sufficient amount of plant tissue, we can confirm that the plants growing on selective plates are transformed via PCR. Alternatively, the GFP knockdown plants should be identifiable by their loss of fluorescence. Stay updated with our results after the Jamboree by checking out our

We held a cross-discipline seminar delivering lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project, through which we harvest massive creative ideas and comments. Click to see in detail.
Figure 2: Seminar on campus
    Then we made our way to the public. Before it, under the guidance of biotechnological company’s planning staff, we got fully prepared by making related resources including exhibition boards, leaflets, souvenir stickers and postcards ready. What’s more, to make the activity more interactive and engaging, we took fully advantage of our visualization tool, the two games derived from project idea and modeling results. We optimized their function under the guidance of professional game designers from ‘Perfect World’. Click to see in detail.
Figure 3: A visit to Perfect World
    Finally, we made a hit at China Science and Technology Museum by holding a workshop named “Deciphering Life” that targets both adults and children. We propagated synthetic biology to adults by displaying exhibition and delivering explanation. For children, we had playful workshop activities including engaging art design, DNA model building and web game section with the hope to inspire their affection towards science and research. We got precious feedback from different groups. Staffs from the museum reminded us about the rigorous nature of science and we should balance between rigorousness and joyfulness when we choose the methodology in our activity. We were also inspired by children for more possibility in considering the influence of spatial factors on population interactions that may be helpful for our future work. Click to see in detail.

    On campus, we also discussed our project with professors in the field of microbial biology. We finally confirmed three characters (farmer, warrior and beggar) for our project together. We especially want to express our appreciation for Professor Xie and Wang who provided us lots of advice in introducing and completing the character beggar whose prototype in nature is “cheater”.

1. The candidates of instructor:
Chun-Yao Chen: Dr. Chen went back to school, team leader will make sure whether the teacher would receive to guide or not.
Prof. Ji-Hshiung Chen: We would like to inquire Prof. Chen to receive guiding us
2. Team leader would discuss the 2009 iGEM Cambridge’s project and the E.coli they use with the professor Ping-Young Woon.
3. We should review the concepts of biochemistry and molecular biology, learn how to design primers, and glance at the experiments and materials of the 2009 iGEM Cambridge’s project.
4. We decide to contact with each other by gmail.
5. We hope to finish designing the primer before this Thursday. (We assume that we could get the alk operon region from Bielefeld University.)
6. Shih-Shan teach us how to design primer.
Calculate the value of Tm.
In prokaryotic genes, they need Shine-Dalgarno sequence to help the RNA polymerase binding, so, the fragments of PCR prefer to include the upstream of alk genes.
The length of alk fragments are about 2k each.
Make sure which plasmid backbone we should use on iGEM website.
7. We dicided to add the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the primer directly, there are about 7-8 bases.
8. The problems related to the primer design that have to solve immediately as follows:
First, decide which expression vector to use, and design the restriction site on the primer.
Secondly, should we decide to include the alkG gene into our idea model?
About this question we have to review the papers about the A. borkumensis genome which was mentioned in the reference that Shih-Shan sent from.
9. Team leader brought up an idea about observing trace elements would let the e.coli change their color.
10. If the time were enough to add the fluorescence gene, we could know the ocean was polluted or not. (The green light of luciferase system is different from the light of photosynthesis system.)
11. Shih-Shan illustrated how to find alkB1 sequence on the NCBI:.
Progress Report:
1. The e-mail of requesting Bielefeld University to offer us ALK genes had sent out.
2. Team leader would send the application document to buy the cyanobacteria from ATCC.
3. About the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria, the reference states that it is different from the prokaryotic and the plant photosynthesis"

Green fluorescence comes from the GFP-tag fused to the protein or from the incorporated Green Lysine.  Red fluorescence is due to the CY5 labeling of the DNA.
Second scan is taken after 10-15 minutes of  wash with PBS.
For data collection the fluorescence intensity measured under the button is normalised to the background and the DNA/protein ratio is calculated. This ratio is ploted against the intensity of the fluorescence of DNA in solution to make the saturation curves. And the Kd for each sequence is calculated from these curves by fitting the next equation:

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," very rare in the whole. This method can greatly increase the possibility of contacting the survey group, with relatively low funds and strong feasibility. In this survey, we were unable to obtain hospital diagnostic information and people who had been tested for allergens were relatively hidden. Thus, we used snowball sampling to encourage respondents to pass questionnaires to people around them who had allergies or who might have been tested for allergens.
Online Survey
We did an online survey that is based on Wechat - the most popular social network in China. The questionnaire is showed on screen as it showed on a paper. And the respondents need to tap the proper options or type in their answer, which is more convenient than the traditional paper way. But the drawback of this method is also obvious. This survey can only collect data from the certain population with a smartphone and a Wechat account, which is highly possible to result in an unbalance sample. We will further discuss this dilemma in the section of sample characteristics analysis.
Result
Analysis of Sample Characteristics
The final sample was formed by the first sample with convenience sampling and the latter sample with snowball sampling. And we focus on the following characteristics of the sample, which help us to analyze the sampling way we design and the population.
Age
As it shows in the pie charts, the respondents of 40-60 years old take up over 60% of the sample, while the old whose age is over 60 occupy the least. This result gives us hints that the sample way we choose is easier to get feedback among people in 22-60 years old.
Family Income
It is showed in the figure that the households of middle class prefer to fulfill the questionnaire rather than others. This is probably because most of these families have smart phone and social network, which are both essential to fulfill the questionnaire.
Sex
In this circle chart, it is obvious that the female respondents occupy the majority.
Education
From the diagram, we can know that the high education respondents make up over 80% of the sample.
Biology or Clinic Background
From the charts, it is worth noticing that the respondents whose family has biology or clinic background occupy a proportion about 29%, which is surprisingly higher than we expected.
According to the displayed statistics, the respondents of our survey are mostly the young and middle-aged who live in a middle-class family. And people who are female or have a biology or clinic background are more likely to answer our questionnaire. One reason for this result is that our survey is based on social networks and this certain population of people is more likely to have chances to use the social network and answer the questions"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

Collaboration with other teams is key to overcome problems as the one Team Sumbawagen experienced; other institutions may have the required resources to test parts or perform other experiments for another group.
Of course, one of the most important parts of starting an iGEM team is having a good idea for a project. iGEM enthusiasts need to think about this carefully: what problem that affects a given community, large or small, can they solve by applying synthetic biology concepts? A large amount of research needs to go into how the project will impact everyone involved and the environment. Working closely with those who the project aims to benefit will help to understand what are their needs and how they should be addressed.
What’s next? Apply on behalf of your school for the contest, come up with a cool project idea involving Biobricks, keep dedications high, and take it a step further to Boston to show the world what you’ve accomplished!
Overview
Our portable device enables users to detect the impurities in their food on-the-go. The WHO estimated that 1 in 10 individuals are affected by foodborne diseases globally each year. We have developed La La LAMP, a program which allows individuals to record and share their device results. Each experiment can be recorded by scanning its unique QR code, which is provided on the PDMS chip. We envision that this information sharing would enable scientists and researchers to better track trends in food safety, as well as enable the general public to take control of their food safety wherever they are in the world.

Synthetic Biology at UCLA
Synthetic biology is the creation and manipulation of living organisms to accomplish a defined task.  The principles of engineering and biology have converged to form its basis. As a unique and emerging multidisciplinary field, there is incredible scope for education and advancement.
Through a vast field, synthetic biology has taken roots at undergraduate institutions around the world  in the form of a competition: International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM). iGEM offers undergraduates  the opportunity to conduct original research, design new biological systems, and share those results with a  community of schools, laboratories, research institutes, and industries. The iGEM community looks to help in advancing the developing field of synthetic biology with the goal of fostering scientific research and education among undergraduate students.
As members of UCLA's Synthetic Biology Club and iGEM team, we are excited to see where the field of synthetic biology, and the iGEM competition, can take us!

Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Do the elderly have difficulties taking prescription medication?
13th of August 2018
This report will analyse a range of literature with the objective of identifying whether the elderly have any difficulties in taking prescription medications and if so, why this is. Firstly, it is important to understand the context of what the current climate is for elderly people taking prescription medication In the United States, a recent report by the Department of Health indicated that 55% of the elderly do not take medication according to the doctor’s orders and approximately 200,000 elderly people are hospitalised due to adverse reactions to their medication. 1) These trends are supported by cholesterol studies, which found that 57% of elderly patients using statin therapy stopped taking them after 6 months and 74% stopped taking them by the end of five years, despite needing these medications for their entire life in most cases. 2) This suggests that already, there is a clear issue with the elderly not taking their medication as prescribed. As the reports demonstrate, this is having a huge impact on hospitalisation levels as a result and puts the elderly at a greater risk of death.
When analysing why the elderly are having difficulties in taking prescription medication correctly, Marlo Solitto suggests that memory loss is a key issue, linking this to elderly people who suffer from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. 3) The UK Alzheimer corroborates this, stating that sometimes people with dementia refuse to take prescribed medication adding that we must not just assume the patient is being ‘difficult’. 4) Dr Kim Notenboom took a alternative approach. Her research concluded that physical constraints such as impaired vision and poor handgrip made it harder for elderly people to open and remove medication from packaging and then use the medication. Dr. Notenboom argues that these constraints increase as people age. 5) Dr Rohan A. Elliott highlights the need for the doctors prescribing the medication to be more aware of the"

                The plasmids:

        The construction:
        
2.Precision of the Logic Gate
        We did four parallel experiments: the bacteria solutions were added by IPTG of 10^-4mol/L, arabinose of 10^-3mol/L, both of them, and neither of them. The following picture is our result.
        As is shown in the figure, solutions with no inducers or only one inducer can produce little GFP fluorescence which verify the precision and feasibility of the AND gate. But, GFP fluorescence is high when only adding IPTG. This may because the leak of Pbad. Considering the principle of AND gate, it is reasonable. Only the protein T7ptag can activate the gene controlled by  T7 promoter, though T7ptag has two amber mutations, some E.coli endogenous tRNA may also identify the stop codon, which causes the leaking of Pbad seemingly.         
3.Response Concentration：
        Next, we designed experiments to verify the response concentration. Through these experiments, we can also conclude under which concentration can the AND gate have the best effect. We designed a series of gradient about how many inducers should be added. The concentration of IPTG and arabinose varied from 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5, 10^-6, to 0. Following is the result.
        Seeing from the right figure, with the increase of the inducers’ concentration, the fluorescence intensity also increases. This figure has met our expectation. As the absorbance value (shown in the left figure) indicates the amount of bacteria, we can make sure that the increasing of fluorescence intensity is not caused by the bacteria growth.         
4.Response Time：
        We measured the sample every certain period after adding inducers, and make the response curves in the figure. We found that after adding arabinose and IPTG, the fluorescence intensity satisfies a linear growth curve. However, the fluorescence intensity of the group with no inducers flattens after 2 hours. The difference of fluorescence intensity between two groups becomes apparent after 2 hours. Thus, we estimate that the response time of logic gate is around 2 hours.         
5.Analysis of Result
        In general, we have verified the feasibility of logic gate. We successfully simplify the three-plasmid system based on our reference, and obtain a good result. After adding two inducers, fluorescence value changed"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," At first the expression of the fusion protein SH2-cI was shown, with a SDS-PAGE and a Western blot assay .  The results revealed an expressed protein with a mass about 25 kDa. This was the expected mass for the fusion protein and proofed that the designed protein is expressed as expected.
Figure 2: EMSA results. In alternaty application the DNA fragment with the 434 OR1 binding site and the DNA fragment with the lambda binding site were used as DNA sample. +/- = with/without SH2-cI fusion protein. Only with the sample with the 434 binding site and addition of the SH2-cI protein a band shift could be seen.
The next step was the proof, if the designed DNA binding domain cI of the fusion protein really binds at their specific sequence. Therefore, a in vitro experiment with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) was realized.  Only with addition of the cI protein the DNA fragment runs slower in the gel, which is a hint for an interaction between the cI protein and the binding site. Also another DNA sequence was tested as well with the lambda phage binding site instead of the binding site of the phage 434. This experiments results in no differences of the run speed of the DNA fragment in the gel and therefore no interaction of the cI protein with the DNA. Besides the in vitro proof also an in vivo proof was accomplished.  Through a cloning step of a GFP generator under the control of an Anderson promoter upstream of the reporter, an experiment was created, where the RFP gene of the reporter is highly expressed, when cI is not binding at the specific binding site.  It was measured in a fluorescence-activated cell scanner ( FACS ), that the RFP intensity of a non cI producing cell is about 35% higher than in a cell of with cI protein expression. Therefore, the designed DNA binding domain is functional.
Figure 3: Results of the BLItz experiment. Illustrated are the measured base line, the association and the dissociation of the protein-protein interaction in the BLItz. The addition of the second protein is marked at 60 seconds after measuring the base line. The SH2-cI fusion protein was added at the start without washing (green), after one (purple) and two (yellow) washing steps with NaCl and after a washin step with a high concentrated HCl solution (upper blue). Also BSA was measured with 1 μg/ml (lower blue) and 10 μ/ml (red) protein.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," can be relieved from binding to the DNA by being bound to by metal ions – these include zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and cadmium (Cd) (Moore. C.M and Helmann. J.D; 2005). This can be summarised in the table below:
Metal Sensor
Metals Sensed
czrA
Zn
Co
Ni
Cd
AND Gating
If the two ion selectivity tables are put together, it can be seen that the metal common to both sensors is cadmium:
Metal Sensor
Metals Sensed
ArsR
As(III)
Ag(I)
Cu
Cd
CzrA
Zn
Co
Ni
Cd
This means that if the two repressors can act on a single promoter or binding site by AND gating, cadmium can be detected and a biological response can be triggered.
The presence of cadmium ions releases both ArsR and CzrA binding proteins from the DNA allowing transcription to occur.
Cadmium sequestration by metallothionein
So the cadmium has made its way into the cell; and the cadmium has been detected by the metal sensors arsR and czrA. The question is: what happens to the cadmium now?
In our project, we hope to soak up the intracellular cadmium with a metallothionein known as smtA. Metallothioneins are proteins which have great tendencies to bind to cationic metal ions; examples of which include copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) (Creti. P., et al; 2009). This property is due to the richness of cysteine residues in its structure (Creti. P., et al; 2009).
In the cell, metallothioneins generally have two important roles: to remove non-essential metals via sequestration and to control levels of essential metals (Creti. P., et al; 2009). It is the first role with which we are concentrating on.
smtA encodes a metallothionein of the same name – this protein, which is described as a class II metallothionein seems to be synthesized in response to metals such as zinc and cadmium (Morby. A.P., et al; 1993). This suggests it has a role in cadmium sequestration.
Our Bacillus spores are coated in the metallothionein by making a fusion protein with cotC a major sp"

Berlin_diagnostX,2017,Team:Berlin diagnostX#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," identifying a new, unique and highly expressed RNA molecule in the transcriptome of Taenia Solium, we created a new series of sensors aiming at this new target without changing the design algorithm. This approach led to two promising sensor candidates that were further analyzed:
RNAseq
By visiting India as part of our Human Practices activities and by building up a strong collaboration with iGEM IIT Delhi and hospitals as well as NGOs in Varanasi, we were able to obtain RNA-samples from lysed T. solium eggs. We were able to isolate RNA from these samples and sent it for sequencing to the sequencing core facility of the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. We received two sets of RNAseq data from our samples. One containing 48 million fragments (96 miollion total reads) and the other one containing 44 million fragments (88 million total reads). Since the two sets of data could be treated as technical replicates, reads were combined and aligned to the T. solium reference genome. In total, 70.98% of the reads were aligned unique mappings, 13.57% multiple mappings and only 15.42% were unmapped reads.
The figure on the right shows a large amount of alignments to genes that may be associated to mitochondrial RNA which may be highly expressed in T. solium eggs and could be an interesting target for future sensor design. Until now, analysis of our RNA sequencing data still is in progress. To this date we can say that we are to our knowledge the first group to describe RNA sequencing data from T. solium eggs. This is particularly important, since RNA expression may differ in T. solium eggs compared to samples from the whole organism. To this date we were able to find out, that many targets we identified in our first analysis of the whole worm transcriptome, are present in eggs, but in much lower expression levels. This underlines again the importance of this sample and its potential to contribute to the discovery of new RNAs that may serve as targets for tapeworm diagnostics.
Nested PCR
New RNA sequencing data and new transcriptome analysis leads to constantly changing targets. Increasing the scale of our test pipeline, while reducing the time and costs spent during the generation of a single sensor, is essential to a successful future of our project. Thus, we focused on establishing a reliable Nested PCR method by which the switch production can be performed within a single reaction.
Using the single-tube nested PCR method, we add both extension primers and the template simultaneously to the PCR mastermix. First, the primer P1 will add the individual"

Collaborations
This year iGEM Guelph continued its expansion to fostering relations with other established teams and had two main teams with whom we collaborated.
Collaboration 1: iGEM Waterloo
iGEM Waterloo was a huge help this year. This team, being the closest team to iGEM Guelph geographically, ended up being one of our largest sources of expertise. iGEM Guelph is now in its second year, still trying to be established at our home university, while iGEM Waterloo has existed for nearly a decade! With their team and university connections so well established, iGEM Waterloo provided our team with knowledge during every encounter, such as at the Ontario iGEM Annual Meeting (oGEM) and at University of Western Ontario’s Synthetic Biology Conference. We’ve discussed topics that ranged from how to secure funding from our university, motivating team members throughout the year, what we should be looking for in a faculty supervisor and different angles from which we should explaining the iGEM Experience.
The Waterloo iGEM also gifted us black, flat, clear-bottomed, 96 well plates so that we could complete the interlab study.
Thanks for being our awesome big siblings, iGEM Waterloo!
Collaboration 2: iGEM Dalhousie
iGEM Dalhousie became very close with our team between the friendship of their Co-President Matt Curry and our own Jehoshua Sharma. With Dalhousie being a cool 13 hour drive away, a lot of our team communication has been over skype. iGEM Dalhousie and iGEM Guelph seemed to have similar issues arise this year and we had many Skype sessions discussing how to tackle lab interest and engagement within the team. We learned from their prior experience the help that Graduate Mentors can provide to an undergraduate team and a healthy way to retain members is by having an exciting incentive outside of lab work to keep the entire team contributing and on task! iGEM Guelph was able to also offer a few suggestions such as discussing potential University avenues to secure funding from (such as their President or Office of Research) as well as the concept of having weekly lab meetings with their faculty supervisor.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the increasing demand for insulin and higher demand of crops/edible carbon sources will require a more sustainable technology, we went to visit the Novo Nordisk Science Park in Måløv, Denmark, to interview Nina Gunnarsson and Kjeld Olesen, who both are researchers in the Strain Development department in Novo Nordisk. With more than five years of employment at the company, they provided us with some insights on how they currently produce insulin, what they value in a production organism and what it would take for them to apply our technology. Click here to read the full interview or read along to get a short version.
Novo Nordisk currently produces recombinant insulin in the conventional baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by growing it on different refined sugars.
“We use a very little amount of sugars compared to what is consumed for food, so right now that sort of sustainability is not that a big of a concern for us. We are more focused on our obligation to provide sufficient amounts of insulin to the patients”
said Kjeld Olesen, when we asked them if changing their substrate into a less competitive and sustainable one was something they were considering. Nina Gunnarsson added: “We obviously have a big focus on having the most optimal processes with the highest possible yield with the minimum environmental impact.” And the most optimal process is for Novo Nordisk is one, where the demand for purity is met. Nina and Kjeld explained to us that purity in regards to avoiding degradative proteins and post-translational modification, especially O-glycosylation, is very important, but the purity of the entire process is essential to obtain the high level of quality required for a therapeutic protein.
We ultimately asked Nina and Kjeld from Novo Nordisk, if they believed changing their insulin production to Yarrowia lipolytica growing on abundant waste streams would be an option: “Well, it would be a huge project! Because the product quality is so important, it would be a very long and complicated changeover, which will include a new factory and new experts, so it would have to be a very good business case,” Nina replied and Kjeld followed: “A stabile, continued supply of substrates is very important. The content of the substrate cannot vary either.” And in conclusion, Nina suggested we should consider applying our technology for something other than therapeutic compounds: “Maybe this would be more applicable for production of other things than therapeutics - such as bulk chemicals, enzymes or food additives, that do not have the same quality and purity requirements.”

What we were able to take away from this outreach was the relevance of our first MARS branch, Microfluidics 101. Providing this easy to access information for anyone interested in microfluidics would be positively impacting the synthetic biology community but also the scientific community at large. Especially when we have coupled it to our rapid prototyping and manufacturing methods.
Black Hole Lab
Over the summer we were also in contact with Black Hole Lab who manufacture plug and play microfluidics for researchers. As we were in the beginning stages of fabrication, our questions for them were mainly in regards to manufacturing chips and what standards they recommended in order to ensure quality control. What we were able to learn is that at the moment there are no specific “industry standard” when working in microfluidics. Quality control guidelines can be built around manufacturing methods and depend on quantifiable parameters. Through building an evaluation system for our workflow, we would be able to introduce a microfluidics “standard” for research purposes. This impacts the existing field through allowing researchers to better document, evaluate and standardize their devices.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Decarboxylation_-_-_TEXT.html,"After preparing our production media 48 hour incubation sample for gas chromatography and extracting with ethyl acetate, we left our sample for use in the GC. Our results indicated a small hydrocarbon peak, indicating a possibility that hydrocarbon production had been a success, but it was not distinct enough to make this conclusion. The procedure would be repeated, this time creating sigma compound solutions as well. These sigma compounds would resemble naphthenic acids. In order to ensure that hydrocarbon peaks would be produced from these compounds and not from glucose, we prepared a new production media lacking glucose, in hopes that incubated bacteria could survive for long enough without a food source to decarboxylate a sigma compound to some extent. Since the sigma compounds we initially selected for our purposes had not arrived as of yet, we opted for others: Cyclohexanepentanoic acid (CHPA), cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. We performed eight overnight cultures and prepared sigma compound solutions. Despite our many attempts, we were only able to acquire an OD of about 0.6 for these 8 tubes. We then performed our production protocol with the tubes, preparing them with the following reagents and inoculating them with the contents of our broth cultures:
Tube 1: Glucose
Tube 2: Glucose
Tube 3: Glucose and CHPA
Tube 4: Non-glucose and CHPA
Tube 5: Glucose and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
Tube 6: Non-glucose and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
Tube 7: Glucose and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid
Tube 8: Non-glucose and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid
In the above tubes, “glucose” indicated that glucose-containing production media was used, whereas “non-glucose” indicated that the production media lacking glucose was used. In each case where a sigma compound was added, it was present at a concentration of 25mg/L. Each production tube was then left for a 48 hour incubation over the weekend, to perform gas chromatography tests the following week.
Week 8 (June 18 - June 22)
This week, we received the results of our gas chromatography of the eight tubes created last week, and unfortunately no hydrocarbons had been produced in any of them. It was thus very important"

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"atable promoters, light regulated ones and also Nac2. Nac2 is still a system we consider to try - we could switch off the expression of Cas9 when needed and regulate it in case it's toxic in higher amounts by concentration of thiamin. But it is actually in the UTR and regulated by a nuclear gene which regulates a photosynthetic gene. So we need to obtain a strain which has been designed to have these pathways independent, we'd need to optimise concentrations of thyamin and design more constructs.!
We also considered another level of safety by introducing another gRNA which would make the Cas9 to cleave itself after homoplasmy has been achieved. However as NHEJ does not exist in chloroplasts, we would also need to supply the template. Still an option! But at the moment we plan to introduce Cas9 cassette either transiently or just into one copy of DNA, not homoplasmic (we plan to try both), let it drive the propagation of our genes of interest and then be lost when we remove the selection pressure of antibiotics. A semi-stable type of integration was decided as an alternative to transient because transient may not produce enough product and be list too quickly.
We are also considering delivery of the preassembled complex of gRNA and Cas9 or its parts into chloroplast by biolistics, although it might be beyond our time-scope
Because of safety our Cas9 and gRNA were initially separated either physically or one of them was outside the homology regions so that it won't be integrated. It was because we had only one insertion site and corresponding homologies. In the current design the Cas9 and gRNA are in one construct but gRNA is targeting another region on the chloroplast genome (so that it drives expression).
Our polycistronic design of cassette might be simpler and produce shorter DNA fragments but maybe complicated for cell processing so we decided to put separate promoters for gRNA, antibiotic resistance and Cas9 fused with FP
ACTIVITY OF CAS9
We had troubles with assessing that our Cas9 is active as one of the first steps. It would be very elegant to let it drive propagation of its own cassette with markers (or changing colours of algae already transformed with a fluorescent protein), making the strain less viable in field but the same in the lab (eg. by nutrient utilisation defficiency). The best solution would be restoring functionality of some mutant strain by the cassette. But we want to avoid a gene drive at all costs. We have also considered surveyor assay. So we are still looking for ideal solutions, probably"

Summary
pCat (Bba_I14033) is not compatible with GFPc (Bba_E0240)
A new protocol and a range of arabinose concentration (0, 5, 10, 50 uM) were used in inducing pBad.
The new induction method still did not result in any fluorescence
The ligated parts Bba_I14033_E0240 has proven to be problematic because it does not fluoresce. Furthermore, additional verification through gel electrophoresis either show a wrong band size or nothing at all. Therefore I tried to create this composite part using entirely new I14033 (pCat) and E0240 (GFPc). While this new combination ended up producing the correct band size during restriction mapping, its colonies still did not fluoresce. Additional verification was done using 1.2% agarose, where pCat_GFPc was run alongside GFPc. A higher agarose concentration was used to visualize a <100bp difference and the result successfully showed the difference between the 2 parts. I figure out that maybe pCat is simply not compatible with GFPc. During the restriction mapping for pCat_GFPc, I tried varying the digestion time (2 hours versus 4 hours) to understand its effect on ligation efficiency. I found out later that such variation did not affect restriction digest efficiency.
Another problem that came up last week is the failure of inducing pBad (Bba_I13453) with arabinose. I previously tried the induction by adding 10uM arabinose into the liquid cultures of GFPc (Bba_E0240), YFPc (Bba_E0430), and RFPc (Bba_J23100) under the pBad promoter. But the liquid cultures autofluoresce under the UV light because the cultures have a yellow hue by themselves. So I tried a new induction protocol this time, in which 500 mL was aliquoted from each liquid culture 8 times. Using 4 of these aliquots, I pelleted and resuspended the cell in 1x PBS (pH = 7.4). PBS was used because it did not have any color, thus preventing any possibility of autofluores"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," models the wide variety of stresses affecting honey bees 1 .  As such, it is the ideal basis for our investigation into the effects of BeeT on Varroa mites and honey bee dynamics. Beehave has several modules covering colony dynamics, foraging, and a Varroa mite model as depicted in Figure 19. Two viruses are also included in the model: deformed wing virus (DMV), and acute paralysis virus (APV), both for which Varroa mites are a vector. Our BeeT module, which runs parallel to beehave, is capable of modeling transport of BeeT into the hive using sugar water or bee bread. It also calculates how much BeeT is transported to larvae based on consumption of honey and pollen stores. The Varroa mite mortality is determined by the amount of BeeT near larvae when Varroa mites emerge from brood cells. This in turn affects Varroa mite population levels in the hive, reducing virus loads in the hive, and allowing colony survival.
Figure 19: The honey bee colony model includes Varroa mite dynamics and virus epidemiology, agent-based foraging behavior with either pre-defined landscape definitions or a representation of local floral patterns. It is also possible to include weather patterns to more accurately model local conditions. Note that the model includes various interdependent mortalities and other parameters which are not included in this figure. Figure from Becher et al. 1, .
Model Considerations
Not everything is known about the BeeT model and as such, it was necessary to make certain assumptions. Some of these are related to BeeT in general, while others are specific to the sugar water or bee bread applications. We will first discuss general limitations of our model, and then address each of the applications separately.
General Assumptions: several properties of BeeT and its chassis are currently unknown. This includes the degradation rate of BeeT, both inside and outside the hive. With both treatments BeeT encounters different environments while being transported to larvae. For sugar water,  BeeT is exposed to the honey stomach of bees, honey stores, and brood cells, whereas bee bread encounters pollen and brood cells. We do not know the effects of these different environments on degradation rates of BeeT. For this reason we assumed that degradation rates are stable inside and outside the hive. Another uncertainty is what the effect of BeeT is on Varroa mite mortality. We modeled this by using a saturating The chosen saturating function smoothly approaches one and is used to calculate mite mortality. function. We also assumed that"

Insulin: Basic Background
• What is the role of Insulin in the Human body?
      Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that removes glucose from the blood. In healthy individuals, excess glucose is readily removed from the blood stream by a proportional production of insulin. In persons with diabetes mellitus however; the body is either resistant to insulin, or it has a reduced capacity to produce insulin. Those individuals require an external source of insulin.
• Why are we expressing human Insulin?
      The ability to produce recombinant human Insulin cheaply has long been a lucrative goal. There are millions of people worldwide who are dependent on Insulin derived from production methods that make the product expensive -and further yet- potentially dangerous.Our team thinks that the current production methods for human Insulin are inefficient and can be optimized by being expressed in Pichia pastoris.
• What is the current method for Human Insulin production?
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli have historically been the preferred host cells to produce recombinant human insulin; however, each one of these organisms has great disadvantages.  E. coli lack secretory mechanisms, thus the cells must be lysed and processed to isolate the insulin. Another concern with E.coli is the lactose operon acting as an inducible system to control gene expression. S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, have the necessary secretory machinery to secrete insulin, but they produce it at very low yields compared to E. coli.
• Why are we using Pichia pastoris to express Human Insulin?
      P. pastoris is a eukaryotic organism in the yeast family that overcomes both obstacles encountered by the aforementioned organisms.  P. pastoris has been shown to excrete proteins at a rate of approximately five times that of S. cerevisiae with higher qualitative value as well. Recombinant"

Background
The hypothesized engineering advantage that the modelling team chose to focus on was simultaneous delivery of proteins into cells.
We considered n genetic toggle switches [1] linked up in series, such that a reporter protein is transcribed only when all the switches are down. We imagined each toggle switch to be activated by a different protein, represented by the different colours in the diagram below:
A series switch with n=2 genetic toggle switches. Each toggle switch is activated by a different protein (hexagons). When all the switches are shut, the reporter (semicircle) is activated.
Furthermore, we allow the switches to ‘pop open’ after some length of time Δ, if the circuit has not been completed. This means that if all the proteins do not arrive within Δ of one another, the reporter is not activated:
The red protein arrives and activates the red switch. But by the time the blue protein arrives, the red switch has popped open, so the reporter is not activated.
The red protein arrives and activates the red switch. This time, the blue protein arrives before the red switch has popped open, so the reporter is activated.
Experiments
We wished to compare the rates of activation in a population of bacteria where proteins are packaged in vesicles (constrained to arrive simultaneously) versus unpackaged dissemination into the environment (where no such constraint arises).
To ensure bacteria can not activate themselves, we consider two populations:
We consider two populations of bacteria (green rectangles) such that proteins secreted by one population can activate the switches in the opposing population. We wish to compare the rates of activation where proteins are packaged in vesicles (top) versus unpackaged dissemination into the environment (bottom).

The LPS-binding site is 32 to 50 amino acids in length and forms an amphipathic  loop which binds to the lipid A portion of LPS (11, 15, 18). We therefore  studied whether a molecule such as ENP, which binds to lipid A and has been  shown to confer protection against the deleterious effect of LPS in vivo, could  block one or more of the sequential LPS-induced events leading to increased EC  monolayer permeability. In this work, we have studied whether ENP protects  against LPS-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, actin reorganization, and  loss of endothelial barrier function. the importance of the  amphipathic loop structure can be investigated by introducingappropriate  disulfide bonds to create a cyclic conformation. However, previous  investigations with cysteine- and non-cysteine- containing peptides derived from  TALF, a protein highly           homologous  with LALF, showed little difference in LPS binding activity (23).

Synthetic Biology Society
Synthetic biology society is a group of students at the University of Cambridge aiming to bring together biologists, engineers, physicists, computer scientists and others to work in synthetic biology and share knowledge. It has been established by previous iGEM members in 2015. The society has ambitions to raise awareness about synthetic biology amongst students, broaden their knowledge through talks and as probably the only Cambridge science society it is actively working on primary research projects.
A few of our members got involved over the year with society’s activities and helped a bit with its beginnings and Lucie is on the current committee as the project manager. Last year’s project still in progress involves building a computer-navigated microscope moving in all three dimensions and scanning samples. Apart from continuing this we are planning a wetlab project in Biomakespace (have a link) which wants to explore cell-free systems. The project may change slightly but we want to make and tune a simple light oscillator (probably using fluorescent proteins fused to luciferase for sharper output changes) and also build a physical electric circuit imitating the biological system. From there we can study and demonstrate if the two systems behave and can be regulated similarly or differently, which may have a big educational value, we could also concentrate on transferring the system into a living organism or even some design using multiple oscillators. The emphasis in the project will be put on sharing skills, learning (even through seminars and trainings) and exploring what synthetic biology and scientific work in a team are all about!

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Choice of Protein_-_-_TEXT.html," acts directly on the target tissue promoting growth. We had thought about producing IGF-1 ourself and discussed this with Jon Scott who thought that it might be very interesting and useful for long term missions to combine these anabolic proteins with exercise in space.  Being able to produce IGF-1 onboard would potentially help the astronauts with maintaining muscle mass during space exploration.
Growth hormone (GH)
Growth hormone has both long term and short term effects. The short-term effects are diabetogenic while the long-term effects promotes tissue growth especially muscle and bone. The long-term effects of GH are mediated by IGF-1[5][6].  Therefore both IGF-1 and GH are very closely linked, and whether to use one instead of the other depends on the therapeutical context.  We thought about producing GH ourself but were unsure. When speaking with Jon Scott we learned that it might be very interesting to combine anabolic proteins with exercise in space and therefore we chose to consider GH as one of our target proteins.  Being able to produce GH onboard might potentially help the astronauts maintain their muscle and bone mass during long term missions.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
Karen McDonald suggested we could look into producing Parathyroid Hormone, because it is a bone anabolic hormone and some astronauts suffer from bone loss during microgravity conditions. Parathyroid hormone is produced in parathyroid gland and is secreted in response to low blood calcium concentration. PTH activate the osteoclasts and thereby promote bone resorption and release of calcium and phosphate into the circulation. PTH also promotes secretion of phosphate in the kidney, thereby elevating the concentration of free calcium ions.  Despite this PTH also has anabolic effects on bone and is currently used as a osteoporosis drug [7] which makes PTH a very interesting protein for us to produce. Being able to produce PTH onboard might prevent bone loss in astronauts.
Antibody/ single domain antibody
Almost all the experts we have talked to suggested us to produce antibodies, because antibodies are useful for many different things. Our main idea as it is right now it to produce antibodies for detection of different molecules, this could be used both for differential diagnosis of astronauts but also for research purposes and help in a lot of different research purposes in space for instance enlightening what happens to the human body during microgravity. We have looked into which alternatives there is to normal antibodies and found that there exists a single domain antibody that might be easier to produce with our system and are as specific as the human one [8].

The negative control plate we did (T10 E. coli cells only) grew a lot of colonies, thus effectively pinpointing the source of our problems the past week.  The agar plates which had ampicillin on them were no longer effective in killing all other bacteria besides what we had transformed which carried resistance to the antibiotic.  Hence why we had such contamination and poor isolation of plasmid DNA.  The other plates looks abnormal for E. coli colonies and they were thrown out.  The Kanamycin resistant plates worked fine and had no contamination.  We proceeded with plasmid preps for the two samples that were grown on Kanamycin plates, the GFP+Terminator (BBa_J52028+ BBa_B0015) composite part and the constitutive promoter BBa_I14033.

6/15: Today I did the plasmid preps from the GFP+Term composite part and the K-resistant promoter from yesterday.  DNA quantification was overall decent, much better than the previous week.  Also, I made new agar plates with ampicillin.  Luckily the 2011 iGEM plates with the DNA arrived and we transformed our promoters and RBS parts again using the new materials.  We transformed the same 5 promoters, 3 RBS, and the RFP gene.  Today was also our lab meeting which was run by one of our graduate student mentors, Suma.  We discussed our recent problems and the steps we've been taking to fix them.  As a team, we decided on transforming another promoter (BBa_R2000) and GFP composite part (BBa_E0240) so that we could use Kanamycin plates and quickly develop a working GFP construct plasmid.
6/16:  This morning the transformation plates of the 5 promoters, 3 RBS, and RFP looked good.  Most had a few colonies and some had a lot.  Only the inducible UV light promoter (BBa_I765001)"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," or the original one (Figure 1) were amplified (region 1) by PCR
As can be seen we successfully managed to get a 98 bp amplicon, which is what we expected, demonstrating that our PCR amplification is working correctly in the plasma.
The next step was to perform a Cas12a assay using both amplified DNA sequences as targets. We performed a dual specificity test, combining each of the targets with either a complementary crRNA, or the crRNA for the other corresponding                       sequence. The results are shown below.
Figure 3. Results of the Cas12a detection assay performed with both fragments amplified previously (average fluorescence; n=4 replicates after 250 minutes; bars represent the standard error here), i.e. region 2 of                           both BRAF mutated fragment (that contains the BRAF V600E mutation) and BRAF original one (non-mutated). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) target site is indicated between brackets. Both amplified regions were targeted                           by either a complementary crRNA or the crRNA complementary to the same region on the other DNA fragment (mismatch). Controls (negatives) consisted of the treated plasma with no DNA template added in it. Please refer to Figure 1 in order to have an overview of the crRNAs/DNA fragments used for this experiment.
We can see that a point mutation inducing a mismatch between the guide RNA sequence (gRNA) and the target region resulted in more than 2-fold difference in fluorescent signal, which is coherent with our hypothesis suggesting the high                       cleavage specificity of the Cas12a/crRNA binary complex.
Besides, it is relevant to notice that the Cas12a system was not activated by any noisy background (i.e. the different cell-free DNA fragments present naturally in the plasma other than the one we poured), which proves once again the                       high specificity of our system.
Result 2: Characterisation of the sensitivity of the Cas12a/PCR system
Next, we wanted to investigate the correlation between the concentration of Cas12a target strand and the degree of activation of the protein (fluorescent signal), by lowering the concentration of DNA in our sample reaction mix, and                       testing the sensitivity of our system in the fM range. Amplification of the second region of respectively 10 pM and 10 fM initial concentration of BRAF mutated DNA template was performed.

Successful assembly of parts K175023 and K175024 which correspond to Plasmid 1 and 2 of the Biosynthetic AND gate section respectively.
Electroporation of plasmid 1 and 2 into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells.
Results
The assembly of the plasmid 1 ( K175023 ) and 2 ( K175024 ) was successful. After the last assembly step (it is worth to mentioning that all assemblies were carried out using the BioBrick Assembly Kit ), 2µL of the resulting DNA mix was electroporated into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells. This resulted in two 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes containing cells with either plasmid 1 or plasmid 2.
250µL of cells carrying either plasmid 1 or 2 were used to inoculate one LB agar plate containing the proper antibiotic as selection marker. The plates were incubated at 37ºC overnight. One of the resulting colonies from each plate were used to inoculate one 5mL LB tube each. The tube was incubated overnight at 37ºC and 175 rpm. The resulting cultures were used to obtain miniprep plasmid DNA which was sent to sequencing. Unfortunately, the sequence showed no match with any of the planned biobricks. As the time was running and less people were available for the lab work, this strategy was left behind and the efforts were directed to the lock/key library and the synthetic transcriptional cascade.

An iGEM Critique
2015 is the tenth year that the University of Waterloo has been involved in the iGEM competition. It's a proud moment for our team and our school, but it is a good time to reflect and provide a critique of iGEM as a whole.
As a student who's been involved with iGEM for three years now, I've been involved in a number of exciting projects; seen hundreds more; and learned an incredible amount about biology, teamwork, and leadership. Being a part of iGEM has provided experiences for me that I am proud of and will look back fondly on. This address isn't meant to denigrate or diminish all of the hard work that thousands of individuals — especially those at iGEM HQ — have put into making iGEM such a success. However, as iGEM becomes more successful and broadens its scope, it has a responsibility to keep its direction clear, and to stick to the values that I and many others admire. This address is meant to highlight flaws that I have observed over the past few years, and hopefully to give some idea of how to remedy them.
There are two main topics I would like to address and talk about in detail: iGEM's priorities with respect to education and students, and the wall that separates iGEM from science.

Background
The human intestinal microflora is considered an essential “organ”      which plays an important role in human health. This complex ecosystem      is composed of approximately 500 anaerobic and aerobic bacteria species,      most of them localized in large intestine.
Many studies on animals      bred under germ-free conditions have shown that microflora has specific      functions:
Metabolic: fermentation of non-digestible dietary residue and        endogenous mucus, salvage of energy as short-chain fatty acids,        production of vitamin K, absorption of ions;
Trophic: control of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation;        development and homoeostasis of the immune system;
Protective: protection against pathogens.
A disruption or an alteration of human gut microflora equilibrium leads      to severe auto-immune diseases, types of colon cancer and non-allergic      food hypersensitivities; therefore, it is very important to keep its      integrity.  In fact already a century ago, the first probiotics have      been commercialized. Probiotics are bacteria species (normally present      in human gut) that are administered as food components or supplements.      Nowadays, with the emerging research field of synthetic biology the      potential applications of probiotics could further increase. In addition,      the introduction of novel functions to this “organ” via probiotics      could lead the way to new therapeutics in order to cure or prevent many      pathological conditions.
Project overview
We engineered an indigenous strain from the gut microflora in order to      create a safe, controllable and versatile molecular platform, which can      be used for production of a wide range of molecules.  For this purpose      we used the Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (commercialized as      Mutaflor) as the host organism for our platform. This particular strain      has been used as a probiotic for decades and its beneficial effects      on"
UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," decided that implementing the ROBUST Method would provide a viable solution to this problem . In our research on industrial fermentation processes, we learned that the fact that glucose could be easily metabolized by many organisms, including potential pathogens, contributed to contamination.
We decided to implement the method in microbial organisms to synthesize valuable, unconventional carbon sources as feedstock that could similarly prevent contamination for our bio-production platform.
Point 3: Establishing Criteria for Carbon Source Selection
Rationale
Up to this point, our team needed to decided what carbon source could serve as an alternative to current food-based crops that served as feedstock. We decided to talk to Dr. Dan Wichelenki at a startup in Virginia called Bonumose Biochem LLC which is currently involved in the synthesis of artificial sweeteners. We felt that this was most beneficial because it allowed us to understand the criteria for having an industrially viable manufacturing process, which was one of Dr. Shaw's key points.
Exploration
We discussed several different topics in a tele-conference call with Dr. Wichelenki. First, he expressed great interest in our project, noting that his company manufactures two sugars that serve as artificial sweeteners: allose and tagatose . When we explained to him that we were trying to use a different feedstock, he suggested that we do in depth analysis of the carbon source because that was going to be a central aspect of our project. He urged us to look at factors including (1) cost of manufacturing for each, (2) any documented effects of that sugar, and (3) chemical properties that could rely on less expensive methods of purification. He said that most carbon sources would be more expensive than the typical glucose, but its long-term benefits in preventing contamination outweighed any short-term savings.
Deliberation
After a team meeting following the Skype with Dr. Wichelenki, we agreed that he had given some invaluable advice regarding the assessment criteria for choosing these carbon sources. However, we felt that we had to add another criteria to that list, namely the idea that the carbon source had to have at least some detailed research on its potential applications. The reason we wanted to make this distinction was because we believed that in order to minimize our environmental impact, we needed to use a rare carbon source that had already been well characterized by others, especially use on an in industrial scale.
After in-depth analysis of 4 sugars (xylose, mannose, lactose, and tagatose) using Dr. Wichelenki's criteria, we managed to narrow it down to xylose and tagatose. After another round of consideration,"

Based on these data, we have estimated the potential market size. We believe that there is a potential market of 187,5 MW in the first 4 years. This is equal to 1% of the estimated market growth of the German companies.
Development prototype
The BioLens will be further designed and tested during the first half of 2017. The cost breakdown of this phase is shown in Table 3.

The prototype will be developed in collaboration with the TU Delft and they will be co-owner of the IP therefore. BioLens will have the exclusive right to use the developed prototype. To develop our prototype, we will use a laboratory from the TU Delft. We are looking at multiple grants and subsidies to (co-)finance the early stage research and development. Furthermore, we plan to apply for the so called UNIIQ funding. This is a Proof of Concept fund for early stage start-ups that need funding to develop their invention to market readiness.
Expenses
We have made an estimation about the expenses of the first four years of the company. The breakdown of those expected expenses can be found in Table 4.

Creation  of SynBio facility at our University
In our second year as iGEMers, we decided to have as part of our outreach (and for our safety) something that could last for other iGEM teams in our University. So, the question was: how to leave a legacy to the next iGEMERS (SynBio lovers) for the years to come? The second question: how to have an lab with biosafety level to work with MeHg? The first thing that came to mind was: a nice and exclusive place to work – by the way this is the desire of all iGEM team throughout the world. But, we all knew how bureaucratic and time consuming is to find a place in a crowded university in Brazil.
We got famous; going to newspaper and web sites due to our project divulgation. Of course we took advantage of being exposed in the media by the Mercury Bacter project and used this visibility to our benefit. So, being known in the higher university administration we could ask for a lab space for SynBio. We did it! And now UFAM has its own DNA hacking space! All under biosafety requirements and standards from CTNBIO (Brazilian Biosafety Authority) and the University commission for Biosafety (CIBIO). We wanted to have a place where we could work, talk about high tech biology, and work at a competition level. We worked on the strategies needed and also helping to build the structure which gave us extreme excitement and a sense of being part of the university, working together with professors and technicians and the most important in a safe place for SynBio.
Big time! And we all could sing along: “…
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do”

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Project#Synthetic TKL_-_-_TEXT.html," after   laborious work of weeks, we had failed to obtain proper PCR products   due to the high G+C content (≥70%) of the interest DNA sequences.   Afterward, to achieve our goal in a more efficient way, we contracted   GENEWIZ, an international genomics service company, to synthesize the   genes. With the coding genes under the control of T7 promoter and   double T7 terminator, we successfully assembled three constructs for   our design.
We were able to assemble all of our constructs and continued our work   with our synthetic DEBS1+TE, DEBS1’+TE (KR of module2 in DEBS1 was   replaced with KR of module1) and RFP+DEBS1+TE (DEBS1 was fused with   red fluorescent protein) by transforming them into the E. coli strain   BAP1. (Fig. 2)
If the right product triketide lactone can be generated, we can   conclude that the standardized domains can work relatively   independently and generate normal product.
Also, we changed the loading domains which selected different   substrates resulting in product of different polyketides.
Furthermore, we can shuffle the domains as units between different   DEBSs.
Induction of PKSs
12-48 hours after induction with IPTG, culture broth samples of the   recombinant strain expressing the chimeric polyketide synthetases were   collected and subjected for further analysis.
Results
1. DNA Electrophoresis
We used restriction enzyme digestion and/or PCR to validate the   constructs (Fig. 3). The constructs carrying DEBS1+TE and DEBS1’+TE   were isolated and digested with EcoRI (Fig. 3, lane 1 and 2) or double   digested with EcoRI+PstI (data not shown). The construct carrying RFP  +DEBS1+TE was validated with PCR (Fig. 3 lane 3) and EcoRI+PstI double   digestion (data not shown). The results showed that all of the three    constructs were successfully created.
2. SDS-PAGE
DEBS1 is a large protein of 370kDa. We performed SDS-PAGE to confirm   the expression of the recombiant DEBS1+TE and DEBS1’+TE. However,   none of DEBS1+TE, DEBS1’+TE (data not shown) and RFP+DEBS1+TE (Fig.   4) could be detected after Co"
