Extended project description
This summer, we are engineering the bacterium E.D. Frosti that induces ice crystallization, using the ice-nucleating protein ( INP ), or inhibits ice crystal formation, using the anti-freeze protein ( AFP ), depending on the given stimulus. These proteins will be extracellularly anchored at E.D. Frosti’s cell membrane. Furthermore, it is essential to create a dual-inhibition system, so that INP and AFP can never be expressed at the same time. To test this system, we coupled the production of a particular color to a specific stimulus given to E.D. Frosti. Finally, as a safety mechanism, we installed a suicide mechanism in E.D. Frosti, whose activity is mediated by an “AND”-gate system: the cell death mechanism is only activated when one of the two stimuli is given, AND a sudden decrease in temperature (a cold-shock) occurs. To construct our E.D. Frosti project, we had to create several mechanisms which will be outlined below.
1. Dual inhibition system
Since E.D. Frosti contains all the genetic information to execute both functions, it is important to make sure that only one type of protein is expressed in one E.D. Frosti cell. We found that a dual inhibition system is a good way to ensure this, as you can see in the next figure.
When arabinose is added to the medium (stimulus 1), it will induce transcription from the pBAD promoter ( BBa_I13453 ), resulting in LuxR ( BBa_I0462 ) and LuxI ( BBa_C0261 ) transcripts that are translated into their respective proteins. LuxI is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of N-Acyl homoserine lactones ( AHLs ) from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)  and acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA).  These AHLs, when bound to LuxR, are able to regulate transcription through binding with a luxR binding site located in promoter regions. In our system, the LuxR-AHL complex will perform a"

(1). In 2015 iGEM Oxford , the problem they want to tackle with is presented as below:
• Antibiotics have negative side effects and their resistance is a growing problem
• UTIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the bacteria that cause them are frequently resistant to antibiotics
• Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms
• Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of all hospital-acquired infections
• Current UTI treatments are ineffective and fail to prevent recurrent infections
It could be hard to tell if the sentence “Antibiotic resistance in UTIs is caused by biofilms” be categorized into providing 1 attribution of responsibility, since biofilm cannot be a cause if there is no antibiotic.
(2). We confront another situation in deciding how many attribution of responsibilities are provided, see 2013 igem TU-Munich :
Antibiotics, hormones and various noxious substances threaten environmental health and are not effectively removed by conventional waste water treatment.
They provide three attributions to the issue in a sentence, we finally decided they fulfill the item of providing more than three attribution of responsibility.
In more case, iGEM teams wrote down sentences in a straight-forward, affirmative voice, leaving no room for more consideration and thinking. In other words, though there may be many factors contribute to one phenomenon, for many time we hesitate if we should consider an article as “there is no attribution of responsibility provided” or “There is one attribution of responsibility provided.”
2. The exclusion of school education. In this research, we won’t and are unable to investigate the effectiveness of school education, though it is the most important part of laying down the scientific knowledge basis for our society.
3. The limit to audience. In this research, we assume that the information is transferred and translated to general public with basic knowledge about science, the so-called educated layman. Besides, the target audience of newspaper, journal and iGEM wiki diverse form each other, making the comparison                     invalid to get important information form analysis.
For iGEMers who are interested in social research, here are some dilemma we encounter:
i. Hard to consider the difficulty of a technical term
A. Gene technology-related term:
Understanding of a term may vary.

The NEFU iGEM team created a survey regarding the ease and speed of creating the wiki.

Conclusion
Through our collaborative efforts we were involved in the projects of 20 other iGEM teams who hail from 15 different nations, as mapped out in the figure below. Collaboration is an important part of iGEM: Through the global iGEM community huge undertakings such as the parts registry and annual Jamboree are achieved. We were overjoyed by the positivity we found whenever we got in contact with another team, and we believe that by continuing to strive to make the iGEM community an inclusive and supporting one, this competition can continue to move from strength to strength in the future.
In the the distant future we look forward to continued cooperation with our friends from international institutions, but in the near future we are looking forward to meeting them all in person at the Jamboree!"

Hence, we retried entire conversion process (see Week 6), got a positive result, and then DpnI digested it. As for pKD-sgRNA-tolA, we wanted to put them into the expression strains that already had the pCas9 plasmid, but these stubbornly grew really slowly in and were unable to reach the correct OD to make them competent.
Overexpression Team
More colony PCRs this week! We continued with the screening process from last week, and eventually found the final putative positive hits that had the correct size insert. For these, again, we miniprepped the plasmids, PCR amplified the insert again, and submitted them for sequencing. We also transformed the cloning strain with an RFP-expression plasmid, hoping to use that for microscopy later.
Week 10: August 1 - August 7
CRISPR Team
We managed to make our pCAS9-bearing cells competent using calcium chloride, and transform them with pKD-sgRNA-degS, too. Once we managed to grow them up sufficiently, we performed a colony PCR to sequence their plasmids and double check that everything was perfect
Overexpression Team
We took a new approach to fusing the two alMGS fragments into the full gene: amplification using 5'-phosphoprimers, such that the two products could be ligated together. Running the results on this procedure on a gel revealed the same result as last time - the reactants were still present at a much higher abundance than the product we wanted (i.e. the full gene). We tried a gel extraction of the correct-sized band, but the gel itself had an unexpected error and we lost all our product...
In what was good news, though, we managed to order the gene in from fragment from IDT, negating the need to fuse it together, hence we decided to wait until that arrived.
Characterisation Team
We made competent the cloning strain bearing either g3p or tolR expression constructs, and transformed these with RFP-expression plasmids. We took these double transformants, as well as the respective single transformants, to the Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope at UNSW's Lowy Centre, taking a variety of cool snaps of fluorescent, hypervesiculating E. coli! However, we realised once we got there that we forgot to bring our negative control - a strain with just RFP - and so the strength of our data was"

To expand the application of BBa_K2559005, we searched theBBa_J04450stored in registry and do another improvement in the BBa_J04450. The BBa_J04450 is a strong RFP expression vector in E.coli. As the main page of BBa_J04450 mentioned, the E.coli colonies with BBa_J04450 were in red color under normal light after about 18 hour culture on LB plate (Figure 2). We used the BBa_K2559005 to replace the RFP region in BBa_J04450, the modified part is BBa_K2559009. We transferred the BBa_K2559009 to DH5α by heat-shock, and found that the fluorescence signal can be observed under the UV (Figure 2).
Figure 2 Colonies with BBa_J04450 (red colony) and BBa_K2559009 (green colony) visualized under UV lightbox.
So, we confirm that our improved part BBa_K2559005 can work in different E.coli expression system. We are also looking forward to more application of the BBa_K2559009!

We received a new strain of Pseudomonas, LD2, this week that had previously been used to study the pCAR1 plasmid. It was grown up in PCA media and had its colonies used for colony PCR. We also received our new primers this week, further increasing the chances of successful PCR. Using the new strain and the new primers CarAa, CarAc, and CarAd all showed at least some bands of close to the correct size. After PCR purification we obtained DNA concentrations of 21.3 ng/uL for CarAa, 41.9 ng/uL for CarAc, and 32.8 ng/uL for CarAd. These products were then restriction digested using EcoRI + PstI sites.

The main responsibilities were updating our team website, aaltohelsinki.com and developing our wiki page with Matilda, who was responsible for the UI design. I implemented the wanted functions and look with html, css and jquery. Together with Matilda, we also planned the wiki structure and figured out how iGEM works, how the judging system works and which pages are required. In addition to the web work, I actively participated in ideation, planning, visits and interviews, fundraising and application discussions. I was the secretary of our association, completed the Interlab study together with Maisa, and when I could, helped out in the laboratory. I taught some basic html and css skills to our team members as well as to the Estonian team who visited us. We organized a modelling workshop/presentation to the Finnish International Biology Olympiad team with Maisa. To the wiki, I wrote on the pages Ethics, Safety, Interlab, Dialog and Education.

Mr. Liu has his own opinions on new cancer therapies.  Before this interview, we weren’t very confident about our project as it was based on a new theory.  Mr. Liu’s words encouraged us.  He said that he strongly supports novel therapies as he himself is a direct beneficiary of such.  And he assures the team that the general public are accepting the idea of new bio-therapies.  As technology develops, new therapies will show more of their advantages.  If new projects can well pass the clinical trials, they will eventually become recognized by the patient.( Click here to see the video )

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," realized that some of my carbon-number figures were off. I originally generated a carbon number input file from the iAF model. Specifically, I ran a python code that identifies the number of carbon atoms in each metabolites chemical formula. However, I realized that some of the metabolites were defined differently in the iAF model than in the WM1788 model. I had to manually go through the model and update any figures that were not matching up.

Finding Metabolites
J_exp22
After tediously updating my carbon number input file, I reran my GAMS code and collected my updated outputs in an excel file. Tom recommended I generate a scatter plot of max biomass vs. max ATP to see if I could identify any observable trends. Him and I noticed a portion of the plot that followed a rigid linear trend. Of the metabolites that were along this trend line, one was glucose, our models primary source of energy. Because our objective was to look into supplemental metabolites/energy sources, specifically those with higher flux values than glucose, we were only interested in those metabolite above glucose on the trend line. This consisted of 73 metabolites.
Given several metabolites in the model are either intermediates or impractical to isolate and provide the cell, I started doing a literature check on each one to determine its candidacy. Even though I only ruled out a handful of metabolites that are intermediates, all of the remaining metabolites were either phosphorylated or sugars, specifically glucose derivatives. We were only interested in these six sugars, which include maltotriose, maltotetraoise, maltose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose.
- Experiments From Jul 17
Writing a summary
J_exp23
I completed my summary of metabolite additives for Cheryl, including a project overview, the general procedure I followed, constraints and reasons for such, and findings. We believe that the addition of these sugars, providing additional sources of energy, can promote cell growth and activity. I also added mine and Laura’s slides to the Monsanto powerpoint.

Meeting with iGEM and Succinate miracle?
J_exp24
Laura and I summarized the results of individual trials in our meeting with iGem. After mentioning the 6 sugars I identified from the addition of our metabolite exchange reactions, one member of the WashU team mentioned hearing of an outside branch having success with replacing glucose as a sole energy source with succinate. From this, I started transitioning on to a new topic"
IIT_Delhi,2015,Team:IIT Delhi#project_-_-_TEXT.html,", industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide.
Sulfur dioxide is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as the result of fuel combustion. In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air. However, this is no longer the case.
Sulfur dioxide affects human health when it is breathed in. It irritates the nose, throat, and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest. The effects of sulfur dioxide are felt very quickly and most people would feel the worst symptoms in 10 or 15 minutes after breathing it in.
Those most at risk of developing problems if they are exposed to sulfur dioxide are people with asthma or similar conditions.
The CysI gene converts sulfur dioxide, SO2 to hydrogen sulfide, H2S. However, hydrogen sulfide in itself is a harmful gas. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation. U.S. EPA then includes these sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) and targets them for federal clean-up activities. U.S. EPA has found hydrogen sulfide in at least 35 of the 1,689 current or former NPL sites. Hence, cloning the SQR gene is important, as it will convert the toxic waste gas hydrogen sulfide to sulfur, which is a solid product and can therefore be separated out with ease.
Gene construction & cloning:
The general cloning strategy for NrfA consists of the following steps.
1. The biobrick BBa_K896000 (Sqr), previously submitted by NYMU iGEM 2012 team, was obtained from iGEM repository.
2. Another biobrick consisting of the Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site BBa_K880005 (P+RBS) was also procured.
3. (P+RBS) was doubly digested by EcoRI and SpeI enzymes to yield Eco-(P+RBS)-Spe construct.
4. (Sqr) was doubly digested by XbaI and PstI to yield Xba-(Sqr)-Pst construct.
5. A linearized vector was prepared by double-digestion with EcoRI and PstI.
6. The 3A assembly was performed to clone the desired construct as shown below into the linearized backbone.
EcoRI-XbaI-(P+RBS)-(Sqr)-SpeI-PstI

Outreach: Consort, Alberta
As a part of our efforts to reach out to the local scientific community iGEM Alberta send one of            our team members to the small town of Consort, Alberta to assist their emerging high school iGEM            team. Consort is a town of about 700 people located east of Red Deer near the border with            Saskatchewan and only has one secondary school. Remarkably students from this small town high           school caught wind of the iGEM competition and decided to get involved. Their seclusion however was            the source of several problems. The Consort team lacked the proper equipment, materials, and training            to realize their goal of competing in iGEM. After hearing of their difficulties Mark Rozema travelled to            the small town to lend his assistance. Mark, a recent graduate, was able to provide much needed            materials such as ligase, buffer, and restriction enzymes. He also gave helpful suggestions to improve            their presentation and delivery and helped develop their safety component and abstract. We were            thrilled to be able to help a local high school iGEM team and look forward to future partnership with the            Consort iGEM team.
Consort, AB is a small town of about 700 people with one secondary school for its 70 high school                students.
The students practice their presentation in front of their parents               and an Alberta iGEM team member, Mark Rozema.
Consort, AB is located several hours from both Edmonton                and Calgary. Having little access to any major biochemistry                labs proved to be challenging for the team.

Only very weak green fluorescence was visible when no aptamers were added to the reaction system (A). Biotinylated thrombin can readily induce membrane scaffolds dimerization because there were typically 1-4 biontin in one molecule leading to scaffolds crosslinking (B). 15-mer and 29-mer aptamer with short (C) or long (D) linkers were both effective in inducing crosslinking. But it seemed that long linkers (D) is more potent than short linker (C) in this system. )
(The upper figure demonstrates another two typical confocal image of E.coli with (C) or without (A) the two kinds of thrombin aptamers. The thrombin concentration was adjusted to a final value of 0.2nM. Figure B and D shows the spatial fluorescent intensity distribution across the image of the left figure accordingly.)
(The green fluorescence intensity was significantly stronger than the control group when thrombin aptamers with short linkers were added to the solution. The final concentration of thrombin was adjusted to 0.2nM. p<0.01, n=3, t-tset. A.U., arbitrary unit.)
Detect thrombin using β-lactamase testing strip
For the second set of inner-membrane scaffolds, two parts of β-lactamase were fused to the periplasmic ends. When 19-mer and 25-mer biotin-modified aptamers are added to the solution and thrombin is present, aptamers act like a bridge linking streptavidin-fused membrane scaffolds and thrombin. In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are pulled together and the two residuals of β-lactamase will meet each other again to become an integrity part with enzymatic activity. This activity can be detected by commercial β-lactamase testing strips, with a total preparation time of about 40 min.
(β-lactamase testing strip. Left shows β-lactamase positive, right shows negative. As β-lactamase was split into two parts in our project, β-lactamase positive actually means the formation of dimerized inner-membrane scaffold. Because dimerization depends on biotinylated aptamers targeting specific molecules, β-lactamase positive indirectly tells the existence of target protein in the solution. )

WHAT'S UP? 21/07/15
With 4 weeks down and 6 to go solUTIon is making fast and exciting progress. Wet lab is a major focus with all members of the team pitching in to complete our targets. Several milestones have been reached including the successful generation of our team's new and also improved biobricks, which are ready to be shipped. Also our DNA constructs have been successfully inserted into their expression vectors ready for characterisation. Some sequences over the last few weeks have proved stubborn and as a team we have had to embrace new techniques including gradient and DMSO PCR.
Over the next few weeks, our team will begin the process of characterisation; this represents the main phase of experimenting and will provide the data we will present in Boston. Some of our early targets include testing Art175's effectiveness against P. aeruginosa, one of the target pathogens, and also the utility of DNase. These represent the main therapeutics our modified bacteria will secrete in order to destroy the biofilm.
Policy and practices is a key part of our project and one we have been successfully integrating alongside the wet lab work. Several areas have been of particular focus over the last few weeks including safety and education. Several members of our team have focused on safety, considering areas of ethical concern and practical contamination prevention. This has included consideration of a new catheter design to contain our modified bacteria and allow the therapeutics to be readily secreted. As well as the design of a kill switch, this represents an important element of control over our modified bacteria. The kill switch allows for the bacteria to be selectively destroyed in the absence of the target pathogen or if the bacteria carry out unwanted colonisation. The kill switch provides an additional level of control over our bacteria and addresses important public concerns about the use of genetically modified organisms.
Education has been the other major focus of our P&P over the last few weeks. An early goal of our team was to raise public awareness for both synthetic biology and the problem of antibiotic resistance of which UTIs present a significant example. Our team has engaged the public with surveys on public perception of synthetic biology and their thoughts"

Therefore, Facebook was an important means for us to convey the importance of our discipline to those who are generally not very familiar with such topics.
Similar to Facebook, we also used our Twitter account to keep our followers up to date. Although we used both media to communicate we rather switched to Twitter when we wanted to post live from certain events such as public discussions. Thus, we could spread the views expressed there as soon as we had heard them ourselves.
To raise public awareness, we regularly issued press releases. In those reports we informed people about our project idea and how we wanted to implement it. Moreover, we told them about important events in which we were about to take part and milestones we reached.
Ethics
""Climate change is fundamentally an ethical issue.” [1]
As this quote suggests, talking about a solution to climate change, inevitably, means taking many other areas into account, too. These issues span a wide range from economy to livestock farming and animal welfare. Some of them shall be addressed here. Livestock farming is one of the most important sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [2]. Thus, one could conclude that if people just stopped eating meat or drinking milk a big step towards a better climate could be done. Obviously things are not that simple, though. On the one hand, although there is a rise of interest in vegan diets [3] and of public concern over the intensification of livestock production [4,5] there is still a vast demand for the respective products, an indication of which is given by one of our surveys . On the other hand, it may be too shortsighted to reduce certain kinds of food solely to the greenhouse gas emissions caused during their production. In a study by Smedman and colleagues [6] the nutrient content of various beverages was expressed in relation to their climate impact. The highest Nutrient Density to Climate Impact (NDCI) index was ascribed to milk because, despite its production being linked to a large amount of GHG emissions, it contains lots of nutrients, which, according to the study, justifies the negative side effects in a way. Such deliberations may be controversial, but they show that a simple change of food consumption patterns is probably not always the most sensible choice [6], irrespective of the willingness. Accordingly, if vegetarian diets are portrayed as superior to non-vegetarian diets one should also consider that at the same time a vegetarian diet might have a lower nutritional value [7].

Week 37: After primers had been delivered, DNA was resolved and diluted. First, all planned PCRs (see Awesomesheet for detailed conditions and protocol for general procedure for all named methods) were performed to get the primer products (PCR product IDs 357-375), that are needed for Golden Gate Cloning (starts with PCR ID 1321) using Q5 polymerase. Afterwards, PCR products were analyzed on gel and purified via gel extraction or PCR purification. PCRs that did not work in the beginning were optimized by altering annealing temperatures, temperature ramp rates and DMSO and Betain concentrations. Switching from Q5 to Fusion polymerase worked too in some cases. This week PCR products with IDs 358; 359; 373; 374; 375 could be produced with matching band length on gels.
Software
Embedding
Training of the embedding on Uniprot continues. First approaches to optimize the current multilabel classifier by adding parameters to it, either in depth or in width started.
The concept of a generator that models natural evolution was designed. There, a starting sequence is exchanged by randomly chosen point mutations, which are then scored by the classifier with a sigmoid output for each label. Sequences that score higher are more likely to be chosen to continue working with. Those will then be changed by point mutations again. In this scenario the selection is modeled by a function that uses the classifier. However it remains unclear, if the classifier supports gradual improvements in a direction that improves the function in reality and in the classifier.

Literature 2 told  us that resistance can be slowed if treatment of Varroa is only applied when needed, so we realized toxin production should be strictly regulated.
Biocontainment
From the very start of our project, we were aware of the potential dangers of using synthetic biology in a system as volatile as the beehive. However, the RIVM (Dutch governmental institute for national well being and environment) challenged us to investigate the 'safety-by-design' in our project. Additionally, beekeepers voiced their dislike of GMOs, and we realized that beekeepers would never use BeeT if they would not be entirely convinced of its safety. With this in mind, we tried to implement two complementary biocontainment systems.
Prototype Design
To get beekeepers to use BeeT it should not just work well, it also has to fit well with their practicalities. We asked design student Thieu Custers, from the Design Academy Eindhoven, to develop a visual prototype. Below you can find his design and explanation.
The next step: does it work?
During our project, we did not have time to finalize BeeT and test it in the field. However, using an open source model (beehave) as a basis, we determined how effective BeeT needs to be to have a significant impact on bee survival. We adapted beehave to our needs by adding a BeeT module, and to make our predictions as accurate as possible we used real life weather data as input. Apart from preparing this tool to measure effectiveness for future use, we got some interesting information from the model about the ideal time of application of BeeT. From Frank Moens we heard that Varroa mites are best combated in autumn. In that way, strong winter bees can be made that are more likely to survive the winter. Moreover, there is no risk of contaminating the honey, as it is not harvested in that time of the year. However, from the beehave model we could conclude that BeeT is more effective when applied in spring. We think this is important information to consider for further development of BeeT and in giving advice to beekeepers on how to use it.

Almost every research professor on campus that we reached out to pointed us in the direction of the reigning milk quality expert - Dr. Daryl Nydam. Dr. Nydam works at the Quality Milk Production Services (QMPS) located on Cornell’s campus, which serves all of New York State. The QMPS is worldly renowned for its diagnostic services, mastitis prevention programs, and educational assistance. In the past year, the QMPS tested over 170,000 cultures, visited 2600 farms, and consulted with 7500 farmers over the phone. Dr. Nydam encouraged our ideas, and gave us invaluable feedback about the promise of bacteriocins. Dr. Nydam gave us information about mastitis causing pathogens. gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and common and rare species. The rare species are valuable to target because a single outbreak can quickly become detrimental, gram negative pathogens are common because they're environmental, and gram positive pathogens are the most troubling and need to be treated with antibiotics. Taking this information, our wet lab team decided to target a few species in each of the groups when choosing the bacteriocins we would use.
Timeline: Ideation Phase
From just preliminary interviewing, we realized that there was a great need for the prevention and detection of mastitis. We became increasingly excited because our project seemed promising so, we got to work. Our wet lab team chose bacteriocin genes based on the information that Dr. Nydam had provided us. Our product development team focused on the prevention of mastitis and narrowed their ideas down to a multi purpose milking nozzle with interchangeable parts. Our CS/ECE subteam focused on the detection of mastitis, creating an app and a microscope attachment. We brought this sketches to experts in the ideation phase.

Milkrite
110 Lincoln St, Johnson Creek, WI 53038
Milkrite, a division of Avon Rubber and Plastics, works on products for the agriculture industry and is based out of Wisconsin and California. Milkrite is the world’s largest provider of dairy rubber wear, with their core business focused on creating rubber liners which are used in the milking machine. We reached out to Tom Votny, a representative of Milkrite. During our conversation, we learned about the current state of the milking machine market, what technologies had already been developed for shell and liners, how products were typically tested, and how large companies conducted their market research. The insight we gained helped the product development further understand that the direction they are going with the mil"

WPI-Worcester,2014,Team:WPI-Worcester#ATF1_-_-_TEXT.html," is used for our expected maximum output that all other results have been normalized to.
Unexpectedly, when provided isoamyl alcohol but no arsenite, the arsenic induced promoter still produced isoamyl acetate, at what may be a slightly larger rate. Due to our error, we can’t confirm this behavior, but it is apparent that the arsenic induced repressor only weakly binds to the promoter site. Which suggests that this promoter may not be suitable for certain tests that rely specifically on the presence of arsenic or other heavy metals
Over the next five columns, we notice a very specific downwards trend. It appears that, although arsenic must bind to the repressor for heightened functionality, the increasing concentrations of arsenite may be toxic for cells. After 0.5uM of arsenite, the amount of isoamyl acetate produced drops significantly, suggesting that cells are dying off, so that less isoamyl acetate is produced.

Pop Culture and Fiction might not be the best teachers for anything out there, but many representations of the popular imaginary are taken from them and reflected on them in a complex relationship [1]. Undoubtedly, there is not a lineal and direct relationship between portrayals of science and scientists, but pop culture (as represented in TV, movies and books) might shed some light and give meaningful insights on what is being thought by the community, through history and now. There might be also powerful cautionary tales out there.
Take for example Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus. Frankenstein is not a book particularly about science, but about anything that disrupts the continuum between the individual and the community. This disruption of virtue, as Shelley called it, is what might be considered to be at fault for the harm brought by Frankenstein's monstrous creation:
""I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected"".[2]
This assertion from Victor Frankenstein's father represents something critical in the novel.  During the summer when Victor created the 'monster', he was ""engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit,"" making his eyes ""insensible to the charms of nature,"" and caused him to ""forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom [he] had not seen for so long time."" The act of corresponding with another person, as portrayed in the novel, is an act of being involved in a community, and what Victor did on that summer according to his father and which can be inferred from the epistolary exchange, was to withdraw from the moral constrains of his community.

Monday 16/6
The lab crash course began. We talked a lot about the project goal and the way of getting there. The team is now on the same page and ready for a great summer of exciting and interesting work to begin. In the lab we learned where everything was located and learned how to run a PCR.

Tuesday 17/6
In the lab: The PCR from yeasterday didn't work, so they were repeated. This time 50 µL PCR reaction were prepared. Gel purification was performed on the PCR products and the final concentration was measured by nanodrop.
We digested the products by using restriction enzymes XbaI og SpeI. We detected that the plasmid was only linearized, meaning that only one restriction enzyme/ restriction site was functional.
We worked on the basics in the iGEM concept. We discussed the definitions of biobrick, basis part, composite part and deviced. We learned the ""Standard Assembly Method"", it's condition, uses and limitations.
We defined the conditions for our own device and started searching for the necessary parts in the iGEM registry

Wednesday 18/6
The XbaI enzyme didn't work to cut plasmid 161 tuesday and we wanted to find out what was wrong. We had different theories as to what went wrong tuesday:
Maybe the XbaI didn't have enough time to cut the plasmid. We only gave it 5 minutes.
Maybe the restriction site on plasmid 161 didn't work.
To find out which of these theories was right we made three experiments:
We wanted to do the same as on tuesday, but allow the enzyme to work for 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes, in case this was our mistake.
We wanted to use the same plasmid as tuesday but cut it with EcoRI to see if this restriction site worked.
We wanted to try to cut a new plasmid (RFP) with the same enzyme for the same amount of time (5 minutes), to find out if the enzyme worked or not.
We ran these three experiments and also a control for each of the two plasmids on a PCR, and"
Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#Project#miRNA Kit_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA miR binding sites in pBS_SV40 Luc2 double transfected with a reference renilla construct. The shRNA_hAAT construct was expressed from a pBS_H1 construct.
Figure 2 shows the results of Dual-Luciferase measurements of the miTuner plasmid with binding sites against shhAAT behind firefly luciferase. The highest knockdown can be achieved by using a perfect binding site. Single mutations outside the seed region at position 11, 12 or 10-12 lead to knockdown between 10% and 60% compared to unregulated expression. Bulges close to the seed region or changes in the seed region itself lead to very low downregulation. Having only the seed region as a target for the miRNA also leads to a less efficient knockdown compared with binding sites containing flanking regions.
Figure 3: Tuning of gene expression through different imperfect shRNA miR binding sites in pBS_SV40_Luc2 construct cotransfected with a reference renilla construct. Gene expression quantified via dual luciferase assay for constructs containing different imperfect binding sites for shhAAT. The shhAAT was expressed from a pBS_U6 plasmid
Figure 3 shows the same assay using binding sites against shhAAT. This time, the shhAAT is driven by a U6 promoter, which is stronger than the H1 promoter used for driving the shRNA in the previous figure. The results are overall similar, with changes in or directly adjacent to the seed region having the highest impact on knockdown efficiency.
Figure 4: Tuning of gene expression through different imperfect miR122 binding sites in psiCHECK-2. Construct was transfected into HeLa cells together with an plasmid expressing miR122. Control without binding site was used for normalization.
We further analyzed binding sites derived from miR122 in the dual luciferase vector PsiCheck2 as can be seen in figure 4. Here we tested sixteen mutated binding sites in order to observe minute fine-tuning between one binding site and the next. Mutated Binding sites 123, 133, 134, 135 and 158 contain 4bp-bulges (non-paired regions) that don not seem to diminish knockdown efficiency much. 107 contains one binding site, while 134 and 135 contain two binding sites for the same miRNA and show a stronger knockdown than 107.

CzrA-ArsR AND GATE
HEAVY-METAL AND
This construct was designed to function as a logic gate, an AND to be specific. This is due to the way the CzrA-ArsR promoter was designed. We used a system that sensed heavy metals in Bacillus subtilis, which was originally designed by the iGEM Newcastle team 2009 ( Newcastle University iGEM team 2009 ). This system consists of a fused promoter, which includes both ArsR and CzrA binding sites. Arar and CzrA are metal sensing repressors. They both respond to cadmium, however silver, arsenic, or copper induces ArsR and zinc, cobalt, or nickel induces CzrA as well (Moore CM, Helmann JD. Metal ion homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis. Curr Opin Microbiol. 2005 Apr;8(2):188-95.). If we use two different metals, specific for each repressor we will have an AND gate.  Besides Newcastle’s 2009 design, we designed two different fused promoters with the same binding sites but in different order to try different combinations that could make the system more efficient.
To obtain our final construct we required the following Biological Parts:

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

By Figure.1 ,we see that in the linear feedback conditions of cGMP(i.e.: M = 1), different state of sGC changes with the time of change: D1 plummets in a brief period when the reaction started, and then reached a nadir in 8 seconds or so. After a short rising stage it tends to be stable finally; D3, the intermediate product of reactions of NO and sGC experienced a period of increase in the first time and then went to the attenuation and finally reached the stability; D2 (i.e.: high-active sGC) reachs the steady state as the same after a brief surge and small amplitude fluctuations. Figure.2 shows the production rate of cGMP experienced process of rising and falling and the degradation rate of cGMP changes from fast to slow and how they tends to be uniform eventually. Figure.3 shows the phenomenon that the production of cGMP experienced process of rising and eventually tends to be stabilized.
Therefore, the autoregulation of cells has the function of making every sector of NO-cGMP pathway tend to be stabilized.
figure.4
figure.5
figure.6
figure.7
In order to discuss how the feedback inhibition of cGMP influences the desensitization of sGC and the degree, we use Matlab to make four images, namely, Figure.4 to Figure.7. Figure.4 and Figure.5 are images of no feedback inhibition (i.e.: m=0). The changes of D1, D2, D3, Vp, Vd with time are very simple, either increase or decrease to stabilization, and there is no volume fluctuate with time during the period. However, when the value of the feedback degree of m is 2, great changes have occurred. Fluctuation degree of each volume is more intense compared with all sectors when m=1. But without any exception, all the volumes tend to be stable, which shows that our model is consistent with the actual law.
figure.8
figure.9
Figure.8 and Figure.9 respectively show the relationship between NO and cGMP along with sGC in the case of cGMP linear feedback inhibition (m=1). We find that in feedback inhibition of cGMP the volume of cGMP is always less than that with no feedback inhibition. Meanwhile, apart from appearing sharply rising in the beginning and is higher than that with no feedback inhibition, as time goes by, the amount of sGC of feedback"

Figure 4: Skim milk plates assay. Cells containing the empty backbone (left) and cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E (right) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
Comparing the clearance of the skim milk plates, a proteolytic activity could be proven for the cells containing the expression system for native subtilisin E. As a result, we concluded that within three days these cells are able to produce the native protease, which will then digest the skim milk in the agar plates, resulting in a clearance. In conclusion, we were able to express subtilisin E in E. coli and to prove its proteolytic activity via skim milk assay. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectModeling_-_-_TEXT.html," tree structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the tree structure changes, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange the two chains with equal unicode_c. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm could be used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code is actually a representation of the path from current node to the root, we can restore the tree structure from the set of Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes set of leaf nodes could uniquely represent a tree structure. We could generate a string, unicode_t for tree structure by splicing the Huffman codes and their weight of all leaf nodes sorted by their weights and adding a asterisk between two adjacent codes, for example:
[000:0:1][001:1:3][010:2:3][011:2:4]
Based on this idea, we could obtain the tree unicode_t for any possible order by exchanging equivalent chains and choose the order which make the minimum unicode_t value. By checking the unicode_t value of permutation, chains are grouped in a number of equivalent classes, which contains one or more chains. Chains within each equivalent classes are equivalent: exchanging order of any two chains will not change the tree structure.
It is easy to compare two Chain-Model structures with the help of chain sorting. We only need to compare unicode_c value of chains in the chain list and unicode_t value generated under that order. If two structures are equal, their chain list and tree structure must be equal since the chains order is unique in our chain sorting method. If two structures have same unicode_c value of each chain and unicode_t value, they must be same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the strings.
How to find species with specific structural pattern of a template one?
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.

To purify the target protein, we would make the target protein and Janus into a fusion protein, which is connected with a linker. Then, we could use aqueous two-phase system to make them separated from the bulk protein, according to the property that Janus will direct to the phase of detergent in the system of detergent/water.After back-extraction, we could get the protein out from the detergent.
Figure 12. The principle of Janus-based aqueous two-phase system
In our project, we would use four kinds of Janus to find the best one. Meanwhile, we aim to design a standard protocol to make this system applicative to almost every kind of protein, and we call it Protein Extraction Kit.  
Firstly, we use the principle of RFC 23 to design a universal Janus tag, which includes a linker able to be cut by TEV protease and a sJanus gene. Thus, if other teams want to use this system to express and purify their proteins, they could use the standard assembly to make a fusion protein. Secondly, we explore for the best detergent, the best concentration of detergent and the best buffer solution. Thirdly, we construct many fusion proteins, including three kinds of fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP and RFP) with four kinds of Janus, which are inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants. We also construct experiments about fusion proteins with cutinases Thc_Cut1, FsC and LC to test if this system could be used on the putification of enzymes. Furthermore, we build complete models to testify that this system is applictive to all kinds of protein and search for the universally good conditions for almost every protein.
Figure 13. The principle of Protein Extraction Kit
Of course, we also conduct experiments to detect the efficiency of this method and make sure that the target proteins have not lost their activity.

Construction in Prokaryotic cells
In prokaryotic cells, the system consists of three circuits. One induces flip, one flips and the other expresses. According to the properties of the promoter pBAD, we build the first circuit, using arabinose as an inducement to generate the recombinase Cre. After the content of Cre increasing, loxP sites flip, causing the expression of supD tRNA and T7ptag. T7ptag and supD tRNA act as an AND gate which can active T7 promoter by (iGEM 2009 PKU_Beijing.)

SAFETY
The Problem
Tailings ponds, lakes that hold the toxic by-products of oil sands mining, cover an area of 176 square kilometers in Alberta and contain enough liquid to fill 390,000 Olympic-sized pools. Tailings ponds are extremely detrimental to the environment and pose challenges for improving extraction processes used by oil and mining industries. If left untreated, tailings ponds have the potential to pollute water sources, damage ecosystems, eliminate biodiversity and kill a variety of living organisms. An example of tailings ponds pollution includes harmful ions such as lead and mercury which affect the environment.The removal of heavy metals in tailings ponds as well as wastewater is appealing yet challenging. In addition to benefiting the environment, the extraction of these metals creates value out of what would otherwise be waste.
Our Solution
To address these issues, we propose a system using engineered bacteria and bacteriophage-- viruses that infect and reproduce within the host bacteria-- to capture and remove ions from solution using novel capsid composition and inducible precipitation. Utilizing biological systems and local infrastructure will both purify contaminated water and extract reusable metals renewably. To better understand the feasibility of our project, we plan on using a mixture of kinetic, agent-based and spatial modelling. Kinetic modelling will allow us to mathematically understand the trend of our system as well as how our system will react to specific parameters. Agent-based modelling will display the different components of our system. This allows for a more accurate visualization of the system as a whole with the different agent interactions. Finally, spatial modelling will help us demonstrate our unique system to the general public. Additionally, we plan to contact the head of the Water  Treatment Plant in Lethbridge to see how our project could be integrated into their facility, as well as to understand how our project would function in their system. Our system of engineered bacteria and bacteriophage will provide a solution to the issue of metal contaminants present in water.
And a big thank you to our sponsors!"
UNIK_Copenhagen,2013,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence measurements and the western blot.
Enhanced flavin-binding fluorescent protein (eFbFP)
The reporter eFbFP is a fluorescent protein that uses flavin mono nucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor. The reporter is suitable for use in anaerobic conditions.
The part was cloned into expression vector pJAM1786 using the Gateway system. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli cells. Colony PCR was carried out and colonies were inoculated into liquid culture. The following day the colonies failed to show significantly more fluorescence than three control cultures.
This was unexpected since we previously showed significant fluorescence from a very similar sequence. Due to two internal PstI sites that sequence was not BioBrick compatible. After removing the restriction sites fluorescence was lost even though no change in amino acid sequence was made. Therefore, we expect the lack of fluorescence to be caused by cloning/transformation/technical issues and not the sequence. Due to time limitation we were not able to support this statement.
Conclusion
The eGFP  protein was fully characterized. In fusion with eGFP proof of the correct size of the MamC product could be presented. MamC on its own could unfortunately not be characterized due to technical limitations. eFbFP lost its functionality after the removal of internal restriction sites and therefore its functionality could not be shown here.
Outlook
For presenting improved results in November at MIT in Boston, we would work on characterizing MamC by acquiring a MamC antibody, which is already commercially available. As a next step the MamC-eGFP construct would need to be conjugated into magnetotactic bacteria to show that it localizes as expected to the magnetosome membrane. Also the eFbFP construct would get debugged and also characterized via fluorescence measurements and western blot analysis for which we would need to develop an antibody or clone eFbFP with an incorporated tag (myc, flag or his).

The lecture is mainly targeted at junior students, in which we talked about the details of our projects and shared our ideas about synthetic biology. Our lecture mainly contains three sections: In the first section, we mainly focus on the background information of our IGEM and synthetic biology. In the second section, we introduced our project, discussing how our four designed parts work together to convey our idea about evolution. To make it more convincing, we share some of our important data and conclusions. Inspiringly, we gather a lot of valuable suggestions on our projects through the discussion.  In the third section, we played a short video which helps make our projects more perceptible and comprehensible. We also showed how to play the Synthetic Bio-farm game which was developed by our team to propagandize the concept of IGEM and BioBricks. The lecture was a huge success, which was praised widely by the participants, including several professors in the field.
The lecturer is introducing the main topic of our team--Evolution.

Software HoloPyGuy
Here, we present an universal software solution which we, the team iGEM TU Darmstadt, created for digital inline holographic microscopy (DIHM).                                             We therefore employ the open-source framework Holopy and extended the existing solution with a graphical user interface.                                             The resulting software includes the connection to a raspberry pi cam as well as a control element for a commonly used blue-ray laser.                                             The graphical user interface relies on the Qt5 framework and is written in Python. The solution                                             aims to be applicable for self-made DIHM and an ‘easy-to-use‘ hologram reconstruction suite. The project is hosted on GitHub under MIT License and is also available for download. A complete user manual is provided in the following section.
HoloPyGuy - An Introduction
First, a reference picture, taken without a sample, needs to be provided in order to analyze a hologram. These reference pictures can be imported by choosing the panel ‘Open Background’.                                             Several background pictures, which are turned into one averaged hologram, is subtracted from the sample hologram, which can                                             be imported via the panel ‘Load Sample’.                                             A dark field image can be generated by taking a picture without laser light if you are concerned about residual light in your setup, but it is not obligatory for each setup. The settings for                                             reconstruction are controlled using the Boxes on the left. Reconstructing a hologram                                             can be easily accomplished by choosing the panel ‘Hologram’.  The single settings provided will be further explained                                             in the section ‘controls’. The algorithm used for reconstruction is applicable for light coming from point sources only.
At first, a picture of the beam without sample serves as reference (left). A raw hologram has fringes around the objects of interest (middle). The reconstructed object is calculated                                                 by substracting the reference picture from the raw hologram and then analyzed with reverse propagation.
Settings
All lengths are internal converted to meters. The preset values are corresponding to                                             our DIHM setup.

contribution
When communicating with UESTC-China team members and coaches, we found out that when they were looking for suitable biobricks to conduct synthetic biology experiments, they could not find suitable biobricks. They also found that the information is insufficient and search for biobricks is not user-friendly enough. Therefore, we built a bio-brick database based on database integration, which dedicates to solve the problem of unclear bio-bricks, incomplete information and poor user experience in the iGEM Registry. The entire project consists of 3 parts. Database integration, information retrieval and display and Bio-chess.
Database integration
First, We integrates 8 traditional biological research databases such as Uniprot, EPD, and String to provide users with more biobrick information. Users can use BioMaster to obtain information on biobrick sites, interactions, function keys, GO annotations and related references. With those information, users can use biobricks and even design and improve biobricks more accurately. In addition, we also collected information from teams’ wiki in 2005-2017.Users can search previous wikis to learn more about iGEM and synthetic biology to get inspired.
Information retrieval and display
In order to enable users to quickly and accurately find useful information, BioMaster provides 4 ways to search. Users can retrieve related bio-bricks using a variety of IDs (Uniprot_id, EPD_id and iGEM_id) or gene names. We also extracted biobrick and wiki keywords for users to directly search for biobricks or retrieve previous projects. In addition, we also provide a sequence searching method. The blast tool is provided in the Bio-Master, users can directly find the matching bio brick by entering the sequence.
At the same time, when the user can't find a suitable biobrick, BioMaster provides a reference to the promoters predicted from the E. coli genome.
Finally, we also plotted the interaction scatter plot, the pl"

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," to these problems and we should consider if our product is really the best option.  Hereby he helped us to broaden our perspective, which helped us to define our application scenario’s. All in all a useful conversation in the early stage of our project development.
RIVM Regelgeving
Goal: Learn more about regulation involved in medicines and applications of new technologies in the human body.
Approach: We spoke to two employees of the Centrum of Health Protection- Department Product Safety: Claudette de Vries and Robert Geertsma. They informed us about existing legal.
Result: They could tell us that regulation is different for medicines and medical devices. Thereby they referred us to the different laws existing for both aspects of medical interventions. This distinction is useful to make a division between external and internal usages of novelties. One of the differences is that clinical trials are obligatory for medicines and are not included in regulation for medical devices.  When we proposed our idea about a device making use of GMOs to track diseases in the intestines, they could tell us that this is considered advanced therapy and new rules apply for that. Important for this application is furthermore that regulation in the usage of GMOs is currently changing.
Intellectual Property Rights
A possible obstacle for our design is the fact that we make use of aptamers as one of the main components; many of the discovered aptamers are currently still patented. Therefore, it was interesting to explore if this could pose any further problems in the future. Therefore, we contacted some experts on the area of patent law. An overview is given below:
Ir. P.H. (Peter) van Dongen - RVO/Agentschap NL - Patent advisor for universities and technological institutes
Goal: To learn more about the basic principles behind patent law and learn more about what we should pay attention to in our own device.
Approach: We spoke to Ir. Van Dongen, who is very experienced when it comes to patent law. We asked him what rules and exceptions there are when it comes to intellectual property rights. And we asked if he could foresee any trouble in the use of aptamers in our design.
Result: Ir. Van Dongen could tell us that patents are granted to any scientist who applied for it and who came up with a novel invention that was never earlier described anywhere in the world, that is not obvious and that could be exploited economically. Hereby it is important to consider that patents are granted per country and it might not be economically favourable for some companies to apply for a patent in small countries like the Netherlands. Patent keepers need to pay"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html," commentary in the journal Nature Biotechnology in which they argued that synthetic biology poses several new ethical issues (Boldt & Muller, 2008). These new ethical issues would constitute a fundamental turning-point in the progress of science. Up till now, it has been possible to manipulate genomes (genetic engineering), but nowadays scientist are even able to design a genome. Seen from the perspective of the scientist it was merely the next step in terms of the usage of genomes. Boldt and Müller argue that moving beyond manipulating constitutes wholly new ethical issues. When it comes to the field of synthetic biology, the shift from manipulatio to creatio is one, they argue,  “with considerable ethical significance”. The creation of new life forms does not only add value to an existing organism, but the whole existence of the organism is created from what the scientist considers to be valuable. On the other hand, they admit that the creation of a new organism is not by definition worse than changing an existing organism.
Without going into detail whether new ethics are needed or desirable or whether we are only facing some new ethical issues we can agree that with this new evolution in science, the ability to change the world increases with enormous speed and will increase even further. In the book ´Das Prinzip Verantwortung. Versuch einer Ethik für die technologische Zivilisation’ (PV)(Jonas, 1984), the philosopher Hans Jonas (1903-1993) argues that the modern technology requires a new, additional ethical perspective. Jonas’ book, published in 1979 in German, was written before the upcoming of synthetic biology, this is the reason why he didn’t discuss the topic in his writing (although he wrote a section on genetic manipulation (PV, pp. 52-53)). However, we think Jonas’ central thesis is still relevant nowadays. In our contribution we will explore his train of thought. In the first part we will explain his demand for a new ethics adjusted to modern technology. In the second part, we will compare Jonas’ ideas with synthetic biology. We will first examine to what extend Jonas’ thinking can be applied in the daily life of the scientist and how Jonas defines technology. Next, we will try to extend the thinking of Jonas to synthetic biology, based on the section in which Jonas speaks about genetic engineering.
Das Prinzip Verantwortung. Versuch einer Ethik für die technologische Zivilisation
The basic assumption is that modern technology unavoidably influences our whole life sphere. If we do not succeed in controlling this process, it could pose a grave threat. This controlling process"

In order to be considered for the Best New Composite Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Composite parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on)."

The RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T3 is DNA-directed RNA polymerase with both high template affinity and specificity. Similar to T7 polymerase, it also possesses quite simple structure compared with the bacterial RNA polymerase so that it can be easily wide-utilized in synthetic biology.
Previous work confirmed this concept and showed that although the RNAPs encoded by T3 and T7 bacteriophages have high sequence[1] , they exhibit nearly exclusive template specificities. According to the previous work, the two amino acid sequences have more than 82% identical residues[2].  Furthermore, promoters of the T7 and T3 RNAPs are also quite similar with highly conserved 23 bp sequences that differ significantly only over an about 3 bp region[2].  Despite these similarities, neither Polymerase (T3 RNA polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase) can transcribe the heterologous promoter efficiently[3,4] . Namely, the T3 RNA polymerase is orthogonal to T7 RNA polymerase, which is an excellent alternative of T7 polymerase for complex genetic circuit designed in the near future.

2. The -12 to -17 region of the promoter interacts with a beta loop of the T3 RNA polymerase.
3. The -5 to -12 region of the promoter interacts with the core specificity determinant.

From the scaling-questions (in this case most suitable for correlation calculations) Q14, Q15 and Q16 seemed to correlate slightly, where the negative numbers indicates a negative correlation, meaning that when for question X someone assigns the score 1, the expected score for correlating question Y is 10.

Project description on the Wiki webpage
i First day at the laboratory
In the waiting for ordered primers, vector and such, we prepared TAP and LB                     medium, agar plates etc.
i LiU iGEM Team Kick-off
When the group members were chosen and the project design was finished we                     started the summer with a kick-off at Robert Forchheimer, the founder of LiU                     iGEM. We had a lovely meal outside and some of us took a swim in the swimming                     pool. We listened to music, played games and had a fantastic evening.
i Made the cover of the local newspaper ""Östgöta Correspondenten""
We made the cover of the local newspaper, Östgöta correspondenten called Corren.                     This Newspaper is delivered to households each morning within the providence                     Östergötland. The article was mainly about the concept of iGEM and the project                     of the year. The focus laid at making more biomass out of C. reinhardtii and the                     contributing work to minimize the greenhouse effect.
i New project approach
Publishing of interviews with interesting personalities on FB
With the laboratory deadline getting closer, we were still out of luck when it                     came to results. We decided that it was time to make a change regarding how we                     executed our project to reach our goals. The project idea remained the same, but                     the approach changed. Instead of using the traditional digest-ligation method to                     construct the parts, we went ahead with a different method called Gibson Assembly. This Assembly enables the creation of a construction of up to six                     parts in just one reaction. Our hope was restored!
i All firms at the list of potantial sponsor of the project this year must be contacted
We started off early with finding potential sponsors and listed them on an                     internal document. Further on we contacted them one by one at the same time we                     investigated firms to build on our list with. At this deadline we had to been in                     contact with all of the firms at our list to be able to focus fully on our lab                     activities. Our search for sponsors continued though.

Objective
Our objective is to insert this DNA construct into both E. coli and Bacillus subtilis to secrete proteins, which will fluoresce red and selectively bio-tag to PET plastic. We based our construct design on Tianjin’s 2016 PET-ase construct for the biodegradation of PET plastic.  We modified this construct with the help of our mentor Lisa Oberding from Fredsense for this specific project. We need to pay huge attribution to our mentor Lisa who designed our construct and did many rounds of troubleshooting so we could finally get these parts synthesized. We chose Bacillus subtilis because of its natural ability to produce hydrophobins, and because when compared to E.coli, it is much better at naturally secreting proteins. The four constructs we designed for lab work all consist of two transcription terminators, a Bacillus-specific promoter, a ribosome binding site, which starts the formation of protein, and a LipA, which is a secretion tag that will help send the protein outside the cell. The parts we submitted to the registry are optimized for use in E.coli and are in the standard pSB1C3 backbone. Any teams wishing to get the sequences for Bacillus specific plasmid vectors are welcome to reach out to us for the sequence!

BBa_K2650001: mCherry PET-ase
This construct is essentially our first construct, with the exception of the part mCherry. Following the transcription terminator is the Bacillus promoter, the ribosome binding site which starts the formation of the protein and the secretion tag SSLipA which is fused with the PET-ase instructing the Bacillus subtilis to secrete the enzyme PET-ase out of the bacteria. But in this construct, the part mCherry is included. The reason mCherry is present in the construct is to be an RFP or red fluorescent protein which the color aspect in the bio-tag. This is also part of the construct to essentially fluoresces when the construct sticks to PET plastic. Following the mCherry is our modified PET-ase (part BBa_K2650002). But between the m"

96-well Plate Analyzer
One of the main problems with data analysis in some biological areas is to deal with 96-well plates: you usually create a map where your samples are and then have to aggregate appropriately your data to construct averages and plot figures. The problem scales exponentially when you have measures over time. To deal with this problem we developed a series of functions in Python to aggregate the data and work on it with minimal effort.
For instance, see below how we read our data and then print the three first hours of measure of wells containing only LB.
Figure 2- Example of our Python functions to read data from 96-well plates and then process it quickly.
All of our results were analyzed using these routines. For instance, you can find all calculations from our Interlab Study available here . Also, it is pretty easy to export your data in a readable format .
This approach not only helps with sharing the data, but also improves reproducibility: anyone can run reproduce from scratch everything we did.
Statistical tests
Finally, often it is not enough to graphically show that one sample is bigger than another: sometimes you need to show quantitatively that the differences seen in a graph are statistically relevant. For this purpose there are statistical tests that can be performed in your data.
Figure 3- Example of our Python libraries for evaluating statistical tests.
With our libraries, you can perform this tests easily, as shown above. We have extensively used in our project Mann-Whitney U test and Student's T .

- To share this year’s HKUST iGEM project to public in Hong Kong.
Description
Throughout this summer, we have encountered many challenges, and also gained experience from lab and human practices. It is our time to share what we know and have done so far to public. We value that our knowledge is not only acquired from laboratory experience and interview with particular focus groups, but also from all public sources. Inno-carnival is a good opportunity to raise awareness  of biological safety issues.

Figure 6: 3D protein structure of Bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase.
The protein structure of Bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase was constructed by using Amber 14. It is demonstrated in ribbon diagram which is done by interpolating a smooth curve through the polypeptide backbone. The colors indicate the amino acids in the protein structure.
Our circuit design for GSH gene
Our circuit consists of prefix, a strong promoter (J23100), RBS (B0034), GSH as protein coding region, double terminator (B0015) and suffix. This part enables our E. coli KO11 strain to overexpress oxidised Glutathione to reduce oxidative stress, increasing its lifespan (Lu, 2013). Our construct was inserted into pSB1C3 and                  delivered to the Registry.
Figure 7: Circuit design of Composite part 2 with GSH gene. BBa_K2571005 . Our construct                  includes a strong promoter,  RBS, GSH and double terminator.
In order to make our gene compatible with RFC 10, 25 and 1000, we reconstructed the nucleotides to get rid of the restriction sites while protecting the amino acid                  sequence. We looked through the codon bias property of E. coli and made the nucleotide changes accordingly.
Figure 8: Because Glutathione prevents ROS from harming the bacteria, increase in cell mas was observed in high concentrations of Glutathione. In brief, when                  Glutathione concentration increases, the specific cell growth rate also increases and we observe an increase in the number of bacteria compared to the bacteria without                  the GSH gene (Kim & Hahn , 2013).
Figure 9: BBa_K2571005 check with GSH specific  primers. Expected band length: 225 bp.                      Last six wells show positive results.
We’ve inserted the GSH composite part to pSB1C3 backbone. Then, we’ve transformed the construct for submission, BBa_K2571005 , (in pSB1C3)                      to Dh4 alpha and conducted colony PCR. We’ve prepared the PCR with GSH specific primers and expected to see a result of 225 bp. By showing the                      band we expected, 225 bp, PCR confirmation for our insertion proved right.

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," become apparent. We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography and plasma bonding. If we decided to do this, there would be a blunt eighty-thousand-dollar barrier of entry to researchers and hobbyists looking to use Neptune. That would be unacceptable. We could have had Neptune’s microfluidics be controlled using very high precision, high accuracy pumps that would provide flawless flow rates. But the hardware and infrastructure for these pumps would cost hundreds of dollars per pump, and the cost would not scale. We could not settle for this.
Instead, we framed our workflow around the low cost MakerFluidics fabrication protocol. In this protocol, the eighty thousand dollar fabrication process of photolithography is bypassed; instead our microfluidic chips are fabricated with a simple CNC mill, costing a order of magnitude less, while still delivering high performance devices.
We made it our project goal, to fully integrate accessibility into Neptune. Neptune is microfluidics for industry, for research, for education and for hobbyists. We made Neptune have the lowest possible bar to entry; it is the only microfluidic design, fabrication and control workflow all integrated into one software tool-- and the best part is it can be used by anyone. We made accessibility the centerpiece of Neptune.
Open Hardware Schematics
A big aspect of enabling accessible microfluidics is reducing the barrier of entry for controlling these devices. Microfluidics are controlled by pumps that generate pressures gradients to push or pull fluids, or open and close valves. Most modern microfluidic control pumps are expensive and difficult to integrate, making it hard to scale for larger microfluidic designs, and dissuasive for hobbyists.
We chose to directly target our hardware designs to this problem. We developed completely open 3D print design schematics for our microfluidic control infrastructure. These designs are available for download on our GitHub repo, and server though Neptune as well! Furthermore, we developed a completely original hardware design to control syringe pumps using very low cost servo motors.
NONA Research Foundation Partnership
Integrating our workflow with the idea of accessibility was a huge step; we successfully build Neptune as the most accessible microfluidics creation tool to date, with low cost fabrication protocols, open hardware designs, and powerful design algorithms- virtually any research lab can now realistically consider microfluidics as an option, without devoting huge costs or needing expertise in the field.
A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a"

William&Mary
Scottish meetup
William and Mary
This year, we were mentored by the William & Mary team, as St Andrews and William & Mary are sister schools.  There’s already a joint degree between the two universities in the liberal arts, and so it was a natural decision to deepen the relationship between the Schools of Biology.  Over the course of the summer, the team from William & Mary advised us on the tricky nature of genome editing, and how it was easier and more reliable to alter bacterial function via plasmids as an alternative.  Moreover, we discussed the nature of using fluorescence as a marker of cell viability as opposed to relying on the OD600 measurement.  Their captain, Ethan Jones, gave us excellent protocols, advice, and pointers on lab techniques that have worked for William & Mary in the past, including methods for colony PCR, miniprep procotols, and general tips on plasmid cloning.  He helped us find the most reliable way to perform part characterization experiments (suggesting we use ribosome binding sites or promoters as a starting point for the exploration).  Additionally, he walked us through the requirements for part improvement.
One of our team members, Morganne, was able to visit William and Mary and discuss more about our project in person, as well as attending their community outreach programme, during which they surveyed citizens of Williamsburg about local opinions on the ethics and implications of genome editing for medicinal purposes.
We’d like to say thank you so much to them for all their help and support, without which our project would not have run as smoothly!

As part of our collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, we hosted a Scottish iGEM meetup with both the undergraduate and overgraduate Edinburgh iGEM teams, as well as their supervisors and guests from the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. This was an extremely useful meetup, lasting from 10:00-16:00 and involved many talks covering all aspects of the competition (including judging, outreach and human practices, modelling etc.).

Manchester-Graz,2015,Team:Manchester-Graz#Practices#Industry_-_-_TEXT.html," 5 The Sankyo process
General waste
Any industrial process has to be assessed by its strengths and weaknesses, with some criteria being more important than others. Waste and efficiency are key examples of important factors in industrial analysis. In understanding the importance of these factors, and how current industry standards perform in this respect, we can better discern the place of our process in the future of manufacturing.
Atom Economy, developed in 1991 by Barry M. Trost with the goal of achieving “synthetic efficiency in transforming readily available starting materials to the final target” [3], is a key metric in determining the efficiency of a synthetic process and evaluating alternative strategies.
Table 1 Atom economy of L-DOPA synthesis processes
An important limitation of Atom economy is that it remains fixed, regardless of the chosen catalyst and other reaction parameters; it is therefore important to recognize that an atom economy analysis will not always determine the greenest approach [3]. The higher AE value, the more economical the process is and therefore the cheaper it is to run. From the table above, the Ajinomoto process is the most economical, compared to Hoffmann La-Roche, Monsanto and the Sankyo processes. The AE of the Hoffmann La-Roche process is lower that that of the Sankyo process because the chemical input in the former is larger: hippuric acid has a larger molar mass than hydantoin (179.17 g/mol vs 100.08 g/mol).
Synthetic ideality is a complex factor that enables the definition of the plan efficiency for a chemical process. Since the Hoffman La-Roche chemical process is closer to practice, its synthetic ideality is higher that that of the Sankyo process. The Sankyo process is the least integrated out of the processes listed above, as well as being the most hazardous with its production of the neurotoxic ozone-layer depleting chemical – methyl bromide. The Ajinomoto process is the most efficient regarding synthetic ideality, in addition to being convenient to operate, since there is no material concern or toxic by-product mitigation [2]. The Ajinomoto process is also a biotechnological process, which allows us to estimate similar parameter values for AE and synthetic ideality for our biotechnological production of L-DOPA using Tyrosine Hydroxylase or Tyrosinase.
Two other metrics that are useful for waste comparison are Process mass intensity and Waste Stream analysis. The former is a factor recommended by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Round Table and measures the mass efficiency from input, encouraging cost reduction at"
