UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Therefore, patients will be released from the anxiety of recurrence or frequent checkup, improving the patients’ QOL. For not only cancer but also other diseases  that easily recurrence, similar therapeutic E. coli can be settled for prompt and repeated healing. Our co-cultivation technology seems to give a new possibility of medical treatment and of living with diseases. The detailed mechanisms are described below (Fig. 3).
Step1 Introduce the  gene of the chimeric transcription factor (relA/traR, constitutive expression) and iP synthesis genes (atIPT4 and log1, inducible expression).
Step2 Administer the E. coli cells harboring the following three genes; the anti-cancer genes, the C8 synthase gene (traI), and the iP receptor gene (ahk4).
Step3 The E. coli cells that are grown at a central part of anaerobic solid cancer and kill the cancer.
Step4 As the cancer cells are killed, the transduced human cells sense the increased number of E. coli cells.
Step5 Transduced human cells produce and secrete iP as an E. coli proliferation inhibitor.
Step6 Suppress the excessive growth of E. coli.
Step7 If the cancer recurs, the E. coli cells detect cancer-specific metabolites, move to the cancer, and resume growing to increase their niche.
Step8 The E. coli cells kill the cancer again, and the transduced human cells inhibit the excessive growth of E. coli cells. The cell concentration balance between human and E. coli cells is sustained.
Co-culture with bacteria and Immune system When human and bacterial cells are allowed to co-existed artificially,  negative influence of bacteria on human health is concerned and whether the bacteria are killed by the human immune system is unclear. However, in this system, we do not aim to introduce bacteria inside human cells but aimed extracellular co-existence. Therefore, it is considered that:
- Human and bacterial cells co-exist only extracellularly and the influence of the immune system is not needed to consider.
- If bacteria excessively grow, the growth will be suppressed by the proliferation inhibition system.
- If bacteria get too close to human cells like invading human cells, human cells sense it and an immune reaction occurs. However, this immune reaction is too weak to lead extermination of bacteria.

     It just sounds oddly familiar. Change the protagonists in the story into scientists and their carefully engineered or synthesized organisms, wouldn't it also be the story of one of synthetic biology’s biggest nightmares?
     Joseph Campbell speaks in his book The power of Myth of the underestimated importance of myths.[]According to him, who was influenced by Jungian Psychology[], humans are born with a psychological construct inherited from their father’s fathers i.e. the collective subconscious. Psyche can perceive the material world with its senses, but can only perceive the ideological world through words. Words in ancient times were the faithful recorder of human imagination which aided our ancestors in their attempts to explain phenomena and explore meanings, and whether scientific or not, their influence has been coursing through our veins for thousands of years. As the meanings of words and stories multiply with the evolvement of human experience in time, their initial impact on human psyche has not been totally diminished. Instead, they have a very basic mode, a simple construct with perhaps not much logic, and have become metaphors in our psyche. Psyche speaks in metaphors[], from which our gut-deep emotions are translated into. This has been verified by the psychoanalytic school of thought.
     Considering the fact that almost all the Europeans have read or been familiar with the Old Testament from a very young age, it's no wonder the mode of evil may have took shape in their heart as the image of that fallen angel, a synthesized being engineered by the Most High, though they may not have realized the vividity of this image in their heart when they have an unexplainable aversion to the genetically modified organisms.
     Why some people would always have an instinctual worry that something as an artificial engineered organism might end up malignant or out of control despite the initial goodwill with which scientists start their project? The safety tests are proved by independent scientists and organizations, and in some countries such as the United Kingdom, public consultation is held [iGEM Edinburgh, 2009?], so why is that the skeptics always would be skeptic, despite evidence and persuasion from sources that our logic and reason would agree? Do they not listen to their reason? Are they really that scientifically illiterate as claimed by some scientific researchers? Some skeptics are also accomplished persons in other areas and their sanity and rationality are proved normal if not better than those who do not doubt. If even they have constant doubt and fear, perhaps it’s time to look into the source of this reaction that sometimes deemed unreasonable and most times underexplained as “doubt” or “fear” by the"

The Rest Saving the West
Quite a few of the projects of previous iGEM teams are aimed at providing solutions for Third-World problems: Bacteria that detect arsenic in drinking water or cadmium contaminated food and bacteria that kill mosquitos larvae . Very few iGEM projects aim to solve first-world problems, such as Todai Tokyo's attempt to tackle lifestyle diseases.
So we asked the team to imagine they were entering the rather wonderful Designs for the First World competition as a team of tongue-in-cheek Synthetic Biologists from India trying to solve the problems plaguing the West:
Food Production and Eating Disorders
Aging Population and Low Birth rate
Immigration and Integration to Society
Sustainability and Over consumption
After a group brainstorm the team came up with loads of ideas, highlights are below:
Food Production and Eating Disorders
Bacteria Salad - Bacteria that has the flavour and consistency of food but with none of its nutritional value - just like salad.
Moo.coli - Bacteria that replace cows in milk-production.
Aging Population and Low Birth rate
The Booster Cell - a cell with packed with mitochondria that latch onto the cells of the host organism (in this case, old people), giving them more energy.
Immigration and Integration to Society
Coloreria - Melanin controlling Bacteria.
Testosterone reducer - Bacteria that reduces and regulates testosterone in men, thus controlling crime in society.
Sustainability and Over consumption
Purgcaelum - Bacteria that filters pollution

Evaluation & Safety Assessment
1.      Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
Magnetospirillum magneticum has no known pathogenic activity and is well regarded by many scientists for its safety.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
The idea of delivering our invasive magnetotactic bacteria into human brain can potentially be dangerous if handled without care. Although AMB-1, the bacterial strain that we are using, has no known pathogenic activity and is well regarded by many scientists for its safety, we cannot ensure the exact effects once the bacterial cells are transferred into the human brain. Still, we have established an in vitro symbiosis between our modified AMB-1 and glial cells, for reducing immune responses.
Besides, all of the experiments including cloning techniques, PCR, bacterial transformation and mammalian cell assay have been practiced under general safety instruction. With regard to the materials, we take careful precaution to prevent spreading. Our work does not pose particular researcher, public, or environmental safety concerns.
2.  If your response to any of the questions above is yes:
a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory work.
b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.
The new BioBrick parts we made this year are mainly about using the electromagnetic oscillation control to excite wobble-complementation of helix of mms13 and CHAMP design; then to acheive our goal-twinkling magnetobac. The parts we constructed in group A will less probably cause the safety issues.

BBa_K2353002: tsPurpleLAA
Our 2017 iGEM team used existing Biobrick parts from the Uppsala team (BBa_K1033906) and also the Endy Lab (BBa_M0050-LAA, M0052-DAS). We were trying to further Edinburgh’s work by expanding upon their experiments with GFP and the degradation tags. We sought to do this by replacing GFP with the tsPurple chromoprotein and characterizing the ClpXP system. We attempted to characterize these previous parts but ran into some obstacles while working with them.
We first obtained the tsPurple sequence from the 2013 Uppsala iGEM wiki page. We ordered the sequence online from IDT, hydrated it, and proceeded to carry out the 3A assembly procedures to create our constructs. We had the tsPurple with no degradation tag, tsPurple with the LAA degradation tag, and tsPurple with the DAS degradation tag. The degradation tags were obtained from the Endy Lab sequencing and correspond to strong degradation for LAA and moderate for DAS.
We sought to improve upon the LAA and DAS degradation tags by showing their relative strength in degrading the tsPurple chromoprotein and we also sought to improve upon the characterization of the tsPurple gene so that its relative degradation may be present for anyone who needs it."

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#BobMcdonald_-_-_TEXT.html," before you start talking about cellulose, about bioreactors, and enzymes, and all that scientific jargon, you’ve got to set the stage. Why are you doing this? What is the point of doing this? Well, fossil fuel is limited, we would like to have an alternative source of energy, so ethanol is the answer to that. Although ethanol still produces carbon dioxide, but, anyways, that’s the point. You’ve got to put your story in human terms so the people who don’t understand the science will understand. So first set the scene, then get into what you’re doing, and do it in terms of what people might understand. I didn’t know that porcupines could digest cellulose. That’s really interesting. Who would have thought about looking at a porcupine to find something that I could put into my car? So yeah, that’s great. That’s what is going to get an audience. So you have to take a step back from the science, and think about how would a person who’s never heard about this understand it? What would get their attention? Relating porcupines and cars, you would’ve never thought of a relationship between porcupines and the fuel station, but this is what we are doing. And introduce it. Set the scene in human terms. Very often when I am talking to the scientists, and they start getting too deeply into the science themselves with all the jargon. I understand it, because I have been in the business for a long time. But, sometimes I’ll stop them and be like, hey, you are not talking to another scientist. You are not defending your phD. Right, I’m just a person interested in it. So, how would you explain this to me if I meet you at a party. If I met you at a party, and I said, what do you do for a living? You would just tell me in general terms what you do, you know well we are looking at alternative fuels, and one of them is ethanol. And hey, who would’ve thought that we get it from porcupines, we’ve taken a lesson from porcupines. Or how would you explain it to your dentist? Your dentist is someone who is well-educated, but doesn’t know what you are doing. Right? They know another field. Or, how would you explain over your backyard fence to a neighbor? That kind of thing. So start there, start with storytelling and set the context and if you want to get into the science of it, you don’t have to teach them everything about the"
NEFU_China,2014,Team:NEFU China#Detecting_-_-_TEXT.html," have chosen an identified pigment in the Registry: the biobrick of RFP ( BBa_E1010 ) was used as reporter gene in our metal detection device. After exchanging the biobrick part with SmtA in smtB-OP-smtA device, the pigment gene was under control of metal-induced promoter (smtB-OP).
It was important to us that the similar device which contained Lac-Z as reporter gene had ability to sense Zn2+ and Cd2+ in E. coli [7, 8]. Thus, there are four potential metal binding sites on protein SmtB as known as α3, α3N, α5 and α5C [9], different from Zn2+ resistance mechanisms, Cd2+ binds SmtB at the site α3N [10]. To gain deep insight regarding the detailed comparison of smtB-OP-reporter affected by these two metal ions in E. coli, we adopted Rosetta-plysS and detected the expression of reporter gene by measuring OD value (OD450 for RFP). As shown in Figure.2 A-B, pigment gene can be both activated by Zn2+ and Cd2+, the up-regulation from Cd2+ was with more sensitive with shorter period and lower consistency than Zn2+. With higher density of bacteria (1x107 cells ml-1), the pigment expression induced by Cd2+ in 2 hours could be easily distinguished by our naked eye (Fig.3C). Taken together, these data provided basic but necessary information that we could take this recombinant device to report the content of Cd2+ with certain degree (2-20μM in 2 hours) not affected by Zn2+.
Based on the conclusions above, we focused on the details of our detecting device resulting from Cd2+ only with certain degree. For quality control, we detected the standard substances by Optima 8300 ICP-OES Spectrometer the credible interval of this method displayed to land at 50-500μM (Table.1). For the pigment expression differences with Cd2+ at 10-50μM in 2 hours are not obvious, our team has coupled a more impressible biobrick part amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ) with the smtB-OP element. Results from Fig 3 A-B indicated that, the diversity of amilCP expression (measured by OD600) was able to represent the continuous concentrations of Cd2+ precisely within 0-50μM in one hour. The visualization is another"
Caltech,2010,Team:Caltech#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"). The red light activation functions identically with the simpler case, but now the OmpR promoter regulates the production of the CinR activator protein (<partinfo>BBa_C0077</partinfo>). Similarly, the infrared light activating the heat-shock promoter (<partinfo>BBa_K112400</partinfo>), now will cause the production of AHL Synthetase CinI (<partinfo>BBa_C0076</partinfo>). When both CinI and CinR are present in the cell, they form a heterodimer transcription factor which positively regulates the HSL-CinR promoter (<partinfo>BBa_R0077</partinfo>), which then can activate the lysis genes.
This HSL-CinR promoter can also be placed upstream of both: (a) the CinI (<partinfo>BBa_C0076</partinfo>) and CinR (<partinfo>BBa_C0077</partinfo>) genes and (b) the lysis cassette (<partinfo>BBa_K124017</partinfo>). In this way, we establish both a positive feedback loop and a strong lysis pathway. The pathway is only activated when the cell has received both red and infrared signals (and has produced both CinI and CinR), comprising the AND gate. This allows us to specify a different lysis profile for each layer in our reaction volume. Because the output of the AND gate activates the further production of the gate's inputs, this also forms an effective positive feedback loop, which ensures that a short pulse of activation signal (light) can be sufficient to produce an abundance of lysis proteins.
Detailed schematic of the proposed 3D printing procedure.
Printing
Our production cells will not only contain the above gene network, but also genes to constitutively or inducibly create the molecules that we ultimately wish to crosslink. These genes can be placed on a second plasmid, allowing the light activation network to be manipulated independently of that responsible for the printing media. Thus, this system can be considered as a general printing framework, where cell stock can be maintained with only the light-lysis plasmid and the various printing media plasmids can be inserted as necessary, like simple printing cartridges. Any biological material could feasibly be printed with this system, for example including various colors or smells or targeting various properties like hardness or elasticity.
Indeed, the system can be considered even more generally still: the dual-wavelength system can be used to easily select any group of cells in a 3D volume, without disturbing the media. Cells can"

UV Spectrum
Ultraviolet is that part of electromagnetic radiation bounded by the lower wavelength extreme of the visible spectrum and the upper end of the X-ray radiation band. The spectral range of ultraviolet radiation  is,  by definition, between 100  and 400 nm  and  is   invisible   to human  eyes.  The  UV spectrum is subdivided into three bands: UV-A (long-wave) from 315 to 400 nm, UV-B (medium-wave) from 280 to 315 nm, UV-C (short-wave) from 100 to 280 nm. A strong germicidal effect is provided by the radiation in the short-wave UV-C band.
E.coli SOS System
Fig.1 E.Coli Survival curve
The maximum UV germicidal effect  coincides with the peak absorbance of DNA (near 260nm) due to the dimerization of two adjacent thymines. That can be seen in the Fig.1 where is showed the living population of bacteria after irradiation.  E.Coli cells have a system that recovery DNA damage when it occurs and it is the best studied transcriptional response [1].
This systems can be divided into two class: the SOS Photoreactivation repair and the  SOS respond triggered by RecA protein. The first uses the photolyase, a poorly expressed enzyme(encoded by genes phrA and phrB)  which  binds the pyrimidine dimers and uses the blue light to split them apart as showed in Fig.2.
Fig.2 After dimerization of two adjacent thymines blue light gives energy to photolyase to repair the damage
Instead single stranded DNA produced by several DNA-damaging agents can be bound by RecA protein, resulting in conversion of this protein to its activated form. The RecA repair system doesn’t need light and Lexa protein controls the expression of 43 genes [2] that cooperate together to repair the extensive genetic  damage. RecA and Lex"

Risk Assessment
Overview
It is tempting as scientists to think that we can treat risk assessment as we would treat any scientific protocols - that with a few key steps and critical considerations, we will always end up with the right answer. However, assessing risk, particularly for environmental projects, is not that simple. Thinking about potential impacts and risks often turns up more questions than answers, and it is difficult to know where to start. For this reason, we have employed three approaches to risk assessment. The first was developed by Cornell’s Environmental Health & Safety Department, pertaining specifically to work with recombinant organisms. The next was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a general environmental risk assessment and modified by both the Woodrow Wilson Center and our team for use on our synthetic biology project. Finally, we strived to embody the design principles set forth by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. Each approach has its limitations, but all of them have helped to inform our project design, research practices, and considerations for further development of our project.
Environmental Health & Safety (EHS)
Cornell’s Environmental Health & Safety Department lays the groundwork for determining safe research practices on campus, and greatly informed our own safety protocols . They specifically suggested the following risk assessment criteria for researchers working with recombinant organisms.
Formation – The creation of a genetically-altered micro-organism through deliberate or accidental means.
For our purposes, our modified organism was altered intentionally, thus we know all of the donor organisms (T7 bacteriophage, H. pylori, P. aeruginosa, N. tabacum) and the recipient organism (E. coli BL21-AI and E. coli DH5α) are not hazardous.
Release – The deliberate release or accidental escape of some of these micro-organisms in the workplace and/or into the environment.
Our filtration device includes a hollow fiber reactor, which is specifically designed to hold cells inside, yet let water and other materials pass through it"

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest AdhesionTest_-_-_TEXT.html," we took inspiration from our teams killing system which secretes a bacteriocin, CFY, which specifically binds to and ruptures the outer cell membrane of Y. enterocolitica. [4] The main focus of the adhesion system drastically changed from expressing human like proteins to expressing the bacteriocin fused with the anchor protein.
If the bacteriocin would survive degradation in stomach like environments and later on find Y. enterocolitica, the bacteriocin, while attaching to the membrane, would  fix the probiotic to its target. Even though this connection would be much weaker than a system with collagen, it is safe and still an advantage to the Bactissile.
System Design
The Anchor
Since we want our system to be usable in a probiotic bacteria we looked for an anchor motif that works both in our well characterised prototype bacteria (E. coli) and in a well known probiotic bacteria like Lactobacillus. We also wanted the anchor motif to be usable with a wide range of protein types since this would be a great addition to the iGEM registry, since no construct for cell surface display could be found by us at the start of our project. In the end we found the gene coding for PgsA from Bacillus subtilis that had been used successfully in both E.coli and a Lactobacillus species. To prevent interaction with the fused domain we added a long (20aa) rigid linker [BBa_J176131] to the C-terminal of the anchor.
The fusion
To make the fusion protein of anchor and colicin Fy (PgsA-CFY) we chose to synthesize the genes in RFC25 standard (Freiburg). This adds two additional restriction enzyme sites (NgoMIV and AgeI) to the four standard ones, thus enabling simple assembly of the two proteins so that they are translated as one in the same reading frame.
Back up plan
We used normal assembly (RFC10) with re-ligation of XbaI and SpeI sites that leaves a TACTAG-scar where TAG can stop translation and therefore disable production of a fusion protein. A solution would then be to perform PCR-mutagenesis and remove the TACTAG-scar via point mutation.
Characterising the anchor
To test that the anchor attaches to the membrane, we tried to fuse a reporter, the blue fluorescence protein BFP, to the anchor. We chose to mutagenise B0034-BFP [BBa_K592024] to make it compatible with RFC25. It was designed to get an"

Londoner Team konstruiert Co-Kulturen
Auch in der Kategorie „Undergraduate“ (U23) war ein europäisches Team bei iGEM erfolgreich. Hier verbuchte das Team vom Imperial College London den Gesamtsieg für sich. Die Londoner haben sich in ihrem Projekt „Ecolibrium“ mit der Konstruktion von mikrobiellen Ökosystemen im Labor beschäftigt. Auf den Plätzen folgen das Team Sydney und SCAU-China.
Einen Sonderpreis heimste das Team Hamburg ein. Für die Hanseaten gab es den begehrten „iGEMers Prize“, der von den tausenden Teilnehmern des ""Giant Jamborees"" als Publikumspreis vergeben wird. Das Projekt ""Finding Clamydory"" - dessen Website-Gestaltung an den Kinoblockbuster ""Finding Dory"" angelehnt ist, traf offenkundig den Nerv des Plenums. Das Team hat einen Biosensor entwickelt, der Erreger der Art Chlamydia trachomatis gezielt aufspüren kann. Chlamydien sind Auslöser von Geschlechtskrankheiten, sie werden meist ungezielt mit Breitband-Antibiotika behandelt. Ein präzises Testverfahren, wie die Hanseaten es ausgetüftelt haben, könnte die Therapie verbessern.
Reichlich Edelmetall
Auch der Medaillenspiegel der deutschen Teams ist einmal mehr beeindruckend: Es gab fünfmal Gold (Aachen, Bielefeld, Düsseldorf, Freiburg und München), sechsmal Silber (Bonn, Darmstadt, Nürnberg-Erlangen, Göttingen, Hamburg und Marburg) und zweimal Bronze (Hannover und Tübingen). Damit haben die deutschen Hochschulteams die seit vielen Jahren äußerst erfolgreiche iGEM-Geschichte fortgeschrieben. Hier können Sie die Projekte der Saison 2016 im Kurzprofil nachlesen (mehr...).

Bacterial simulation overview
An example of the Java programming in this project, showing the Subtilis.java class file.
Bacterial cells classes
See Bacteria Pseudo Code .
For the actual simulation of the bacterial life cycles, we decided to allow each bacterial cell to run as a separate thread. The phenotype of a bacterial cell changes depending on what state they are in, so we decided to have a number of different classes to represent these states. These classes have some common attributes, which can be represented as a superclass in object orientated computing. There is also an additional simple class for easily storing spacial coordinates, ie 3 number values.
Superclass:
Cell - contains the common attributes, such as levels of cadmium and nutrients. The Cell class also provides access to the database.
Subclasses:
Subtilis - represents vegetative cells. From here cells can make various life choices and enter other states accordingly. These can become Spores, Biofilm, Motile, and divide into two.
Spore - represents the spore stage of the life cycle. Note that in our project the cells have to choose whether they are going to become a ""metal sequestering"" spore which cannot germinate.
Biofilm - represents the biofilm phenotype of the cells.
Motile - represents motility of the cells

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Notebook#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," on SC-U plates with Glucose and incubated at 30°C
Plasmid isolation of p123 and p136
Investigator: Roman
Aim: Aim of the experiment was the isolation of p123 out of transformed (see friday) XL-1 blue chemo competent e.coli- cells. Old and newly prepared competent cells were used (see friday). Besides, p136 was isolated out of transformed cells, which is pSB1C3 with CHS- inserted. The whole experiment should provide an adequate amount of pSB1C3 backbone for the caffeine team, because we want to insert our three genes in this vector.
Operational Sequence:
The plasmid preparation was performed as described in the manufacturers protocoll (Quiagen Miniprep Kit). Elution was done with 50 µl Elution Buffer in one step. Due to the incubation of the liquid cultures at room temperature over the weekend instead of 37°C over night, the pellet was a bit smaller than usual, resulting in concentrations of only:
51,9 ng/µl (p123, old competent cells used)
57,8 ng/µl (p123, new competent cells used)
59,2 ng/µl (p136)
Restriction digest of p123 and p136 and preparative gel electrophoresis

We have a precise plan for our human practice project. We would like to study the emergence of complexity in many different fields and investigate how people deal with it. We will do this with interviews of experts in different fields, and with a survey for a wider outreach. We will also reach younger people by organizing talks in schools. We will finally give our own advice on the question by writing an essay on the subject and linking it to our experience with Mosaicoli.

Construction of the regulator plasmids
Thursday, July 5th
Construction of the lasR regulator plasmid (piG0040)
Competent cells were transformed with piG0028 (K553003, lasR) and selected on chloramphenicol-LB-plates. Plasmid DNA was extracted by performing a miniprep. The relevant plasmid sequence was sequenced by Microsynth using the primers oiG0001 and oiG0002. Amplification of lasR by PCR using oiG0003 and oiG0004 resulted in the fragment fiG0004 (1.0 kb). The vector piG0034 (pSEVA 181) was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and PacI to fiG0001 (3.0 kb). The two fragments, fiG0001 and fiG0004, were assembled using Gibbson assembly. Thus we used the plasmid backbone of piG0034 and lasR of piG0028 to construct the lasR regulator plasmid piG0040. Competent cells were transformed with piG0040 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. Colony PCR using the primers oiG0035 and oiG0036 was conducted to check the size of the inserted fragment (expected bands at 1.0 and 1.2 kb). The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the same primers.
Construction of the luxR regulator plasmid (piG0041)

Overview
This year, our team is investigating new methods of increasing the efficiency of bioremediation and biosynthesis using modified bacteria. The development of the oil sands in Alberta, has resulted in the build up of toxic byproducts stored in massive tailings ponds. To help resolve these issues, our goals can be divided up into three main categories: the binding of pollutants, adhesion and aggregation of bacteria, and catalysis.
Most bacteria possess tail-like appendages called flagella, which can be genetically altered for novel functions. Each flagella is made up of a number of polymerizing proteins, often called flagellin. By making chimeric insertions in the variable domain of the flagellin, we can incorporate metal binding proteins, enzymes, adhesive proteins as well as scaffolding proteins to further extend the possible applications. To accomplish this, we can summarize the majority of our work into three main tasks:
clone and modify the constant domains of the flagellin protein for making insertions using Biobricks and parts obtained from the wild.
design a flexible, compatible cloning method for efficientlymaking chimeric insertions using Biobricks and other parts
introduce binding and catalysis to the length of the flagella.
Fluorescence
ChimeriQ, the project on tail-like appendages flagella, can be genetically altered for novel functions. As a proof of concept, we believed it would be most beneficially to use fluorescent proteins as a stepping stone to validated that proteins could indeed be expressed on the flagella.
Through the learning phase we researched intensively on the full flagella construct and what was required to incorporate protein infusions. As stated before, the D3 domain in the flagella construct has no real function, and can therefore be replaced with a protein of our choice. Through PCR overlap extension we would incorporate GFP and RFP into our constructs. To prove that it PCR overlap extension would worked, we would incorporate this PCR product"

We also Improved a previous iGEM project
We improved CRY2 ( BBa_K1592015 ) and CIB1 ( BBa_K1592016 ). These biobricks are key BioBrics in "" A live eukaryotic cell based auto-cementation kit "" project of HUST-China 2015. CIB1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, would interact with cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), a blue light stimulated photoreceptor. This fusion protein is for use in a yeast-two-hybrid system, and a Gal4 DNA activating domain fused to N terminus of CIB1. To regulate DNA transcription by blue light, the system is based on a two-hybrid interaction in which a light-mediated protein interaction brings together two halves (a binding domain and an activation domain) of a split transcription factor.
We improved the function of CRY2 ( BBa_K1592015 ) and CIB1 ( BBa_K1592016 ) and enter our parts ( BBa_K1982005 and BBa_K1982000 ) in the Registry. Please see the Registry page of this two parts.
Figure 1 illustrates the detailed design of the whole device
Proof of concept
According to our design, we transfected a targeting plasmid into E.coli BL21 to express fusion protein composed of the protein tCas9 and CIBN. Simultaneously, we transfected GFP, gRNA and CRY2-VP64 plasmid into E.coli BL21. Then, the promoter of GFP were continually repressed by gRNA and tCas9. When exposed to blue light, the N-terminal fragment of CIB1 (CIBN) would interact with CRY2. Subsequently, binding of the CRY2-VP64 on the upstream sequence of promoter will result in activating promoter via recruitment of the RNA polymerase II by the VP64 subunit of CRY2-VP64. Generally, the experimental procedure can be divided into four steps:
Characterization of fusion protein
Verification of the suppression efficiency of gRNA
Silencing capability validation
Targeting capability validation
Characterization of fusion protein

As this project represents on itself a huge amount of intellectual, material and time implication of all of our team, and as we didn't realize all the mini-games we wanted to design, we want our mobile application to be transmitted and updated every year for the iGEM competition by the next IONIS iGEM teams.
Challenging others
What a better way to get people to question a topic than by challenging them?
Challenging iGEMers: popularization is not an easy task which is why we ask our fellow iGEMers to explain their project in a less than one minute video!
Challenging Biotechnology Students: After presenting the iGEM and synthetic biology to 1st year biotechnology students we challenged them to imagine a project in less than 30 min in a friendly competition after which they presented their idea in front of their classmates who were encouraged to question the idea on every area from ethic to biosafety and possible road-to-market issues.
Increasing Curiosity for Science in Primary and High Schools: Members of our team have presented biology and more generally Science to primary school pupils. They also presented synthetic biology and human genetics to High School students. Those presentations were both rewarding for the class as well as our team: children and students were really excited and curious about the topic, and it was truly fulfilling to teach them during those sessions and turning on a sparkle of interest which may lead to a real passion for science!
Building a safer project to contribute to the industrial use of synthetic biology
Another aspect of our project was to bring scientists a tool to make their project safer: the kill-switch triggered by light we aimed to design would allow other projects to be conducted in a  controlled and closed environment, by preventing any spreading out of the bioreactor in which bacteria would be kept for instance. However, to ensure the safety of our system, test on the rapidity of the death activation after light exposure should be performed and modeled before being used in industrial conditions.       Biosafety should be a fundamental part of synthetic biology research and we hope our contributions to the iGEM competition will both help future teams but also encourage them to think about their own way to develop safer experimentations that could lead one step toward industrial use of synbio!
Final words
To conclude, our team believe scientists and citizens must work together because ethical and environmental issues related to synthetic biology are concerning everyone.       Everybody should be able to understand the main principles of this field and it is with"

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," popular protein for membrane fusions (Kim & Yoo, 1998) . Using these different approaches we expect to coat the cell in polysilicate, an overview is shown in figure 1. This glass coating around the cell will be the basis of both our biolens and –laser.
Figure 1: (A) Silicatein is able to convert monosilicate to polysilicate, allowing the cell to cover itself in it. (B) We express silicatein in three ways: solely expressing silicatein and fusing it to the membrane proteins OmpA or INP.
Experiments and Results
To determine if we have successfully covered E. coli in polysilicate, and to characterize the properties of the polysilicate-coated cells, we have performed a series of tests. First of all, we have stained the cells with Rhodamine 123, a fluorescent stain that is able to bind to polysilicate. These stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope to determine whether the polysilicate shell was present. Furthermore, the polysilicate-synthesizing cells were observed using both Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We have also determined the physical properties using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to see whether the polysilicate layer changes the stiffness of the cells. Lastly, we have also performed a growth study of the polysilicate-coated cells to determine whether the polysilicate layer affects growth of the organisms.
Rhodamine 123 staining of polysilicate covered cells
Introduction
After transforming E. coli with the different silicatein BioBricks, we wanted to confirm and image whether the cell had indeed synthesized a layer of polysilicate around itself. In a very intuitive experiment we can stain polysilicate with the fluorescent dye Rhodamine 123, which has shown to bind specifically to polysilicate (Li, Chu, & Lee, 1989) . We can image the stained polysilicate with a simple fluorescence microscope.
Methods
The experiment was performed using E. coli BL21 with the plasmids and conditions listed in table 1. All genes are expressed under the inducible Lac-promoter, which was present in the plasmid backbone we used, together with the LacI gene. This backbone was obtained from pBbS5a-RFP, a gift from Jay Keasling (Addgene plasmid # 35283) ( Lee et al., 2011 ).

1. The pcDNA3.1-CD63-L7Ae plasmid and pcDNA3.1-nanoluc plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293T cells as a negative control.
2. The pcDNA3.1-CD63-L7Ae plasmid and pcDNA3.1-nanoluc-C/Dbox plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293T cells as a test group.
The exosomes in these two groups were isolated from the medium of the transfected cells by ultracentrifugation and the quantity of packaged mRNA were measured by qRT-PCR.
Similarly, we chose another group of RNA-protein complex to deliver our cargo mRNA to exosomes. (Why another construct?)
Introduction to MS2 & 3 loops
The MS2 coat protein and the MS2 3X loops in our project is a group of bacteriophage RNA-protein complexes.                     They come from MS2 bacteriophage,                     a single-stranded RNA phage (Wang et al., 2018).                     The MS2 gene encodes a bacteriophage coat protein which can recognize and bind to an RNA hairpin structure,                     the MS2 stem loop, which is present at the beginning of the replicase gene to modulate the expression of that gene (Peabody, 1990).
Lethbridge iGEM 2017 used MS2 and its corresponding MS2 stem loop for RNA isolation (BBa_K2443038).                     They employed two MS2 stem loops in their construction.                     According to a previous research,                     the MS2 loop tandem trimer (termed 3X loops) has a higher mRNA binding efficiency compared with other numbers of loop tandem repeat.                     Furthermore, a U to C mutation was introduced at position 13 in the wild type MS2 loop  eresulting in a higher affinity e f(Hung and Leonard, 2016).                     Therefore, we utilized the higher affinity MS2 loop tandem trimer (3X MS2 loops) to achieve a high therapeutic mRNA encapsulation efficiency.
Design overview
We dinserted the y3X MS2 loops downstream of the 3’-UTR of cargo mRNA,                     which can bind to the cognate bacteriophage coat protein MS2 (Hung and Leonard, 2016).                     In addition, MS2 is conjugated to the C"

The University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team has aided the High School iGEM team in troubleshooting wet lab experiments, specifically with the assembly of our three constructs Nuclease (BBa_K1792004), Dextranase (BBa_K1792002), and Petal Death Protein (BBa_K1792000). Advice was given with experiments such as transformations, restriction digests, ligations, minipreps, and construct design.
In addition to our collaboration with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team, we organized and hosted an Alberta wide wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams, Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, and Lethbridge were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of Ligations, Making Competent Cells, Transformations, Minipreps, and Gel Electrophoresis were taught, to name a few.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Our team seeks to extend the range of optimal functioning of the sensor developed by Bristol at temperatures below  20 ° C, as many of the crops in highlands (coffee and fruits), are in this range. To solve this problem we found that the use of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase) gene responsible for thermogenesis in the sacred lotus [4], mainly used in Synthetic Biology to generate an increase in periplasmic temperature, produced an interesting increase in the growth and downsizing bacterial densities in temperature [5]. This part uses a HybB promoter [6] for ""cold shock"".  We, the UTP-Panama iGEM Team developed a new ""device"" by Combining the two parts, the AOX periplasmatic heat generator (BioBrick BBa_K410000) and the Nitrates biosensor (BioBrick BBa_K381001), to create that we call The Renbo, to ensure that our meters Nutrient operate at low temperatures. The Renbo is the first of a family of Improved Biosensor that the UTP-Panama Team plans to create.
Future Develops
The next step in our project is to interchange the HybB promoter by the CspA promoter (BBa_K328001), these will produce an anti freeze protein that prevents ice crystals formation in the cell, by applying these we expect E.coli to survive and also perceive an increase on the genetic expression of our Escherichia Coli and still be able to sense the nitrate and nitrites on even lower temperatures than 15ºC (limit temperature of RENBO).

Our Project Design
The Bristol BBa_k381001 encodes an expression of GFP in response of Nitrate or Nitrites that expresses fluorescent signals upon nutrient detection, its principal application is that allows farmers to quantify soil nutrient content. The BBa_k410000 is a fusion of the HydB cold shock promoter, the OmpA a signal peptide, and AOX 1 . AOXa is a alternative oxidase found in Sacred Lotus. This is going to produce a increase of heat above ambient temperature as follow:

Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Modeling#Fingerprints_-_-_TEXT.html," procedure of reducing the number of variables from a multivariate set of data while still keeping the correlations intact. PCA has many possible appliances including neuroscience and image compression. The technique comes from an older established theorem in linear algebra called Singular Value Decomposition (2 , 3) . The matrix operations from this theorem were used in MATLAB rather than the PCA package to attain a better understanding of each step of the process.
Remarks
Some useful conclusions have been drawn from the analysis namely the relevance of squalene as the key target for an ageing device. It is important to highlight that these results are a long way from having a practical use. The major barrier to overcome is understanding the complexity of how sex, age, ethnicity, diet, as well as substrate properties interact (2) . The results already show great variation in a controlled environment so taking into account the different types of surfaces fingerprints that can be left behind would add further difficulty in attempting to draw any hard lined conclusions.  The major aim from this research was to prove that it is possible to date fingerprints. This work has helped assert the possibility while also rejecting the notion of a “one size fits all” type of age curve to do so.  From the PCA results, what we propose is a procedure where if there is a known suspect from a crime scene with a fingermark found at the crime scene. We would take forty or so samples from the suspect and construct an intraspecific age curve that would work in conjunction with the biosensor. This would be using a set of fingerprints collected from the suspect to deduce the age of the fingermark at the crime scene. This would be a laborious procedure and would probably be reserved for high profile cases.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Properties of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
The unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is known as a model organism, the first strains were isolated about 60 years ago (1). The algae diverged from land plants over one billion years ago and comes from a linage of Viridiplantae. C. reinhardtii is built up by a basal body with two connected anterior flagella used for environmental sensing, mating and swimming. It is approximately 10 μm in size and has a chloroplast containing its photosynthetic apparatus as well as metabolic pathways (2). The algae occurs in two genetically mating types, + and – alleles of a mating type complex. Mixing the two types will rapidly form a diploid cell that turns into a heavy walled zygospore.
Why this model organism?
C. reinhardtii is used as a model organism for several reasons. Firstly, it is very easy to culture in many different environments as long as there is access to fresh water or soil and carbon dioxide. It is also possible to grow the algae in dark if a carbon source is provided. Secondly, this microalgae has a very short generation time and is easy to manipulate genetically since its entire genome has been sequenced.
Saftey
According to previous research, C. reinhardtii poses no human health risk at all (3). As a precaution however one should treat it as a biosafety class 1 when it has been genetically modified (4).
Previous research
There has been a study, with an aim to see if it worked to modify the algae CRISPR-Cas9 where they have successfully modified C. reinhardtii using this system. The study was however unsuccessful to retrieve any transformants with Cas9. Since the promoter of Cas9 was constitutively activated, the research group concluded that the cells did not grow fast enough due to Cas9 being toxic to the algae. They speculated that this was probably due to the Cas9 interfering with the survival of the C. reinhardtii, although they did not speculate as to how Cas9 interfered with cell growth. (5). In that study they also suggested as a future change,"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," project done by USTC in iGEM 2014.
We also included a brief history about the development of synthetic biology in the lecture, hoping to impress them about the mechanism in biological world and thus they might be attracted into the field of biology in the future.
After that we showed them around our laboratory and introduce our equipments to them. In addition, procedure and some rules of using peptites were also taught to them. Many of the high school students showed strong interest in our project and biological experiments.
Then we played a video describing our daily experiments in laboratory, which was transcribed in advance. The video consists of four parts, plasmids extraction, making mediums, digging out single colonies and electrolysis, which were completed by four of our team members, respectively. With that video, high school students could gain more detailed and comprehensive knowledge of our experiments and project. In this way, we aimed to enhance their interest about synthetic biology.
Finally, since it is the 10th year that we have attended iGEM, the history of USTCers' participating in iGEM was told to them. We encouraged them to study harder to join us one day, so that our glory will be continued by THEMSELVES.
Although nowadays it become difficult for public to catch up with the rapidly developing science, we still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.
Introduction of iGEM to freshmen
In the beginning of this semester we held a lecture for freshmen of our university to introduce iGEM competition as well as our project to them. By holding this lecture we wish to encourage those new students who are interested in synthetic biology and likely to choose biology as their major to try to learn more about this field and participate in iGEM competition next year.
Kaiyue Ma, the leader of Team USTC, gave them an introduction about molecular biology told them what the scientists do with the technique of synthetic biology. During the lecure, we tried to show that scientists hire the cutting-edge technology to explore the complex metabolic process of organisms and creat new applications for practical use such as Genetically Modified Organisms and treatment for diseases at the same time.
The lecture also included brief introductions of our project this year. The leader shared with them information about the spliting of GFP protein and the aggregation of prions. In addition, he talked about the iGEM competition and our trial and errors and of course achievements in our experiments and researches. In this"

Bigger Picture
Our antitoxin plasmid can be combined with the restriction enzyme system to generate a toxin-antitoxin system that works on a tunable delay depending on the induction of the restriction enzyme. Once the degradation of the antitoxin plasmid containing the immunity protein is initiated, the cell will continue to produce the activity protein, which will digest the cells own genetic material as well as its neighbors and extracellular DNA via its DNase activity.
Scroll through the thumbnails to see the step by step explanation of our project.
In the initial phase, the colicin activity protein and immunity protein are produced and form a heterodimer, protecting the cell from the activity proteins' DNase domain.
In the second phase, the restriction enzyme is produced.
In the third phase, the restriction enzyme recognizes and cleaves the restriction sites present in the antitoxin plasmid.
In the fourth phase, the antitoxin plasmid is completely degraded rendering the cell vulnerable to the lethal activity protein.
In the fifth phase, the activity protein kills the cell and digests its genetic contents.
Objectives
Bacteria have developed mechanisms to kill other bacteria in order to reduce competition between themselves in their environment [1]. Some strains of E. coli produce lethal proteins called colicins which kill sensitive bacteria, including related species of E. coli. Colicinogenic cells contain specific immunity against their own toxin, and their colicins only effect cells containing specific receptors on their  outer membrane surface.
We have exploited this naturally occurring system to construct a well characterized toxin-antitoxin system  ( design ):
Design an antitoxin part from the colicin E2 immunity gene that confers immunity against the Col E2 activity protein
Measure viability of immune and vulnerable cells in the presence of WT Col E2 cells
Design a Col E2 activity protein part under the control of a constitutive promoter and establish in immune strains to generate synthetic Col E2 cells
Measure viability of immune and vulnerable cells in the presence of synthetic Col E2 cells
Combine our system with the Restriction Enzyme System, measure viability
Design
For our system we will generate two plasmids, one carrying the Col E2 activity protein and one carrying the Col E2 immunity protein. As the immunity protein is normally present in excess in natural colicinogenic cells, we chose a 10-12 copy vector pSB3C5 to carry the immunity protein, and a lower ~5 copy vector pSB4K5 to carry the toxin protein.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"2YT, LB or Esvelt-Medium should be used for further experiments. Since Kevin Esvelt reported in his PhD thesis, that medium influences the amount of F-pili an E.coli expresses. This should be directly correlated to the number of phages which can infect one of the E.colis, since M13 phages are using f-pili for their transport in and out of the cell. The results of these tests showed a high number of single plaques for 10-2 and 10-4 dilutions of the supernatant from LB medium. In contrast, 2YT and Esvelt medium showed uncountable numbers for these dilutions, with a slightly higher propagation using Esvelt medium. Exceptions have been made, since we had poblemes with the negative control in all cases. Since we want to observe the general feasibility of each medium to propagate phages, this should not be important in this case.
Reporter systems:
Four different reporter systems should be integrated in our assesory plasmids. mNeonGreen is currently available in all our APs, while the Nano Luciferase, provided by Promega, will be cloned in one of Jan´s APs. This reporter should supply a bright signal while having a moderate size. LuxAB was former used in the Bt toxine paper from Badran et al.. All our important strains contain the LuxCDE genes in their genome (S1059, S1030, S2060, S2208). We should consider it as a reporter system. At last, LacZ is considered as another possibility for a simple readout before infecting the laggons. A possible reaction could include the addition of phages to a culture which contains AP with LacZ. After an amount of time, for example ten minutes, phage infections should be observed. For the next week, cloning of the different reporter systems is planed.
MinION sequencing:
spoke to Jan-Philipp Mallm who uses the MinION in AG Rippe
he is sitting in the fourth floor (R425 or something)
told me that the device is, like we already know, leaky in terms of error probability (around every tenth base is called incorrect)
first he was pessimistic to detect small mutations
BUT one could calculate the number of random mutations by comparing the occured mutations over time
one should find the directed mutations by the number of occurences and the occurence over time
due to that we should not need barcording - is not useful
maybe barcoding for different sample pools from different timepoints - simult"

BIOBRICKS SUBMITTED TO THE REGISTRY

BBa_K764007 wbiP
Encodes the galactosytransferase wbiP that adds a β-D-Galactose donor sugar onto an α-D-GalNAc(N-Acetylgalactosamine) acceptor sugar to form a 1->3 glycosidic bond. wbiP readily glycosylates GalNAc analogues all with α substutions at the reducing end, and also glycosylates serine and threonine residues.

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," Validation of the multiple choice questions would require us to examine whether certain answer choices are “good” or “poor” distractors, answer choices designed to test common misconceptions, and common statistics like the “facility factor” and “discrimination factor” that test how easy or hard a particular question is and how well a question help to discriminate different skill levels in a class, respectively. Validation of the survey instrument would require us to assess statistics known as “validity” and “reliability” [REF #.3].  Validity basically refers to whether or not the survey is measuring the concepts we think it’s measuring while reliability assesses how consistently the survey produces valid results. Dr. Pagliarulo has offered to help with this process if we can collect enough data.

Our goal for the wet lab portion of the project was to develop an inexpensive triclosan biosensor for use in a high school laboratory setting. To achieve our goal we first needed to find a molecule that interacted specifically with triclosan and whose interaction with triclosan could be coupled to a measurable readout. In researching the biology of triclosan, we discovered that its natural target fit the above requirements!
Triclosan’s natural target, the FabI enzyme, is directly inhibited by triclosan and its activity also depends on a commonly measured co-factor, NADH. It was unclear however which of the thousands of FabI enzymes we should use for our biosensor since all Bacteria and Eukaryotes have a FabI gene. We decided to use our device’s requirements to define our enzyme selection criterion. The chosen FabI enzyme would ideally:
over-express well in E.coli,
show activity on its respective substrate at <2nM level of enzyme, and
be inhibited by triclosan at the >2nM level of inhibitor (the higher level of TCS found in treated wastewater and toxic to algae).[18]
In addition, the commercially available native substrate for FabI (crotonyl-CoA) is unstable and costly. An alternative substrate was thus necessary for our biosensor to be used in a practical setting.

BBa_I0500 has a graded input-output response when put on a low copy or high copy plasmid. On low copy plasmid pSB3K3, BBa_I0500 is responsive to 10-4 - 10-2 mM arabinose, whereas on high copy plasmid pSB1K3, it senses arabinose from roughly 10-3 to 1mM.
BBa_I2031 appeared to be giving less fluorescence in low arabinose concentrations when placed on the high copy pSB1K3 plasmid than on low copy pSB3K3 plasmid, and the value is even lower than the auto fluorescence observed from the negative control (DH10B / pSB1K3-BBa_E0240). It might be interpreted that the promoter BBaI0500 is less leaky when placed on a high copy plasmid.
Cambridge 2011 used BBa_I0500 on pSB3K3 to drive their ReflectinA1-sfGFP and reported a threshold of all-or-none between 0.001mM and 0.01mM of arabinose. Groningen 2011 measured BBa_I0500 on pSB1C3 and reported an input sensing range from 0.05% to 1% of arabinose. Our result did not agree with either of theirs.

By placing the ompR coding region downstream of the red light sensor and upstream of a terminator our modified system controls expression of the puc genes by the red light sensor.  It should be impossible for the puc promoter to directly cause the transcription of puc genes due to the terminator, but instead, transcription of the puc genes must be activated via decreasing the presence of phosphorylated ompR.  The end target of ompR transcription is the ompC promoter, located directly upstream of the puc genes.  Placing GFP on the ompC transcript will show how often the promoter is transcribed and how often ompR is phoshorylated.
Part three of our characterization measures the effectiveness of the red light sensor in downregulating the phosphorylation of ompR.  This setup is identical to that of part two except we have introduced the red light sensor.  Now, the rate of ompR autophosphorylation will be halted by binding to a domain on the light-activated EnvZ kinase analogue.  GFP is still attached to the end product, the ompC promoter.  By comparing the fluorescence of GFP in this scenario compared with the second scenario the decrease in rate of phosphorylation should be apparent due to the activity of the red light sensor.
This is the final construct that will be our actual functioning model in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  This finished product will be compared to the wild type over various intensities of light and cell culture densities can be compared to see which strain, the wild type or the modified strain with the red light sensor was more efficient in harvesting light with varying intensities.

Our group seeks to assess the optimality of the synthetic system that modulates pucB/A gene expression and LH2 complex assembly in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.

Her reading subject is about  French and European law of the notion of scientific uncertainty. She was also one of the speakers at the conference we organised about the contribution of synthetic biology for the future.
Here is a memorable quotation from her speech.
“Scientific incertitude is a current state of scientific knowledge. I insist on the word current, because it’s at a defined moment. It is expected of scientists to be able in the future to give more and more informations based on their researches .(...) A recurrent object of scientific incertitude is the “possible risk”, here we are talking about possible but not confirmed risk, otherwise the technology would be forbidden”- Aliaa El Dairouty
Based on here presentation, we can understand that we are not yet able to completely assess the possible risks of our system. Indeed we are limited by our scientific knowledge. Therefore we should search for ways to expand this knowledge about our system. We should consider all the possible risks to make sure that our project is as safe as possible, not only for ethical concerns but also to get legal approval to develop it.

That’s because the toxin addicted time was too short that only part of bacteria expressed cbtA. While expression of cbeA made most bacteria appeared in bacilliform in 6h observation. Because the experiment time was limited, we didn’t get the distinct result. We think that more solid result will appear if we extend the observation duration.

Following them is a reporter, sfGFP, or superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein, which has been documented as extremely effective in Bacillus subtilis (720 bp)[vii]. Following the sfGFP is a terminator (39 bp).
The second plasmid had 4,703 base pairs and included the kill switch, two of the corn genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytosiderophores, and a reporter. It starts with a promoter induced by lactose (“PLlac0”, 55 bp). Following the lactose promoter is Hyb5, a holin which causes lysing [cell-death] in Bacillus subtilis (465 bp)[viii].  A terminator concludes the kill switch section of the plasmid. Following the kill switch is the constitutive promoter Pveg, the corn genes SAM (1689 bp), which encodes S-adenosylmethionine synthase,[ix] and nas1 (984 bp), which encodes nicotianamine synthase,[x] a reporter mRFP (mutant red fluorescent protein, 706 bp)[xi] which has been successfully used in Bacillus subtilis before, and a concluding terminator.
Organization
The plasmids were designed strategically so that they were roughly equal in number of base pairs, and the orders of specific were considered carefully. Shorter plasmids are more likely to be successful and cheaper, which is why we tried to minimize the length of each plasmid. Terminators are not always effective, so the kill switch is located at the beginning of a plasmid to avoid being accidently translated by an mRNA due to a previous section not being properly terminated. The reporters are placed after the corn genes because gene expression decreases linearly as the distance from the promoter increases, and expressing the corn genes is much more important than expressing the reporters.
Registry Part Selection
Using a conditional promoter so that the modified Bacillus subtilis would only produce phytosiderophores in the presence of plants roots was considered, but it was decided that conditional promoters would not be reliable enough. A constitutive promoter of medium strength was chosen for the corn genes because a weak promoter might not have produced enough phytosiderophores to make a difference, and a strong promoter might have overtaxed the cell in the production of phytosiderophores as to be counterproductive.
A strong RBS was chosen so that when a promoter was induced, the RBS would not be the weak link"
Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Economics_-_-_TEXT.html," working population, it can affect South Africa even more deeply. This is a danger of HIV, it is a disease that affects the individual and the collective insidiously.
The Congo
The Congo provides an interesting case study of the effects of HIV in a situation where the government cannot provide. So affected by social and political instability, foreign aid is difficult to deliver; to say nothing of the health care a stable government is able to facilitate. The Congo provides an example of HIV left alone to run rampant.
Although many studies have been conducted with regard to HIV in the Congo, sampling methods have been greatly affected by instability making it difficult to track HIV in regions of active conflict. However, one study finds that, although there is an overall prevalence of HIV less than two percent, there is a high degree of heterogeneity with regard to the spread of HIV cases. In some regions, up to thirty percent of people may be infected. Furthermore, this number is not homogenous across genders either. In some regions, men are disproportionately affected while in others it is women that are most affected.
HIV in the Congo is difficult to track but the heterogeneity of the spread of the disease is clear. Furthermore, according to the study, it appears that proximity to a city is a key factor for women. A greater proximity is associated with a higher incidence of HIV. This will have implications for when the conflict ends. (5) During times of conflict, cities are targets of high value and this heavily impacts short-term migratory patterns. If the conflict comes to an end, there is a strong likelihood that the population of the country will migrate back to the cities. As the higher incidence of HIV in urban areas is associated with patterns of riskier sex practices, there is the possibility that a time of sustained peace could lead to a spike in HIV incidence within the population.
As discussed in (1) the issue that HIV presents, especially in growing economies, relates fundamentally to shortened lifespan and lowered quality of life. As jobs continue to aggregate in cities, so too will the population. As such, the potential damage HIV will do to the economic growth/recovery of the Congo could be devastating.
United States
The United States uniquely differs from the countries of Africa in that researchers simply have a greater capacity to do research in the country. In fact, a far greater variety of information can be specified by American Studies. Although these studies do not necessarily reflect our region of interest, they do provide accurate data on the economic burdens associated with HIV in a country with a relatively developed healthcare system and a relatively high growth rate. This is a very best-case scenario.

In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to"

We use different primer for colony PCR . First, we use the chl upstream and downstream primers, after electrophoresis we get the right stripe. Second, we use the mRFP upstream and downstream primers, after electrophoresis we get the wrong stripe.
We get the Chl gene but we don’t get the mRFP gene, it shows that we did not connect snippet on the cell genome. When we do it, we also do a contrast experiment .We put mRFP complete and it primers together, after colony PCR  and the electrophoresis we get the right stripe. This suggests that the primer was correct.
14/08/2016 Aug 14th
1. We use the mRFP upstream and downstream primers, after electrophoresis we get the wrong stripe again.
2. So we decide to check the whole snippet. We use VF and VR to copy the whole snippet, the whole snippet was about 2053bp, but the snippet we get was about 300bp , that was clearly wrong.
15/08/2016 Aug 15th
1. Now we were confused. Why always can't successfully transfer into the TOP 10 cell? Why did it grow up in the B plate but doesn’t have positive results?
2. We thought about the above wassues, the only way to make it have Chl gene was transfer the PKD3 plasmids into the cell by mistake. In order to get the Chl gene, we use PCR technology to get it from PKD3 plasmids. So we make a verification experiment.
3. We extract the plasmid from B plate, use it to be the complete for cat gene, and we succeed. And we also do electrophoresis to compare with PKD3 plasmid, we get the same stripe. It shows that the Chl gene was brought by PKD3. To solve this problem, we nitrify after we copy the whole snippet. It will eliminate plasmids.
16/08/2016 Aug 16th
1. We copy the Chl gene snippet and mRFP gene snippet by PCR technology.  After electrophoresis we get the right stripe then we use kit recycle the snippet and the last we verify the snippet.
2. Use OE-PCR link two snippets.

Module PHI
PHI
PHI is basically the pipette. PHI controls 3 pipette actions, Aspirate, Dispense and Clean. It consists of three motors whose functions are as follow
Motor 1 (3-way Toggle switch)
This motor controls the flow of the air. If you look at it from the side when the switch is visible:
When the switch is to the left, there is a direct flow from the pipet head to the air. This makes it possible to use the second motor (motor B) to attempt to aspirate without aspirating any liquid, and enabling it to blow extra air out.
When the switch is in the middle, there is no connection.
When the switch is to the right, the pressure built up in the air tank is released into the pipette head.
Motor 2 (Aspirate or Dispense Liquid)
This motor is connected to a piston, so it can aspirate and dispense liquid.
Motor 3 (Clean Pipette)
This motor is connected to compressors compressing air in the air tank. It runs for seven seconds once the air is released.
PHI module in action
This video shows Phi running by itself.
Current Functionality and Limitations
BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 is only a proof-of-principle prototype.  In its current implementation, it is not user-friendly enough to be used by a standard molecular biologist directly. In our current program, both ALPHA and PHI provides a set of primitive functions that can be called by a driver program. ALPHA has a command that allows the pipette head to move to any location and tell PHI to do an action. PHI has primitive functions for ASPIRATING, DISPENSING and CLEANING. In Version 1.0, we still need a programmer to write a driver program and hence it is not usable by a molecular biologist.
In the planned version 2.0, we will build a nice GUI where a molecular biologist can specify what they want to do, without the need of having a programmer to write the driver program. The cost of a typical commercial liquid handling system is about $10,000. The hardware cost of this project is only about $700. We have developed the primitive functions to show that the robot works. The rest of the work is software based, and will not increase the cost of the robot, if we provide it to the user community in the form of open-sourced programs. This project also provides an open framework, where other iGEMers"

After obtaining and isolating the open/closed regulated pIV porins, we would have to test the secretion of a selection of easily detectable proteins present in the periplasm but not able to go through the second membrane of E. coli. If those proteins can be detected in the extracellular environment only in the presence of such a mutant in the right ion conditions than we achieved our goal. A new verified biobrick could be proposed as a universal aspecific regulable secretion tool.

What is C.Difficile?
A meta analysis predicted 6.3 $ billion dollars spent annually on attributable costs ofClostridium ​difficile ​infectionsMore than 250,000 people require hospitalization of this pathogen in the U.S alone.
Clostridium ​difficile ​is a major cause of healthcare associated diarrhea. Withincreasing outbreaks of hypervirulent strains worldwide due to the developmentof antibiotic resistance. Symptoms can range from dehydration and fever to toxicmegacolon and sepsis. Patients who have undergone treatment with broadspectrum antibiotics or are immunocompromised are particularly susceptible tothis pathogen because their gut flora is likely to be in a dysbiotic state.
Meaning fewer commensal bacteria are available to fend off pathogens or takeup space in the gastrointestinal tract. Increasing the likelihood of a Clostridiumdifficile ​infection. As well as certain strains being able to resist environmentalstresses such as heat, hydrogen peroxide and even ethanol. Makingcontamination much harder to control even with sterilizing techniques.
Currently treatment largely consists of using antibiotics which has the detrimentaleffect of further damaging commensal bacteria in the gut. With 1 in 5 patientsexperiencing recurrence of infection, this method of remedification is not optimaland is highly prone to increase the likelihood of bacteria developing antibioticresistance. Unsatisfied with the current efficacy of this treatment we propose anew therapy.
Bacteriophage (phage) therapy: An alternative treatment to using antibiotics thatis becoming increasingly recognized in western medicine, primarily due to drasticincrease of antibiotic resistance seen over the past few years.
Phage: Small vectors of genetic material encased in protein shells, and a tail that allowsthem to bind and transfer information between organisms. (Picture of a phage)
Phage propagate primarily via two different mechanisms:

I am responsible for the construction of metal binding peptide periplasm display module for Pb(II). This module aims at binding Pb(II) ions in the periplasmic space using the engineered anti-parallel coiled coil which is transported with the help of DsbA signal sequence. During the process several other intermediate plasmids are also constructed. Furthermore, I contribute to the characterization of Pc promoters of different intensity.

Considering the proximity of these aspects of our projects, it was only natural that we shared similar problems. For example, the correct folding of the chosen binding proteins in E. coli. As disulfide bounds are not well built in the cytoplasm and Nanobodies are possessing these when not specifically designed to avoid, we thought about utilizing a bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BIFC ) as a control for correct protein folding. While further formulating this issue in our calls (click here for our Skype protocol) it crystallized that team Freiburg could make good use of our control system, too. After all we decided to give them the two plasmids necessary for the BIFC in order to have a control.
Lethbridge
We were thrilled after realising that this year’s project from Lethbridge University was similar to our project. They also wanted to screen a library of nanobodies using a bacterial two-hybrid system. After initiating the contact we had several skype meetings ( see here for a complete skype diary ) where we exchanged ideas and talked about each other’s approaches towards the experiments. After a intensive discussion about bacterial two-hybrid systems, we realized that Lethbridge has no positive controls for their two-hybrid system. Therefore we sent them our positive controls: the HA4-Abl SH2 binding pair including the different mutants of HA4 . In this way,we hope to give iGEM Lethbridge the tools to validate their two-hybrid system.
In exchange, Lethbridge provided us with the NS1 peptide from influenza A virus. We wanted to try this peptide as a potential target for our Evobodies. Therefore we could generate Evobodies against the important pathogen"

Our interview questions fallen into three aspects as follows:
The first is about the limitations of existing methods of reducing gene expression such as gene knockout, RNAi and novel gene editing techniques. We hope that through having a clear view on what problems still exist, we can know which kind of improvements that we actually need to focus on.
Dr. Zhuo told us that all traditional methods of reducing gene expression had efficiency problems and moreover, they also yielded unknown effects.
The next one is safety issue.  Although there are few clinical applications to degrade intracellular proteins at present, there is a general trend in market demand. The main problem is that the biological complexity leads to unknown practical application. Therefore, safety is the most essential topic we need to consider about.
Considering the safety issue about our project, Dr. Zhou raised two aspects.
1.Unknown effects in vivo environment
Dr. Zhou mentioned that the purpose of protein-specific degradation technology is to degrade abnormal or overexpressed proteins. The implementation of this method in vivo must ensure that it does not introduce other problems that are adverse to the organism. It should be noted that in vitro and in vivo environment are not equivalent.
2.Excessive protein degradation
From an evolutionary point of view, it is only the amount of protein present in an organism that determines its actual function. Therefore, the degree of protein degradation on the biological effects should also be taken into account. For example, the removal of certain overexpressed proteins may affect the normal physiological activities of the organism.
Last but not least, it is about the possibility of application. We hope based on his abundant market experience, Dr. Zhou can give us more detailed suggestions about the approaches to clinical application and marketization of our project. Here are some significant answers we get.
1. What difficulties do you think our project will meet in the result transformation?
Dr. Zhou: The first thing must be considered is security issues. Also, you have to look for clinical trials of medical institutions that are willing to cooperate. What’s more, you need to pay attention to the negative or positive result of the standard.
2. During the transformation of achievements in China, the situation that the intermediate process of commercialization and industrialization of scientific and technological achievements is missing, always occurs, which is related to both universities and enterprises. Can you give some suggestions to avoid the ""blank"" area?
Dr. Zhou: Much of the reason for the ""pilot"" area actually lies in the role of government. While protecting the intellectual"

What does this data show us?
The data collected suggests that among the teams surveyed, women and LGBTQ+ people are significantly involved and welcomed in iGEM. The data also shows that iGEM participants are predominantly Caucasian, and cisgendered. In this regard, this survey shows that improvement is needed. As we must attempt to create racial diversity so Caucasian people do not have a large majority, we must also make sure that individuals feel there is a strong LGBTQ+ presence, and try to improve the amount of women of colour in our community. Additionally, while respondents indicated that they  feel respected in iGEM we should foster that feeling. Despite having a small sample size, this survey acts as a stepping stone to a further discussion of inclusivity and diversity in the iGEM community. We would also like to acknowledge that there were no indigenous peoples among respondents to our survey, we find this regretful as making space for Indigenous peoples should especially be a priority for Canadian iGEM teams.
Suggestions to improve inclusivity
Surveys are an important part of getting to know a community, particularly in the case of iGEM: a very specific community which is relatively new, but exists in a field in which gender roles and the exclusion of women, gender, minorities, and people of colour is common. But knowing the data is only part of getting to understand this complex issue and is only the first step on the road to change. We hope that every team can do their own research into the issue of inclusivity but here are some methods (that we ourselves are trying to use) to get this started.
UAlberta iGEM would also like to recognize that these suggestions are not comprehensive and are imperfect. We welcome feedback and would love to have a conversation about this topic if you are interested! Moreover with all our suggestions we do not want to treat any group as a token (meaning they are included in a superficial manner for the sake of appearing inclusive) and ask that no one treat a group or particular person this way!

Consequently, just a few large groups share the four lines of business, even at the world scale (for example AREVA, EDF, GE Energy or Mitsubishi). Suppliers, operators and customers inside the pattern are interconnected, and are quite often subsidiaries of these multinational companies. Competition is very strong because contracts are rare and huge.
Thus,sources of pressure on this field are numerous and varied. Political influence on the electronuclear field is quite important: in France, nuclear holds a paramount place, but politics can at any moment decide to favor other ways of electricity production, as in Germany (solar, wind turbines, etc.). Therefore role of public power in different countries and of international organizations (for example AIEA, ANDRA) is crucial, because those are the ones which will decide, fix rules and directives. The application of agreements against the global warming by public power (Kyoto, Copenhagen) can also impact directly and positively on the electronuclear field, this one giving out no CO2, to produce electricity. However, there are currently two main problems: the becoming of nuclear wastes (for now, stocking of wastes of low, medium and high activity), and the risk of an accident whose consequences would be disastrous for environment and population. Voted laws restrict this field to allow a permanent control, avoid accidents and protect populations. Indeed, from a social outlook, the apprehension facing this strength and the different accidents which occurred is still present (Safety) . Nevertheless, because of the increase of the price of fossil energies (petroleum, gas) and thanks to the researches on new generations of more efficient reactors, the electronuclear field keeps its competitiveness on the energy market.

Figure 1: Module 1 overview
Our first module deals with the construction of an E. coli strain, which is able to accept electrons stimulating its metabolism. We considered two different electron transfer systems: direct and indirect electron transfer .
Direct electron transfer in bacteria is a very complex and not completely cleared up so far. Because of this we focused on the indirect electron transfer via mediators , which are reduced at the electrode in a electrobiochemical reactor and then reoxidized again inside bacterial cells.  In the gram-negative bacteria E. coli there are two membranes with a periplasmatic space between them, which have to be overcome in order to achieve a successful electron transfer.
We worked on three different mediators: neutral red , bromphenol blue and Cytochromes . Additionally we constructed an electrophilic E. coli strain, which grows in the presence of electric current and therefore shows increased metabolic activity. ( Park et al., 1999 ) To realize this aim, several steps and problems in electron transfer have to be resolved. The electron transfer system consists of different steps:
First the reduced mediator has to cross the outer membrane of the E. coli cell. For that we are going to use the outer membrane porine OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) provided by"

- Today I re read through the paper about the CRISPR we have used  (http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/21/9275.long#ref-14)  We have used the same protocol as they did so the problem is not with our experimental setup.
- This means that there could be a problem with our T7 spacer. We may have chosen the wrong DNA target for the CRISPR to target, also we could have chosen a region of the genome that has mutated.
- Reading through the paper I did notice that they said that not all cells that have a CRISPR are immune, but those that do acquire their own spacers will be immune to phage infection. We would expect this to give the small colonies that grow up after the infection. Since DH5a gives these naturally we cannot test these because most of them would be from the host bacteria. We are going to test E. coli strain B and see if it produces these satellite colonies.
- Today I started a plate of strain B and an overnight culture to transform the CRISPR and T7 spacer and also test to make sure that strain B doesnt produce satellite colonies.

As a control we transformed the T7 spacer with the empty iGEM plasmid. Today I also plated E. coli B and spot tested dilutions of T7 phage out to 10e-10. Tomorrow I will be able to see if strain b gives the satellite colonies. Tomorrow I will also test the CRISPR in strain B and compare it to the empty iGEM plasm"

Emily's first experience with cloning! Ashlee led Emily through several practice experiments from designs made earlier in the year: making a gel, loading samples, gel purifying DNA. Ashlee introduced Emily to her research the previous semester. She had inserted the HMF-ABCDE pathway on the pSEVA251 KanR plasmid into P. putida and had validated its function, but was having difficulty inserting the dCas9 system into the pSEVA251 KanR HMF-ABCDE plasmid. The plasmid size would be close to 18 kb and this, among other affects, was thought to increase the difficulty of the cloning. Another hypothesis was that the dCas9 pathway did not have a strong terminator for the trans-acting RNA. Ashlee and Emily began work to insert the terminator. They performed a ligation of the pSEVA251/HMF plasmid and the terminator.
Clay and Sam worked on a program in Excel to codon optimize GFPs. Sucess. Unfortunately, program is clunky and requires a lot of user input for any optimization. Decision made to attempt the same task in MATLAB.

Team Activity Tests: It´s ECOL time! We got some new and nice fractions that we tested immediately after rebuffering in H2O, determining and adjusting the protein concentration via Bradford and incubating with 0.4 mM CuCl2. The samples we got were large tubes so that this measurement was decisive for further characterization of ECOL . Fraction 7 was our favorite (it convinced us with its high protein concentration and great enzyme activity) so that we chose that one to be our candidate for all future measurements with ECOL (see Figure 3)
Additionally we went on with the measurements of TTHL . The laccase was rebuffered, adjusted and incubated as well so that we can now tell that there are some fractions that do show activity! Check out Figure 4.
Activity measurements of different fractions of ECOL . Measurements were done via oxidized ABTS and OD420.

Bad day for us.

If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

IAP Synthetic Biology Class
Last January, students from the 2011 MIT iGEM team ran an introductory synthetic biology class to recruit students for this year's program and to spread interest in the subject.  The class was offered during MIT's storied Independent Activities Period (IAP), a four-week gap period in MIT's academic calendar.  Over two weeks, students learned biological theory and basic lab techniques, and built an inducible luciferase circuit.  Several students in the class ended up joining the 2012 iGEM team.  We plan to offer this class again next year and are currently designing the curriculum.

We participated in the first New England Regional iGEM (NEGEM) meeting at Boston University! Hosted by the BU team on September 15, 2012, the NEGEM meeting allowed four local iGEM teams – Boston University, Wellesley, Brown-Stanford, and MIT – to practice presenting our respective projects in front of an audience. Each team received valuable anonymous feedback about their project and viewed presentations from members of the other three teams. We really appreciate the opportunity to have been a part of this collaborative experience!

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Project
Overview
As a part of Policy & Practices project, we conducted a survey on people’s attitudes toward genetic engineering. The results showed that the general public does not feel familiar not only with genetic engineering but also with science. So we designed our project in order to change this for the better.
What can we do to make science more appealing to everyone? One of the solutions for us was ""to harmonize science with arts"". You may say that science is incompatible with arts. But KIT actually constitutes of science and arts majors embodying a fusion of them, as its philosophy posits “Wisdom, Beauty and Technology”. Our project fused science and arts in a KIT way. KIT has the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC) , which collects stocks of Drosophila melanogaster, an important model organism in life science research, from laboratories around the world. There are only two other such centers in the world. Inspired by this, we let Drosophila in our project with the help of E.coli and S.cerevisiae. Please enjoy living BioArt to feel science closer.
