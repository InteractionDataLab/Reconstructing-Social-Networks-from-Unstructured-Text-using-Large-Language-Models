Linkoping_Sweden,2015,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Knowledge Survey_-_-_TEXT.html,".                     Unlike what many may think food allergens are not gases that spread interminably in the air. Food                     allergens are small particles, we are talking about micrometers. Small particles settle slowly                     throughout the air. Allergens from tree nuts does not spread more than 1-2 meters. Peanuts can                     eventually spread a little bit longer. Frying and cooking as well as whipping and stirring increase                     the amount of allergens settling through the air but the air dilution is enormous and therefore a                     constant production of allergens is required to evoke severe symptoms. Someone eating peanuts from a                     bag or bowl is therefore luckily not sufficient enough.15
Stress/fear can influence an allergic reaction.
True: Experiencing allergic symptoms, such as itching and swelling of the                     throat, is uncomfortable and it is no wonder you get scared when it gets harder to breathe and it                     feels like you are going to suffocate. Fear and panic induce an allergic reaction even further,                     since the body’s stress response interacts with many of those organs and tissues affected during an                     allergic reaction.15,21
The critical symptoms of an allergic reaction are clearly visible directly after the food                     intake.
False: The first symptoms of an allergic reaction normally shows within a                     few minutes upon contact with the allergen. An allergic reaction usually culminates and reaches its                     climax within 10-30 minutes, but can under some rare circumstances be maintained for hours and days.                     However in most cases there is plenty of time to take the medications.10,15
You can experience allergic symptoms upon intake of peanuts without having true peanut allergy.
True: This phenomenon is known as a cross allergic reaction and occurs                     because proteins, including allergens, from different animals and plants resemble each other and the                     immune system is unable to tell them apart. Cross allergic reaction are especially common for those                     that have pollen allergies, which can make them hypersensitive to peanuts, tree nuts and drupes,                     such as apples, as well. Grass allergens are also known to cross react with peanuts and other                     legumes.22
Children normally outgrow their peanut allergy.
False: Peanut allergy is a chronic condition in the majority of cases,                     less than 20 % outgrow their allergy, And since the number of children affected have been more than                     doubled the last decade food allergies are indeed an increasing health issue.3,4,5,6
Common knowledge?
The final question of the “Do you know nothing or nuthings?” survey permitted the participants to                     estimate their own general knowledge about allergies"

Team:UC Davis
From 2010.igem.org
Welcome to our page!  Our team is comprised of 8 dedicated individuals: 6 undergraduates and 2 advisors. This will be the second year that iGEM @ UC Davis participates in the competition.  We are hard at work and are looking forward towards the completion of our project. Stay tuned for the upcoming results!
Characterizing and Improving Registry Part BBa_C0051: cI-Lambda, the Promoter in Disguise
This summer, we started with the goal of building a novel circuit encoding the function of spatial oscillator that would push the bounds of what had been done before, both scientifically and in the context of device complexity. Our device required the assembly of >30 individual parts and had 7 promoters - both on the very high end of what has been demonstrated in most projects. Clearly, this was ambitious and was going to test how robust the immature technologies we use in synthetic really are. We anticipated challenges and got them in spades. . . One of the most interesting, in which we invested a lot of effort tracking down, was the discovery that the commonly used part BBa_C0051 (the cI lambda phage repressor) could, in the right context have promoter activity. We have spent some time tracking the source of this activity and generated a construct that corrects this error . . .for more, click here!
Spatial Oscillation! It Makes Stripes!
Repeating patterns are an overwhelmingly common sight in nature, whether it comes in the form of a zebra's stripes or a centipede's repeated segmented body.  And although it may seem a simple task to replicate this behavior, in reality, cells that undertake transformations into specific states to express a certain phenotype undergo very complicated biological processes.  These biological processes often involve a cell to know where it is spatially (spatial awareness), and given the information it receives from the state of its environment, a cell may choose to perform one action over others.  Our iGEM project involves building a device that when implanted in a cell allows the cell to choose from one of two states given a stimulus (in our case, the absence of light), in a project we have named "" Spatial Oscillation "".

Our discussion with Mr. Cardwell gave us some great insights about what needed to occur from both a scientific and entrepreneurial perspective. He agreed that it was definitely an interesting project, and offered us resources and other contacts who could help us with this specifics of entering the biotechnology industry.
Have a proof of concept
Protect our research through the proper intellectual property channels
Be aware of the regulatory aspects and potential obstacles for the commercialization of the  ROBUST technology
Keep a reasonable expectation about the timeframe for the implementation of the bio-production pathway, and try to keep it as simple as we could
Deliberation
We laid out a pathway to commercialization in a reasonable timeframe, hoping that our proposed bio-production platform can help solve issues such as bacterial contamination while also paving the way for the next generation of biologics manufacturing.
Point 12: Visual Storytelling consultant, Jen Boyce
Rationale
As we began to put together our work so that people could view it on the 2017 UCSD iGEM wiki, we realized that there were a number of components that we had overlooked, namely the method of presenting information throughout the website. After going through nearly 200 websites from last year's competition, we set out to redefine the style of conveying information, relying on more graphic design and clearer organization of information. To get some creative ideas, we consulted Ms. Jennifer Boyce, a visual storytelling expert from Oregon.
Exploration
Because we understand that the iGEM project should be a reflection of our ideas, not someone else's, we had already laid out some ideas to discuss with Ms. Boyce. Her key advice was that at every stage during the website, we had to keep in mind our audience. Because we are presenting highly technical information, it would be important to find the balance between simplification and visual appeal. She also suggested that because most people are visual learners, we should try to find opportunities to convey information through infographics and structuring the information, both literally and figuratively.
Deliberation
From this point, we created a design philosophy for our website. We wanted to modify the existing paradigms of information giving and allow the user to control the overall experience. We also realized that we needed unique ways of conveying the different points, so we held multiple brainstorming sessions. The result is that every page on this website has a very specific purpose with clear organization of information, wrapped in a sleek design that enhances the information provided."
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Electrace_-_-_TEXT.html," that it has to somehow activate a promoter. Therefore, essentially every biosensor promoter can be coupled to the electron transport module. In this way, our system is similar to the optical outputs currently used, of which the modularity is the biggest plus.
Since our system is developed using the BioBrick standards, our system can easily be combined with existing sensing promoter BioBricks. This provides the opportunity for our system to be widely used, tested and further characterized in the iGEM competition. This will speed up the optimization of our ELECTRACE system.
The modularity of the ELECTRACE system opens up the opportunity to develop a whole range of specific products based on the ELECTRACE system. In a sense, you could compare our ELECTRACE system to the operating system of your smart phone, and different biosensors based on ELECTRACE as smart phone applications. For mobile OS, open-source development is highly successful: open-source OS Android had 78.6 percent market share in 2013 [9]. Therefore, it is a logical step to further develop the ELECTRACE system in an open-source fashion, making the “source code” (the plasmids and the device designs) available for free. As a matter of fact, since ELECTRACE is developed as an iGEM project, we are already working open-source!
Issues
Unfortunately, even with all criteria discussed above fulfilled, commercial application of the ELECTRACE system is not as easy as it seems. We have hosted a discussion with a group of policymakers at the RIVM , during which we asked them: “How do we get from a working prototype to a commercial end product?” With their specialist input, we have been able to define the most important hurdles for commercial application: safety issues arising from outside-the-lab usage, and the possible discrepancy between open-source development and commercialization.
Usage out of the lab
Making the use of microbial biosensors (and synthetic biology in general) outside a lab environment possible has been one of the main goals during the development of the ELECTRACE system. In our opinion, development of outside-the-lab applications of synthetic biology will contribute to public understanding and acceptance of synthetic biology. It should therefore be the direction in which research should focus.
Under the current Dutch legislature [10][11], it is not allowed to use GMOs outside a carefully monitored laboratory environment. This makes the application of the ELECTRACE system as we have in mind currently impossible. In our discussion with policymakers discussion with policymakers , most of the attendants agreed that this legislature needs to be reconsidered.
The underlying reason for this"

Eventually ,chief financial officer decided the company's financial plan.
Economy of the Business
Due to the genetically modified (gm) crops is unpopular, our astaxanthin is likely to extract product to sales alone, which requires the industrial model to analyze the economic plan. According to the idealized model of economics and business decision-making simulation (Based on Management and Economics Simulation Exercise, designed by Harvard), enterprise's basic  spending depends on the market (Marketing), the equipment Investment spending (Investment), research and development (R&D), these three major categories, these three spending also react on the product cost, sales. Earlier market has a big investment, so it can increase the sales quickly, reducing the cost, having the advantage in sales.But in the future, because of the problems about unfinished orders, unit profit decline and the product quality is not high.The increasing investment in research and development, may raising costs, reducing sales, and the latter will power up.
But luckly, under the existed scientific research fund's support, we have completed the most  part of the research and development, having unique advantages in technology.Through the financing, we can invest a great amout of money into the market and equipments. If we obtain 500,000 yuan at the first round of financing, we shall use 250,000 yuan for equipment investment, 250,000 yuan for the market, paying attention constantly on depreciation after, and ensure that the investment has been higher than depreciation. To control the amount of depreciation, production should be 80% of capacity (80% Capacity Utilization).
Improving equipment can improve productivity, reduce costs and market investment can promote sales. At the beginning, our price should be 1.5 times as much as the mass of production cost per unit, and then running down gradually with the decline of the cost per unit. The specific speed of decline according to the market situation, trying not to decline so fast, to avoid price rebound. What's more, we need to pay attention to the early pice, ensuring that it will not be too low and remaining the space of reduction. After two years, we are better to proceed early profit into the R&D investment, maintainning competitive.
In addition, for the modern enterprise, it's vital for us to master ourself"
Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". Fluorescence measurements were normalised for OD (600nm).
From these results we can see that in the direction of PdcmA DCM has a modulating effect of relieving DcmR repression thus DCM acts through depression. Interestingly, DCM appears to decrease sfGFP fluorescence in the absence of DcmR.   In the direction of PdcmR DCM appears to have no significant effect on the expression of sfGFP. Therefore in the native system we suggest that DCM has a modulating effect through depression of dcmA expression. Additionally DCM shows no effect on the auto regulation of dcmR expression.
In the context of our biosensor this means that DCM is capable of modulating expression of sfGFP through interaction through the PdcmA repressor DcmR.
Ultimately we can conclude that DCM acts to encourage expression of sfGFP through derepression: consistent with our double repression model.
Discussion:
The results displayed here demonstrate the repression nature of DcmR on PdcmA and PdcmR bidirectional promoter. The modulation by DCM on the PdcmA promoter we have observed offers a constructive route towards a Dichloromethane biosensor. In this way we are able to use a reporter gene downstream of PdcmA to respond to the concentration of DCM.
Additionally the nature of the bidirectional promoter offers a uniquely useful tool to molecular biologists. The relative stoichiometry of two genes inserted either side of the bidirectional promoter can be can be modulated through the addition of DcmR (BBa_K1446003 - Oxford iGEM). This can be utilised easily for investigations into the effect of protein stoichiometries between two interacting proteins.
Bioremediation
Bioremediation
For the bioremediation aspect of DCMation, we managed to achieve the following:
dcmA-sfGFP is expressed in E. coli
DCMA-sfGFP can be expressed in E.coli. E. coli cells were transformed with the construct in figure A. Once transformed, the expression of dcmA-sfGFP was induced using IPTG at various concentrations (see figure 2 and 3). It was shown that there is a basal level of expression when using this system however upon induction, there was a significant increase in the protein levels. Following this conformation that dcmA-sfGFP is expressed in E. coli, an assay that has been previously used to measure the activity of DCM dehalongenase (Kra"

Survey 2
What does survey 2 evaluate?
It evaluates the final conception and opinion about SB and the talk. It will help us know whether our talk was helpful in providing a working definition for SB to the audience.
Survey 2 is based on four questions:
What did you understand by synthetic biology?
This question is the first hit to know if Synthetic Conquest of Mexico mission has achieved the main objective. We expect differential results compared with the preliminary survey, trying to get our point to people of the concept of synthetic biology as bioengineering. This question is treated as question 1 in survey . If  the concept is far from the main idea it will be classified as other.
Select the option that best suits your vision about engineering living organisms.
Nowadays it is possible to engineer living organisms
Nowadays it is not possible to engineer living organisms
Other
For this question we expect to know if people got the reality of current synthetic biology whit available tools and techniques.
Do you think synthetic biology will change our lives in the upcoming years?
Yes, in ___ years.
No.
Once proven if the Synthetic Conquest of Mexico has put the first step in minds of students, we want to know if they feel the reality of synthetic biology tangible in their current or future life. The option to put years probably shows the impact or influence of our presentation.
Do you support the advancement of synthetic biology? Mention your opinion with positive and/or negative points.
Going deeper inside the minds of students, we try to investigate if personal, objective or maybe religious ideas, support or impede the development of Synthetic Biology in Mexico and World.  The purpose to put positive and/or negative points we now if students got the knowledge  of potential and concerns about synthetic biology.
Write down any comments you have about the lecture or topic.
Here we expect to know if they found the lecture interesting, boring, shocking, boring, etc… This question covers the performance of the lecturer and opinion about lecture.

Developing Our Project
Here at FREDsense Technologies, we focus on developing biological solutions to monitoring toxins in our environment.  Bacteria are incredibly diverse and capable of sensing and reporting on the level of a variety of environmental issues in our society.  We have harnessed the power of a genetically modified version of an environmental bacteria to be able to create a general toxin sensor to be used in the oil and gas industry.  Here we describe our commmercialization strategy to make our first Field Ready Electrochemical Detector available.
Project
The development of petroleum-related industries around the world has lead to large amounts of environmental contamination. Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge: the development of petroleum-related industries has led to large volumes of contaminated water, requiring extensive monitoring and remediation before the eventual release of this water back into the environment. Currently, methods of monitoring are either too slow, labour intensive, or inaccurately report on the toxicity of the sample. With increasing government regulation in the petroleum industry, the time for new technology is now. The 2013 Calgary Entrepreneurial team is advancing an electrochemical biosensor for petroleum-related toxins through our early venture: FREDsense. Using a unique sensing platform, our technology is faster, more quantitative, and capable of operating in environments where existing biosensors cannot. With collaborations in both industry and government"

Implications
We didn't spend all our summer inside the Centre for Bacterial and Cell Biology, we also considered our project and iGEM in a wider context.
We took time to connect to as many people as possible:
We designed a BioGame to entertain and inform young biologists about synthetic biology.
At the iGEM U.K. meet up (YSB 1.0) we gave a presentation and presented a poster about BareCillus.
At YSB 1.0 we gave a presentation about rule-based modelling and the software BioNetGen to the other U.K teams. Team Leeds went on to use BioNetGen some for their modelling.
We held an architecture and synthetic biology workshop with architecture students to explore the relationships between the two fields and how they may interact in the future.
We took time to consider and document the safety , moral and legal aspects of synthetic biology and BareCillus.
We compared the methods used in the fields of architecture and synthetic biology and explored how synthetic biology may impact on architecture.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

ETH_Zurich,2016,Team:ETH Zurich#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," EsaR's ligand.
BIOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION: CRISPR/Cas9
A similar approach for an AND gate with an irreverisble genetic switch was persued using the classic CRISPR/Cas9 system. Contrary to the CRISPR/Cpf1 system, the Cas9 endonuclease cuts the genome integrated reporter construct only once and the double strand breake (DSB) is sealed by homology directed repair. In our test system, the λ-Red system, which is necessary for recombination, is induced by a heat shock but would finally be under the same regulation as Cas9. Furthermore, the expression of mNectarine / GFP would be under control of the candidate molecule (e.g. 3-OH-C6-HSL).
SENSOR AND-GATE:
At a site of inflammation, nitric oxide activates NorR and triggers the transcription of Cas9. The transcription can only proceed if 3-OH-C6-HSL is present. The HSL makes the repressor EsaR dissociate from the regulatory element (esaBox) on the DNA and thus annihiliates its roadblock activity. The guide RNA is expressed constitutively at a high level.
LEARNING:
Once Cas9 is expressed, it is brought to the cleavage-site by the the guide RNA. There, Cas9 cuts the mNectarine gene while introducing a double strand break. The repair mechanism by the λ-Red system is - in our test system - manually induced by a heat shock which then recombines the gfp gene via the two homology arms. This way, mNectarine is removed and GFP is expressed.
REPORTER AND-GATE:
In a final system, the gfp gene would be under the control of a constitutive promoter regulated by an esaBox, the binding site of EsaR.
After the system has now learned to respond to the associated stimulus alone, the expression of GFP could easily be induced by just exposing it to the stimulus again, e.g. EsaR's ligand.
DIRECTED EVOLUTION OF EsaR
In order to change EsaR's specificity towards an IBD related HSL, we try to to apply directed evolution on this repressor protein. The variant of EsaR that we used was already an improved version with a D91G mutation that has an increased signal sensitivity compared to the wildtype 16 .A dual selection system offers a possibility to select for these variants. These systems allow for negative selection (""killing"") of variants that still react to the native H"

One of the most important things in science is its educational aspect. Therefore we aim to stay in constant contact with the public, to inform about our project. In this way we receive constant feedback which we try to directly implement into our project design. We especially want to raise awareness in young children to involve them in research and wake their passion for science early on in life. Therefore, our team member Veronika went to the Staatliche Chiemsee Realschule to present our project to young students and show them the everyday life of scientists. At this point, we already realized that even though Glyphosate is such a prominent topic in the media, the public and especially young people lack a certain, objective and scientific background. Informing the public in an objective and scientific way is one issue that we want to tackle during our project.

pKH4: 2 µl NEBuffer CutSmart, 4 µl pKH4, 13 µl H2O,  0.5 µl (KpnI, BamHI)
pRB7: 2 µl NEBuffer CutSmart, 2.3 µl pRB7, 14.7 µl H2O, 0.5 µl (KpnI, BamHI)
Digestion of pKH4 (KpnI, BamHI) and pRB7 (KpnI, BamHI). Desired bands for insert of ~3.8 kbp and backbone+sfp of ~3.9 kbp were expected. 100 V, 0.8 % Agarose, TAE
The restriction for pKH4 did not work correctly due to the fact that with assembly of pKH4 the BamHI cutting site was removed and the plasmid was only linearized by the KpnI cutting site. For pRB7 two bands at almost equal site can be expected and thereby the digestion approach can not be used in this manner. We will try again with a similar approach like for the assembly of pKH4 as here a nonsense sequence instead of the PPtases will be introduced into pRB7.
preparation of pRB7 MP by retransformation of TOP10 (as no glycerol stock is available).
Amplification of svp
The svp fragment we used so far was wrong, so we try to amplify it again from the genome, using various primers:
RB13/14
RB15/16
RB29/30
RB39/40
Gradient on biometra cycler (72 °C, 65 °C, 58 °C)
svp was always right; only after assembly it turned wrong"

Sequencing of phage DNA
This extremely rapid procedure produces template of sufficient purity for manual or automated dideoxy sequencing, without the use of phenol or chromatography.
Carry out the plaque amplification procedure described in the Phage Amplification protocol. After the first centrifugation in Step 4, transfer 500 µl of the phage-containing supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube.
Add 200 µl of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Invert several times to mix, and let stand for 10–20 minutes at room temperature.
Microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C and discard the supernatant. Phage pellet may not be visible.
Re-spin briefly. Carefully pipet away and discard any remaining supernatant.
Suspend the pellet thoroughly in 100 µl of Iodide Buffer by vigorously tapping the tube. Add 250 µl of ethanol and incubate 10–20 minutes at room temperature. Short incubation at room temperature will preferentially precipitate single-stranded phage DNA, leaving most phage protein in solution.
Spin in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and discard the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol (stored at –20°C), re-spin, discard the supernatant, and briefly dry the pellet under vacuum.
Suspend the pellet in 30 µl of TE buffer. The template can be suspended in H2O instead of TE if desired, but this is not recommended for long-term storage. In TE buffer, the phage DNA should be stable indefinitely at –20°C.
Quantitate product by using a Nanodrop.

Sequencing Guidelines
The sequence being read corresponds to the anticodon strand of the template. Write out the complementary strand and check against the top strand of the insert sequence shown in the figure below (the primers hybridize downstream of the insert). Check that the third nucleotide of each codon in the randomized region is G or T.
TAG stop codons are suppressed by glutamine in ER2738 (glnV). If the library was amplified in this strain or any glnV (also known as supE) strain, TAG should be considered a glutamine codon when translating.

Collaboration with Lanzhou
[confirming the mercury concentration]
◎ BIT-China for Lanzhou
https://2016.igem.org/Team:Lanzhou/Collaboration
This year, team Lanzhou aimed to employ the gut flora to treat the mercury pollution inside fish body. To transform the gut flora, they planned to feed the fish with genetic engineered bacteria.
Above is the gene circuit they designed, INP (Ice Nucleation Protein) is an extrinsic membrane protein of E.coli and acts as an anchor. gfp acts as a reporter gene while metal catcher can bind heavy-metal ions.
We helped them designed and operated the pre-experiment to identify the maximum concentration of mercury ions which can keep the fish alive. From literature research, we chose the following concentration: 0.3mg/L, 0.2mg/L, 0.15mg/L, 0.1mg/L, 0.05mg/L, 0.025mg/L.
Then we raised 10 fishes and measured the number at the same time in fifteen days.
At last, we found that the concentration of mercury ions should be maintained at 0.1 milligrams per liter. When the concentration is higher than this value, the fish will die. When the concentration is lower than this value, the difference will not be obvious.
◎ Lanzhou for BIT-China
On September 18th, 2016, we met and exchanged ideas with members of teams from Lanzhou by the Beijing Institute of Technology. After the meeting, we confirmed our collaboration relationship. To further extend our system, we asked them for helping us constructing one of our gene circuits.
They constructed one of our testing circuits.
The ""inhibitor"" system is very important for our project, we use the concentration of inhibitor proteins as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers, and it can trigger the downstream reaction by activating the killer gene while the plasmid concentration reduce the threshold.

5th Annual Brick-by-Brick Charity Dinner and Silent Auction
Brick-by-Brick has been hosted by the Lethbridge iGEM team since 2010 to raise awareness for local charities. Our most recent event raised $2800 for the Interfaith Food Bank Society of Lethbridge; a non-profit charitable organization that acts as a bridge between community donors and those in need. Brick-by-Brick provides the team with an opportunity to give back to the community while also sharing our work with the public.
University of Lethbridge iGEM: 10th Anniversary
This year marks the 10th year that the University of Lethbridge has participated in the iGEM competition. This is a big achievement of our team, being that we are one of the smaller Universities competing from Canada this year. Since the founding of the team in 2007, the University of Lethbridge iGEM team has pursued projects that face issues such as the byproducts in Oil sands tailing ponds and neurodegeneration in humans; now taking on ambitious and all-encompassing projects such as Next vivo. We took this year to look back at our past projects and commend our team alumni by inviting them to talk to our team about their experiences with iGEM. These members include Adam Christiansen, a collegiate member from 2015, who is currently pursuing his degree in software engineering. He has described his experience as very beneficial and his inspiration for entering his degree. He also said he still networks with team collaborators from Florida State University, a team we still have close ties with.  Whether it be the past or present, the University of Lethbridge has used synthetic biology to tackle important projects to benefit society.
University of Lethbridge Shine On Summer Festival
The opportunity to engage the public on both the high school and collegiate iGEM projects at the shine on festival was wonderful. Not only did the public seem interested in our work but also the support from the community was high. We had a great time interacting with people of all ages, teaching them about synthetic biology and the basics of our projects. The people we talked to seemed to accept our projects well considering the issues concerning genetic engineering. We took this as an opportunity to also address this problem, especially since next vivo tries to tackle this problem in both"

Overview
Microorganisms respond to environmental stress through several means for survival. This research project aims to engineer Escherichia coli cells to generate heat in response to a cold-shock. Altering a cell’s reaction to external variations prolongs its ability to survive such a shock, thereby ensuring an evolutionary advantage over other species. Studying and manipulating a prokaryote’s stress response can broaden the prospective on evolutionary mechanisms in general. This research venture will advance biological engineering by furthering current attempts at constructing and understanding complex gene networks. Applications of synthetic, thermogenerating bacteria range from the investigation of cold resistance evolution to the development of a new generation of inexpensive biosensors for environmental monitoring and contaminant detection. The experiment will focus on producing an over-expression of alternative oxidase (AOX), an enzyme associated with thermogenesis in plants. In the future, we hope to link a decrease in ambient temperature with a “huddling” cell aggregation leading to biofilm formation.
Background
The synthesis of ATP is coupled with the flow of electrons through the electron transport chain to a terminal electron acceptor, terminal oxidase via ubiquinone and cytochromes. In addition to this pathway, all higher plants contain a cyanide-resistant pathway involving an enzyme, alternative oxidase. In this route, electrons branch from the cytochrome pathway at ubiquinone (before cytochrome) and terminate with an alternative oxidase.
Unlike the free energy from the cytochrome pathway, the free energy generated by the flow of electrons from ubiquinone to alternative oxidase does not result in the generation of ATP but instead is lost as heat. Due to an increase in the alternative oxidase activity in certain plants, heat is generated (up to 20ºC above ambient) to volatilize foul-smelling attractants for insects engaged in the pollination process [1][2]. The occurrence of AOX is found in plants, as well as in many fungi and protists.
Arabidopsis thaliana is widely researched partly due to the breadth of knowledge on the plant including the completion of its genome sequence. Additionally, its AOX pathway has been extensively studied. The two major classes of AOX genes are expressed in mRNA, AOX1 and AOX2. The AOX1 gene family is stress induced and found in both monocotyledons and eudicotyledons while the"

I.3) Numerical evaluation
We have simulated the effect of arm length on free energy (low free energy implies high binding probability) using the Born salvation free model, pair van der Waals energy, and electrostatic potential, described above. However, there are some parameters that we are not sure about (Equivalent charge and Hamacker coefficient of Zinc fingers, equivalent charge and Hamacker coefficient of base pair) that depend on charge distribution of the DNA strand, which should be determined experimentally as boundary conditions. Alternatively, one could consider each base pair with independent charge.
The systems have been simulated in MATLAB.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#July2011_-_-_TEXT.html,"). We used .74 mL of chloramphenicol for a liter of LB agar and plated them directly under the flame.
To figure out what was going wrong with the P23019 plasmid, we used the Nanodrop to determine that the sample (Plate 4, well 14E) was at a concentration of 97.4 ng/microL. This result seemed to indicate that there was DNA in the sample of the plate (as opposed to just red dye without DNA).
Tuesday, 5th of July 2011
Since  we were running out of the P23019 plasmid DNA to try new PCRs, we thought it would be a good idea to transform it. We used both Lilia's and Alina's cells, adding a negative control. The incubation for chloramphenicol required a two hour recovery period in the incubator, since the antibiotic is stronger. After Tuesday's meeting, we went ahead and plated the result and let the plates incubate overnight.
Meanwhile, moving on with the Gibson assembly of the J61002 plasmid, Vincent tried to obtain the final Gibson sequence. This sequence would be used to see if PstI and SpeI would cut differently on the assembled plasmid versus the normal J61002 plasmid: we hoped this would allow us to check that Gibson had worked successfully if we ran the ligated plasmids on a gel. Ideally, the J61002 original plasmid would cut at two locations while the Gibson plasmid would only cut in a single location (the biobrick scar would make it impossible to cut at the previous cut location). On a gel, we would see a single piece of about 3000 bp for the Gibson plasmid and two bands of approximately 2200 and 700 bp respectively for the normal plasmid.
Using the plates with the four Gibson colonies, Vincent made cultures which he put in the incubator overnight.
Wednesday, 6th of July 2011
With the Gibson cultures in hand, Vincent made glycerol stocks (500 microL glycerol, 500 microL cells) and then mini-prepped the four cultures using the standard protocol. The resulting DNA plasmids were ready for enzyme ligase.
Vincent also looked at the results of the transformation of the P23019 using two different sets of competent cells and negative controls. No colonies grew, leaving us quite perplexed as to what was in the original P23019 well. Determined to find a substitute for the P23019 plasmid that would serve as"

SCU_China,2017,Team:SCU China#HP#Silver#Meetup_-_-_TEXT.html," communications, we knew what others had focused on, what they had                                         done and what they could do to help us. On the other hand, we also provided them                                         with some suggestions which might give them a hand. In poster sessions, we                                         displayed our poster and learned how to present our project better from other                                         teams, for example, some anthropomorphic images and descriptions could be used.
Fig.3
      When we introduced our project, we attracted                                         people’s attention successfully. Many people showed their interest in our                                         project in the panel session and they also gave us some good suggestions.
Fig.4
      After our presentation, Dr. Zhang (Haoqian                                         Zhang) showed his appreciation to our idea, and he also told us it was better to                                         knockout the enzymes rather than cut off the tag if we wanted to make                                         repressilators more stable.
Fig.5
      Also, we learned about other teams’                                         projects, asked them questions and gave them some suggestions.
Fig.6
      In poster session, an advior of team                                         “NUDT_China” was interested in our subproject “Melatonin”, and suggested us to                                         mix the first three enzymes with different formula in vitro to find the best                                         formula with the modeling results. And his suggestion fitted right in with our                                         design.
Fig.6
      We also talked with students from team                                         “Shanghaitech”. We exchanged our thoughts on InterLab study. One of their                                         students asked us why the fluorescence was under expectation when the                                         concentration of fluorescein was high. We told them it might be the result of                                         inner filter effect.                                         Coincidently, we found that project of team “Peking” this year has close                                         relation to repressilator, which is vital to our project. Thus, our two teams                                         had a deep communication about the design and related experiments of                                         repressilator. What’s more, after CCiC, we still stayed in contact. And once we                                         turned to them for ΔclpXP E.coli strain, they mailed it to us, which really did                                         us a great favor.                                         In CCiC, we showed our project in many ways, by speech, by poster, by                                         introduction…. And so did other teams. So that, we could learn from other teams                                         how to present our project better and make it more attractive.                                         Generally speaking, CCiC is an excellent opportunity for us to communicate with                                         other iGEMers and improve our"

At last, Professor Zhang Hongxiang from Chinese Society of Biotechnology provided us with some suggestions on research and made a speech at the closing ceremony.
In this summit, we shared our research with each other and developed a further understanding of the great importance and multiple applications of synthetic biology. Thanks to iGEM, we became close friends with each other and we would work together to improve the world with biosynthesis technology!
Public Education
Our team made several public speeches about our project in schools and at the corner of Xidan road in Beijing. Our main goal was to let the public know about synthetic biology and its various applications which could improve our living standards and environments. We also hoped to provide an idea, which was to use new technology to improve the world we are living in, to the public and let them pay more attention to the relationship between diseases from mosquitoes and public health. Moreover, we were sincerely expecting more people to join us so we could work together to make the world a better place with biosynthesis technology.

Human Health Impact
Experiment
Since we already determined the topic of our project, the next step was to design our genetic circuit and did experiments. We first made a field trip to Tsinghua and Peking Universities in order to consult instructors and students from former iGEM teams. Besides, after we finished designing our circuit and most of our experiments in laboratories, we made an outdoor experiment to test the effectiveness of our citronellol.

Basic Parts
Several basic parts are constructed during the summer and we contributed to the iGEM Registry with one of the most important coding sequence in our project, which is ready to be used in most of cyanobacterial species.
• Protein Coding sequence, desA
desA is a protein coding sequence, which translated and expressed in Synenochococcus elongatus PCC 6803 only by cold induction (temperature-regulated). It is also predicted that the expression of this cold-induced gene is regulated by its membrane fluidity. As temperature is decreasing, the membrane will be less fluid and signal the expression of desaturase enzyme to increase the concentration of unsaturated fatty acid thus counterparts the effect.

The final layer is the web application written in Flask, with jQuery on the client side for AJAX calls (to submit forms, and keep track of users in the queue). The queue is kept in a Redis database. The application is served by the CherryPy web server. The automatic twitter posting, from the web app, is managed by python-twitter. All scheduled events (tweeting, clearing the queue of inactive users) is managed by kronos.
Video is streamed through EPFL's Flash streaming server. The video is transcoded live by Flash Media Encoder on a Mac Pro, to which the webcam microscope is connected.
Older plans and origin of the name
The culmination of our system was initially to be an on-chip ""Tamagotchi"":  the goal of the game is to take care of a C. Elegans larva living on the chip, feeding him with bacteria every now and then, and watch him grow into an  adult. If you didn't feed him, he would go into dauer stage or, worse, die. This game idea was abandoned shortly before the regional wiki freeze for two reasons: the worms are very hard to see under our cheap microscope, and they do not thrive in our kind of microfluidic chip. Instead, we used the setup as an educational tool, to demo microfluidics. The name stuck, though.
The tamagotchi chip has higher channels than the MITOMI chips, to make space for the worm. It is designed with a cavernous main lounge (by nematode standards), with two adjacent dining rooms (or feeding chambers), to allow feeding of the worm with slightly different foods, to observe its preference.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," transporter sequences of VL3 strain were available online, but there were two nucleotides in the sequence that were not determined. The first one (nucleotide 475) was marked with M, meaning that it could be either adenine (A) or cytosine (C), and the other one (nucleotide 1126) with Y, meaning that it was either tyrosine (T) or cytosine (C). For the first nucleotide, the different bases would result in a changed amino acid at position 159 -  either a leucine or isoleucine. We decided to test both transporter variants. For the second unclear base, replacing Y with T would have produced a premature stop codon at the place of amino acid 376. Because of this, we chose C, which resulted in having glutamine as amino acid 376. After this reasoning we had two different transporter variants. The following figure 6 presents the possible options we had.
Figure 6. There were two unknown bases in the sequence of QDR2 transporter of VL3. Our plan was to test all options, except the one leading to a premature end of transcription.
We planned to replace the transporter directly in our S. cerevisiae lab strain’s genome with homologous recombination. To be able to detect the correct expression of the transporter replacement in the eventuality that functional testing with response to MC wouldn’t produce clear enough results, we also designed constructs with strep-tag markers on both termini and a construct with a mCherry red fluorescent protein tag on the C-terminus. All designed QDR2 variants are presented in figure 7.
Figure 7. All designed variants of the QDR2 transporter from VL3.
All inserts were designed to be amplified in the pUG6 plasmid backbone, which is commonly used to generate deletion cassettes to be used in yeast homologous recombination (Güldener et al., 1996). The pUG6 backbone contains ampicillin resistance for amplification in E. coli , and a KanMX resistance cassette for antibiotic selection in yeast, flanked by loxP sites to enable recovery of the selection marker after selection. The inserts were designed to be compatible with either Gibson assembly or yeast recombination with a linearized pUG6 plasmid backbone. The disruption cassette for genome integration can then be generated from the assembled transporter-pUG6 plasmid via PCR. The PCR is designed to generate a linear fragment containing both the transporter, the KanMX selection marker, and 50 bp long regions"

Yi WU
Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

Awesome at regular performance in complex biological systems. Majorly deals with ocean of numbers this year. Concentrates on modally and numerical analysis, take a bit of contribution on the design of hardware.
Away from the computer screen, favorites are songs and joggings. Likes traveling and eating special local foods. Fan of sci-fic movies and tech. product.
Yuqing LEI
Tomorcolumn is another day.
Yuqing is a sophomore majoring in biology at UCAS.
The year just passed witnessed the vigorous gcolumnth of her, which was due to the learning and working experience with iGEM team members.
While she used to be quiet and nervous, experience in iGEM really changed her a lot. Now, she has been more outgoing and warm-hearted, and never afraid to face challenges and difficulties.
She still enjoys reading and traveling alone, but becomes more open to new friends and new ideas.

TU Delft's Policy & Practices Research
This year, the 2016 TU Delft iGEM team began a research initiative focused on iGEM’s influence on science, education, and policy. To start, they developed a survey about the 2015 competition and asked other teams to report on their 2015 experiences as a contribution to their research. We gladly participated in this collaboration.
Collaboration with Team Exeter:
Contributing Podcasts
This year, Team Exeter came up with the great idea to produce a podcast series. In the series, entitled ""Desert Island...Science?"" Exeter students interview pioneering researchers whose work is relevant to synthetic biology. The series targets a wide audience, and it aims to inform and inspire those unfamiliar with synthetic biology.  Our team independently decided to conduct video interviews with like figures, and we planned to post these interviews on YouTube.  Ultimately, we decided to pool resources with Team Exeter and help them develop more material for their Soundcloud channel. We have converted our interviews into podcast format and are uploading them to Soundcloud. As a result, our interviews will reach a broader international audience, and the channel will represent international perspectives.

5.Introduce our project to professors and students in our university.
During winter vacation, we had a brainstorming and our idea was settled during April. To make iGEM and our project known in our university, we made a presentation to introduce our project to who are interested in our project, including professors and students.
Last year, OUC-China iGEM Team got a bronze medal in Asia Jamboree. It attracted many students to learn about synthetic biology and iGEM. Many students are curious about synthetic biology and its concept. As iGEMers, we wanted to use an example to explain iGEM and synthetic biology. Since we have our own idea and needed a test, we made a presentation to introduce iGEM and our idea to others.
Describe our project to others
Lecture of iGEM in OUC
In April, we have the honor to meet with Haoqian Zhang and Shuobing Chen, the former and current iGEM team leader of Peking University respectively. We displayed multitude of brainstormed ideas in the last winter vacation and make a deep discussion with them. Through this process, we further understood the core thinking pattern and application of synthetic biology. They are very kind and ready to help us along with the coming 2012 iGEM competition. Here we express our sincere appreciations to Peking iGEM team. Finally, we invited them to perform a presentation named ‘research-driven education’ which embodied their brand-new concepts on the relation between education and scientific research. Besides, they displayed their team’s work from 2007-2011 and the joy and sorrow along the inheriting process. We not only expanded our knowledge from their lectures, but deeply recognized our responsibility to inherit and spread the edge-cutting knowledge as well as concepts to those ready to achieve their goals in scientific research. We’re ready to assume the responsibility to impel the education reform. Are you ready?

Reduced growth at 30°C likely due to decreased efficiency of MG1655 ethylene glycol break down enzymes. These enzymes (see UC Davis 2012) are endogenously expressed and detoxify Ethylene Glycol.
Bioplastic production ▼
E.coli MG1655 containing the PhaCAB construct Part:BBa_K934001 [83] accumulates the bioplastic P3HB inside its cells. P3HB can be visualised through staining with Nile Red, which fluoresces strongly in a hydrophobic environment, such as when it binds to the P3HB. However staining will be much lower in cells where P3HB is not present. To see whether P3HB was being produced we grew E.coli containing the phaCAB operon under the native promoter from Ralstonia eutropha. This produced the results we hoped for as seen in the image below.
The P3HB production model indicated that upregulating atoB would lead to an increase in bioplastic production. We changed the promoter before the phaCAB operon to the strong promoter J23104 and a hybrid promoter we created.
The Nile Red plates also provide a preliminary way in which to investigate the effect of changing the promoter to a stronger version. The darker staining of the streaks of the constitutive and hybrid promoter containing constructs suggests the production of higher levels of P3HB in these strains.
E.coli transformed with the phaCAB operon(native, hybrid and constitutive are different promoters expressing the operon) fluoresce when grown on LB-Agar plates with Nile Red stain. The P3HB produced  within them is stained. Those without the operon do not(EV- transformed with empty pSB1C3). When the promoter is changed from the native form to the hybrid or constitutive J23104 then the fluorescence is more intense, indicating increased P3HB production.
We imaged the cells using the fluorescent microscope to qualitatively understand how much P3HB is produced per cell. As indicated by other authors(1), we saw that P3HB is found in localised granules within the bacteria. Empty vector containing cells show little fluorescence. In those that do, the staining is qualitatively different than in the phaCAB containing strains. Nile Red is also used as a lipid stain and"

Specifically, colonies 1 and 3-6 all appear to contain an insert of the correct size (about 800bp). Those select colonies were sequenced then used for subsequent transformation and protein expression.
Protein Expression
The circAFP construct was expressed using IPTG induction and allowed to splice in vivo. Induction of circAFP occurred at 23oC, which allowed for sufficient intein splicing to occur, generating our circularized AFP (Figure 3). As described by Zettler et al., the Npu dnaE intein splicing activity is extremely high and can occur within 6-37oC4. *Wild-type Type III AFP is known to be about 8 kDa. Any discrepancies in the ladders shown on protein gels is due to the composition of the SDS-PAGE gel itself; gels run used Tris-Tricine as a major component, which can cause skewing of the ladder sizes.
Figure 3. SDS-PAGE of unpurified cell lysate components for both wild-type (WT) and circular AFP: supernatant (sup), pellet, and total cell lysate (TCL). First three columns show the WT AFP, and last three columns show the circAFP. Although the circAFP contains several additional amino acids, it appears to have run further down the gel. Similar results were visualized by the Heidelberg iGEM team in 2014. Cyclized proteins run further than their linear counterparts because of their more compact shape; this allows for the protein to travel through the gel much faster.
The protein was then purified using size exclusion. This technique was chosen because of the circAFP’s relatively small size (about 8 kDa). Column fractions were chosen and run on an SDS-PAGE to visualize the purified protein (Figure 4). Next steps were to attempt ice-affinity purification(IAP) of the circularized AFP, as shown in Figure 5. IAP uses the knowledge that AFPs and other ice-binding proteins attach themselves to ice, which creates an effective method of isolating these proteins from other cell compounds. IAP also verifies that our circAFP is in fact active despite our modifications.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," “fitness” is not focusing on building bulky muscles but living a healthier life. We were confused by the time we heard this statement, thinking that it might not be what we had expected.
However, after about two hours of explanation, it dawned on us that what he said was all about one core concept:  excess is just as bad as deficiency. Training excessively is damage, while no exercise is unhealthy as well; too much intake of sugar is harmful, while too little sugar consumption is even more dangerous.
Similar to what Dr.Wu had told us, knowing how to adjust one’s own physiological stage and managing a balanced diet is the only way to live a healthy life. How wise it is. Perhaps this is the kind of thing we won’t be able to learn from the coach who’s pro in developing six pack abs. In the end of the discussion, he even taught us a breathing method used in training which helps regulate our breathing. To be honest, we had a special experience after today’s visit.
In sum, this interview has surprised us - even ordinary things such as breathing has variations, but also let us learn a lot about regulating daily nutritions. Before finishing, he also suggested us to consult to the nutritionist, assuming that we might receive a different response. However, the two experts made similar proposals in the end, showing us the part our work needs to improve.
We summarized our project to the fitness instructor. He told us about his work. He has his own workshop, where he focuses on designing lessons, trying ways to stimulate advances in physical function, such as improving the ability of impairment. He said that what he does is absolutely different from those who conduct training for the purpose of body strengthening. 
We: Can we say that, this is similar to what we call OT (occupational therapy)?               Coach: Probably yes. But, I am just a coach for assistant purpose.
We: Will you recommend any kind of health supplements to your clients?
Coach: No. Due to the differences of individual needs, I think it is more appropriate that doctors do something like that instead of me. But, I can give them advices on what efficacy they may need for their supplements. 
We: Any examples?
Coach: Sure. Let me take weight losing. It’s easy to understand that if a person want to lose weight, the amount of calorie he consume must exceed the amount he take in. So, in the initial phase, calorie consumption is what we focus on. As long as he get used to the diet, we started to focus on the nutrients in food."

Talking Life in 150 words
Do you speak to your bacteria? We do. We have designed, constructed and characterized an inter-specific translator based on light pulses that allows to literally dialogue with microorganisms. We have built seven biobricks with fluorescent proteins under the control of environmentally-sensitive promoters. The process is as follows: human voice messages are electronically- and then light-encoded in excitation wavelengths, and microbial proteins’ emission wavelengths are electronically- and voice-encoded back. We have used this system to find out the fermentative status of budding yeast and to dialogue with E. coli allowing it to answer questions such as “are you hungry?” The three pillars of our project (human practices, modeling and wetlab) yielded continuous feedback with each other, illustrating an integrated interdisciplinary approach. For example, in human practices, we qualitatively discussed the possibility of cheater mutant (“liers”), which was quantitatively supported by our results in both our modeling simulations and in the wetlab.

(b) Hazards to Human Health
(i) Hazards associated with the recipient organism (e.g. bacterial host or viral vector, animal, plant etc) Factors to consider include whether the recipient microorganism is listed in ACDP hazard groups 2, 3 or 4. Other relevant factors may be the microorganism’s mode of transmission, disease symptoms, host range, and tissue tropism as well as an indication as to whether vaccines or chemotherapeutic agents are available. Information should also be provided on any disabling mutations and whether there is any possibility of any disabling mutations being complemented or reverting. If an animal or plant, are these organisms inherently dangerous (e.g. toxic plants, production of allergens etc)
Escherichia coli DH5 (a K12 derivative) is recognized as being unable to colonize humans and is disabled with respect to growth outside the laboratory.  It is considered to be ACDP a Category 1 pathogen and thus unlikely to cause harm to human health.  The cells have limited survivability in the environment and often have auxtrophic reqirements which are unlikely to be satisfied outside the laboratory.

Depending on how far off the output is from the end of the tube, sample volume inaccuracies are introduced that propagate throughout the run. To reduce this error, TERRA currently requires the user to start the system once the TERRA Adapter chip has stabilized. TERRA then calculates the time necessary for the output nozzle to be filled by the output based on the given flow rate.
Plate Security
If the plate support is close to the Y-axis, the plate may jostle, resulting in sample volumes not entering selected well. Close proximity between the plate support and the Y-axis coupled with sudden movement at the start of homing creates a slight ramming effect, jostling the plate. To fix issues relating to plate security, TERRA automatically sends the plate support to the upper left corner at the end of the run to distance it away from the Y-axis. In addition to fixing plate jostling, moving the plate reader to the upper left corner acts as a loading location so that the user can easily access their well plate."

Discussion
I
The definition of genetic heredity and its features are known to almost everyone. However they are usually not knowledgeable on heredity at the population level and how this contributes to biodiversity. A possible cause is the current biology curriculum in high schools in Japan. For example they teach concentrating on a limited number of generations and with an emphasis on population genetics using equations. Then students learn the calculation without deep understanding. And it must be difficult to understand such phenomena for people who had not studied biology.

Many people said that they would take the medicine produced by genetically modified bacteria described in question 3. However three quarters of the people said that they would"

Description
Construct Model
Building off of a rapamycin induced split-luciferase system characterized by the 2015 Peking iGEM team, our construct consists of a promoter reporter system that looks at two downstream products, c-Myc and COX-2 (Peking iGEM Team 2015, 2015). These products are assembled into a construct composed of fusion proteins as well as split luciferase fragments (COX-2 - FRB - nLuc and c-Myc - FKBP - cLuc). In the presence of rapamycin, the interacting protein partners dimerize and subsequently cause luciferase to activate. In order to test this model, we created vectors of our constructs and inserted them into E. coli cells.
Figure 1
Our gene production construct is modeled to produce COX-2 and c-Myc, which we used to simulate conditions in human bodies when these proteins are overproduced, in the case of CRC. The construct consists of an Anderson promoter, a ribosomal binding site, a COX-2 gene/c-Myc gene, and a terminator.
Figure 2
Our promoter-reporter construct is built so that only when there is both COX-2 and c-Myc will the binding sites be able to come together and glow with the addition of rapamycin. The construct built to bind with COX-2 consists of a COX-2 promoter, FRB, n-Luc, and terminator. The construct built to bind with c-Myc consists of a c-Myc promoter, FKBP, c-Luc, and terminator.
Figure 3
Our promoter-reporter system consists of two separate constructs each with a gene-specific promoter attached to a non-specific binding site fused to a domain of split luciferase. One construct consists of a COX-2 promoter, a FRB domain, and n-Luc, and the other consists of a c-Myc promoter, a FKBP domain, and c-Luc. The split system is built so that only when the presence of both COX-2 and c-Myc is detected will the binding sites be able to come together with the addition of rapamycin and cause glowing.
Figure 4
In solution, our two gene constructs are able to simulate the conditions in the human body by producing proteins COX-2 and c-Myc. These proteins then interact with the promoter-reporter constructs"
OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". For the conference preparation, We were responsible for contacting each team, sending a questionnaire to them and investigating the commands of each team for the meeting. Then we organized and summarized all information of 62 teams. At each key time, we reminded each team to submit project summary, team logo and then sorted out according to the track. As an old team, OUC-China actively participated in After iGEM activities and shared our team heritage and experience with other teams.
As a part of the joint iGEM session, OUC-China joined the CCiC Executive Committee and worked with the members of the Executive Committee, organizers, sponsors to plan the conference and contribute to the CCiC heritage.

1. Introduction
""How do fundamental research results be transformed into applications that benefit human?"" ""How do you apply social feedback to a project?"" ""How do you turn an obscure basic research into an easy-to-understand form?"" There are many questions waiting to be solved by OUC-China.
Through communication, we found that many other teams were also confused by these problems. In order to transform the basic research results into the practical applications, we communicated with many stakeholders, visited related biotech companies, and asked professors in related fields. Soon, an inspiration came into our mind, and we created a game based on our project in order to popularize the biology science to more people.
In the process of spreading our project, it is difficult for many amateurish people to understand these principles, especially when we mentioned some biological terms, such as ""CRISPR"". With the help of our game and the game brochure, the obscure principle became vivid and interesting to them, which was really a good feedback for us. Apart from that, we teamed up with five other iGEM teams to set up a Basic Research Results Transformation Team, in order to jointly research on local biotech companies and explore a fixed pattern for the basic research transformation, hoping to give a reference to the future iGEM teams. In fact, we have done a lot of work about education and public engagement based on our project, such as our game, biotech companies research report and so on, which is a part of our human practice.

arabinose induction time: 5000-5120[sec], 15000-15120[sec], IPTG induction time: t > 22500[sec]
The unit of vertical axis is [nM], and that of the horizontal axis is [sec]. We can see GFP expression only after 2nd-induction and rapid degradation of sigma after IPTG induction. These mean that the counter shows collect behavior theoretically.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is an examination of output value changing when a certain parameter changes.
By conducting sensitivity analysis, we could know how each parameter affects the system. Results of some specific parameters are shown below. The parameters we changed are shown in Horizontal axis. The vertical axis is the ratio of GFP that is expressed in the first induction to GFP expressed over the entire experiment. When we changed one parameter, the other parameters were fixed.

Comparing Fig.2 with Fig.3,  Kσ seems to have less influence on the system than the pulse length of the arabinose induction. From Fig.4, Vσ shouldn't be so large or so small to minimize the leak_GFP/GFP.
Stochastic Model
Formulation of the Model
If there are a lot of molecules, modeling usually uses ordinary differential equations, but some in vivo reactions involve only a few molecules. For example, transcription involves the cell's genomic DNA which is one copy or plasmids which are about 200 copies [7][8] in a cell of Escherichia coli. The average size of a cell of E. coli is about 1.0× 10-15[L][15], so the concentration of DNA is about 1.7[nM] and the concentration of plasmids is about 200 times of it. This is obviously weak. Reactions like this are well affected by fluctuations due to the reactants's limited copy numbers. So, we need to take this"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Our large-scale ambition is to substantiate and help facilitate space exploration and colonization. Towards this end it was necessary to seriously consider practical circumstances and their influence on the makings of our project.
Our first step was to investigate the legislation concerning intellectual property, and the next to consider the modularity and its application. All such endeavours are described. Lastly, we addressed the extremely necessary matter of ideological and ethical facets of space exploration. All of it can be seen here .

Collaboration
NYC Wetware
Throughout the summer we connected with other iGEM teams interested in radiation-related projects. The NYC Wetware team in particular was studying the effects of genes cloned from the organism Deinococcus radiodurans on radiation resistance in E.coli. We were given the honor of helping them characterize one of their strains TS TR, a strain capable of producing the molecule trypanothione.
Using the gamma facilities provided by the Radiation Science and Engineering Center at Penn state we were able to carry out tests of gamma irradiation of their strain and subsequently measure cell viability.
Aliquots of culture (5ml each) inoculated with the TS TR strain were added to tubes which were irradiated by a cobalt-60 gamma source at a dose rate of 25 gys/min for total doses ranging from 0-800 gys. After irradiation 0.02 ml of the irradiated sample was inoculated into 5 ml of SOB media. The OD600 was measured 12 hours later. The results are shown below.
Sevilla iGEM Team
We were also fortunate enough to have one of our team members, Lauren Rossi, visit the Sevilla 2011 iGEM team while traveling in Spain. She was able to meet the team, swap lab tips, techniques, and gossip, and even got a few members of their team to give interviews for our human practices video Check out their contributions and more on our human practices page!

Nanjing_China_Bio,2012,Team:Nanjing China Bio#notbook_-_-_TEXT.html," Jiren continued on the presentation on the team of Slovenia 2008, whose topic based on the biosynthesis of Helicobacter Pylori (HP).  Their team had novel ideas on their BioBricks, resulting in their well reputation.  Following was related introduction on the new idea of BioBricks by Jingwei.  In a word, BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences consisting of a cleavage site and a specific function sequence.  (BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and function; they share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells to construct new biological systems.)  As all our members are the first time to get in touch with this conception, it caused heated discussion about the main structure and the process of constructing and composition of BioBricks.
Later, An gave a detailed introduction on primer design, combining his own experience in the laboratory.  In addition, he pointed out some problems when using those two Endonucleases, which would be of great help in the experiments following.
Based on this background knowledge, we portrayed the blueprint of our research ideas.  Our goal was to improve the Salmonella we have.  In other words, besides keeping its advantage of having anticancer effect, we want to diminish the damage it would cause to normal cells and increase its specifity significantly.  In addition, we aim to make Salmonella a universal element that could be inserted into other bacterial cells.
Guided by the idea above, we decided to divide our work based on several parts: the invasion mechanism of Salmonella, immune mechanism, and chemical reaction mechanism.  We hope that after comprehending the basic knowledge, we could come up with our own unique ideas.
5.29(all)
Today, we had a deep discussion with our lead teacher, Pro. Zichun Hua.  He advised us to adjust the way of reading documents.  We decided to divide  our team into 5 groups focusing separately on the following aspects based on the review Engineering the Perfect (bacterial) Cancer Therapy: specific bacterial targeting of tumors, intratumoral penetration, native bacterial cytotoxicity, expression of anti-cancer agents, and gene-triggering strategies detection of bacterial therapies.  Each group has two students to work together on researching on the related documents on that specific project, and show the others their conclusion and comprehension.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#Other assembly systems_-_-_TEXT.html," phage genome attP sites are found, and on the host bacterial genome attB sites are found. After recombination the att sites, hybrid sequences contain sequence from both the phage and the host att site and are then called attL and attR (5). Gateway cloning enables the assembly of multiple DNA fragments. Taking advantage of the site-specific clonase enzymes and the att sites, the problems with conventional cloning method are avoided, which use restriction enzymes and ligase (6).
The way it's done
In the Gateway technology four different recombination sites attB, attP, attL and attR are utilized (4). attB sites always recombine with attP sites in a reaction mediated by the BP clonase, and attL-sites recombine with attR-sites mediated by LR clonase. Furthermore, attB1 reacts only with attP1 and not attP2, thereby maintaining the orientation of the transferred DNA fragment and the reading frame (5). In the Gateway® cloning system the final plasmid is obtained through two steps of cloning.  Through PCR amplification with primers flanked with attB BioBricks for the first recombination, the BP reaction. First PCR fragments with the appropriate att sites and orientation has to be constructed as shown in the figure below.
The Gateway Assembly can assemble up to 4 DNA fragments into one vector. The Gateway assembly is executed in the same way whether you join two or four DNA fragments. Depending on the number of fragments specific att sites are attached, always starting with attB1 and ending with attB2 (4) .
Difference between Plug'n Play assembly and Gateway assembly
The gateway assembly relies on a kit from Invitrogen. Furthermore, different entry clones and destination vectors are often needed and requires that a big library is established first. Furthermore, the biggest difference between the two assembly systems are the speed. The Gateway assembly takes longer time, because it relies on two cloning and transformation steps, before the final plasmid is obtained. Thus, the Gateway Assembly is far more complex than Plug 'n’ Play.
In fusion
In-fusion assembly is a method for assembling of two or more parts, provided by Clontech. The assembly system can be semi-standardized by simple primer design rules, minimizing the time used on planning the assembly reactions.
The way it's done
The PCR fragments are assembled with the use of at least 15bp homology on both ends. The forward primer of the first PCR fragment must be homologues to the reverse primer of the second PCR fragment and so forth. The assembly"

We are collaborating with the University of Lethbridge Collegiate Team for the 7th year in a row. The collegiate team members have assisted our project by providing us with mentorship and assistance in the lab. It was easy for us to collaborate with them as both our projects contain protein capsids from viruses, and therefore we were able to help each other design these constructs. We were also able to have connection to collegiate team members who have had previous experience with tailings ponds in their past iGEM projects, which helped our project greatly. Sydnee Calhoun, Chris Isaac, Luke Saville, and Kristi Turton, members of the collegiate team, were advisors for our team and provided valuable assistance and help for our project."
