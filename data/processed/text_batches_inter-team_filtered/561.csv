We conducted the PCR of pr-1 pr-2, pr-8, ct-4 and Terminator. Pr-2, pr-8 and ct-4 showed the clear and right band on the agarose gel, while pr-1, pr-9 and Terminator didn’t show any band. Then we recycled the gel of pr-2, pr-8 and ct-4. The vector of pSB1C3 was cut by speI. We introduced pr-2, pr-8 and ct-4 into the Top 10 F’ and DH10B.

We selected the clone that we introduced into the cell, only ct-4 showed the band. The clone of ct-4 was sent to sequencing to see if the sequence is right. PCR of pr-1, pr-9 and Terminator was conducted again as well as tj-9 and this time they all showed the right band on the agarose gel. The pr-1, pr-2, pr-8, pr-9 and Terminator was recycled and introduced into Top 10 F’ and DH10B.

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#HumanPractice#Review_-_-_TEXT.html,". As a burgeoning field of study, synthetic biology not only asks for wild imaginations but also active and motivated new participants, this ternary human practice project includes both and more.
British Columbia 2011
Can flying a balloon help with the spread of synthetic biology? Sounds weird. But what if this is done in front of the camera of BBC? In their endeavor to broaden the impact of synthetic biology, the iGEMers of Brown-Stanford 2011 took it to the next level: BBC interviews and Maker Faire NYC. This is sure something big.
Brown-Stanford 2011
Some team may complain about a lack of opportunities for them to arrange activities like those mentioned just now. Don’t worry, investigation and survey can also win attention! For those teams more focusing on investigations rather than outreaching activities, this project could be of great inspiration.
NYC Wetware 2011
How to present your human practice projects? And to what extent should our concern extend?
For the 1st question: film it! For the 2nd question: how synthetic biology could help with the most serious problems of human. Go visit the wiki of imperial college London 2010 to find more!

5 Meritorious Projects: Presentation
How should incorporate the work of modeling into the whole story? Imperial College London 2010 has a solution. Their presentation is a wonderful combination of wet and dry lab in the presentation.
And a piece of video of suitable timing can convey different information in a different way.
Imperial College London 2010
As for the presentation of the same college, but in the year of 2011, they have other advantages. Pellucid logic with inviting skills of introducing a project from its origin to its achievement, from problem faced to their solutions.
They have presented a perfect example of clothing on stage, relative to their subject..
Imperial College London 2011
What if each module contains rather professional knowledge that makes it difficult to be accomplished by one or two narrators?
The presentation of Cambridge team of 2009 would be an example to illustrate interdisciplinary cooperation and division
Cambridge 2009
Again, aesthetics also matters in your slides! Wondering about how to match colors and set a suitable background? Here we see reasonable color matching of slides (black background is always the best choice for projects about light), and so much enthusiasm and team work in this very presentation.

Greg Albano - Team Lead
Biological Engineering '19
Greg is very much like a tree. Not in the sense that he's the strong silent type, but more in the sense that he's tall and has the personality of a tree.   Talking to Greg, it becomes clear that he knows a lot about biology- specifically a lot about what it's like being a tree.  Greg's dad is an apple farmer, which means he plants trees. In a way, you could say that Greg has more than just the two human siblings he has. He also has hundreds of fellow trees.  As iGEM moves forward trying to grow better plants, Greg moves forward trying to be a better tree. Truly leading his fellow vegetables by example.
Fion Chu - Co-Wet Lab Lead
Human Biology, Health, and Society '19
They say the smallest people are the angriest because their anger is most concentrated. Coming in at 5.01 feet tall, Fion's voice carries all the way to Ashwin's ears on his towering 6'3"" figure, but her arm isn't long enough for her hand to slap his face. When she's not busy arguing about Koko's or defending herself from compressed air, she studies for the MCAT because she's an aspiring pediatrician or anesthesiologist. While she does do research and is a human biology health and society major, she would much rather slurp away on spicy ramen and rice cakes.
Carol Hung - Co-Wet Lab Lead
Biomedical Engineering '19
Carol. She flew all the way from California after hearing about Cornell iGEM to join us. Not only she is our aspiring co-wet lab lead, she also casually spikes her volleyball at people so be aware! But don't worry, all it takes is a happy netflixing session to get our happy, gleaming, cheerful, fun Carol back (and of course, good snacks). Outside of iG"

Further applications for the NAD+ bioassay
The reviewed molecular beacon based NAD+ bioassay can be applied to biochemical and biomedical studies ( Tang et al., 2011 ). Accordingly, it can be utilized to detect NAD+/NADH-dependent enzymatic processes. The low limit of detection, its reliability and manageability provides a practical alternative to present colorimetric, fluorometric, chemiluminescent, electrochemical or mass spectrometric methods detecting NAD+ or NADH. In context of clinical applications and therapeutics the NAD+ bioassay can be useful to monitor cellular NAD+ levels during treatments of tissues or cell cultures for identification of drug targets, for instance. It may also be applied in the field of diagnostics. Finally, the principle of the proposed NAD+ bioassay can be used for cell-free optical biosensors by taking molecular beacons either immobilized on the sensor surface or being present in the reaction medium ( Tang et al., 2011 ).

Expression mnt-penl
To verify the correct assembly of the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , the part was sequenced using the iGEM primer VF2 and a self designed reverse primer , located in the ho1 gene of the photocontrol device. Through this, it was discovered that a plasmid fragment coinciding with the length of the promoter and the BioBrick prefix, had been removed from the plasmid, as illustrated on Figure 1.
Figure 1. A fragment containing the strong constitutive promoter and the BioBrick prefix with the EcoRI (E) and XbaI (X) restriction sites had been removed from the plasmid containing the photocontrol device.
The original sequencing data can be found here In the light of this finding, it was investigated whether the Mnt-regulated or PenI-regulated promoter was suitable to control the expression of the photocontrol device.

Transposon Hotspot
During the cloning of GFP, BBa_I13504 under control of the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 , it was observed that the part yielded three bands when digested with EcoRI and PstI, see Figure 1. One band was observed at 2000 bp, corresponding to the pSB1C3 backbone, one band at around 950 bp, correlating with the expected length for the part, and a third band with a length around 1200 bp.
Figure 1. Agarose gel showing the digestion of the composite part by EcoRI and PstI. Three bands where observed. The bands at 2000 bp and 950 bp corresponded to the backbone and inserted part respectively. The third band at 1200 bp was unexpected.
To ascertain the reason for the band with the unaccountable length, the part was sequenced using the iGEM primers VF2 and VR. The sequencing revealed a repeated sequence inserted between the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and the GFP reporter, encoding a transposable element. The cloning was repeated, with a similar result. Given that a similar part , differing only in the RBS sequence, had been successfully assembled and tested before by the Kyoto iGEM team from 2010 . It was hypothesised, that this particular assembly could cause the formation of a transposon hotspot.

Batch Purification, continued
We continue troubleshooting our batch purification protocol, this time trying it out on another sample of lysate. We did notice that yesterday, when we first diluted our lysate in 1X Binding buffer in a 1:1 volume ratio, coagulation and precipitation appeared. As the contents of the tube came closer to room temperature, coagulation and precipitation lessened, but still present. We suspect that the lysate sample used yesterday had excess contaminants that led to this unexpected precipitation. Today, when diluting our lysate sample in 1X Binding buffer, again in a 1:1 volume ratio, the solution became a bit cloudy, but no evidence of precipitation or coagulation. We interpreted this as a good sign and continued on with our purification protocol.
Modification to Protocol : Instead of centrifugation after adding the Elution Buffer (250 mM Imidazole), we used gravity filtration to filter out the solvated Tamura proteins from the resin pellets. After checking this filtrate under a UV box, it glowed green, verifying the presence of solvated Tamura.

3) Outstanding water binding property. Its internal structure have many poles,                                     it has fine air and water permeability. Capable of absorbing water 60-700 times of its own dry weight. Therefore,                                     it possesses wonderful water retention quality and wet-maintaining quality.
4) Outstanding shape-retention tear-resistance quality.                                     Bacterial cellulose is 5 times more tear-resistant than polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride film
5)fine bio-compatibility and Biodegradability.
6) Functional tunability during biosynthesis. Adopting different methods of culturing for Acetobacter, such as in static or spinning environment, can result to different advanced structure of bacterial cellulose. Through adjusting fermentation conditions, collecting bacterial cellulose with different chemical properties is also possible.
Application of Bacterial Cellulose
Since the discovery of bacterial cellulose 100 years ago, its application is limited due to low yield and lack of understanding to its physical property. In recent decades, as scientists learn more about bacterial cellulose’s biosynthesis mechanism and refine its fermentation condition, the industrialization of bacterial cellulose is accelerated. Owing to its excellent characteristic in purity, water retention, physics, and mechanical properties, bacterial cellulose is now promising bio-material in business world receiving attention worldwide. Until now, the cost of producing bacterial cellulose is still high for which its application still focus on high-value added product.
Application in Medical Fields
Bacterial cellulose possesses good bio-compatibility ,tensile strength and degree of hydration, which is good for skin tissue growing and contamination-resistance[2,3].                             Physical, chemical, mechanical and biomedical test of refined bacterial cellulose have proved that it possesses some unique quality such as bioactivity, biodegradability, bio-compatibility and is not irritable. Especially, the good mechanical tensile strength makes it possible to be new-type of bio-medical material. Dieter[4] has conducted research on using bacterial cellulose as artificial vessel in microsurgery. In his research, he found out that this material has a promising future in clinical application. For instance, it can function as vector for slow-release carrying various medicine, which is beneficial to applying medicine on skin surface and promoting wound healing and recovery. The up side of this material is that it can alleviate pain for the patience and has good adhesivity, which help prevent bacterial invading and contaminate the wound. It is permeable to water and electrolyte. Additionally, compared to tradition material, bacterial cellulose require shorter time to process and the the regeneration of healthy skin"

To qualify the criteria for the silver medal in human practices, we have categorized our human practices in an organized way.
Human Practices for Silver Medal
Judging Criteria
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
Our Human Practices
The directions of our human practices are oriented to the issues including food safety, agricultural sustainability, and the growing age of agricultural working labor. The three issues are becoming more and more prominent in the agriculture industry in Taiwan. Here are the human practices designed for the related issues. The context elaborating on the details of each activity, please see the link.
1. Education—Public Online Survey
In order to know the general public consciousness for pest control and the related chemical toxin issues such as food safety and environmental pollutions, we did an online survey to grasp the directions of our project.
(see more about the Public Online Survey )
2. Study—Business Study
The downstream food industry influences on the upstream agricultural industry significantly. So it is essential for us to investigate the opinions from the proprietors. We went to investigate a famous up-scale tea shop—YinChuan. Through the investigation, we got a holistic panorama of the modern food industry, and the customers.
(see more about the Business Study )
3. Further Considerations
In the further consideration, we have compared the existing methods for pest control and found out the pros and cons of them. Through the comparison, we may know the advantages and the potential disadvantages of our bio-repellent.
Apart from the human practice events that base on the contents of our project, we have also made some other activities that promote the concept of synthetic biology and have interactions with other iGEM teams. The context elaborating on the details of each activity, please see the link.

Laws Exploration Mathematical Model combining per capita GDP & environmental quality
Jul 18th
to Aug 9th
2017
Because there are many health determinant factors, including market goods and services, such as healthcare, investment time and environmental conditions, such as air pollution, environmental sanitation and water purity, Grossman put forward the model of human capital demand in 1972 healthy, healthy as a kind of capital goods for the first time, be regarded as different from other human capital ""health capital"". The model considers the demand for ""good health"" can be used to explain the supply and demand curves, and the optimal decision for health needs by wealth and survival time in the life cycle of constrained. in 1991, Grossman and Krueger first proposed the environmental Kuznets curve (referred to as EKC), to describe the relationship between economic growth and environment are analyzed, their environment and economic growth in many countries the data shows that this the relationship between emissions and economic growth of some environmental pollutants in some countries of the present an inverted U-shaped curve relationship, which is in the initial stage of economic development, economic growth will cause great damage to the environment quality, but when the per capita GDP more than a ""inflection point"", the economic sustainable growth will in turn promote the improvement of environmental quality.
This year, XMU-China made a plan to investigate the relationship between environmental pollutants and economic, and finally chose the Grossman model to explore the relationship and the amount of GDP emission environment.The Grossman model (the classical economics on health demand model) was divided into three kinds of emissions of pollutants and GDP effect, which were the scale effect, structure effect and the impact of technological progress effect respectively. Fujian province (China) was selected, which maintained 12 major rivers in the province's 143 water quality evaluation. In the 143 sections of the overall water quality evaluation section, only 3 of them did not meet the water quality standard. The main items exceeding the standard was ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, COD, BOD five dissolved oxygen, all the statistics were from the data source for the 2016 statistical yearbook of Fujian Province, between 1996 to 2009.
Due to the fact that the industrial solid waste and industrial smoke and per capita GDP regression failed to pass the test, therefore, the EKC test lists four other pollution emissions and per capita GDP on the table. There is no Kuznets inverted ""U"" curve relationship among per capita emissions of dust,"

Demonstrate the Green Receptor activity with a GFP reporter.
METHODOLOGY
Green reception is composed of a two-component system. The green light sensing agent CcaS, that is a histidine kinase that phosphorylates the transcription factor CcaR, it shows greater affinity for DNA when is phosphorylated. This two-component system has been recently described in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and due to the homology relationship with the EnvZ-OmpR system, it might possibly be functional in E.coli.
Once  the sequences of the green light receptor (ccaS),transcriptional factor (ccaR) and DNA regulated region from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, reported in Yuu Hirose were obtained, they were sent to synthezise.
The DNA regulated region by CCaR would be ligated to the GFP protein, to analyze the activity of the photosensor.
RESULTS
Edinburgh team sent us plasmid with accesory genes for PCB creation because we could not get them from the existing biobrick BBa_K098010, which is also necessary in the red reception module.
CcaR and CcaS were ligated to a weak constitutive promoter (J23117). Activity confirmation is still in progress.
Emission module: LuxAB luciferase from vibrio fischeri plus Lumazine protein
OBJECTIVES
Obtain LuxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri.
Design Lumazine biobrick, send to synthesize and transfer the construction from Mr. Gene plasmid to pSB1C3 DNA submission backbone.
To test that the device works as expected. This characterization will test if Lumazine protein can also be functional working with the Vibrio fischeri luciferase, instead of its native interacting luciferase from Photobacterium phosphoreum.
METHODOLOGY
Lux operon
The strategy to obtain LuxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri was the same working with the green light emission module.
Lumazine
Lumazine protein of Photobacterium phosphoreum (lumP) is a small protein which shifts the wavelength of light emitted by the P.phosphoreum luciferase LuxAB from 495 nm to about 475 nm. It was used to tune the blue light emission wavelength towards another one closer to that of LovTAP system reception.
A version of the lumazine biobrick (BBa_K216007) was sent to us by Edinburgh Team, due to this construction hadn't been tested we"

Overall Circuit
Diffusion and Degradation Rate
There are only two details needed to be discussed : diffusion and degradation rate.
In the tetracycline uptake process of E.coli, two systems are involved: the  rapid concentration-driven system which occurs initially and is insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, and the slow energy-driven system whose rate is only one-tenth of the rapid system [19] . The latter is not as important as the former, hence we only consider the concentration-driven factors. Though it is still unknown whether the concentration-driven system can be categorized as passive diffusion or facilitated transport, the transportation rate is in proportion to the gradient of tetracycline concentration. So, we just take it as diffusion process.
Diffusion through cell membranes can be described by permeability coefficient, which is"
Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," pollution to other lab organic materials may act as a result of escaping and further generation. Since our strain does not hold a proliferate feature, dominance of this bacteria in environment is not likely to occur, thus provide less potential risk.
Experiment Safety
In order to minimize potentially risks that could be brought about by certain instruments and reagents, our members were requested to use normative protective equipment and follow the safety manuals throughout our lab time. Instruments like alcohol burner, centrifugal machine and hazardous reagents like ethidium bromide were carefully used and discarded according to the safety manuals. Gloves, lab coats, pants and close-toed shoes are demanded during lab time, and it is not allowed to touch about when wearing gloves. Besides, no food or drink is allowed in the working space.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," If that is the case, then high shear rate events such as coughing, which causes a shear rate of 103−104 s−1 (this is 1000-10’000 fold higher than what we measured), would cause deglycosylated mucins to form much less viscous mucus than native mucins (Lai et al. 2009).
Figure 10. Deglycosylated PGM shows decreased viscosity with increasing shear rate.
Figure 11. Visual representation of the decrease in viscosity of PGM after chemical treatment. Left tube is deglycosylated PGM and right tube is untreated PGM.
Hypothesis 8: Mucin samples enzymatically treated with endo-β-galactosidase and/or sialidase show a decrease in viscosity.
Our results support the hypothesis of lowering mucus viscosity when mucin-associated glycans are removed. Due to time restraints we were not able to test our expressed enzymes.Thus, we would like to further explore the beneficial impact of enzymatic mucus degradation by glycosidases. In particular, the stepwise treatment of mucins with sialidase and endo-beta-galactosidase.
Hypothesis 9: E.coli can grow and express enzymes in mucin samples
Due to time restraints this part of the project was never reached.

Zhang: She had done a lot of work on directional optimization of BioBricks.
Purpose: Inputing environmental parameters include special loci genes, the expected expression level and chooses candidate BioBricks. Optimize and find out the best sequences under given conditions and setting number of evolutionary (n) chooses the BioBricks, and the system will guide users until the given conditions are met, variation to generate different sequencess. Copy, retain or reject BioBricks according to the matched-degree, this step is parallel to natural selection. Circulation stops after n times circulations, output the best sequences. The problems are how to make sure that the genotype equals its phenotype? How to define the f(x) that we want? And now we need to read some books about the genetic algorithm to get the way.
Summary: Now we have two ideas. One is to build a platform for researchers that focusing on synthetic biology (aim to increase their efficiency). Former researchers have already done some researches about it, so it might be a rat race.
Solve synthetic biology problems with GA. We need to supplement relevant basic knowledge of GA. So, studying CLOTHO developed by Berkeley and other universities and try to find out some flesh ideas and make a research to find out what front-line researchers need. We also need to study pertinent software and GA, protein quaternary structure and knowledge about directional optimization, read more books and literature to make sure the possibility of the idea. GA is too difficult for some of us. We still need to get come up with some novel ideas.

Tec-Monterrey,2010,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of a traditional physical or chemical sensor, for example, bacteria can offer the same specificity and sensitivity that traditional sensors offer, but they are much more portable and grow in inexpensive media. Furthermore, bacterial reporters also offer advantages over using other types of biosensors like enzymes and antibodies because they are living organisms and they are capable of analyzing samples through a process that involves many enzymes (Yagi, 2007)
The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) although these early tests didn’t use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the areas of genetic engineering and synthetic biology have resulted in many more applications such as detection of contaminants (Willardson, et. Al., 1998) and sugar and amino acid availability in soils (Jaeger, et. Al., 1999) . Even though the reporters have gotten more sophisticated and sensitive, we realized that there isn’t much mention of a single bacterial bioreporter capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting differently depending on the concentration.
We thought the use of synthetic biology as well as the BioBrick standard could help create a “genetic circuit” (van der Meer and Belkin, 2010) capable of detecting different concentrations of a substance and reacting in a different manner depending on the amount detected. In our initial research we realized that the iGEM British Columbia 2009 team decided to do something similar, so we used parts of their project as a base and integrated parts of other previous iGEM projects in order to propose a new genetic construction capable of detecting different amounts of a certain substance. We call these new types of sensors, “intelligent biosensors”, because they have the ability to react in different ways depending on their surroundings.
With our project we hope to continue with the previous efforts of other iGEM teams, and at the same time propose a new type of genetic circuit for achieving these functions. In the process we plan to develop BioBricks for two new families of phage activators as well as different BioBrick constructons that can make our system easy to adapt, so that the creation of these “intelligent biosensors” becomes just a matter of choosing the substance of interest and choosing the different reporters.

Mercury Bioremediation

To design a system for biological remediation of not only mercury ions in contaminated waters, but also the more toxic form, methylmercury, we’ve selected to use 5 genes of the mercury resistance (mer) operon of which over 10 genes have been identified and characterized in various strains of mercury resistant bacteria in the environment. This construct was assembled from the mer operon in Serratia marscecens in the plasmid pDU1358, and is designed to contain an upstream regulatory gene merR, two genes encoding for transport proteins merP (periplasmic) and merT (transmembrane), a gene encoding mercuric reductase MerA, and finally a gene encoding organomercurial lyase MerB. This system is regulated by a bidirectional promoter so that ''merR'' on one side of the operon is constitutively expressed and allows for the repression of the mer operon in the absence of mercury ions, and the downstream activation and transcription of ''merT, merP, merA, merB'' when mercury ions are in close proximity.  MerT and MerP were selected as transporters for their high turnover rates to bring in mercury ions, which are subsequently bound by MerA to catalyze their conversion into volatile mercury eventually captured within a carbon filter in our device and disposed of sustainably. The organic and more toxic form, methylmercury, can diffuse into the cytosol of the bacteria where MerB catalyzes its conversion into mercury ions, which are then bound to MerA and converted into less toxic, volatile elemental mercury in an NADP(H) dependent reaction. The system is very tightly regulated and allows for continuous turnover within our bacterial chassis as the mercury ions are volatalized and then captured externally rather than sequestered within our bacteria which would eventually lead to cell death and the requirement to replace the cells. Due to the NADP(H) requirement of MerA, metabolically active cells are required throughout this process"

After explaining fundamentals and challenges of synthetic biology, members of the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team held a discussion with the group of High school students and helped them to think about a future iGEM project. Some ideas such as designing a fluorescent human body appears to be very popular among the group of young students!  In order to transpose theory into practice, we offered the young scientists a private visit into the lab ( Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell ). They had an overview of the necessary tools and techniques commonly used to manipulate genome.
IT Magazine
IT is a web magazine publishing articles covering subjects about industries and technologies. We corresponded with one of their journalists to explain the iGEM competition, the main concepts of synthetic biology and its numerous applications. We also presented the concept and objectives of our SafetE.coli project with a simplified view so it can reach the general public. Therefore an article dedicated to the project of the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team was published on the 28th of August 2015.
La fête de la science (The Science Party)
“La fête de la science” is a national Science Festival undertaken by the Ministry of National Research. Scientific events are held all over the country to promote sciences and to interact with people from different backgrounds. The iGEM Paris-Saclay team attends every year events in the campus that hosts students, personal, academic and general public in its laboratories in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics and geology. Our team is planning activities for this year festival that will take place on October 11th. The main purpose is to induce debate and promote synthetic biology by exhibiting popularization posters made by our team and potentially meet students interested in joining the iGEM Paris-Saclay 2016 team.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Methods#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," perfektan needed and the exposure time of perfektan to the liquid GMO cultures depends on the culture mix. Specific instructions can be found here . After successful treatment with perfektan the liquid can be disposed of in the sink.
Additionally, the areas in which the work with GMO is carried out should be cleaned meticulously with 70% ethanol. This is both to avoid the GMO from spreading but also to avoid cross-contaminating experiments carried out in the working area.
Knowing Your Chemicals
Most of the chemicals involved in our experiments are harmless or only dangerous if they come in contact with eyes, are swallowed etc. However, one frequently used chemical that deserves extra attention - ethidium bromide. This compound is used for gel electrophoresis, and is carcinogenic. Thus, we worked with it in designated areas: at separate benches for gels, where gloves should be worn. Gloves are not to be worn anywhere else in the lab, except when working with other dangerous chemicals, in which case they must be taken off immediately after, and the affected area cleaned with 70% ethanol.
Besides ethidium bromide, known to require extra precautions, whenever starting a new experiment, the material safety data sheets (MSDSs) for the specific chemicals used in the experiments should be looked up, to know how to handle them. When working at Technological University of Denmark, MSDS’s are administered by www.kemibrug.dk, but be aware that your institution probably uses another provider.
After running a gel it is often necessary to cut out specific bands for purification. This requires illumination with UV light. To protect the skin from the UV irradiation, we wear protective masks and gloves. The gloves also protect against the ethidium bromide in the gel, discussed above, and should be thrown out after use. The scalpel is not to be used for any other purpose and should always be handled wearing gloves.
Lab Safety Checklist!
If you are going to work in the laboratory, check if you are ready to enter the lab and start the work with these simple recommendations:
Get a proper introduction to the lab(s) that you are going to work in.
Get acquainted with the safety rules and what to do in case of an emergency e.g. fire, spillage etc..
Plan your work in the laboratory:
Read the protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) you are going to follow during your work
Identify when to use personal safety gear and what is the right gear such as gloves, safety glasses etc.
Book the right equipment e.g.. fume hoods, LAF-ben"
UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Human Practice#Science Fair_-_-_TEXT.html," CABD (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo) and OTRI (Oficina de Transferencia de Resultados de Investigación), the UPO-Sevilla Team had the opportunity to participate in this edition of the Science Fair and explain what Synthetic Biology is to the public. Also, we intended to transmit the importance of multidisciplinarity in 21st century science. With this aim, we organized some games to make sure that boys and girls from 5 to 18 years old could understand the meaning of synthetic biology as a new field of science, the basis of its innovative “based on parts” perspective and its need to embrace Informatics, Mathematics and Biology.
One of the games involved designing and creating a new cell that could do anything the designer, that is the child, would like to. The public was offered an empty and uncolored cell and was encouraged to “create your own cell” by inserting some puzzle pieces into it that provided defined functions. Other game (partially related with our project) lied in deciphering a color-coded secret message that was carried in fictitious bacterial multicolored plates, or on the other hand, create their own message from the color code.
Entertaining and instructive!

Overview
As a link to our use of luciferases in the Cas-Find project we developed an interest in biological imaging. This was largely influenced by the research of our Secondary PI, Amit Jathoul in this general area.
One challenge in the field of biological imaging is in the use of fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins that emit light with longer wavelengths. The mKeima RFP variant has been previously used as a long stoke shifted fluorophore and was the subject of the SPECTRA project of the 2013 UCL iGEM team .
Therefore as a side project we planned to alter the potential usage of the Lux Operon biobrick (Cambridge iGEM 2010 BBa_K325909 ) by inducing a red-shift in its bioluminescence via an interaction with the mKeima protein.
We hoped to show that blue light produced by E.coli expressing the native LUXoperon would excite the mKeima protein resulting in the emission of red light.
We aimed to analyse the interaction between LUXoperon and mKeima in two ways:
1. Co-expression: Express the LUXoperon and mKeima in different bacterial cells and assess whether the Fluorescence by Unbound Excitation from Luminescence (FUEL) reaction was able to cause a change in the wavelength of the light output. The gene expression in both bacteria is controlled by the arabinose inducible promotor pBAD.
2. Co-regulation: Addition of a rbs-mKeima sequence to the 3’ end of the native pBAD::LUXoperon . We aimed to assess whether there was an alteration in wavelength of the light output in these bacteria compared to bacteria contained an unaltered LUXoperon.
Experimental Design
The mKeima protein has been added to the registry by the UCL_PG team of 2013 ( BBa_K1135001 ). However as part of this side project we have submitted two unique parts to the registry that contain this protein:
1. pBAD::LUXoperon:mKeima fusion ( BB_K2060002 )
2. pBAD::mKeima ( BB_K2060001"

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#Algorithm_-_-_TEXT.html," many high dimensional systems when the input variables are properly chosen. This is also the formula we use to achieve HDMR expansion. How to determine HDMR component functions? Practical formulations of the HDMR component functions determine whether we can carry out this algorithm. Theoretically, a component function
<math>f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il})</math>
is obtained by minimizing the functional,
<math>\min_{f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il}}\int_{\Omega}\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},u) [f(u)-f_{0}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(u_{i})-\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(u_{i}, u_{j})-...- \sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(u_{i1},u_{i2},...,u_{il})]^{2}du</math>
under a suitable specified orhogonality condition which guarantees that all the component functions are determined step by step. Here,<math>\hat{x}=(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},...,x_{i_{n}}</math> , <math>\omega_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(\hat{x},u)</math> is a weight function. Different weight functions will produce distinct, but formally equivalent HDMR expansions. There are two commonly used HDMR expansions: Cut- and RS(Random Sampling)-HDMR. Cut-HDMR expresses <math>f(x)</math> in reference to a specified cut point, while RS-HDMR depends on the average value of <math>f(x)</math> over the whole domain <math>\Omega</math> . We adopt RS-HDMR to do global sensitivity analysis. For RS-HDMR, we first rescale variables <math>x_{i}</math> such that <math>0<x_{i}<1</math> for all i. The output function <math>f(x)</math> is then defined in the unit hypercube

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#IntroductoryLabwork#7 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," order to carry out this step, we need to extract and purify the plasmids first (to be done tomorrow) via alkaline lysis - this requires three solutions, two of which were made today.
Solution 1
According to Dr. Aldridge's protocol named ""Phil’s mini method for Alkaline Lysis for Mini Prep"", we need to add 'solution 1' (along with an RNAse) to resuspended transformed E.coli cells, tomorrow. Solution 1 requires the following ingredients at the following concentrations:
* 50 mM Glucose    * 25 mM Tris.Hcl (pH 8.0)    * 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)
This solution was made today in preparation for tomorrow's exercise. We were told that the total volume should be 250ml. We were presented with pre-made solutions - 1M Tris HCl and 0.5M EDTA - and were told we needed to calculate the correct volumes of each of these solutions to be added to the beaker to give the desired molarity.
We were presented with glucose in it's solid form and asked to make a stock solution of 1M glucose; after which we were asked to calculate the amount to glucose solution to add to the beaker to make a molarity of 0.5M! The following equation helped:
Molecular Weight    x    Desired Volume (Litres)   x   Molarity   =   Weight (grams)
Making the glucose stock solution
molecular weight of glucose = 180.2
desired volume of stock solution = 500ml
desired molarity of stock = 1M
Put these values into the equation above gives the amount of glucose solid needed for 500ml of water...
180.2   x   0.5l   x   1M   =   90.1g
We added to 90.1 grams of glucose to 0.5 litres to get a 1M stock solution.
Adding the solutions to the beaker
25ml of 1M glucose stock solution was transferred to beaker (to make 50mM)
6.25ml of 1M Tris.HCl was transferred to the same beaker (to make 25mM)
5ml of 0.5M EDTA also added (to make 10mM)
H2O made the rest of the solution
These values are derived from the above equation

Experiment details -- Nitrite stability in anaerobic E. coli
Verification of Transformants
In order to verify and characterize our Mutant 1 (grows under aerobic conditions; converts ammonia → nitrite) and Mutant 2 (grows under anaerobic conditions; converts nitrite → nitrous oxide) transformants, we performed the following experiments.
Mutant 1: Aerobic consumption of ammonia and hydroxylamine
Grow Mutant 1 AMO and HAO transformants aerobically in the presence of ammonia and hydroxylamine respectively.  We found that the AMO transformant used ammonia more quickly than a nontransformed E. coli control, suggesting that the AMO is functional and active.  We also found that hydroxylamine was toxic to the cells, and did not detect nitrite production in our HAO transformant.
Experiment details -- Aerobic consumption of ammonium and hydroxylamine
Mutant 2: Anaerobic production of nitrous oxide from nitrite
Grow our transformed Mutant 2 anaerobically in the presence of varying concentrations of nitrite; measure the amount of nitrous oxide produced.  Controls are untransformed E. coli and P. aeruginosa.  The results from this experiment are complicated by the fact that measurements of nitrous oxide are extremely sensitive and the sensors did not always give reliable data.

Bioreactor
Finally, in order to see if the long term behaviour of our Nir transformant, we grew it in a bioreactor.

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video.  We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to iGEM Peshawar, who thought it was a great idea, thus creating a video documenting the lab techniques of transformations. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:
Danielle Tullman Ercek, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University: Discussed the way synthetic biology becomes part of a living system and redefines life. Also talked about the scope of synthetic biology, what it can achieve, and the applications and goals of the field.

In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway after dialysis: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the extraction of potential reaction products, to be able to start a LCMS analysis in order to detect the synthesized caffeine.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

Protocol
We used general protocols as well as our own protocols for testing our gene and gathering quantitative data. You can find all of them below.
General Protocols
Our general protocols come from the Lab Protocol Manual from the 2016 University of Lethbridge Synthetic Biology Workshop 2016.
Below is a copy of our lab protocol manual:
Proof of Concept Protocol
Our mentor, Robert, helped us adapt the lipase assay from Gupta et. al..
Below is our modified version:
Spectrophotometry Protocol
Using our above Proof of Concept Protocol, we modified it slightly to test the same reaction but getting quantitative data from the spectrophotometer as the reaction progresses. We did this with help from the University of Calgary, specifically Cassie Stillner.
Note:
- 25uL of 50mM IPTG was added to a 50mL culture.
- We used a 400nm wavelength during the spectrophotometer measurements

According to the information provided on two websites, we identify and seperate all the domains from DEBS1.
3. Generating new polyketide by “programming” domain in module.
After identifying and obtaining the sequence of each domains, we assemble the domain in the order of what we want. Then we can test whether the PKS are expressed correctly and the polyketide synthesized as we want.(figure.2) GC content of PKS DEBS1 sequence is very high, so we have the codon optimized to make it suitable for E.coli[7].
3.1 Standardzing the domain.
We first assemble the domain as original DEBS1+TE, to find whether our reconstructed domain works.(figure1)
Figure1: Standardzing of domains
At the same time, we try to exchange position of domain with the same function. We exchange the domain KR and ACP and insert the didomain DH+ER into different module to know whether our standardized domains works[8].(figure2)
Figure2: Repositioning and insert of domain inside module.
Thirdly, we obtain the loading module from diffenent organisms.
Loading module is the first module in polyketide synthase that recognize the starter unit of the polyketide chain and initiates the polyketide synthesis[9]. It include at least two domains that AT and ACP. Some loading modules may contain KS. The loading module influences the efficience of polyketide synthesis as it start the synthesis process.
We choose loading module of PKS of pyoluteorin[10] and amphotericin[11]. Erythromycin’s starter unit is propionyl-CoA and The starter unit of Amphotericin are acetyl-CoA. (Figure3)
Figure3: Exchange of loading module
Starter unit of Pyoluteorin in two PKS database is different that malonyl-CoA in ASMPKS and acetyl-CoA in MAPSI. We compare the efficience of that loading module between two concentration of substrates.
The loading module of Amphotericin contain an redundant domain DH that can’t modify the starter unit or any other polyketide unit[11"

Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us. Finally, Shanxi WeiQiDa Luminosity Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd provides us a capital sum and some samples. Then, Tianjin Naipu Technology Co., Ltd suggested that they can provide us some PET samples and we can also go to their factory for a visit.
During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," of the IT sector to strike up a reflexion on the development of alternate economic solutions to patents.
We will most notably refer to both Joseph Stiglitz’s (Nobel prize in economics in 2001) and Elinor Ostrom’s (Nobel prize in economics in 2009) theoretical work in the economics of innovation and intellectual property to back up our study.
The patent system: an efficient economic model ?
What is a patent, how is it awarded?
A patent grants its owner a monopoly in a country on an invention he was the first one to describe and claim. At a firm's scale, this also means being able to shield the potential commercial exploitation of the R&D work which has led to the invention, against the company's competitors. It rewards this work by granting the patent’s owner an economic advantage that will probably make the financial cost of the R&D be worth it. The perspective of this heavy economic asset is the major reason why patents are said to be a driving force that encourage innovation.
Nonetheless, such a profit-making privilege has a cost for both the claimer (patent offices fees, attorney fees, translation expenses if necessary, and so on) and the society, namely the ""monopoly rent"" it generates (see below). Indeed, targeted invention have to meet tough conditions for a patent to be granted. Consequently, knowing the granting conditions is very important to fully understand the patent system.
A patent is granted:
for a new invention never publicly revealed, which can lead to industrial applications ;
on a precise territory ;
for a maximum of twenty years ;
to the one who revealed the invention and described it with enough precision.
NB : A patent has to be paid annually for its delivery and maintaining.
The 1930 plant patent act marked the beginning of a new economic era for biology as emerged with it the patentability of the living world. Nowadays, even the genetically modified bacterias may be patentable (the latter have been patentable in the USA and then in Europe since the beginning of the 80s even if the precise conditions to be met to make ""living things"" patentable remain quite fuzzy.).
The goal of this brief study though, is not to discuss this matter.
Why patents have been created?
In France, patents have been created after the 1789 French Revolution. They were then considered as a human right : their aim was to recognize the inventors’ rights on their ingenuity. And so was born the first legal mean to claim authorship of an invention: a new age for intellectual property began.
Instead, the justification for patents became quickly socio-economic."

”You can’t build a society without law” - Naftali Bennett
Our project is oriented to the safe sending of encrypted information through conventional means (such as regular post) rather than only on the pure storage in bacteria. For that we are providing the Bacillus subtilis spores with several biologic layers.
In this part of Human Practices, we explore the current national and international legislations that the CryptoGErM system must obey in order to ensure its safe and unrestricted shipping.
National Legislations
With the advising of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu; RIVM) from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport from the Netherlands we consulted the current national law requirements and international legislations that regulate the sending of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
Currently, the shipping of GMOs is strictly regulated in The Netherlands.
Such regulations are stated in the articles 3rd and 4th from the Environmental Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms (Regeling genetisch gemodificeerde organismen milieubeheer 2013) [1] . These articles state the norms for the deliberate shiping of GMOs within the Netherlands; if the shiping of the Bacillus subtilis spores from the CryptoGErM system is intended within the Netherlands, it must obey this legislation.
According to these articles, “the shipping of Genetically Modified Organism within an Institute, or aboard a ship, must occur in accordance with the following guidelines”
GMOs must be transferred in a closed, unbreakable, non leaking containers
Containers of GMOs must be disinfected before shipping
The dispersion of GMOs to the environment must be avoided by applying the relevant safety measures.
We applied these regulations for the design of the shipping container used for the sending of CryptoGErM spores.
International Legislations
The next step was looking for international laws that regulate the shipping of GMOs around the world, since one of the applications of Crypto"

Champions week - Week 4
19th - 25th July 2010
Today was our first real glimpse at the real competition at stake here. WE got a chance to meet and mingle with other universities in Newcastle who were hosting this years UK iGEM conference. It was interesting to listen at the wide variety and range of ideas and ambitions that the other teams had. Our presentation went well to say the least and although we were asked some tough questions we managed well, especially as we had only been on the project for around a week. Nevertheless, the following team building exercise allowed us to immerse into different groups and socialize with other individuals from across the country. We finished the day with a nice meal togethe at La Tasca along the riverside, rainy, but still a great end to our day.
Had to wake up early to go to iGEM lectures, second day in Newcastle. Finished at 12 pm, and we were desperate to kill time, so we decided to watch ""Inception"". By 5 pm we were out of their and back to good old London and its kebab shops. We were all fired up following this conference and on the way back spent hours planning how we were going to make this iGEM even more successful then last years, and how we will go about beating our competitors, it was definitely going to be close and tough, but we knew we had it in us!
The 1st Portico meeting took place at 9.00 in the morning, with a cup of coffee on everyone's hands and sleepy faces talking about championships and splitting of tasks.Okay, point"

The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t"

We also learned that the cost of storing text, even long term, is relatively cheap compared to other forms of storage. Mr Hibberd explained that this is because text is easy to condense when storing. He recommended that an improvement to our project would be if we could store data other than text.

The Tübingen iGEM team had an amazing idea of collaborating with teams from around the world to produce synthetic biology tutorial videos, spreading scientific knowledge to the community on each country's national language! We also had produced our own videos, so we didn’t even hesitate and embraced this idea and shared the four videos we had made for our “Synthetic Biology 101” project. Other teams, like Aalto-Helsinki, are involved, and we are proud to be a part of this beautiful gesture of information dissemination.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,": What examination do we need to go through if we are to commercialize our product? 
FDA: If it is positioned to a kind of common food, it won’t be required to pass any examination procedures. But, if you are to make it a health food warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients. The list of ingredients that could be added is now available on the internet. Manufactures are required to hand in their examine result themselves. 
We: If we are now planning to quantify our products in the form of pills, do they have to be examined?
FDA: Sure. Everything should stick to the Standards for Specification, Scope, Application and Limitation of Food Additives.
We: Is there now any regulation related to GMO products?
FDA: For GMO products are generally related to GMO plants, there is still no fine institution for GMO microorganisms. Moreover, we have not yet received any application for this. But, if this really happen, we will ask the applicants to hand in the microorganism’s DNA strands they use. We will test whether any toxic substances or allergens is produced. 
We: So, is it true to say that the limitations keep GMO products from prevailing in Taiwan?
FDA: This is considered a topic of personal view. The governing departments stand on neither side in a controversial topic. But, we’ll be sure that customers have the right to know whether it is a GMO product.
We: So, what kind of data is required?
FDA: First, the effect of the product must be testified. Also, we will ask for the descriptive data about the bacterial strain, how you grow and preserve them, how you rebuilt its DNA, and whether any toxic or allergic reaction is found.
We: Is it an offence if we just make an allegation that our product is of health-giving properties?
FDA: If your product is added to medicines, you may violate the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act. If you claim that your product is of medical effects, you could end up in prison.
We: If we get the permission of commercializing health supplements, will there be an expiration date?
FDA: 5 years. If after 5 years, a new regulation is enacted, and the standard is adjusted, we will examine the product with the new standard again.
We: Is it necessary that we conduct human clinical trial?
FDA: Either in vitro or in vivo trial is acceptable. But, if your product is related to hypertension, than it will be better if you can conduct human clinical trial. Moreover, items should be labeled if it has been done"

Meet The Farmers
On October 10-12, 2014, Sumbawagen team took ECONEY project to meet the farmers at Batu Dulang and Gapit, the two honey production center in Sumbawa. We carried missions as follow: first, we’d like to introduce our ECONEY project to the honey farmers since they are one of the target of our project implication. Secondly, by taking our project to meet the society we’d like to promote synthetic biology in the society.
This event was opened by welcoming speech from the chief of each village. The event was divided into three sessions.
A. Session one : from honey to ECONEY
The farmer we met used to work with honey, so now we let them to work with ECONEY. Before doing so, we introduce the equipment Sumbawagen used in wetlab activity. Participants also asked to practice using micropippet and shaker in front of other audience guided by Sumbawagen team member. The next thing we do is showing cultivition process and asked them to join to the process.
B. Session two : get in touch with the software
ECONEY is a device used to measure glucose concentration in various sample. In this project, we use various samples of honey from Sumbawa and other part around the world. Through color emitted from our E.coli devices we then able to measure the glucose level with help of our ECONEY software, an android based application.

Human Practices
Our HP projects this year were diverse and palpably profound. All team members engaged in those      projects with great enthusiasm and we think that we did some great work presenting the field of      synthetic biology and the iGEM competition in general to the public.
Integrated Human Practice
Throughout our Human Practice projects starting from lab courses at school to presentation of our     work to a broad community at the “Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften” we received a strong feedback     from the people, what we must consider and how we can improve our project. Overall, visualization     of our project was challenging in the first place. Here the school children showed us multiple ways,     how people can understand our project better, without using to complex terms, which can only be     understood by scientists. The Lego brick concept was convenient to demonstrate the working     principle of our catcher tag system as well as the formation of our polymer and was further well-     understood by non-scientists.     Out trip to the “Bionicum” gave us an impression how nature fulfills motion and how we have to     adjust our system to work as a muscle. Here, we realized that our attempt of a light-driven muscle is     inferior to our electric device as the thickness of our muscle system limits the transmitting light.     Hence, we focused more on the development and the pattern how we can fold the DEAs to reach     high strength with low amounts of material.     Finally, we have demonstrated the principle of our work at the “Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften” to     a broad community. We could apply, what we have learnt during our Human Practice and our work     in the lab. We were faced with many questions and bright ideas how to scale up the process and the     purification by secretion of the protein instead of lyses to create a continuous supply. It was a     crucial     factor for the evaluation of our gaming app, where we benefited from the enthusiastic crowd of     people.

The second picture shows the resulting light intensity profile, which can not be used for holography (without pinhole). The third picture is taken with a smartphone flashlight and pinhole. Black spots are caused by dust on the detector.
Electronics
Our initial plan was to use an Xbox DVD Pickup as the laser source, as it provides 405 nm, 650 nm, and 780 nm laser point source with possible laser alignment and intensity control by using a customized PCB board . However, as we experimented with the pickup, we found out that the hologram was greatly destructed by the Fresnel lens within the pickup. Thus we opted out on the pickup and PCB idea. Instead, our setup now consists solely of a smartphone flashlight, a pinhole, a micromanipulator and stage for alignment, and a V2 Picam with a RapsberryPi 3 for the recorded holograms.
Figure 4. A Raspberry Pi is connected to a Raspi Pi Cam, which features a webserver for retrieving the captured pictures online. The electronics setup can be powered with batteries or a smartphone charger, which enormously increases the flexibility.
As shown in the picture above, RaspberryPi 3 is connected to power, Pi cam, and the LAN cable for internet connection. A webcam server is then setup with local host configuration such that a live stream from the Picam can be accessed via a browser on another PC. The webcam server is also customized with a GUI to record images or videos, adjust camera settings such as ISO, resolution, and save the recorded data on the server for eventual downloading.
Assembling it
If you would like to copy our setup we welcome you to watch our short assembling video.
Working Principle
The working principle of digital holographic microscopy relies on the interference pattern, i.e. the hologram, which encodes 3D information in a 2D picture, and on the 3D reconstruction algorithm, to extract the 3D information from the recorded holograms. The interference pattern comes from the joint wavefronts of the object beam and the reference beam. As indicated in the picture below, a coherent collimated light source is split into two beams: The object beam passing through the lens and the object that is to be observed, and the reference beam pertaining the phase and coherence of the light source. The joint wavefronts form the hologram, which is recorded by an image sensor. The 3D reconstruction algorithm then functions as a digital lens, cutting the joint wavefronts in minuscule"

General
In a world where research in life science and especially in Genetic engineering and Synthetic biology is thriving, who has responsibility for all the genetically modified organisms that are being created and their potential harmfulness? Well, it is OURS of course! Every researcher should consider biosafety and bioethics as issues of high importance, before even starting to work with microorganisms. But first things first!
What is a Genetically Modified Microorganism (GMO)? What is Biosafety and Bioethics?
The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines:
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs): as “organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally” [1] . This means that the researcher removes or introduces genetic material to the organism. Additional material can either be of their own or somebody else's design or taken from other organisms. Every organism created in an iGEM project is therefore a GMO.
Biosafety: is defined by the WHO as “the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, whereas biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins”. It is a very important part of lab work in general and work with GMOs in particular as these might pose a higher risk when released into the environment.
Bioethics: is defined by the WHO as ‘’the"

Scope and Future Aspect
The partsregistry.org is a continuously growing collection of genetic parts that can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems. The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry users benefit from using the parts and information available from the Registry in designing their engineered biological systems. In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will, in turn, contribute back information and data on existing parts and new parts that they make to grow and improve this community resource.As a growing databes partsrgistry.org need to be more organized and improved.Huge collection of parts requires some algoritms not to get lost in database. According to this needs, BIO-Guide is the first designed software that enable huge amount of parts in partsregistry.org to be organized as a possible biological device and system construct member based on graph theory. Application of synthetic biology is emerging field and these kinds of softwares are inevitable needs in that field. Making parts standards as suitable is the focus of synthetic biology and our innovative approach make parts in partsregistry.org  easy to use. After designing algoritm we understand that present standards are inadequate and partsregistry form must be improved. We need new form format during parts registry, some additional features make database more handleable. In future , we think to develop BIO-GUIDE 2.0 after revising parts registry form. Our final aim is to make a software making intended device and systems automatically. All you will do is writing your needs as a output and input or more complex networks and BIOGUIDE will give you all possible construct. It is not a dream because we made this software algorithm fundamentals this year and next year we will improve it

Saving the World, one statue at a time
Our Project was selected among the Best 16 of the World Championship!
Our project had been awarded with a Gold Medal in Amsterdam and was among the ""Sweet 16 High Scorers"" in Boston! We're really proud and excited about it!
Project Codename: Crust Away
Statues and monuments all over the world are not enjoyed to the extent that they should be because they are covered in a disfiguring black crust, which consists mainly of CaSO4.
A practical solution would be if a cheap mechanism was available to continually remove the pollutant molecules that adhere to the surface of statues. To build such a system, we are engineering an aerobic sulfur reducing pathway in E. coli to dissolve the disfiguring black crust.

Project Codename: Terminator 5
Surprisingly little standardization of T7 phage derived parts has occurred, despite the prevalence of T7 parts in recombinant technologies.          Also, the compatibility between T7 and E. coli derived parts has not been explored.                To better understand the compatibility of the two systems and to begin to better characterize T7 biological parts, we are measuring the termination efficiencies of T7 and E. coli transcriptional terminators with E. coli and T7 RNA polymerases.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," finally converts the nootkatone pathway into our artificial compartment.
Since the production of nootkatone does not lead to a change of colour we need to apply different methods for verifying substrates. Once we succeed with the qualitative validation via Western Blot analysis, we can verify the presence of nootkatone by using high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively.
Model influence on Nootkatone expression
We modeled the nootkatone biosynthesis pathway using ordinary differential equations in order to optimize nootkatone production. We found two hard and an easy problem, all of which we could find a solution for. The easy problem is optimization of the enzyme concentrations of the biosynthesis pathway. According to our model of the Nootkatone pathway we found that overexpression of Valencene Synthase is necessary to maximize the Nootkatone yield, while both alcohol dehydrogenase and p450-BM3 have only minor effects on the yield.
One of the hard problems, as shown in our penalty model is the toxicity of nootkatone and nootkatol. Since the toxicity most likely stems from both nootkatone and nootkatol clogging up the cell wall we present our peroxisome as a solution for this problem. When comparing the cytosolic model to our peroxisomal model we found that, if our assumption that neither Nootkatone nor Nootkatol are able to pass the peroxisomal membrane holds up, we can greatly increase Nootkatone production.
A further  problem is the influx of the pathway precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). We used OptKnock analysis to design yeast strains with optimized FPP production. With this analysis we got hints that growing the yeast cells on a fatty acid medium might be a simple alternative to  knocking out the desired genes.
Violacein
Working on a project is a process of well planned steps. It starts with an idea and theoretical research to create a design. When finally demonstrating the mechanism of the project it is important to point out the benefits with a suitable application.
Synthetic biology offers countless numbers of new opportunities, especially in the field of metabolic engineering. To testify some main parts of our artico project, we decided to relocate a metabolic pathway into yeast peroxisomes. There are several reasons why this approach fits perfectly as a proof for our concept.
Based on described of advantages of violacein this pathway was chosen. Violacein is naturally produced in numerous bacterial strains, most popular in the gram-negative Chromobacterium viol"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Our product would be used in the human body, or in food (Examples: anti-cancer bacteria, bread made with engineered yeast, engineered rice plants)
Risks associated with real use
Our project is basically focused on proving the concept that one can use bacteriophage therapy against C. difficile. We wanted to explore alternative treatment options due to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Of course, we do not claim in any way that our final product will be straight away ready for therapeutic use. In the best scenario, it would need to be tested in vivo in pre-clinical studies and in clinical trials to assess their safety and test for any side effects. This would be done with ethical approval. Pharmacokinetic studies and biochemical experiments would be carried out to determine optimum conditions for use.
Our project is focused on using phage. Even though it is specific to C. difficile, its specificity may vary depending on different conditions. More research would be needed to investigate possible non-specific infection.
How experts have overseen our project to manage identified risk
Michelle Kelly, one of the safety officers at the lab our team has been working in, carried out a full laboratory safety induction and introduced the risk assessments and standard operating procedures that are adhered to when working in a Category 2 laboratory. She has also set up training records for each team member which requires signing off by advisors when each lab skill has been efficiently performed. She has been working on C. difficile for more than 5 years and possesses deep knowledge into proper project design that ensures safety of the researcher.
Nigel Minton (PI) has worked on C. difficile and Clostridia for over 20 years and has overseen the project development. Four other advisors who will also oversee the work that is completed, all of whom have worked on Clostridia for at least 3 years.

In   the afternoon we had a meeting with Mark Shepherd, to discuss ideas. By   the end of the meeting we had decided to further research into the production of esters in E.coli, but also to carry on researching into BMCs.  
 
Day 6 (02/07/14): 
We   took two colonies from the 100µl plates of cells containing YFP and   inoculated them in LB media. These were left to grow overnight.  
We   centrifuged the cells transformed with GFP that had been inoculated in   LB media overnight. Using the pellet of cells produced we followed the   miniprep protocol to obtain the plasmid DNA.  
 
Day 7 (03/07/14): 
This morning we met to discuss ideas for the project. After the meeting with Mark Shepherd we had spent the last few days researching the idea of targeting   antimicrobial peptides to BMCs to deliver them to the gut and for   treatment of gastroenteritis/other conditions, or alternatively using   E.coli to produce fragrances. We discussed the pros and cons of each   project and collectively decided to further research into using the   production of fragrances in E.coli as an environmentally friendly   alternative to their current industrial production.  
Week 3
Day 8 (07/07/14): 
Today   we met in the library to decide on which genes we wanted to try and   insert into plasmids. We decided upon S-linalool synthase, R-linalool   synthase, E-E-germacrene-B synthase, patchoulol synthase, R-limonene   synthase, zingiberne synthase and geraniol synthase. We found the   sequences for these and also began looking at what promoters and   terminators we could use. We also began looking at using light to   activate the synthesis of these genes.  
 
Day 9 (08/07/14): 
Today   Taylor and Matt used the transformation efficiency kit to test the   efficiency of the competent cells we had made. These were plated and   left overnight to grow. 
We   also had a meeting with Wei-Feng, and discussed the lab work we have   carried out so far, the enzymes we have selected to try and put into   plasmids, and the best methods to do this. Wei-Feng suggested using   Gibson assembly to do this. Wei-Feng also suggested disregarding"

Adding to the storability, we realised that our tool needed to give a readout visible to the naked eye. At a farm, there are no fancy lasers or microscopes, so we had to get creative! We started by designing a microfluidics paper chip with GMOs with a kill switch to detect resistance genes, but gained crucial feedback on this.
Even if GMO kill switches were reliable, there is no public acceptance to use GMOs in the environment. If it will be accepted in the future, it will take years from now to legislate this principle. Innovation based on this gets stuck. Cecile van der Vlugt (Risk Assessor GMO)
This led us to come up with a new application: CINDY-Seq. This method allows for a simple yes or no answer to the question: is the pathogen causing mastitis in my cow resistant to penicillins, or even all β-lactamases depending on the design of Cas13a, in a matter of hours, without the use of GMOs in the environment. For more information on how CINDY-Seq works, please visit our coacervation design page.
Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as possible for a farmer, as farmers like to do most things themselves.
We try to do most things by ourselves to prevent high bills from the veterinarian. Tjerkje Poppinga (dairy farmer)
In the case of mastitis, the pathogen is present in the milk of the infected cow. By hitting the books and optimising existing protocols, we came up with an easy method to prepare a fresh milk sample for the detection tool. To know more about which methods we came up with, look at our sample prep design page where we describe this extensively.
Finally, our integrated human practices strategy helped us to think a step further about our design, regarding, for example, the costs involved in our device and what it should actually look like; what kind of ‘kit’ will it be and what will it contain? We also looked at the feasibility of our device in the context of whether or not farmers would actually be allowed to use such a device and what needs to be done considering legislation to make this possible.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Introduction
We developed a mathematical epidemic model to predict the population dynamics of cockroaches infected by our Metarhizium anisopliae since we can not do real experiment with our gene-modify product. We then performed numerical simulations on the model and sensitivity analysis on some key parameters. By doing so, we expected to estimate the efficiency with lethal time after using our ‘cockroach terminator’ indoors, and analyzed the impact of each relative factors that influence our product so as to modify our design.
Natural condition
In natural condition indoors, due to environmental resistance like food, water and space, the population of cockroaches is more likely to follow a S-shaped growth curve (sigmoid growth curve), which can be formalized mathematically by logistic function $\dfrac {dN}{dt}=rN\left( 1-\dfrac {N}{K}\right)$ .After we research papers and government researches, we found that
The average number of cockroach in Shenzhen family house is 38 The grow rate (r) is 0.61, And by assumption, we set the carrying capacity (K) to be 40.
After simulating the numerical solution (Figure 1), we can see that the cockroach population growing rapidly and reach to stationary state of 40 less than fifteen days. It’s necessary for as to control this worrisome infection.

After control
After we using M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder to control the cockroach population indoors, M.anisopliae will behave like an epidemic-like disease and spread out inside"

Consequently, there is the need to advance the methanol generating industry with a low proximity conversion system. This system will convert the methanol into a universal, complex, easy to handle and safe carbon source which is suited to be the starting point for a huge variety of industrial processes. As a result, the safety risks of using methanol are decreased remarkably while maintaining the high energy capacity of methanol.
Use of Modern Devices in the Lab
Even though biological laboratories in Germany are tightly regulated, biosafety is still a major concern to the public.
One question that we wanted to answer was: Are touchscreens a good idea in the lab?
tubefront is designed to be used with modern devices such as phones and tablets. But what about contamination risk when people use touchscreens in the lab? And how does it compare to computers with a mechanical keyboard?
To find out, we did a simple experiment: Sampling of microbes from keyboards and other surfaces in the lab.
Protocol
Making Chips
prepare 250 ml LB with 2 % Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast extract, 5 g Agar)
sterilize the black chip-mold by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol
fill the mold with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes
use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings
move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula
store at 4 °C
Sampling Procedure
using disinfected gloves, slightly press an agar chip onto the surface for 5 seconds
put the chip back into the petri dish and incubate at 37 °C for 24  hours
clean & disinfect the surface
for analysis count the number of:
bacterial colonies
fungal colonies
Results
In cooperation with team Slovenia HS [2] , we took samples from different surfaces in the lab.
Contamination of different surfaces
Multiple samples were taken from different surfaces in the lab. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C the number of bacterial/fungal colonies was counted and averaged.
The average numbers of colonies per agar chip show that keyboards are among the most contaminated surfaces in the lab. Smartphone touchscreens are equally"

Collaborations
Collaborations with institutions or other iGEM Teams promote exchange of experiences and know-how and lead to a benefit for both sides. Therefore, we got in contact with two local research institutions. They supported us with advice, materials and helpful methods for our experiments. One of the supporters was the Thünen Institute in Braunschweig with a research focus on the economy, ecology and technologies of rural regions, seas and forests. Dr. Ulf Prüße, an expert for renewables conversion technology, gave us professional advice for our experiments with the immobolization of E. cowli. Furthermore, we received lots of material from the institute and had the possibility to measure the methane degradation at their gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector.
An important part of the iGEM competition is the cooperation between the teams. In order to get in contact with other iGEM Teams from Germany, we joined the iGEM meet-ups in Munich and Aachen. We numerously represented the iGEM Team Braunschweig at both events and drew attention to our this year’s project. We used these opportunities to give presentations and obtained encouraging feedback and helpful ideas during the follow-up discussions. At the Munich meet-up we made contact with the iGEM teams from Aachen and Hanover, followed by some nice barbecue evenings with Team Hanover. We also met a few iGEMers from Aachen at the “Maker Faire” in Hanover and spent the day together. Team Aachen provided us with a self-engineered methane sensor which we would later put to good use in our experiments. Such collaborations were strengthened at the second meet-up which was held in Aachen in September. However, we did not only get in contact with teams nearby, but also with teams overseas. We had a skype video chat with the iGEM Team Waterloo and discussed our projects, and exchanged our experiences concerning the competition.

Refutation
Re: dangers of transgenic organisms: you would still be criminally liable for not controlling your creations; proposition proposes to still control what it does, just not how it’s made.
Re: domination by transgenic crops: genetic engineering can’t compete against 4 billion years of evolution; there is a reason why crops didn’t evolve to be the way we may engineer them – transgenic crops have significant weaknesses as well as strengths.
Re: importance of the environment: we wouldn’t argue we should live in caves so that dolphins can be happy – there are some sacrifices we are not willing to make, and sacrificing the potential good of genetic engineering is one we shouldn’t make.
Re: Monsanto law suit: Monsanto actually distributed the transgenic seeds they claimed spread naturally.
Re: using what we understand: if opposition is in favor of using what we understand, use genetic engineering as opposed to crop breeding, as genetic engineering is more targeted and gives greater control.
Arguments:
1. Role of the State: the role of the state is to regulate the release and not the existence of these organisms – regulate what actually does harm, not just what one is afraid of.
2. Improving the Research Environment: Research freedom attracts people willing to innovate, expanding useful areas of research, supporting economic growth and helping keep our nation globally competitive.

Re: genetic engineering gives us more control: we’ve bred animals for a long time and understand that technique much better. We are far from having a good understanding of organism engineering – even Dolly the Sheep died early.
Re: improving the research environment – safety takes priority over getting cool scientists.

    4.2 Fundamental type of the BioBrick
  The author of a BioBrick MUST assign the BioBrick a corresponding type. The choice has been limited by promoter, RBS, coding sequence, terminator, plasmid backbone and others. The choice ‘others’ means that the BioBrick is not a promoter, not a RBS, not coding sequence, not a terminator nor a plasmid backbone. The author can give the detail description following 4.3.
  There can be only one type specified.
    4.3 General description of the BioBrick
  A description is a MUST requirement for a qualified BioBrick. The function of the BioBrick SHOULD be written into the description if available. And characteristics as well as the physical properties and the best experiment environment are RECOMMENDED. Remember that any offended words or anything irrelevant to synthetic biology SHALL NOT be allowed.
    4.4 Status of the BioBrick
  In order to let users clearly know whether the BioBrick is working or not the status of the BioBrick SHOULD be specified. And the choices of the status are recommended as the following: available, building, cancelled, deleted, missing, planning, sent, unavailable.
    4.5 Categories that the BioBrick falls in
  Any BioBrick SHALL fall in at least one category in the following four categories shown in figure 1. The classification MUST be specified to at least the second level.   The form of the BioBrick category SHALL be like this:   // Chassis/ Yeast;   // Function/ Functions/Biofuels   The “//” indicates the beginning of a classification. A BioBrick can have more than one classification if there is any.   Figure 1 is the classification tree of the BioBricks. There are three levels; different levels are distinguished according to indentation.   For example, ‘Function’, ‘Chassis’, ‘Type’ and ‘Device’ are the first levels. ‘Plasmidbackbone’, ‘Promoter’ and ‘RBS’ are second levels in Type. And ‘Biosynthesis’, ‘Chromatin remodeling’ and ‘Enzyme’ are the third levels in ‘Protein Coding Sequence’.
