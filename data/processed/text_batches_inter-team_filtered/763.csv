UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," for our use case. We also launched contact with the Boston University iGEM team and had a video call to discuss our overall idea. They helped us iron out some of the challenges for using microfluidic devices in cancer diagnostics, and we kept this in mind for our design.
UCSD Biodynamics Lab
After selecting controlled flow devices as our primary interest, we met with several undergraduate and graduate researchers at the UCSD Biodynamics Lab, run by Dr. Jeff Hasty. Our conversations helped us realize that their are several key parameters to keep in mind for developing a mathematical representation of a microfluidic system . Because the laws of physics remain the same in microscopic and macroscopic systems but gives rise to different forces, we must consider how reduction of size has an influence of the characteristic times of the system. They also explained that , integrating microfluidic devices with synthetic biology can also have a number of benefits: faster response times, formation of static and dynamic gradients at sub cellular resolution.
Takeaway:
The Hasty Lab pointed us to foundational literature that gave us greater detail about the elements of a microfluidic device, how to design and fabricate each element, and how to use modeling to ensure the correct operation of the system. Consideration of all these parameters was crucial for the design of our prototype microfluidic system. Our conversations with them also led to exploration of biosecurity concerns, and helped us pivot to a cell-free system that can be more accurately modeled and also poses decreased threats to the environment in case of misuse or release.
Naila Chowdhury, Director of Social Innovation, and Dr. Suresh Subramani, TIGS
As part of our exploratory process, we also wanted to consider the larger questions and take into context the broader impact of what we were doing. We reached out to the director of Social Innovation, Ms. Naila Chowdhury, and explained the overall workflow. She expressed great interest and enthusiasm in our project, and helped affirm that through her work, she saw the utility of a cost-effective liquid biopsy test for hepatocellular carcinoma, especially because of its disproportional impact on the Hispanic population in the US with increasing rates of diagnosis, as well as its prevalence in South and Southeast Asia. She also introduced us to Dr. Suresh Subramani, the former vice-chancellor who expressed similar enthusiasm for our project. He helped us consider how we could potentially implement our idea on an international scale. As one of the presiding members of the TATA Institute of Genetics and Society, he was able to connect us to a number of other researchers who"

Date: the 26th of july
Protocol: [ RD1.1 ] and gelpurificaton (DE1.3)
Notes:because the concentration for both plasmid and biobrick is rather small I dobbelt the volumen of the reagent compared to the protocol. in the soultion contaning the brick the volumen of the PCR product was triple and to adjust the total volumen i added 5ul less water.  We made 2 Restriction mixtures which both were 4 times the mixture in the protocol. both the plasmid and brick was cut at the E and P site. After the cutting the plasmid and brick was run on seperate gels because of there different size. the plasmid on a 1,5% gel and brick on a 2% agarose gel. When I observed the gel under the UV lamp the was no visible band on the gel were the brick was loaded. therefore it was only possible to do DNA extrated from the gel contraining the plasmid. The Dna was eluted in 10ul of water and I eluted two times. The DNA concentration was measured on the NaonDrop and was found to 55,41ng/ul for the first elution and 28,03ng/ul for the second. the to samples are pooled and stored in a freeze tube.

In the case where the interaction between the two dCas9-gRNA complexes is not negligible (because the activating/inhibiting binding sites are too close or because the persistence length of the double stranded DNA changes significantly when it is open by dCas9) we have \(J\neq 0\). The situation is more complicated but we can still computing the binding probabilities using the total partition function \(Z\). However, in this case we will have an additional non-trivial parameter to estimate which is the interaction energy \(J\).
Assumptions
Modelers of biophysical systems often have a difficult mission. They must strike a compromise between developing a very detailed and accurate model and producing a simplistic one that may be easily analyzed and compared to experimental data.
Developing models implies making a certain number of simplifications and assumptions to enable it to conform to reality. In this section we will keep track of the assumptions we made in order to clarify our model. Since the same system may be modeled using different approaches, we will justify our choices and set of assumptions.
The most important assumption underlying our kinetic model is the fact that the concentration of a given species does not depends on spatial coordinates, i.e. it is the same in every region of the cell. This assumption is quite bold but is a common approach in the literature and usually produces accurate results [1]. The validity of this assumption is limited, for some species, by the small number of molecules present in the cell and by their localization in membranes or particular organels. In some cases it may also be necessary to consider the stochastic behavior of individual trajectories rather than global averages [1].
One of the challenges we faced while building the model was the lack of readily available kinetic constants. Since dCas9 is a newly discovered gene regulation technology [2], dCas9-gRNA and dCas9-gRNA/DNA binding/unbinding kinetics are still under investigation. One may imagine that the binding/unbinding constants are somewhat related to the gRNA sequence given the different chemical properties of nucleotide sequences. However, we will consider binding/unbinding constants to be gRNA-independent. For the gRNA/dCas9 interaction, this assumption is justified by the fact that the gRNA scaffold is always the same. For the dCas9-gRNA/DNA interaction, we can justify this hypothesis by thinking of an average nucleotide composition, as our synthetic sequences are randomly generated

2. GCODe Mini
Intro
The GCODe Mini is a sleek black acrylic cuboid that houses a test tube that will hold your culture. Connect the Mini to your laptop via USB, tell it what to do with our associated software, place it in the shaker-incubator, press Start … aaand you’re done !
The Mini can:
Take readings of the optical density at specified intervals for as long as required.
Alert you via pushbullet notifications when the OD increases by a specified amount, or at regular time intervals, or when the OD reaches a desired value.
Plot a graph of OD vs time.
Design
The GCODe Mini has two components, the Power Unit and the Analysis Unit. The Analysis Unit contains the Arduino, and the test tube. It will be connected to the laptop, and goes inside the shaker. The shaker should be plugged into the Power unit (which requires Mains power), so that it can be turned off during measurement to give a stable reading.

3. GCODe
Intro
While the Mini needed the culture to be grown in a test tube, the GCODe Pro works perfectly with the large quantities of a standard conical flask. It will automatically do dilution for you, which means it can measure an almost unlimited range of ODs, including those that occur in yeast and other organisms not compatible with regular plate-readers.
The GCODe Pro has the same analysis unit as the Mini, but uses a network of servos and a peristaltic pump to draw precise amounts of culture and dilute it to any desired level before measurement. Optical Density is measured by drawing the liquid into a standard cuvette, which allows the flexibility to grow unlimited amounts of culture in a conical flask or any other vessel.
Design
THe GCODE Pro has X main components
THe Analysis unit uses a cuvette supplied and drained by a needle, but the measurement system is the same as the one used in the Mini
The Sampling Unit draws liquid from the conical flask, or culture vessel, dilutes it as programmed, and delivers the culture to the cuvette. THe pipes are cleaned between every run by washing with ethanol.

Le ciblage nucléaire [7]
Le vecteur cellulaire libère, après une étape d’endocytose, le plasmide thérapeutique dans le cytoplasme de la cellule cible. Cependant, le plasmide doit absolument pénétrer le noyau pour assurer sa stabilité et son expression. Un plasmide quelconque n’atteindra que très rarement le noyau si on ne lui fournit pas, à la base, les éléments nécessaires au déclenchement d’un mécanisme d’incorporation nucléaire. Des études ont été menées sur l’utilisation de séquences spécifiques permettant l’importation nucléaire de séquences génétiques : les séquences DTS (Dna nuclear targetting sequence). La séquence SV40 du simian virus est bien connue pour jouer ce rôle.

The swimming agar experiment was repeated. Since the OD600 of the bacteria culture for the inoculation was too low, the plates were inoculated the next day. More concentrated aspartic acid solution was made by reacting with NaOH to make aspartic acid salt. A concentration up to 7 % was reached.  Also some salt was ordered to save doing this in future. This time, only 0.3 % agar plates were used. Two wells were made using the thick end of a 1000 µl pipette tip. In the left hole some aspartate solution was put and on the right some water (control). To half of the plates the solutions were added in the morning to allow chemotactic gradient to set up, to the second half the solutions were added immediately before the inoculation in the afternoon (arond 5 hours later). The E. coli MG1655 strain was inoculated three times on a line in the centre between the two holes and incubated overnight at the different temperatures: 25oC, 30oC and 37oC.
Today, the plates were photographed and measured. There was some significant movement more towards the aspartate (chemoattractant), but the difference should be more visible. Thus, various conditions should be tested during the next experiments.

Nevertheless, in the first chambers a blue dye in 0.3% agar (to represent aspartate) and an orange dye in 0.1% agar to represent the bacteria was put (beads were added in later experiments).

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship#Main_-_-_TEXT.html,"2017 ). Due to the versatility of our method, detection of other genes is easily achievable. Our model on the determination of the detection window will have to be adapted drastically, since it will have to take into account equestrian physiology as well as regulation cycles for the genes in question. All other components of our detection method will be easily convertible to horse racing.
Doping testing in equestrian sports works via an A-B-C system. First, the A sample is tested for doping. If the result is positive, the horse owner or trainer can decide to appeal. As part of this appeal, the B sample is tested with a more thorough detection method. The C sample is stored for (anonymous) research purposes. “Your pre-screen and screen fits with this model well.” Mellegers assured us. Since the appealing party pays for the testing of the B sample, cost is also less of an issue.
Testing speed is important in applying a detection method. “The time between placement matches and registration closing of the main match is often only one week,” Mellegers explains, “so a doping sample should be shipped to testing facilities abroad and analyzed in less than one week. Most of our tests take two to three days.” Herein lies the strength of our fast detection method compared to methods without pre-screen or efficient data-processing.
Blood will probably always be collected as a sample in the future. Currently, a doping official has 20 minutes with a horse to collect a sample. They initially try to receive an urine sample, but if the horse does not comply they take a blood sample. “In the future, we are planning to collect both samples always so that we have enough sample material to do advanced testing in cases of appeal.” according to Mellegers. For ADOPE, this means that blood sampling will remain relevant in equestrian testing.
Finally, we learned that transparency is incredibly important in equestrian sports. “Horse racing is built upon dreams” Mellegers says. If you are not completely transparent, people will mistrust any outcome and this will damage the sport greatly. All doping test results must be published immediately. Since transparency and being open source are values ADOPE embodies, we believe that our test will be a good match to the equestrian anti-doping policies.
“Horse racing is built from dreams.”
Camiel Mellegers, Doping official at the Dutch Trotting and Flatracing Association
To conclude, we will shortly discuss the potential of our detection method in the equestrian sports, motivated by the topics above. The threat of gene doping is real"

6.3 CsCl Gradient Phage Purification
1. Primary ideas
Direct evolution method
Separation method: ultracentrifugation sedimentation with sucrose gradient, size exclusion chromatography, TEM
Environment that would hasten evolution?
Limit nutrient as Dr. Kooyman suggested – affect host more than phage?
Different strains of E Coli – will phage still infect?
Selected phage can self replicate – storage
Purified product and DNA sequence can direct further engineering for drug delivery purpose (protein team’s job)
Site-directed mutagenesis
Identifying sites to mutate
Modeling: compare CP and scaffolding protein sequence of similar phage that has slightly different size, deduce from this possible sites that can be mutated to produce smaller phage
Capsid production
Introduce genes into E coli for expression and assembly – producing a novel machine that is not naturally found
How many genes to introduce into E coli?
Stability?
In vitro assembly?
Has been done with T7 genome in E coli extract (no cell)
Site directed mutagenesis of a genome (40kbp)
Our parts would be plasmid introduced into E coli, but capsid produced this way won’t need extracting DNA/RNA from capsid to make an empty carrier
2. Refined plans
Get the E coli and T7/Q beta to grow
Test with different Agar concentration – see if selection method works (evolution)
Sequencing if evolution occurs
Compare genome to find targets for point mutation
Playing around with phage genome
Knocking out the polymerase
Change genome size - experiment – could go bigger or smaller

Figure 25. (A) Dot blot of ferriTALE B exposed to FAM labeled DNA containing the B target sequence ( protocol ). 1 µg of ferritin fused to E coil was incubated with 2 µg of TALEB fused to k coil for 1hour to make the FerriTALEB complex. Subsequently the complex was blotted on the nitrocellulose strip. The blots were then exposed to 1.66 mM FAM labeled DNA for 1 to 90 minutes as indicated on the strips. The controls are to the right, with ""ftn"" being ferritin only, ""np"" being no protein, and ""D-"" being no DNA exposure. The kinetics from the densitometry is shown in section B of the figure. The Kd from this plot was determined to be 66nM.

A2 is TALEA soaked in 1mM FAM-labeled [B]. A3 is TALEA soaked in 1mM FAM-labeled [A]. On the A- strip no protein was blotted and it was soaked in 1.66mM [A]. All strips were soaked in DNA solution for 90 minutes. (B) 1uL of the DNA solutions used for soaking were blotted on nitrocellulose and a picture was taken instantly, to indicate that both [A] and [B] fluoresce to the same extent.
Can our coils bind?
After putting in gratuitous effort to build parts containing our coils and successfully purifying these proteins we wanted to determine if the E and K coils interacted with each other. In order to characterize coil-coil interaction we performed an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. We built a GFP with an E coil ( BBa_K1189014 ) and we also built TALE-B with a K-coil ( BBa_K1189030 ). To characterize the binding of the coils we pulled down with either an immunoglobulin G antibody ("

$$\frac{d[plasmid\,nucleus]}{dt} =k{kissociation2}[plasmid\,bound\,nucleus] + k_{unpack2}[complex\,nucleus]$$
$$- k_{cell\,death}[plasmid\,nucleus] \tag{16}$$
Detection of cell free doping DNA
Apart from the effect of the gene doping EPO on the production of red blood cells, the purpose of the model is to determine the dynamics of the detectable cfDNA concentration in the blood. Cell free doping DNA is released from dying infected cells and circulates in the blood where it is assumed to degrade at the same rate as natural cfDNA.
$$\frac{d[Doping\,DNA]}{dt} =k_{cell\,death}[plasmid\,nucleus]-kel_{cfDNA}[Doping\,DNA] \tag{17}$$
Equation 17 provides us with a detection window for which we assume that we can detect both, DNA left in the tissue and bloodstream after injection, and DNA released after cell death (kcelldeath). Any other degradation terms or transient expression we incorporated in the constants used. Based on the above model we obtained the concentration developments of cfDNA in time for both intramuscular and intravenous injections and the estimated detection windows where we assumed an estimated detection limit of 100 copies DNA. The concentrations of DNA over time were used in the laboratory for our sample preparation to mimic real life detection potential. The cell death rate constant is directly linked to the average lifetime of renal interstitial fibroblasts, which we estimated to be around 57 days based upon measurements in chicks by Weissmanshomer et al. 1975 .
According to Haller et al. 2018 , the expected concentration of doping cell free DNA may be higher for athletes in endurance and intermittent sports. Haller et al. found a 22.7 fold increase in venous cfDNA concentrations in footballers after a professional football match. Given the high amount of training top level athletes endure, this finding leads us to believe that the detection window might be even longer than our model predicts.
The Protein Effect
Lastly, the uptaken DNA can be translated into proteins according to equation 18, after which it can be exported to the extracellular environment according to equation 19.

When the enzyme concentration is much smaller than the substrate concentration, the product formation rate is:
\[\upsilon  = \frac{{d[P]}}{{dt}} = \frac{{{k_{cat}} \cdot [S] \cdot [E]}}{{{k_m} + [S]}}\]
Where，[S] is the substrate concentration, [E] is the initial enzyme concentration, [P] is the product concentration.
3.1.2  Law of mass action
The law of mass action is: the rate of the elementary reaction is proportional to the power of the concentration of each reactant, where in the power exponent of each reactant concentration is the stoichiometry of the reactant in the reaction equation, and the proportional constant is called the chemical reaction constant. For the following biochemical reactions:
By the law of mass action:
\[\frac{{d[C]}}{{dt}} =  - \frac{{d[A]}}{{dt}} =  - \frac{{d[B]}}{{dt}} = J\]
\[J = k \cdot [A] \cdot [B]\]
Where，\(J\) is called flux of chemical reaction.
3.2 Basic model
At a constant concentration of enzyme, the Michaelis-Menten equation describes the relationship between reaction rate and substrate concentration. Therefore, The biochemical reaction from glucose to butanol shown in Fig. 4 can be described by equations (2)-(9).

The somatosensory disorders are thus the main manifestation of neuropathies derived from MeHg poisoning. Their distribution pattern is a ""stocking-glove"", similar to the pattern found in peripheral neuropathies, however, due to the presence of the normal reflexes of the tensions of the members of patients whose chief complaint was paresthesia, canceled the diagnosis of this hypothesis, since it occurs in fact, diffuse lesion in the somatosensory cortex, represented by Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3. To measure such disturbances are measured thresholds of touch and two-point discrimination.
Figure 11 - Standard neuropathies Stocking-Glove.
Figure 12 – Brodmann map.
The threshold of touch, in general, becomes high in general in the whole body, including distal and proximal regions, again in contrast with the characteristics of peripheral neuropathy, only where there is an increased threshold at the ends. The threshold for two-point discrimination, or epicritical touch, was found to be twice also generalized way. Regions such as the tongue, lips, fingers and thumb represent areas with the greatest loss of sensitivity due to the fact these possess large areas in the cortex devoted to their sensitivity. Besides affecting the somatosensory cortex, MeHg poisoning is also capable of causing damage to the granular layer of the cerebellum, generating a phenomenon called cerebellar ataxia, which is characterized by lack of coordination of voluntary muscle movement, balance and planning movements. Finally, damage to various areas of the cortex, such as the primary visual area in the occipital lobe, or primary auditory area in the temporal lobe may cause damage corresponding to the area in which they are working and causing symptoms such as loss of visual acuity, acoustic, among others.

Chitosan
Aim of the chitosan subproject was the production of chitosan in an expression system. To achieve this, the chitin synthase NodC and one of the chitin deacetylases NodB or COD had to be encoded on a plasmid.
Already existing BioBricks from the iGEM Team Darmstadt 2017 ( ChiTUcare ) were used for the cloning of the enzymes in a plasmid. BioBrick BBa_K2380002 encoding NodC combined with an arabinose inducible promoter was used as vector.
After having recieved plasmid DNA from iGEM Team Darmstadt transformation was successfully conducted and plasmid DNA isolated using Monarch Plasmid Miniprep Kit (NEB). In parallel, 10 ng of pUC19 plasmid DNA were transformed to evaluate the transformation efficiency of the prepared competent E. coli DH5α cells. Transformation efficiency proofed to be about 107 cfu/µg.
Plasmids were checked by restriction digestion using XbaI and PstI to excise the inserts from the pSB1C3 backbone. The respective agarose gel is shown in figure C.1.

Except for BBa_K2380044 (COD basic part) all fragment sizes matched the expections.
Construction of combined BioBrick containing nodC and nodB
BBa_K2380002 was opened at the BioBrick suffix using SpeI and PstI. The COD ORF including the preceeding RBS was excised from BBa_K2380042 by double digestion using NheI and PstI. After agarose gel electrophoresis of the COD sample the respective band at about 1400 bp was cut out and eluted in 10 µL ddH2O using ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research). The NodC"

The Oxford iGEM team has conducted a study on the presence of Europe in the competition .
Case Study: China and the USA
Consider two examples: On one hand, we have the USA, visible in the first map as the country with most citable publications (87,600). It keeps its throne in the second map with almost 2 million citations. Here it should be noted that the second country, Germany, ranks to only around half a million.
On the other hand, we have China. In the second place, with 37,225 citable documents, it slips to place 6 when it comes to citations. With about 285,000 citations, it falls below countries like the UK and France that occupy the 6th (20,065 publications) and 8th (13,652 publications) place respectively in the citable documents ranking.
For the h-index of both countries, which measures the productivity and impact of published work of a scientist or scholar, the US maintains the top spot, while China slips to 13th. The UK, which only produces around 60% of citable documents compared to China, is placed 3rd. Australia, with less than 8,000 citable publications, is ranked just 2 places below China (SJR 2014).  It seems language barriers can reduce impact of published work from non-native English speaking countries. Whilst many cultural and socioeconomic factors contribute to the discrepancy between China’s publishing output and h-index rankings language also has a role to play (Moed 2002)
University Case studies: Team Members are Multinational
Needs and introductory sentence e.g. iGEM is international between teams but also within teams. The competition attracts top universities and top universities attract students from around the world.
In the UK, 18% of the student population comes from outside the country. That translates to about 425,000 students. If we take a look specifically into institutions that have the longest history of participation in iGEM, the numbers are even higher: In our very own Imperial College London, 44% of the students come outside of the UK. Cambridge, the first UK University to participate in the competition has a population of 33% foreign students and the University of Edinburgh includes 35% non-UK students in its body (UKISA 2013).

As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthetic biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthetic biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend. However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong(in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang(in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and "

Got review literatures and questions and answers sessions from DTU Biosustain. We are added to DTU Biosustain’s online help platform in slack. And got many answers from DTU Biosustain experts, both online and in person at helpdesk sessions. Model is validated using Cameo with published and unpublished data from DTU Bioengineering, model is considered good enough to simulate general trends from substrate constraints. Tried to move on to strain design investigation using gene KO. Attempted but failed at making OptGene work. Returned no results. Attempted but failed at plotting fluxes on Escher due to reaction and metabolite IDs mismatch and the lack of Y. lipolytica metabolism maps. Same problem with KEGG maps, we do not have the right IDs to plot fluxes. It would be too time consuming to find the IDs or build a map on Escher ourselves, solution pending.

From these statistics we realized that some of the problems such as leakage and lack of robustness are universal. Some teams provided their solutions, like changing the vector/sensor/promoter and decreasing plasmid copy number, but most admitted that they had no idea if these methods would work. This is why NEON system is important: it might provide a solution to improve unsatisfying expression results. Finally, nearly all of the teams agreed that our project would be one prospecting solution to their problems. To us, this was a great encouragement and urged us to further explore the potential of our NEON system.

She did a single digest with EcoRI-HF to test if the EcoRI site is in the synthase or not. Chris Keeling emailed Daisy the sequence he used for the truncation of the 3-Carene synthase.
A couple days later, the sequencing results came back. The NAPS unit (the place we send our samples to be sequenced) said there was no signal from the results.
Below is an example of the chromatogram that came.
1,8-Cineole
Gurpal attempted to remove restriction sites from the PgxeTPS-Cin synthase gene, for Jacob, by doing a SDM-PCR. After doing it, he ran the PCR product through a gel and nothing showed up. Fortunately...
Jacob ran successful a SDM-PCR to remove a restriction site as verified by restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. He transformed competent cells with his SDM-PCR product and also ran SDM-PCR on another, closely related synthase (isolated from a hybrid between Picea glauca and Picea englmanii, as opposed to a pure Picea glauca). He ran Raf's mini-prep protocol on transformed cells to isolate a plasmid containing the SDMed pg-TPS-cin gene.

”You can’t build a society without law” - Naftali Bennett
Our project is oriented to the safe sending of encrypted information through conventional means (such as regular post) rather than only on the pure storage in bacteria. For that we are providing the Bacillus subtilis spores with several biologic layers.
In this part of Human Practices, we explore the current national and international legislations that the CryptoGErM system must obey in order to ensure its safe and unrestricted shipping.
National Legislations
With the advising of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu; RIVM) from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport from the Netherlands we consulted the current national law requirements and international legislations that regulate the sending of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
Currently, the shipping of GMOs is strictly regulated in The Netherlands.
Such regulations are stated in the articles 3rd and 4th from the Environmental Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms (Regeling genetisch gemodificeerde organismen milieubeheer 2013) [1] . These articles state the norms for the deliberate shiping of GMOs within the Netherlands; if the shiping of the Bacillus subtilis spores from the CryptoGErM system is intended within the Netherlands, it must obey this legislation.
According to these articles, “the shipping of Genetically Modified Organism within an Institute, or aboard a ship, must occur in accordance with the following guidelines”
GMOs must be transferred in a closed, unbreakable, non leaking containers
Containers of GMOs must be disinfected before shipping
The dispersion of GMOs to the environment must be avoided by applying the relevant safety measures.
We applied these regulations for the design of the shipping container used for the sending of CryptoGErM spores.
International Legislations
The next step was looking for international laws that regulate the shipping of GMOs around the world, since one of the applications of CryptoGErM is the shipping of Bacillus subtilis spores containing sensitive information across borders.
European legislations

It was also a method the  ZJU-China 2012 iGEM team   used to show the effectiveness of their riboscaffold design, and we therefore had their experimental protocols as a reference. By creating a standard curve for the unbound enzymatic reaction of the IAA pathway and comparing this to our scaffolded reaction, we could analyse how co-localising IaaM and IaaH onto our Assemblase scaffold impacts product yield.
This could be further built upon through the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These techniques would allow us to separate, identify and quantify each component the reaction mixture of the IAA biosynthesis pathway. This would not only give us an understanding of how the product yield would change when the enzymes were attached to our scaffold but also allow us to understand the changes in the concentration of the reaction intermediate substrate. This is important as it will enable us to consider the probability of undesired reactions occurring in our system, another key functional requirement (FR1.1: Reduce the probability of encountering undesired reactions). Due to the accessibility of the HPLC protocol and its ability to produce accurate results, we decided to set up this enzyme assay first.
4. Plants
The team also wanted to demonstrate the functionality of our biosynthesised IAA. After revising  the 2011 iGEM Imperial College London  team’s project, it was decided that a similar plant based root growth assay could be performed. Using the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, we would be able to investigate how varying concentrations of IAA affect the growth and development of the plants. As well as using this to connect the use of our scaffold to a commercial application, we wanted to develop a protocol for testing IAA which would enable us to observe whether the IAA produced from reaction by enzymes fused to our scaffold would have the same phenotypical effects as the IAA which is already commercially available.

Tsinghua-A team 2013 have done some promotion of iGEM HS in China with the help of ITCCC (International Teenager Competition and Communication Center), a Chinese organization devoted to the promotion of science and technology competitions for young people. We went to Haidian foreign language experimental school and had a lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM, which had attracted nearly 300 students, and through this lecture we got some helpful and beneficial communication and interaction with those students. After that, we give some guidance towards their iGEM HS team’s experiment, project and competition. And in the iGEM HS 2013 competition the Haidian Foreign Language Experimental School team got an Individual Awards.
Our team member Lei Wei participate the Synthetic Biology and IGEM Exchanging Meet, held by Nanjing University, on April 26th, 2013. As our team leader in the last year, he shared his experience in doing research of synthetic biology and his feelings about participating the iGEM competition. Also, as a non-biotechnology-major student, whose major is Automation, he shared his experience and feelings standing on the Automation field, which would give students attending the meet some different inspirations.
We also collaborate with Nanjing-china team. As a team coming from Department of Biology, they were not so good at building model and coding, so they asked for our help to build model and code for them. They sent their circuit to us, and through our hardworking we finally sent the equations and codes back to them. They did some more work basing on our code and got the result meeting expects.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," excitement, the donor transfer light received to acceptor which emits a different light (Piston and Kremers, 2007). BRET is similar to FRET in that donor/acceptor pair is required, but BRET need not external source, rather it is powered by oxidation of substrates (Pfleger and Eidne, 2006). It seems that for our purposes FRET and BRET are too complicated and doesn't offer good enough signal to noise ratio in our application to justify the use of them. Instead we should focus on simple biochemical reporters, i.e. those enzymes mentioned above.
I have started working on the kinetics of those reporter enzymes.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The focus of this week has been the kinetics of those enzyme based reporter genes. There are two approaches to their kinetics, one based on chemical kinetics uses coupled ODEs and another using the results of enzyme kinetics reporting values such as Km and V. I was not trained in enzyme kinetics so I found a textbook by Cornish-Bowden to learn the techniques (Cornish-Bowden, 2012). This took up most of the week.
The kinetics of horseradish peroxidase in the context of being used for waste water treatment can be found by the work of Carvalho et al. (2006). Even though we intend to use horseradish peroxidase in the context of reporter gene, but we believe the catalytic activities will be the same, so the reaction pathways for pehnols in that paper can be readily adopted for our use. On the other hand the kinetics of fluorescence of β-galactosidase has been studied by Huang (1991). However the kinetics presented is very simple compared to work done by Metelkin et al. (2009). We need to decide whatever the detailed model will give us better results to justify their complexity.
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
In this week four models of enzyme kinetics have been built in Mathematica for the study of β-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase. By using the built-in function Manipulate, we can inspect the impact of substrate/enzyme concentration on the time course of the product of interest. In special cases, such as one model for horseradish peroxidase, even temperature can be varied as well.
It was noticed that some models predict negative concentrations of enzyme intermediate even though the governing equations were correct. We believe this was due to the stiffness of the system,"

Sheffield,2017,Team:Sheffield#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,"ance also involves using electrodes to measure the amount of stored electrical charge across the bacterial solution. As the bacteria grow the capacitance increases.
3- Opacity refers to the transmittance of light through a sample. As the bacteria grow, the solution becomes more turbid and less light is transmitted through the sample which can be detected by a light-sensitive sensor.
4- Light Microscopy refers to the viewing of small objects, bacteria in this case, at a magnified view with the use of lenses. A camera could then be set up to take automated photos of the bacteria which allows the user to watch them grow over time.
5- A pH meter can be used to measure the pH increases during bacterial growth.
Impedance Microbiology:
One of the methods that was considered to measure the bacterial growth was by measuring the change of the impedance, or the electrical resistance, across the bacterial sample. As bacteria grow they release soluble ionic compounds, known as electrolytes, into their growth medium. As the concentration of the electrolytes in the solution increases the impedance of the solution decreases. As a result, this decrease in impedance has a direct correlation to the increase in the number of bacterial and can be quite sensitive (Grossi et al., 2008). As electronic components can be relatively cheap to source, the team investigated whether the construction of a low-cost impedance microbiology kit would be feasible to implement.
To investigate the feasibility of this idea a Monte Carlo simulation was run to see sample resistance curves with bacterial growth, for various types of bacteria. A model was then derived from literature (figure 1) to show expected resistance changes for the sample size and used well plate data to determine parameters such as expected final bacterial number.
Figure 1: This graph shows how various different bacteria with different specific growth rates could affect the change in resistance of the solution as the bacteria grow.
The resistance changes are on the micro-ohm scale. These small changes are very difficult to measure accurately at a low cost so the decision was made not to pursue impedance as a measure of bacterial growth.
Capacitance:
After the realisation that measuring the change in impedance would not be feasible, it was found that similar equipment could be used to measure the capacitance of the bacterial solution instead. Capacitance occurs when two conductor plates (ie: able to transmit electric current) are separated by an insulator, and a current is applied to the conductors, creating an electric field between the plates (figure 2); with positive charge collecting on one plate and the negative charge collecting on the other (Miller and Simon, 2008).

This week, we did minipreps of construct 11* ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 + TALE A +Link+βlac) of the colonies that showed correct bands in the colony PCR. Following the successful verification digest (Figure 22), the samples were sent for sequencing. We did a Kapa PCR of BBa_J04500 + TALE A , but the gel of the PCR products showed a band size that was approximately 1000bp less than expected. This PCR was done so we could use it for other constructions. Instead we ordered new primers to try a different approach to our remaining constructs.

No contamination is observed in the negative control without DNA, the positive control shows no bands however the BBa_J04500 lane shows bands at 2100bp and 2300bp, the backbone and uncut plasmid are expected at 2070bp and 2290bp. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.

Therefore it would be necessary to perform protein engineering to exchange these cystein residues for other amino acid residues in order to increase the stability of this protein.
Kill-Switch
Safety is one of the most important issues in synthetic biology. Therefore we implemented a kill switch into our project. For us, it was important to use a trigger, which is ubiquitously present in the environment and absolutely autonomous. We therefore developed a light-triggered kill switch . With this system, the transgenic moss could be cultivated under blue filter foil. As long as the moss grows under this blue foil no red light can be absorbed by the moss, so it stays alive. As soon as the moss escapes from this protected environment the red light is present and the kill switch is activated. The system was modularized into a sensor module and a suicide module. The sensor domain consists of a split TEV protease which is attached to either the proteins PhyB or PIF. These two proteins dimerize when red light is present and therefore lead to the dimerization of both split TEV subunits, so the reconstitution of the TEV protease is initiated. The suicide module consists of  a nuclease which is anchored to the intracellular membrane by a linker which contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a TEV cleavage site. As soon as the sensor module is reconstituted by red light, the TEV protease cleaves the cleavage site at the membrane localized nuclease. Thereby the nuclease is liberated, is transported to the nucleus due to the nuclear localization signal and, in the end, fragments the genome. The choice to use a nuclease instead of siRNA was for example driven by our modeling approach in which we found the siRNA suicide module to be less effective as there is a negative feedback loop which impedes the efficient killing of moss cells.  We have transformed moss cells with this kill switch and have protected the resulting growing cells, as mentioned before, by blue foil. However when we opened the blue foil after the selection process, all moss cells were dead. This can be explained by a drastically reduced transformation efficiency as the kill switch DNA was >10 kDa or by the fact that the kill switch is reliably killing the cells even without a trigger. In order to test the sensor module in vitro, we have produced the two fusion proteins in vitro as recombinant proteins and have attempted to purify them, which was not successful as the proteins are probably not stable in"

Conclusions
NOTE: These will be better understood once the reader has gone through the details (""Learn More"").
The greater the strength of the Lac promoter, the greater the repressive action of LacI prior IPTG induction.
The greater the Lac promoter leakiness (kleak) the greater the basal amount of expression of protein of interest, prior IPTG induction.
The greater the amount of IPTG introduced, the greater the production of protein of interest.
Here we assumed that the range of IPTG we have introduced is non-toxic for our cells. Growth curves will tell us whether IPTG does limit cell growth at the ranges we are interested in.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#biosynthesis#violacein_-_-_TEXT.html," color of other two cultures. Figure 1b: significant difference in color of violacein extracts of the incubated cultures. Violacein was extracted from the incubated cultures. A strong difference in color intensity is visible between the extracts of all three cultures, among which the extract of the culture containing a plasmid with the DNA program exhibits the most intensive purple color.
We further analyzed the extracts using more sensitive methods, e.g. thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with densitometry, mass spectrometry (for a detailed description of the protocols see the page ""Methods""). Results show that in additon to violacein and deoxyviolacein, exctracts of bacterial cultures with enzymes without zinc finger domains contained many more side products (Figure 3, line 3), particularly deoxychromoviridans. The identity of all compounds was determined by mass spectrometry and absorbance spectra. However, a significant decrease of deoxychomoviridans and deoxyviolacein product formation was detected, when program DNA was present (Figure 2, compare lanes 2 and 3).
Figure 2: More violacein and less side products deoxyviolacein and deoxychromoviridans is produced when DNA program is present. Violacein in the samples +/- DNA program was extracted, analyzed by TLC and the amounts of each compound quantified by densitometry.
Figure 3: Denzitometric analysis (right) and the ratio (left) of violacein, deoxyviolacein and deoxychromoviridans in samples with DNA program and without a program.  Densitometry scan of samples after TLC analysis indicate that deoxychromoviridans was only present in the sample without a program, while In the presence of DNA program, violacein was the predominant compound produced, followed by deoxyviolacein. No deoxychromoviridans was detected in samples with DNA program.
Most important, the yield of violacein when program DNA was present has improved ~6-fold and ~2 fold, in comparison to yield when no or scrambled DNA program was present, respectively (Figure 4).
Figure 4: Violacein accumulates faster in the culture with the DNA program and results in a higher yield of violacein production compared to cultures with scrambled  or no DNA program.  Samples were analyzed as above. Figure A shows faster production of violacein in cultures containing DNA program. Figure B shows quantification of violacein in samples taken after 24 hours"

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a patch for burn & chronic wound healing (see below).
Requirements:
Modularity: The living material must be capable of performing different functions by exchanging the type of incorporated genetically engineered E. coli.
(Bio)safety: The living material must be designed in such a way that it is safe for both the users and the environment. This necessitates that bacterial leakage is prevented and the material                              is non-toxic and biodegradable.
Viability: The living material must be a permissive environment for E. coli, allowing their survival and functioning in the material for a prolonged periods of time.
Robustness: The living material must be able to withstand and function in a variety of conditions it might be subjected to in a real world application.
Preferences:
Affordability: The production and maintenance of the living material is at a reasonable cost for the application.
Ease of manufacturing & scalability: To allow widespread use of this new technological innovation, production should be straightforward and allow for upscaling of the manufacturing procedure to industrial scale.
Sustainable: The living material and its production process must be environmentally-friendly.
User friendliness: The material should be easy to use by the end user for a certain application.
Constraints:
Considering the expertise of our department in E. coli biology compared to other bacterial strains, E. coli was the only logical candidate bacterial platform for our project.
Our material of choice for a living material is a hydrogel, a polymer network with water as dispersion medium. Hydrogels are inherently biocompatible, permeable and have a high water content.                          This makes them an ideal matrix for living materials (1) . Their use as cell                       delivery vehicles (2) and scaffolds for tissue engineering (3) proves                        their suitability as a viable environment for micro-organisms. We quickly realized that our hydrogel has conflicting demands.                        It should prevent bacterial escape but also have an open porous structure to allow free diffusion of oxygen, nutrients,                        signaling molecules and proteins. Simple physical entrapment of the bacteria would therefore not suffice. We envisioned                        that the solution to this conflict is to actively tether E. coli tightly to our material. In this way, we prevent the                        diffusion of E. coli out of our gel while allowing the free transport of solutes. Our hydrogel-anchor combination should                        thus act as a sort of prison, keeping the E. coli bacteria alive and functional, but restricting their movement.                        The concept of Gelcatraz was born.

Therefore, after this analysis our aims for middle and long-term emerged. The middle-term aim is going to be reached within five years. We contemplated the necessary production for the total area of apple at Chihuahua state.
The long-term aim expected to be reached within ten years, we intend to cover the national demand, considering that the cultivated surface will increase through this time.
Product Concept & Customer
Global food industry and security today are vulnerable due to massive growth of human population, climate changing will place huge demands on natural resources, the emergence of new virulent pathogens that had antibiotic or pesticide resistance, and demands from increasingly discerning consumers for chemical-free, sustainably produced food products that ensures a yield improvement on less cultivable land space. Bacterium based biological control agents are used as part of an integrated management system, which promotes sustainable agriculture. Based on the method of using the power of natural biology to reach a desired result in the field there is an effective solution to bridge societal, growth needs and allow farmers to be productive and environmentally conscious.
Currently, there is an extensive range of products used as biological controls that offer alternatives to different problems that afflict farmers, especially fruit growers from Mexico, the United States and the rest of the world. However, all of these alternatives that are currently in the international market share the same disadvantages; having a very low-efficiency level and prices out of reach, making the investment not profitable, speaking of millions of dollars in the case to control the incidence of the fire blight on apple trees.
These are some reasons why our value propositions are not only focused on providing a solution with high efficiency to control this disease but also offers a higher survival of biological control into the plant of interest at a lower price in which it is usually found for sale.
Customer
Through extensive interviews we have done with experts and producers involved in apple breeding, even leading Latin America apple market such as “La Norteñita”(Labs, S., 2017), it was found that our initial hypothesis, which established that any farmer/company with"

King's B Protocol
Written by Katariina Jaenes
KB Introduction
In order for bacteria to be successfully cultured, they must be grown in the appropriate media. King's B media, formulated by King et al,. Is a nonselective media that is a standard for culturing Pseudomonas species, as it allows for quick growth and high yields. Therefore, the proper preparation of King's B will be crucial to maintaining our bacterial stock throughout the summer. Furthermore, addition of agar to King's B creates a gel for bacteria to grow upon, and is therefore used for plating bacterial cultures on petri dishes. We will be preparing our own King's B as well as our own King's B agar plates, which will be used to culture Pseudomonas putida F1.
KB  Basic Terminology and Concepts
Agar vs. Agarose: Agar is used for making petri plates to culture organisms, while agarose is used for making gels, in the likes of SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis
KB Safety Precautions
SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets.
PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back.
Autoclave: The autoclave should only be handled by execs. Note that any autoclaved materials may still be hot and should therefore be handled with caution. Be careful not to burn yourself.
KB Materials and Equipment
Note: this recipe is for 500ml of LB, which makes approximately 18 plates. King's B can be kept for 3-4 months
Reagents

Opening the Lab to the public
23rd-24th July. We invited groups of international summer exchange students to our department.  We took the opportunity to introduce them to Synthetic Biology and iGEM, shared our lab experience and organized small demonstration session. The sessions sparked a lot of interesting questions, enthusiasm and potential future iGEMmers!
Cafe Synthetic
August 4th. Cafe Synthetic is a monthly science meetup at the local Panther Arms pub, open to anyone interested in Synthetic Biology. We signed up to present our iGEM project and get some critical discussions going. The event was attended by scientists from diverse fields and Salil's presentation captured everyone's attention.

Table 2: Table of reactions performed according to the DoE salt supplement screening design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of each salt supplement according to the table above. The pattern column shows whether a salt was present (✔)  or absent (X) from the system.
Experimental Procedure 1
Cell extracts were prepared from E. coli BL21 cells using sonication. A CFPS supplement premix solution was prepared as above, except the salts were omitted. Separate solutions for each salt were prepared and added to each CFPS reaction according to the main effects screening design. Reactions were performed as above and CFPS activity was measured as fluorescence at each time point minus fluorescence at 15 mins (Figure 4). Endpoint data was then used, along with the JMP software, to build a model predicting the important factors (Figure 5).
Figure 4: CFPS activity of CFPS reactions with salt concentrations according to the main effects screening design (table 2) was determined as fluorescence intensity at each time point minus fluorescence intensity at the 15 minute time point. Reaction IDs are described in table 2.
Figure 5: Screening model constructed using JMP showing which factors were closest to significance. Predictions for interactions are unreliable due to forced orthogonality (*). Of the primary factors, magnesium glutamate is the closest to significant, followed by potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate in that order.
Design Stage 2

From top to bottom: design type, number of reactions required by the design, colour map on correlations, Power analysis of terms, efficiencies, and average prediction variance. For the colour map on correlations, red is highly correlated and blue is highly un-correlated.
The three salts which the screening design determined as being the most important (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate) were analysed further. A surface response design was used to help determine optimal concentrations for each salt in the CFPS supplement premix solution. The JMP software was used to create a classical surface response design for magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate.

TTC ⇒ TTT (Codon usage bias increases: .49 to .51)
RecA Test Circuit: The cI repressor is constitutively produced and binds to the repressible promoter under normal settings.
Activated RecA then cleaves the cI repressor, causing transcription of RFP. However, if RecA exhibits recombinant activity, then the homologous double terminator regions will recombine. This causes the deletion of the repressible promoter and RFP.

It was a great challenge for the tissue engineering, one feasible method is 3D printing: constructing the ultimate pattern and size of the tissues directly. Another method is to program the pattern in need. The later one is closer to the natural process and it lasts longer. The combination of these two method can be used to build a bio-construction and help the researchers to understand the basic principles of the biological pattern formation.
However, neither the scientific complexity nor the technological uncertainty of the research has been thoroughly studied. In addition, the legal and ethical concerns of its social and humanitarian impact is largely yet to be addressed. Proper regulations should be developed to support the innovation and related application transformation while protecting the public from potential harms.

Education
One of our most successful educational initiatives this year is that our team wrote and published a handbook which combined the synthetic biology, bioinformatics and molecular biological technology to give the public a better understanding of the synthetic biology and what synthetic biology can do for our life. Also, we state a brief introduction of the iGEM competition and the team of HZAU-China .
In order to use the opportunity of working and learning with students to the maximum, we hosted a freshman reception to the college of life, science and technology in Huazhong Agricultural University. In which we give a introduction of the bio-pattern formation and synthetic biology, we gave a invitation for the students to visit the HZAU-China Laboratory in the same time.
Public Engagement
HZAU-China took part in calculating system biology conference which hosted by the college of science in Huazhong Agricultural University on March,2016. The conference lasted 3 days and talked about the bio-power system and the synthetic biology. We helped the meeting to conduct smoothly and discussed some topics about synthetic biology and questions of our project this year with the expert and professors who participated the conference.

The NJU iGEM team believes there are two main aspects of “Human Practices”: public outreach to the non-technical community as well as education engagement; and collaboration within the academic and iGEM community. For both sides, we participated in a series of engagement exercises, including consulting with patients and doctors about potential application spaces for our research technology, educational and investigating outreach to the local Nanjing community, and collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to improve their projects and presentations.
filter_dramaQuestionnaire and Propagation online
We believe science is everywhere and it is a part of each person’s everyday life. For most people without science background, synthetic biology and targeting therapy seems to be a very far-off topic. In order to offer better understanding about synthetic biology and the targeting therapy applied in our project, we did a grand scaled questionnaire on social network and then gathered data for a thorough analogy.
Conclusion of normal group questionnaire
Basic situations of the investigation group
● Effective investigation number: 780.
● Age distribution: 18~50 years of age accounted for the dominant.
● Education level: 66.67% for bachelor degree, the survey group basically has the education background of high school or above.
● Family economic conditions: the vast majority of respondents are of well-off level.
The respondents’ understanding of cancer is relatively simple, one-sided and inadequate.
The way of understanding cancer is limited. Most people learn about it from media reports, even though they are uneven in quality.
Figure 1. Rumor of Tumors…
● While the respondents generally recognize that if detected early, cancer can be treated and cured in time, the data notes that there are still nearly 15% of respondents identifying cancer as a terminal and incurable disease.
● The majority of respondents still have a fear of malignancy cancer, which is believed to be their nightmare scenario. Notably, among the 780 valid surveys, only 39.1% are aware of that, during the last decade in China, LUNG cancer made the highest mortality rates amid all types of cancers; 30.9% chose liver cancer, which is of the same high degree of malignancy with Lung cancer; the remaining 30%"

Protocol
Put two gel glass pieces together in the correct orientation  (should be small space between them) and clip into the gel apparatus
Add about 5 mL of separating gel in between the two glass pieces (ensure it does not leak)
Add a thin layer of isopropanol on top of the separating gel to form a smooth line
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Rinse out the isopropanol with water
Add about 2 mL of the stacking gel on top of the separating gel and add the gel comb
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Place the gel into the gel running apparatus and lock it in place. Ensure the side with the larger piece of glass is facing outward. If there is only one gel, add empty glass pieces to the other side
Put the gel into the gel box and fill with 1x SDS Running Buffer. Ensure the middle section between the gels is filled with buffer
Load samples
Run gel at 100V until samples leave the well and increase the voltage to 150V. Or run the gel at lower voltages (~90V) to get cleaner bands
When the gel is done running, fix it with destaining solution (50% water, 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min
Stain the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1h
Destain the gel with water or destaining solution

This is particularly significant now as the world population is ever increasing; the higher the agricultural yield the more people that can be supported. An accurate NO sensor can allow a farmer to be able to better utilise their resources and to accurately apply fertiliser, water and needed farming techniques to maximise the crop yield.
Medicine

Nitric oxide is an important physiological signalling molecule within the human body. This highly reactive molecule is produced through the action of enzymes called nitic oxide synthases (NOS).  There are three main types of NOS in the body, which each produce NO for a different physiological role: inducible (iNOS), endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) (Xu, W. et al. 2002). NO in the blood, causes vasodilation through increase of cGMP, a second messenger which activates many receptors and processes (Ferreira, L.F. et al 2010). As NO signalling is so widespread within the body there are many applications NO sensors can have in medicine.
Whilst NO triggers several defence mechanisms within the innate immune response, it has been found that some bacteria, such as the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, are able to use increased NO levels (produced by nitric oxide synthase-2) to promote their colonisation of host cells; culminating in a condition known as listeriosis. L. monoctogenes is absorbed from donor to recipient cell within vacuoles, and as NO decreases the rate at which the immune response destroys these vacuoles the bacteria is increasingly successful (Cole, C. et al. 2012). A system which is able to both detect and decrease levels of nitric oxide would thus be highly advantageous in therapeutic strategies to treat L. monocytogenes infection.
Cancer Research
This image is a logo which represents a future application of how our BioBricks could be used to produce a bacteria capable of acting as a cancer thereapeutic.
All the isoforms of NO synthases aforementioned are involved in the promotion or inhibition of the tumour cells (Xu, W. et al. 2002). Research has shown that high levels of NO can be cytotoxic /or cytostatic to tumour cells; however, at the low levels produced by tumour cells, NO signals angiogenic factors"

The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe our plasmids were not what we believed them to be. Eventually it was discovered that we were using an incorrect amount of Q5 2x master mix which caused the PCR to not work properly.
Since our project would eventually require separate experiments with 5 different inserts, our first goal in lab was the amplification of our experimental base plasmid. We first created a stock of ampicillin selective plates with a concentration of 100ug/mL. We carried out a transformation with NEB DH5α chemicompetent cells and created a glycerol stock of leftover cells after plating. We plated out transformants on 3 plates at original strength, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions using glass beads. Our platings were successful, and we used the 100-fold dilution plate to isolate single colonies and create a monoclonal culture of transformants. We also learned how to plate with a sterile wire loop in order to keep the number of plates used to a minimum. Every protocol--pouring plates, transformations, platings, and creating glycerol stocks--was new to us and required some reading of protocols from NEB and other sources.
Created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of four S. cerevisiae strains obtains from the Heinrich lab at UCSC. Did a second attempt of miniprepping the pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli, but unfortunately had salt contamination in our resulting sample. We attempted this a third time by tossing out flow-throughs between each step of the miniprep procedure and obtained workable plasmid samples for pXRL2 and pUC19.
Primers came in and were rehydrated.
We performed our first attempt to PCR amplify out the ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica using colony PCR. No amplification was observed. For our second amplification attempt, we used Touchdown PCR and used increasing concentrations of yeast cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Still no results.

Moreover, we re-acknowledged the use of our system in wastewater treatment plants; although Lethbridge’s wastewater treatment plant would not require our system based on our tour, physical wastewater treatment plants used to clean the wastewater from industries discard large amounts of metals. Our system would definitely be purposeful there, in addition to places with metal contaminated water, such as Flint, Michigan. This demonstrates the improved knowledge we gained on the application of our project as a result of the advice given from Professor Rood."

Interspecies conjugation
We’d like to furthermore test our system with different bacteria. If, as we suppose, our kiler bacteria can conjugate with other Gram negative bacteria, our system could kill the antibiotic multi-resistance bacteria usually found in           hospital, ... (like Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus sp, …)           Unfortunately, we don’t had enough time to test it… It will be tested soon after Boston.
Design with complete RP4 plasmid
For better efficiency, we’d like to design the same conjugation/killing system, not with a “light” mobilizable plasmid like we have used, but with a complete RP4 plasmid (about 60k bp) to have a much better conjugation efficiency.
Biosafety aspect
We’d like to add biosafety composant to our system. With a killer plasmid carrying the R6K machinery, our killer plasmid will be dependant of Lambda-Pir. If our plasmid become liberated, it cannot be propagated.           We have started such system, with a conjugative strain (pSW23T) carrying the R6K Ori. We have clone in this plasmid, after have change the MCS, our “killer” cassette containing the Cas9 and our killer sgRNA. This plasmid was cloner in           S17-1 who have Lambda-Pir.           Unfortunately, we don’t had enough time to test it… It will be done soon after Boston.
We also like to add a FRT sequence around, for example, the resistance gene present in our plasmid. With a special enzyme, this antibiotic resistance gene will be “cut” of the plasmid, who will be safier.
Adding a recombination system
As we want to do in a first time (but aborted because of time), we wanted to combine our conjugative “killer” system, with a sequence that could permit our “killer” cassette to recombine into the target bacteria. A such system will be           more efficient.

BIOBRICKS
Nine BioBricks were planned as extracts from the PHB operon.  Five of these were from the PHB promoter and four were from the CAB gene cassette.
SUBMITTED BIOBRICKS
Three PHB promoter BioBricks were successfully ligated into the pSB1A3 plasmid.  These BioBricks were constructed to be tested as promoters for green fluorescent protein to determine their autonomy and effectiveness. These BioBricks are labeled in the BioBrick registry as BBa_K089004, BBa_K089005, and BBa_K089006.
Miniprepped plasmid DNA from each of the BioBricks were placed into PCR tubes and labeled with their designated BioBrick number.  These were placed in a 50-ml free-standing centrifuge tube and sent to iGEM for further testing and placement in the registry.
BIOBRICKS IN PROGRESS
The two remaining PHB promoter regions have been successfully amplified using PCR and are in process of ligations and transformations.
Two of the CAB cassette genes, phaA and phaB, have been successfully amplified using PCR and are in process of ligation and transformation.  The phaC and phaCAB sequences are in earlier stages.

Proof of concept
Five different plasmids were assembled with the Plug ‘n’ Play standard in order to verify that the system functions in mammalian cells. To demonstrate how fast any vector of choice for the expression in mammalian cells can be assembled, we designed a reporter system as proof of concept.
The plasmids for proof of concept in mammalian cells were constructed with the strong constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor , the BGH terminator , the hygromycin marker cassette , and the plasmid backbone pMam .  Different genes encoding fluorescent proteins were used as the gene of interest, and the reporter system can easily be modified to be used for gene expression analysis. All transient transfections were performed in the human derived cell line U-2 OS, kindly provided by the Danish Cancer Society. For microscopy the transfected U-2 OS cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde, and VECTASHIELD was added to prevent rapid loss of fluorescence while examining the cells with the confocal microscope.
We have proved that the Plug ‘n’ Play assembly standard can easily be applied for construction of mammalian expression vectors. Transfections and expression of the fluorescent proteins GFP, mCherry, YFP, and CFP were successfully conducted in U-2 OS cells. Furthermore, expression of GFP targeted to the peroxisomes of U-2 OS cells succeeded. Lastly it was shown that mammalian cells can be transfected with different fluorescent proteins simultaneously.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

We have invited some predecessors coming from the Northeast Forestry University to                                 introduce iGEM competition to us. It was a very cherish chance for us to know iGEM                                 closely and to understand diverse ideas proposed by the teams coming from all over the word,                                 which made us very excited. So, students who were from Northeast Forestry University gave                                 us the first lesson about the competition and they guided us to solve some troubles we                                 met at the beginning of registration such as registering on the web, remitting by wire                                 transfer, filling in the form correctly and so on. So, we are very appreciated for                                 their selfless help and efficient guides.

In addition, our team was also ready to help others and glad to communicate with other                                 teams. We has provided some essential reagents and plasmid to other team after                                 verifying them right. We provided LUDOX - an interlab reagent to XJTLU_CHINA as soon as                                 they asked. Since we didn’t join in the plan of interlab experiment, we thought that                                 there might be some requirements of interlab reagents or plasmid. So, we pronounced                                 the case that we could provided our materials in the social communication platform. With the                                 competition going on, JLU_China had asked us for some materials and then we send                                 them the Test Device 3: J23117.B0034.E0040.B0015 in pSB1C3 and the FITC Standard.                                 We were pleasure to gave them a hand when they need help and that interaction led a                                 more closely communication between us. We have often exchange some experience and                                 experimental skills up to now.

Ag43 mediates autoaggregation, via a velcro-like mechanism (Heras et. al., 2014), and plays a role in E.coli biofilm formation. Interestingly, the alpha subunit is able to express foreign peptide sequences on E.coli cell surface if inserted just in front of codon 148 (Kjærgaard et. al., 2002).

2.       Biobrick description and potential uses
BioBrick Bba_K1352001 is a modified version of the Bba_K1352000 BioBrick. It is composed of an Ag43 coding sequence with an in-frame FLAG epitope tag flanked by BglII and HindIII multiple cloning sites inserted within the alpha-subunit in front of codon 148 of Ag43. Expression of Ag43 is under the control of the pBAD promoter; it includes a ribosome binding site as well as two transcriptional terminators. Structure of the BioBrick was designed to allow easy insertion of foreign protein sequences of choice at codon 148 with a simple restriction digest with BglII and HindIII followed by ligation. Potential uses of this BioBrick include surface display of foreign peptide sequences, E.coli aggregation tests as well as synthetic vaccines production.
3.       Template for foreign peptide insertion
Depending on the length, desired foreign peptide sequence can be purchased as oligos or a synthetic piece of DNA. In order to keep the foreign protein sequence in-frame, a following template should be used:
5' gct gtg AGA TCT (your sequence) AAG CTT aac acc 3' [note reading frame of Ag43 is indicated by nucleotide triplets]
BglII recognition site; HindIII recognition site; sequence adjacent to foreign peptide insertion site
4.       Making of the Biobrick and plasmid modularization
Bba_K1352000 BioBrick was a starting material for this construct. FLAG tag flanked by BglII and HindIII MCS was inserted into Ag43 at codon 148 via an In-Fusion reaction (Clonetech). For a more detailed description of the construction of this BioBrick, please see: https://2014.ig"

In nature, the function of MpIBP is multifaceted. With its ice-binding domain, it positions                          the M. primoryensis on top of the water column where there is still sunlight.                         With its peptide and sugar binding domain, it binds to other M. primoryensis bacteria,                         making a strong multivalent connection with ice to resist fluid fow, but it also binds                         to diatoms with these domains. These photosynthethic microalgae produce oxygen and waste                         products that feed the strictly aerobic M. primoryenisis. MpIBP plays a crucial role in                         forming a symbiotic microbial biofilm under the ice. (4)

Binding of the DNA binding protein cI
In vitro binding
The next step of the working bacterial two-hybrid system is the examination of the interaction between the DNA binding domain and the possible binding site upstream of the promoter region. An in vitro interaction   was demonstrated via electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with the single OR1 binding site ( BBa_K2082231 ) and the double OR1 and OR2 binding site ( BBa_K2082239 )   of the phage 434.   The DNA fragment without addition of the protein SH2-cI runs way faster than after adding the SH2-cI protein (figure 1A). This observation indicates an interaction between 434 cI an the binding site OR1. Binding of the protein to the DNA increased the weigth of the DNA fragment in the gel, which results in the slower movement and the visible band at the higher position in the gel.   To disprove the possibilities of general DNA binding of the cI protein, another fragment was tested with nearly the same fragment size than the OR1 fragment but with a different sequence. However, the agarose gel did not reveal any recognizable differences between addition of SH2-cI and"

With a Little Help from Our Friends
We would like to thank all of our instructors and advisors, without whom this project would not have been possible. Professor Tracy Palmer, Dr Fordyce Davidson and Professor Frank Sargent guided the team throughout the duration of the project. Their experience and expertise were crucial to the progression of the project and their support got us through long hours working in the lab. Our advisors; Karim Rafie, François Cléon, Avril Smart and Scott McCrimmon worked closely with the team to help us achieve our goals, providing critical advice and feedback throughout. Dundee iGEM 2013 alumni Chris Earl and Nasir Ahmad provided us with indispensable support and advice on all aspects of the project. Richard Owen and Lucia Licandro gave input on the project based on their iGEM experience.
We would also like to thank all of the members of the Division of Molecular Microbiology, in particular:
Frank Sargent Lab We extend thanks to all of the members of Frank Sargent’s lab. Particularly Professor Frank Sargent and Marilia de Costa. Their advice on the wet team’s work and support with protein work and florescence microscopy was extremely valuable to the team. We would also like to thank them for the equipment and resources supplied by Frank Sargent’s lab.

- The destruction of the two most important efflux mechanisms ENA1 and NHA1, so that as little salt as possible leaves the cell.
- Overexpression of NHX1 to maximize the sodium (and therefore chloride) uptake into the prevacuolar compartments.
Fig.6: We knocked out the two efflux mechanisms ENA1 and NHA1 and overexpressed NHX1 to increase the sequestration of ions in the intracellular compartments.
These mutations were performed individually as well as in various combinations to identify the most efficient mutant ( >> results ). To learn more about the methodology we used for       these changes, check out our Workflow and Protocols pages.
But while working on and modifying the native transport system of S. cerevisiae, we have also integrated a new system which offers further possibilities of increasing the salt intake.        For this purpose, we used a combination of ion transporters that are found in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The system differs from that in S. cerevisiae, since plants react       comparable but not similar to salt stress.
AtNHX1
Plant vacuolar membrane Na+/H+ antiporter genes play an important role in cellular ion homeostasis, especially the sequestration of Na+ in the vacuole to confer salt stress resistance       in plants [28–30]. Vacuolar membrane-bound and H+ translocating enzyme H+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and H+ inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPiase) generate an electrochemical potential       across the membrane through a proton gradient [31,32] that is used by the Na+/H+ antiporters to move Na+ against its electrochemical potential and accumulate it inside the vacuole [31].
In Arabidopsis thaliana the most abundant  Na+/H+ antiporter AtNHX1 is bound to the vacuolar membrane [33] . It mediates the import of not only Na+, but also K+ into the vacuole and with that       contributes to the accumulation of cations significantly [28,29]. AtNHX1 is a channel which is homologous to the yeast NHX1 gene that encodes a Na+/H+ antiporter in the       prevacuolar compartment [34]. When AtNHX1 is knocked out in Arabidopsis thaliana the plant loses its ability to sequestrate sodium and thus is more sensitive to salt stress [35].

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.

This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html,"$. Thus, the yield of daptomycin per glucose is appropriately equal to 0.086. This is in a comperable range to the result of our simulations, in which the yield was $ \frac{v_{delftibactin}}{v_{glucose}} = \frac{0.68}{10.5} = 0.065 $. As daptomycin and delftibactin have similar molecular mass, this shows that the metabolic capabilities for the production of NRPS/PKS products of these two organisms, according to current flux balance models, are fairly similar.
In the above publication, the experimentally measured titer of daptomycin in fed-batch culture was 581.5 mg/L. Our modelled fed-batch process titer of 63 g/L (61 mmol/L and delftibactin has a molecular mass of 1033 dalton). This factor of 2 shows two things: For one, natural systems will have to be significantly engineered in order to achieve NRP production rates close to the Pareto frontier. Yet, this was one of the main reasons why we started the experiments for the introduction of the D.acidovorans genes into E.coli: The latter can be manipulated and used for metabolic engineering in a standardized framework. On the other hand, this factor also shows that our calculation might be very optimistic for the time being and that significant further research will have to be done until such as a system can applied at industrial scale.
Bioreactor simulation
In general, there exist three main methods for the cultivation of bacteria in bioreactors: The most classical one is the batch method, in which all of the initial medium is inoculated at the beginning point. In contrast, for the continuous fermentation, new medium keeps flowing into the reactor while also being withdrawn at the same rate. Continuous fermentation of course requires a lot less labour costs, provides higher yields and is more controllable than the batch process. On the other hand, in real processes, the microorganisms often mutate to non producing variants, thus making continuous processes problematic [21]. In between these methods lies the fed-batch, which was chosen here, in which medium keeps being added to the reactor, but is not withdrawn.
This method, was simulated using dynamic FBA (dFBA), which quickly proved to be a very valuable method for combining dynamic processes with stoichiometric metabolic models. However, one disadvantage is the rather long simulation time, but recent methods have been developed in order to efficiently simulate differential equations numerically of which the right"
