We performed Miniprep in sample pSB1C3 and digested it with SpeI and buffer N4. For the sample pSB1k3 we performed a new ligation, transformed the ligation product using bioline cell and spread plate it.  We ran a 1% gel to check the digestion product of pSB1C3 and proceeded to PCR clean up of the sample and DNA quantification.
We started building our level 0 destination vectors :) We ligated our backbone pSB1C3 with the following pcr amplified products: DVL0_GF_BR, DVL0_DF_FR, DVL0_DF_GR, DVL0_CF_DR and DVL0_BF_CR. We transformed them using Bioline competent cells, and plated them with X-gal and IPTG for blue-white screening.
We updated our Clotho experience section , check it out!
July
Week 4
We made cultures of E1010 and pSB1C3, pSB1k3 did not work.
We transformed ligations of DVL0_GF_BR, DVL0_DF_FR, DVL0_DF_GR, DVL0_CF_DR and DVL0_BF_CR to the pSB1C3 backbone following the bioline cell protocol for ligations because the last set of transformations didn`t work without heat shock. The cells grew but they were not blue. We thought that it might be related to the fact that we did not leave enough time for IPTG and X-Gal be absorbed into the plate. We made a new set of ligations and repeated the transformations, this time placing the plates with IPTG and X-Gal into the incubator for 30 min before plating the cells. And it finally worked! All of them had blue colonies, except for DVL0_FF_BR.
In order to perform new ligations with the Level 0 inserts, we repeated the protocol from last week to obtain more backbone of pSB1C3.
Also, we worked on the pSB1k3 backbone. We ran the PCR using the conditions we previously set. We performed PCR clean up AND DNA quantification and ran a gel to confirm the amplification.
We performed a single restriction digest (SpeI) of the sample, DNA quantified it and ligated to itself in order to get circularized backbone.
We transformed the ligation product following the Alpha Select cells protocol. The colonies grew! We picked colonies and incubated them overnight."
Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is an organism considered “modified”? Indeed, we are not capable of changing the whole system of an organism, we can only change some functions or metabolic pathways. Is it a lack of respect to nature and the living in general to insert a gene controlling insulin production into a bacterium if that means saving thousands of human lives? from an anthropocentrism point of view the answer might be no, however from a biocentrism point of view the answer might be yes.
Whatever would be the answer, we believe that respecting living beings first and foremost rests on scientific integrity and rigor, a realization of all the implications of the scientific project, the precise knowledge of its content, and finally the establishment of security measure. We should never consider Nature and living beings solely as work tools.
In the European Union, the legal definition of GMO is mentioned in the 2001/18 directive: a GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) is “an organism, with the exception of human beings, whose genetic makeup has been modified via methods that do not occur in nature and/or through traditional crossbreeding methods”.
However, the regulation regarding GMOs varies from a country to another as far as research, production, marketing and their use are concerned. The US consider that a GMO is an organism whose “genetic makeup has been modified, either using classic selection, recombinant DNA methods (also called gene splicing) or gene modification”. The regulation is based on other criteria than the ones applied inside the European Union. Indeed, American policy is based on the product of gene modification techniques, not on the process itself. The regulation is founded on verifiable risks and does not focus on the risks that were not proven (for more details see the precautionary principle).
As mentioned in the introduction, distinction must be done between different kinds of GMOs (GMMs, PGMs, etc…).  As far as the iGEM competition is concerned, only genetically modified microorganisms are pertinent.
In France, the confined use of GMMs is subject, via the 2009/41/CE directive, to a system of notification and authorization. Even though MGMs in France are under a strict regulation because of their potential effects on health and their dissemination, they’re commonly used for medical purposes (insulin production by E. coli), or in the food industry (modified yeast for beer production).
Their irruption in the production processes went almost unnoticed. They were even perceived well since they were able to engender more reliable products, as it was the case with the production of the growth hormone. It is with the PGM"

To analyse growth of BP235, we used the strain constitutively expressing GFP, which was constructed similarly to the previously used strains. For the analysis we again used 100 µL CS-Glu medium supplemented with the appropriate glyphosate concentration. The cells were added in a 1:1 ratio. GFP was excited at 488 nm and emission was measured at 509 nm.
Figure 24. Cell mixture (1:1) of strains BP193 and BP235 were incubated with increasing glyphosate concentrations (0–5 mM). Strain BP193 harbors the lacZ gene behind an artificial promoter, but does not tolerate glyphosate in contrast to strain BP235.
5. Engineering bacteria to disarm glyphosate
5.1. The glyphosate N-acetyltransferase confers resistance to weedkiller
Many years ago it has been found that glyphosate can be inactivated by acetylation yielding N-acetylglyphosate (see Figure 25) (37). Because the acetylated form of glyphosate has low affinity for the active site of EPSP synthase, it is nonherbicidal. The glyphosate N-acetyltransferase GAT from the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus licheniformis transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA onto the amino group of the weedkiller (37). Interestingly, B. subtilis possesses a putative glyphosate N-acetyltransferase, which is designated as YitI and shares 59% overall amino acid identity with GAT of B. licheniformis. However, the native GAT enzymes are very poor catalysts for N-acetylation of glyphosate (37).  Moreover, despite extensive screening of biological amines, including amino acids, nucleotides and antibiotics, the physiological substrates for the native enzymes are unknown (39). As an alternative strategy for glyphosate resistance involving enzymatic conversion of glyphosate to N-acetylglyphosate the GAT was also subjected to directed evolution for creating an enzyme with higher efficiency and increased specificity for the herbicide (37). When introduced into plants, optimized gat genes confer robust tolerance to glyphosate (37). Therefore, we expect that bacteria like B. subtilis expressing the optimized GAT should tolerate high amounts of glyphosate even though it is taken up from the environment via the high-affinity glyphosate transporter GltT (see above). To evaluate the potential of the GAT to allow B. subtilis in the presence of glyphosate concentrations that are toxic for the wild"

The report states that in 2011, out of 921 biotechnology businesses that responded to the survey, the three main biotechnology industries were biopharmaceutical industry (274), biochemistry industry (196), and biofood industry (206). Other biotechnology industries include bioenvironmental industry, bioenergy industry, and bioelectronics industry etc (""Domestic biotechnology industry,"" 2013).
The report also suggests that biotechnology business in Korea is growing. In 2011, around 35,600 people were employed in the biotechnology industry and within that group around 22,100 people were researchers. This number represents a 3.4% increase compared to the number of researchers (21357) in 2010. Also, the total market value of biotechnology industry in 2009 was around US $4.0 billion, growing annually at 17.6%. In 2011, the total market value had risen to US $5.5 billion (""Domestic biotechnology industry,"" 2013).
Only one Korean company, Bioneer, is listed in the SynBio map inventory. Bioneer has gene synthesizing technology that is the foundation for synthetic biology (""Synthetic biology project,"").
Biotechnology Industry Funding
We present information of biotechnology funding as a whole. ‘Bio-Vision 2016’, the second Korean national framework plan for the promotion of biotechnology, is currently under way. Under this plan the Korean government will provide around US $9.7 billion in 2012 to 2016 for expanding local biotechnology industries. This pledge was reaffirmed by the prime minister during the Bio-Korea 2012 conference held in Seoul. The plan also mentions that the government should increase support for the development of synthetic biology. Additional details, however, are not provided in the framework. The Ministry of Health and Welfare mentioned that the government would eagerly support the development of biotechnology in terms of policies and international collaboration (Lee, 2012).
In addition, private funding in 2011 was round US$ 1.3 billion. This value represents a 26.6% increase compared to the US$ 1.02 billion generated in 2010. 89.9% of the total fund is from the three major biotechnology industries in Korea which are biopharmaceutical (63.8%), biochemistry (13%), and biofood industry (12.5%) (""Domestic biotechnology industry,"" 2013).

Collaborations
In iGEM, the idea of significance plays a vital role in determining the validity of contributions for medal criteria. As outlined by iGEM HQ, we believe that a collaboration or contribution is significant if it betters a project or a team, ultimately contributing towards its advancement. That being said, significance is also largely subjective because what one judge may see as beneficial, another may believe it to be too passive of an effort to qualify.
Collaboration is not specific to PNP. All subteams should collaborate with other teams to improve different aspects of projects. Examples of how Waterloo iGEM has helped out new teams entering iGEM providing web construction technical support, providing a guide to accelerate new development, and assisting with the development of their wiki pages. In addition, Waterloo participates in an annual oGEM conference for iGEM teams in Ontario. At the conference, teams all share their ongoing projects, critique the projects of others, and allow them to network with each other and develop ideas for collaborations.
Project Determination
The 2016 Imperial College team inspired us to create a structured method to select the annual project for the team. The typical selection process for the project begins with some of our members coming up with ideas and presenting them to the whole team. From there, members across the entire team conduct individual assessments, which get compiled to produce a quantitative analysis of which project the team believed was the best to pursue. The assessments were based on the set of criteria described as follows:
Primary Criteria:
Novelty: As the focus of the competition is the advancement of synthetic biology, teams must either build upon a previous project or come up with an original idea
Feasibility: It is important to consider the amount of resources available to teams such that they can produce a complete project
Secondary Criteria:
Interest: Teams with a greater interest in their project are like more likely to excel above and beyond
Applicability to Subteams: It is important to select a project that will enable all subteams to work on their respective aspects of the project to fulfil medal criteria
Impact/Usefulness: The degree to which how useful the project is and how it can impact society (how stakeholders benefit and how many stakeholders"

Fabric Printing (Manufacturing & Environmental)
The fabric dying industry involves the use of various toxic and environmentally damaging chemicals. Patterned expression of dyes in bacteria using the PixCell electrogenetic system would provide an affordable and environmentally friendly fabric printer. We developed a proof-of-concept of this system with the production of melanin which can be used to dye wool-cloth (Amal et al., 2018), but recent publication show it could also be used for indigo dyeing of denim (Hsu et al., 2018).
Bioelectrical Patches (Therapeutics)
Transdermal are currently used to treat a variety of diseases, such as L-DOPA patches to treat Parkinson’s disease. Although existing patches function passively and are expended after a day. A microelectrode array could be used to generate an active transdermal L-DOPA patch with a longer lifetime utilising a previously reported L-DOPA synthesis pathway (Wei et al., 2016).
Efficient Mutant Selection (Foundational  Advance)
The efficiency of directed evolution experiments is dependent on adequate selection and separation of successful mutants. Previous literature shows how evolving various activities in protein, DNA and RNA can be linked to the expression of a transgene (Esvelt et al., 2011). By linking successful mutations to SoxR expression and bringing the flagella control gene CheY expression under the control of pSoxS you can create a system in which successful mutants would tumble around electrodes (Scharf et al., 1998). This not only allows for easy isolation of mutants, but by scanning various electrode potentials you can test a series of selection pressures in one reaction to select for libraries of mutants with various activities. Moreover, it hasn’t escaped our attention that his system can be used as the basis of an antibiotic-free selection system.
Biomaterial Patterning (Manufacturing)
Biomaterials are normally produced in liquid-phase and then undergo classical industrial processing to form the fibres used in manufacturing. Our electrogenetic system provides a method of precise spatial patterning which could be used to allow printing of high-value, processing-free biomaterials such as bacterial cellulose into ready-to-use defined shapes (Buldum et al., 2018).

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node"

Anastasiya did minipreps of the O/N cultures of pAT13 and pAT15. Meanwhile I did PCR cleanups of the pSB3C5 and pSB3T5 backbone plasmid PCRs that Patrick did yesterday. I then did digestions of pSB3C5, pSB3T5 as well as J23100 and J23116, the two BioBrick promoters we plan to use as references in our measurements. After the minipreps were done, we ran verification PCRs on both plasmids and saw that only pAT15 had the correct insert.
The ligations of pAT12-16 that were done yesterday seemed to have worked this time! Lisa and I restreaked six colonies of each construct, while Patrick did restreaks of the SPL + GFP construct, that also seemed to have worked.
NOTE: It seems the newest batch of competent cells has been contaminated with some unknown E.coli strain that is also Amp resistant. This sucks alot if you are transforming plasmids with only Amp resistance. Sebastien says we just have to deal with it, since it's too late to waste time making a new batch (unless someone has nothing to do). Luckily the unknown E. coli strain seems to grow ALOT faster than DH5alpha, the ""bad"" colonies are giant compared to the ""right"" ones, so just avoid those when doing restreaks after a transformation.

Stochastic Switch
Introduction
One of the most exciting aspects of our project is our synthetic stochastic switch. The switch regulates the decision to become a non-germinating metal container spore, or a spore that can go on to germinate as part of the normal life cycle. Whilst stochastic oscillators have been implemented before using transcriptional regulators, our switch makes use of an invertable DNA segment to ensure that the decision is heritable.
By differentially controlling the expression of the Hin invertase, we designed our switch to be tunable to achieve a biased heads or tails response, allowing a range of probabilities of orientation of the invertable segment to be achieved.
Novelty in this sub-project
We designed a synthetic stochastic switch by using an invertible segment of DNA flanked by a pair of promoters. Depending on the orientation of the invertible sequence, coding sequences will be expressed which reflect the decision to be a metal container or not. We also tuned the natural stochasticity of the sporulation system towards greater sporulation rates by altering the rate of Spo0A phosphorylation.

BioBrick constructs
There are a number of bricks involved within the stochastic switch construct.
The stochastic brick construct uses the Hin invertase system in order to flip a region between Hix sites. The directionality of the promoter determines whether the switch is 'on' or 'off'. When the promoter is facing right it allows transcription of genes that control:

$$ \Delta T(n) = -(n-n_c) \Delta I + n_c \Delta C, \qquad n_c\leq \textrm{ and } n \in [1,N] \tag{3}$$
For convenience, we normalize the $P_{clv}$ through division by the cleavage probability for a matching (on-target) sequence and find R, the cleavage probability relative to the on-target.
$$ \mathcal{R} = \frac{P_{clv} (s|g)}{P_{clv}(g|g)} \tag{4}$$
From a numerical implementation of the model (in Python), we can now determine Cas13a’s tolerance for mismatches between the target and guiding sequence for several model parameters (the energy gain $\Delta C$ and energy penalty $\Delta I$).
Off-target simulations
Although scarce, there are some experimental data illustrating the mismatch tolerance of Cas13a ( Abudayyeh et al. 2017 , Figure S19 and S21). We observe there is a central seed region between nucleotide 9 and 15. Two consecutive mismatches are only tolerated at the two ends of the spacer, while three consecutive mismatches are only allowed to occur between the nucleotides at the 3’ end of the crRNA spacer and thus the 5’ end of the target. We consider these data, adjust the model parameters and compare the data to the computed tolerance for mismatches using our model. We find a decent parameter fit by eye to be:
$$ \Delta C = 0.25 \tag{5}$$ $$ \Delta I = 2.5 \tag{6}$$
Figure 3 displays the computed mismatch tolerance for single mismatches, two consecutive mismatches and three consecutive mismatches and shows that single mismatches are not tolerated in the central seed region, two consecutive mismatches are tolerated at the ends of the spacer and three consecutive mismatches are only tolerated at the 3’ end of the spacer.
Figure 3: Cas13a tolerance for mismatches. Cas13a tolerance for mismatches ($\Delta C=0.25$,$\Delta I=2.5$). The cleavage probability relative to the on-target is plotted for different types of mismatches. Single mismatches (blue line) are not tolerated well in the central seed region. Two consecutive mismatches (orange line) can be tolerated in the beginning and end of the target. Three consecutive mismatches"
NCTU_Formosa,2018,Team:NCTU Formosa#Human Practices#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," made sure that our biostimulators included agents that could curb the effects of any extra fertilizer present in soil. Additionally, the center suggested we pay attention to the most important indicators of soil fertility, such as nutrient levels, if we wanted to ensure health of both the microbiome as well as the crop. We made sure to integrate these tips into our project by generating a model that predicts changes in bacterial ratios based on changes in N, P, and K levels, and vice versa. We also designed a device that uses electrical conductivity as an indicator to project current N, P, and K amounts in soil.
NCHU, Professor Young
Bacillus subtilis is one of the most widely used phosphate-solubilizing biofertilizers in the world and is dominant among the phosphate-solubilizing bacteria in soil. Currently we are only able to add this biofertilizer, not inhibit it. A means of regulating Bacillus subtilis levels would help greatly in preventing excessive levels of phosphate in soil.
Figure 2: We visited Professor Young of National Chung Hsing University.
     Our search for a phosphate regulatory agent led us to Professor Young of National Chung Hsing University. Young, renowned for his research in soil microbes, advised us to target the commonly-used Bacillus subtilis to control soil phosphate levels. Using an improved version of the peptide prediction model created by NCTU_Formosa 2017, we predicted numerous proteins with subtilis-inhibiting abilities, eventually finding peptides classified as bacteriocins, which we used as our biobricks. We then performed experiments using these bacteriocins to develop a model that describes the relationship between peptide volume and Bacillus subtilis inhibition, which can be used to precisely regulate subtilis levels in soil should they become too dominant.
Asia Agri-Tech Expo
Nobody has thought about improving crop productivity or soil health by directly targeting the microbiota. Most solutions focus on adding soil supplements without any mode of regulation. This concept presents a fresh take on an old problem and could really benefit the industry.
Figure 3: We attended the 2018 Asia Agritech Expo.
     As our project matured we travelled to Taipei, where we attended the 2018 Asia Agritech Expo to confirm the usefulness of our concept. There we met with over one-hundred agricultural businesses from all over Asia. Many representatives were excited by the idea of regulating soil microbiotas, as well as the versatility of biostimulators that our model could support. One common suggestion for our project was to add a way of actually measuring"

The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control because it did not have a Chloramphenicol resistance gene.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F
Another set of plates with 10^-5 and 10^-4 dilutions of Chloramphenicol were prepared.
The plates were divided into quadrants with CHOP on the top left and bottom left quadrants and crcB on the top right and bottom right.
CHOP had the most growth at 100μM F at 10^-4 dilution.
Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to screen for fluoride riboswitches with higher responsiveness or select new fluoride riboswitches from engineered libraries.
High-throughput screening of potential fluoride riboswitches
Using CHOP, putative fluoride riboswitches can be characterized by inserting new promoter riboswitch pairs into CHOP and using serial dilutions on plates with varying levels of fluoride to determine the responsiveness to fluoride.
CHOP can be used to screen many thousands of riboswitches at the same time, by plating bacteria on plates with various levels of fluoride and sequencing clones that survive. This approach could also be used for libraries
CHOP can be used to screen other transcriptional riboswitches to help identify which ligands bind and determine the responsiveness.
In the future we hope to use fluoride riboswitch technologies for sequestration, bioremediation, and detection of fluoride
To sequester fluoride we hope to identify fluoride riboswitches with a higher affinity to fluoride and attach multiple copies of the riboswitches to nanoparticles
To bioremediate fluoride we hope to control enyzmes that metabolize fluoride (fluorinase) with the fluoride riboswitch
To detect fluoride we hope to identify a set of fluoride riboswitches with different responsiveness to fluoride. These riboswitches will regulate a reporter, like a fluorescent protein of luciferase, so there will be a visible signal if fluoride is present. This will allow people to determine the concentration of fluoride in drinking water"

Through controlling the direction of the signal stream we can achieve our goal to make a logic-flexible device. Now let’s come to a simple example. We replace the Gene of Interest with a kind of promoter. Under the initial condition, the promoter is able to induce the Output. But once the external signal comes, the expression of the Cre recombinase will be activated and it will lead to the flip between the two LoxP sites. Consequently, the promoter cannot bring out the output.
What we exactly want and how?
Without loss of generality, we decide to start our project with the conversion of the two basic gates mentioned above: the And gate and the Or gate. And when it comes to the situation with 2 inputs, we construct our design like this.

Between the LoxP site there’re promoter A&B. Initially promoter A can only induce signal X, and promoter B signal Y. The Output is under the regulation which can only be induced by X AND Y.So only when both promoter A&B are activated can we get the expression of the Output. Definitely it serves as an And gate. In response to the external stimulus we’ve given, the Cre recombinase come out and start the flip. After the flip either promoter A or promoter B can activate the expression of both signal X and signal Y. Then we can get the Output. So the system works as an Or gate. That’s how we construct the switch between the And gate and the Or gate.
An Introduction to Cre-LoxP System
The system consists of two components: Cre recombinase and LoxP site. Cre-Lox recombination is a site-specific recombinase technology widely used to carry out deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. It is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems.

Johan: This is good to hear. They just added extra tyrosine as powder and got a lot of melanin (under good conditions - 30° C pH 7).  I can have missed, but I also didnt read that cells died, which is good, as the previous article mentions that “melanogenesis is hazard for melanin-producing cells” and that that is a reason why it is made in melanosomes.
“Furthermore, the disulfide linkage could be cleaved by the elevated level of glutathione and reductase activity in the cytosol,[12] which allowed release of OVA from LMWP and thus retention of a full intrinsic immunogenicity” - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization pp.2725-2726
Johan: Dont fully understand the paragraph in the article, but it seems that the cargo could release from the CPP. This sounds very good as melanin exists in polymers and melanin+CPP would probably not be able to polymerize

MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor)
""MITF is a transcription factor that normal melanocytes secrete which acts beneficially  towards the melanocyts, as mentioned below in the citations from an article. Vitiligo skin  has unfortunately a disorder in producing MIFTs from their melanocytes. Our aim is to  have our bacteria on the skin to produce MIFT as a fusion protein with a cell penetrating  peptide, thus going thorugh the skin and protecting the melanocytes even if they naturally cannot produce MITF themselves.  Although the biochemical pathway from tyrosine to the melanin polymer has been known for decades (1,2), the findings of the last fifteen years have led to unveiling the transcriptional regulation of genes which are necessary for the synthesis and deposition of melanin. Remarkably, only one transcription activator emerged as a universal regulator of expression of several proteins accomplishing the assembly of the melanosome and its decoration with melanin."" (This protein --> MITF) - ‘‘Transcription physiology’’ of pigment formation in melanocytes: central role of MITF p. 2
Nina: MITF is mentioned a lot in articles such as this in the context of vitiligo. Therfore, I think this transcription factor seems to be good to introduce into the skin and further into melanocytes.

Get Clotho Now!
This is the notebook of Nade Sritanyaratana. I got involved in iGEM through word of my instructor. I am a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley in Bioengineering with a concentration in imaging, and I hope to apply for a PhD graduate program in the upcoming year. My prior research experience consists of working with bioengineering professor Steven Conolly in the summer and fall of 2007. Beyond imaging, my academic interests include biomechanics; signals and systems; circuit analysis; systems biology; and linear optimization.
My primary role as a Tools Team member is to produce connections to plug into Clotho's core infrastructure; that is, to make functional tools that communicate with Clotho's ""command center"". Clotho is a project that my post-doc, Doug Densmore, had initiated as one of his side projects. It implements his notion of Platform-Based Design, which involves the optimal interaction between the Application-space and Architecture-space of a program (see Platform Based Design in more detail). This notebook will be used to document any noteworthy updates on my progress in the UCB Tools Team.
EDIT: As of after iGEM and the start of Spring 2009, the purpose of this notebook has now changed.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression plasmid plates
All the plates had colonies on them, although there were still areas of unspecific growth, presumably because of uneven dilution of the spec into the LB plates.
We made cultures of all the chem comp cells (77, 83, 84, 85) and the electro comp cell that did not have the correct insertion (80, 81). We picked 4 colonies from each plate, resulting in a total of 24 cultures. We have left them in the 37* shaker overnight, and tomorrow plan on performing a miniprep and PCR to check for the cross-junction.
PCR to check for omega+ultramers
We performed a PCR on the five electro comp miniprep products, to find out what may be missing. We used the omega_F+pLacO (index: 73) as our forward primer, and each of the respective reverse ultramers as our reverse primers (index: 78-82). We had an annealing temperature of 58* and an extension time of 30 seconds, and the expected product size is 646 bp.
Team ZF results in lanes 8-12
Strangely, we did not get results for sample 78 (FH bottom), even though we got a band there in a PCR earlier today that used the junction primers.  We got positive results for samples 79 and 82, and everything else seems to check out with these two samples (bands present in the correct size with junction primers from both isothermal assembly and miniprep templates).  However, we are still having problems with samples 80 and 81, which may be a problem with the colonies that we picked.  For now, we will assume that the isothermal assembly worked, due to colonies growing on the spec plates for samples 80 and 81, and that we had simply picked bad colonies.  We will find out tomorrow if other colonies from the same plate give us the same results.

Colony minipreps
Minipreps were performed on all of the samples except for a few where nothing grew in the LB/spec media.  These exceptions included 85.3, 85.4, 84.2, 81.2, and 81.3.  Possible reasons for no growth for these samples may include: (1) The colony was somehow not a transformed colony and was a cheater (possibly picked from a spot where there was a smaller amount of spec in the unevenly distributed dish), and"

This would allow for some degree of interaction (like resizing graphs, linked views, etc.) and may even make it somewhat easier to use graphs, we'd simply have some on-line repository of simulation results (a spreadsheet for example) and we could select which graphs to use on the Wiki.
Below an example of a JavaScript generated graph is shown, based on this spreadsheet . Note that the two views of the data are linked (although at this time both the kind of graph and the link is not optimal) and that it would be possible to create templates for creating these linked graphs. The current demo is based on the Dojo Toolkit as it has more advanced charting capabilities at this moment than Google visualization (and it seems to be supported well in different browsers).
Loading graph ...
Loading graph ...
Questions that would have to be resolved include:
How can we make this easy to use?
The graphs can now be defined using a more or less normal Wiki page and allow the use of templates.
What kinds of plots do we need?
How flexible do we need it to be? (Layout-wise.)
Can we make it that flexible? (And still easy to use.)
Can we create a relatively easy way to let the viewer select different data for exploratory purposes? We will likely run more simulations than you would normally graph.
How to support axis titles?
Currently done using some custom code (created by someone else and submitted to Dojo's bug tracker).
 ???
Taking this idea (much) further it would even be possible to run simulations using JavaScript (and charting the results), based on SBML models. However, this would involve much, much more effort than just showing a few interactive plots.
Note that we did implement simulations in JavaScript, but based on a function that return the time-derivatives given the current state. In principle this is surprisingly fast (in some cases graphing was the bottle-neck, leading us to subsample the simulated time series for graphing purposes) and it should be relatively easy to adapt to other models. Note that we only used a very simple integration scheme though (so if your model requires a more advanced integration scheme you'll have to program it yourself).
Modelling a Genetic Circuit - TODO
To model a genetic circuit the following must be done (TODO: more detail):
Determine which genes are involved and how they are regulated???

Wiki Editing Tutorial
From zero to hero
The iGEM wiki is where teams write all the information about their projects to make it available for teams participating the next year, judges or people interested in the project. It is also the place where team members itself go to remember their iGEM experience and see how the project looks like after all the work done during the summer. However, most iGEM teams are mainly composed of students of biology-related fields, which usually do not have the necessary skills to set up a wiki.
What did we do?
We created a series of video tutorials about iGEM wiki editing with the intention to facilitate learning how to edit a decent iGEM wiki page to team members with no prior experience in wiki editing. This way, teams will be able to document their project in a better way in their wikis and let them focus on iGEM projects without struggling to learn how to edit the wiki.
There are lots of tutorials on web development. However, the iGEM wiki is quite a peculiar interface and amateur students might have a difficult time learning how to use it despite the information provided by iGEM about the topic. For this reason, this tutorial is totally focused on learning how to set up a functional but stylish wiki design that can easily be adapted and uploaded to the iGEM server. The tutorial consists of a total of 4.5 hours of video and a GitHub repository containing all the examples used in the tutorial. We really encourage you to check for more information about the purpose, design and contents of this tutorial by accessing its dedicated wiki page .
Why is this important?
We believe that this tutorial is one of our most ambitious collaborations, as all the teams participating in the subsequent years’ iGEM competitions will benefit from it. It also helps to solve one of the major challenges that other teams will face. By following this tutorial, future teams will be able to document their projects better in their wikis. Therefore, this tutorial is more than just providing help in wiki editing, as it will also represent an improvement on the way that iGEM projects are documented and this will have a great impact in the iGEM community.

Principle of Distributed Computing
Introduction
The creative concepts developed and the plethora of information gathered during the last decade by iGEM teams from all over the world proof efforts in Human Practices worth to be rewarded with a track of its own in this year’s iGEM competition. Since iGEM teams from Heidelberg have always been interested in the question how laymen citizens can get involved into synthetic biology, they already introduced new concepts to the community to improve communication (first abstract page in multiple languages, first site tour for laymen, first mascot 2008), to do research on the mechanisms of science communication (2010) and to encourage reflection by philosophers and artists as representers of society (2010, 2013). Following the findings of our former team mates , also supported by literature as described here , that acceptance towards a technology is not correlated with the information provided to a sceptic public, we rather aim at involving the public into the creative process of scientific work. In the style of the new iGEM community labs track that encourages science amateurs to contribute “beyond the accolades of scientific publishing and economic reward”, we sought for a new way to involve laymen in actual science and build a strong community of well informed supporters and communicators of synthetic biology at the same time. Thereby we want to lay the foundation for a democratization of Science in an enlightened society. Now we proudly present the crowdsourcing and communication platform iGEM@home!
Introducing Distributed Computing to the iGEM community
Modern biology uses computational simulations of models for validation as well as to predict key experiments and suitable designs for specific applications. Despite of the fact that the experience with and the mere amount of algorithms and code dedicated to biological systems is growing exponentially these days, big data evaluation such as sequence analysis and multidimensional problems such as protein folding still consume vast amounts of computational resources. Therefore main aspects of biological science are only accessible to research institutions that provide these resources in form of supercomputers or computer clusters. In order to open computational biology up to all future iGEM teams in a manner that is not dependant of institutional affiliations, we decided to develop a platform from a set of applications that build upon the BOINC framework for distributed computing ( Details on Software ). Thereby we provide access to computing power for future (community lab) iGEM teams and at the same time create an opening for laymen to jump in and empower science!

Isolate a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate, and inoculate a culture of 10- 15 mL LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for ~12-16 hr at 37°C with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm). Use a 50 mL culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture. It is strongly recommended that E. coli be used for routine plasmid isolation. An OD600 reading between 2.0 and 3.0 is an indication that bacterial cells are at an optimal density for harvesting, and plasmid DNA isolation.
Centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Decant or aspirate the medium and discard.
Add 500 µL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Complete resuspension of cell pellet is vital for obtaining good yields.
Note: RNase A must be added to Solution I before use. Please see the instructions in the Preparing Reagents section.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"  new  education  model  for  the  student  life  in  Tecnológico  de  Monterrey.  The  program  provides  us,  as  alumni,  a  comprehensive  education  that
enhances our personal capabilities, leadership, and self-realization, considering our physical, emotional and spiritual balance.
Knowing this, iGEM Tec Chihuahua decided to be part of LiFE and we registered the team as part of it. We got informed of what we needed to make our team a student group that belonged to LiFE and joined right away. LiFE encourages student groups to involve themselves with people who may be interested in their desired topic by making activities that result interesting to the audience, which was perfect for the approach we were looking for.
We attach below the official picture of iGEM at Tecnológico de Monterrey as part of LiFE.
The approach we gave to the group was synthetic biology. Our main objective is to attend to different schools where synthetic biology is not conferred and teach alumni what we have learned about this new technology throughout these months. We seek to communicate our acquired knowledge, express ideas and share information in order to light up interest in science on high school students.
So far we have gone to the UVM (University of the Mexican Valley) and gave high school students an introduction of what synthetic biology means and some concepts we considered meaningful to teach. For this first visit, we contacted Dr. Sonia Chavira Ríos, who is a teacher at this school. We explained what we wanted to present to her 11th-grade students and she accepted. She found our topic enlightening for her science class and gave iGEM Tec-Chihuahua a space to present. We went to UVM High School on September 18th where we talked about DNA, base pairs that shape DNA, genes, plasmids, genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and recombinant DNA.
As well, we had the opportunity to ground all the theoretical information by talking about how we applied synthetic biology and genetic engineering to our iGEM project. We explained to them how we made our bacterial transformation and how we obtain the protein production. As well, we wanted to keep in touch with them in case of any doubts they could have so we annexed our contact to keep communication.
Below you can find the presentation we showed them:

ITB_INDONESIA,2015,Team:ITB INDONESIA#team_-_-_TEXT.html," wetlab is exhausting but the whole experience of working interdisciplinary with awesome people is so engaging and mind-opening.”
She is the secretary of our team and also a member of the wetlab division.
Her main responsibility as secretary is to manage administration tasks in the team such as proposal activity for internal and external fundraising, and a lot of letters for iGEM ITB_Indonesia activity permission. At the wetlab division, she does some couple tasks and make sure the facilities and equipments are available for the wetlab work. She also loves to help fundraising project whether she keeps the money or accounting the money that flow in and out in our lab.
Her hobbies are traveling and snorkeling around Indonesia, even now she rarely does it because she still conducts her research in master degree. Her other hobbies is drawing, make a doodle and some random amateur design, she puts a couple of her artwork in her social media network such as Inst**ram and T*m*lr.
Indah is very interested in synthetic biology and she hopes by joining ITB_Indonesia team will enrich her experience in manage big interdisciplinary research project. Besides that, she wants to improve her team management skill and team working skills together with ITB_Indonesia member.
After several months in the team, she feel like sit in ferris wheel because sometimes it up, sometimes it down, feel like sweet and bitter simultaneously. In her opinion iGEM is the real competition not only comparing our work with other team, but also how we can manage and improve ourselves together to be more competent to reach our project goal. It is all about teamwork, hard working, responsibility and of course, big heart. She really love her team mate :).
Haryanto is working together with the human practice team to hold education and public engagement related events in order to promote synthetic biology in Indonesia and to educate the society.
At his free time, he loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games.
He was eager to join this team because he'd like to participate in a international level competition and also to enhance his leadership experience besides expanding his connections.
Based from his experience, he could gain a lot of experiences after joining this team, by overcoming all the challenges and issues regarding the iGEM competition. My fellow iGEM team members inspire me a lot in their own way and this made him happy.
As a fund raising coordinator, first, she evaluates iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2014 sponsorship tracks. Collect company contacts that have a prospect for our sponsorship proposal through colleagues and company’s website. Once the proposal is done, it is reviewed by the team members"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#At-a-Glance_-_-_TEXT.html," the current day, it is possible to dissolve the elements of the clot with specific medication such as tissue adaption. However, the tissue adapted to hypoxic media may be poisoned from oxygen. The absence of oxygen and nutrients from the blood during the ischemic period creates a state in which the rejuvenation of circulation to its original state results in inflammation and oxidative damage due to the induction of oxidative stress instead of the restoration of normal function.
The state of oxidative damage may cause some unwilling reactions which have the aptitude to produce toxic chemicals called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are intermediate products of oxygenation which have an absence of one electron in their covalent bonds. This makes them ultimately unstable. With such instability, ROS can disrupt almost all cellular structures, including DNA, cell membranes and organelles. Due to such elements in the nature of ischemic conditions, the final solution should incorporate a solution for all negative outcomes caused by ischemia
Our Approach
Our project design aims to assess and resolve two distinct cases. If a more holistic approach is to be taken towards ischemia, the issue could be better combatted. For this reason, we intend to use our vessel cells as a route to act in time to prevent the consequences of ischemia and heal them. To do this, we have to sense hypoxic conditions to prevent or remove clot formation and oxidative stress factors.
Regarding the need of an efficient, cost effective and rapid treatment option, the approach to the issue was dissected into modules.  Detection devices and activist proteins.  Hypoxia will be detected in two levels; with a promoter device for detection in genomic level and a protein domain for protein level regulation. Also, the oxidant factors in the media will be sensed to empower sensor devices. These devices will then produce the activist proteins, which are clot dissolving agents, antioxidant enzymes and proteins. We have the prospect of issuing a novel approach to the problem which will take effect in a short time interval, and affect strongly to prevent the recurrence of the problem.
Future Aspects
Gene therapy and tissue engineering are two different, but promising therapies which relate to our project. We have deliberated the advantages, disadvantages and also the possible side effects, ethical or social issues of these therapies to determine which of these would be the most beneficial.
Furthermore, we have designed the real-life application of our project to address the needs of both the clinic and the patient in a multiperspective manner.
As a final remark, we aim to feature computer modelling data to predict the potential effects of our treatment in order to determine its applicability as preventive medication. We envision that our system will"

Gluing it together
One of the prerequisites for our goal was the co-localization of the DNA binding protein and the histone modifying protein. This could be achieved by a fusion protein combining those two, as in the work of Mendenhall et al. (2013). However, this method would force its users to synthesize new fusion proteins for every new locus and every new modification they want to analyze. A more flexible approach lies in the non-covalent bond between biotin and streptavidin. Although this would have allowed us to design interchangeable fusion proteins for easier large-scale applications, we were unwilling to commit to the trade-off between flexibility and stability, as the bond in question, albeit strong, doesn't react well to low pH or mechanical forces (Chivers et al., 2010). To get the best of both worlds, we chose to utilize the recently established SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, which provides an isopeptide bond to connect two proteins and hold them together.
The SpyTag/SpyCatcher system as it is used in our project was developed in 2013 by the group of Associate Professor Mark Howarth from the University of Oxford. It (the system, not the university) is derived from the adhesin domain CnaB2 of a fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, a Gram-positive species of bacteria pathogenic to humans (Zakeri et al.). A spontaneous reaction within the mostly hydrophobic protein core irreversibly binds the nitrogen atom of a lysin's side chain to an oxygen atom of an aspartate's side chain. This intramolecular bond can be turned into an intermolecular bond by splitting the protein in two, which is exactly what Howarth's group"

KUAS_Korea,2018,Team:KUAS Korea#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," with the public and make an effort to think of the solution for the social problem these days. In order to accomplish the objective, we tried to provide a chance to the public to be familiar with synthetic biology, although the field is promising that as technology develops, awareness is relatively very low even to the bio-undergraduates. This year we had an open seminar targeting undergraduates in Korea regardless of majors. Throughout the seminar, we looked over from its history to applied cases to help participants deeply understand synthetic biology.
At the beginning, we illustrated the concepts of synthetic biology. First, we explained the idea of standardization and modularization, the most important and fundamental concepts of synthetic biology. The explanation of synthetic biology is followed by a presentation about iGEM competition. To help participants understand this area, the history of genetic engineering and synthetic biology and some examples of its study results were briefly described. After the introduction, we had illustrated some detailed parts of synthetic biology; diagnostics and environment part.
In diagnostics, we discussed detecting method for screening toxicity using synthetic biology regardless of the kind of toxins. In the aspects of disease control, early diagnosis is a vital issue for the field of the preservation of health because the invention of easier and cheaper diagnosis methods enables official health services to prevent and reduce deaths from certain diseases before patients suffer for deteriorated pains. To improve this area, synthetic biologists made microbeads containing different sorts of the recombinant luminescent bacterium, which express unique luminescence when each of the bacteria detects specific toxins. This method has a huge advantage in a respect of having the capacity to test whether someone has several diseases at the same time. Moreover, it can be used for other areas like examination of water. This relates to the environmental application part.
In the environment, synthetic biology was applied to making biofuels, sensing pollutants, and refining contamination. Biofuel is renewable energy (such as ethanol, diesel oil etc.) produced by using eco-friendly biomass such as sugarcanes, CAM plant, whey and even waste sulfite liquors. The process of manufacturing biofuels goes on by culturing recombinant strains like yeast with these biomasses. And the recombinant microbes can be used not only for prevention and detection of a pollution but for purification of polluted spaces by a series of designed mechanisms which metabolizes pollutants to another harmless substances.
Last but not least, we suggested the outlook of synthetic biology in a developmental and ethical aspect. The way to develop synthetic biology can be told it is on an extension of its history so far. The direction of synthetic biology is on the two points; decentralization"

Chlorite Dismutase Composite Part [Cld(SP-)]
See the full characterization of CLD(SP-) on the BioBrick Registry
Here we have the Cld+sp and Cld-sp g-blocks from the previous slide digested with BsaI, resulting in the respective sticky ends. These sticky ends are complementary to the sticky ends of the CPB-38-441 expression vector which is shown below. This particular vector contains the Kanamycin Resistance gene which we used as a selectable marker when we plated our transformed cells in media treated with kanamycin. This plasmid also contains a LacI repressor which acts as the on/off switch for gene expression. Upon induction with IPTG, the repressor releases its bind on the lac operators, allowing RNA polymerase to begin transcription. The plasmid also includes the “Tinsel” gene from DNA 2.0’s “Paintbox” chromophore collection. The expression of this chromogenic protein will play an important part in the selection process of our transformation.
It is important to note that our BioBrick Submission was sent on an iGEM Registry standard backbone, different from the plasmid shown in the image above.

Besides, diffusion tests were carried out by our team to choose the best materials of the device. After answering these questions, the device containing our system was modeled and printed in 3D thanks to Jean-Jacques Dumas help, a professional in the design of industrial products.
Finally, once our product created, our team developed a business plan in order to project ourselves into a business creation project, define the action plan to be implemented to exploit this opportunity and how that will result in financial terms. Here, we were assisted by Pierre-Alain Hoffmann, Deputy Director of the business incubator named CRITT Bio-Industries, who has a lot of knowledge in business creation and development.

Scope statement
The scope statement is divided in two main chapters: the project presentation and the project requirements. In that entrepreneurship part, our goals are:
to define clearly the context, the purpose and the organization of the project;
to describe all the functional and technical specifications that our product must meet.
The testimonies and reflection made through the ethical matrix were taken into account to define the requirements of the product. Once all that points mentioned, the reflection about the design of the product can begin.
Chapter 1 - Project presentation
I. Context
Cholera is a diarrhea-causing disease that has affected the entire world through many epidemics throughout history. Today it still strikes developing countries, war-torn countries or those affected by natural disasters. It is contracted after ingestion of water contaminated with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The main cause of cholera epidemics is the lack of drinking water and sanitation resources in affected countries. According to the WHO, between 1.3 and 4 million cases are reported worldwide each year, causing 21,000 to 143,000 deaths.
Rehydratation is a very efficient treatment to cure the patients, however some people can not get this treatment early enough because they live in remote areas or can not have access to drinkable water. Thus, a solution to treat water in these areas has to be found. Current solutions including sterilizing filtration, treatment by chlorination, etc. are expensive or difficult to set up.
II. Purpose of the project
Our team wants to make a new system to detect the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae in water and purify"

"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#AlbertoNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," gel electrophoresis proved that they indeed contain the DNA (i.e. cut plasmid).
The use of new E. coli cells in concentrated amount in the transformation of ligation reactions resulted in a few plates that contained colonies.
The ligated parts showed reduced efficiency in both plasmid prep and miniprep.
Further efforts are being done to verify the ligated parts and the possibility of false positive.
I ligated and transformed the ligation reaction from last week. Unfortunately, only the single cut GFP Composite (Bba_E0240) showed a single colony, despite the fact that it was supposedly the positive control. The ligation reaction for this particular plate was done on the bench top at room temperature for 30 minutes. I initially planned to verify that ligated plasmid by comparing it with uncut GFP Composite (Bba_E0240). But I decided against it because nobody was planning to do gel on that day and running just one sample seemed inefficient. We then had a discussion where we realized the following: Supercoiled plasmid can usually be transformed easily. But ligated plasmid is not supercoiled, hence its relatively large size, making such plasmid more difficult to enter the bacteria through transformation. We can now understand why our bacteria transformed BioBrick parts easily, but had problems with the ligated parts. The amount of bacteria in each reaction tube might not be enough to uptake the ligated parts. To solve this problem, we got a new E. coli batch from MIT that contains 10^2 to 10^3 more bacteria in it. One attempt at transforming ligation reaction using those new cells resulted in the two plates with very small colonies. They were almost invisible to the naked eye, but additional incubation allowed these colonies to be clearly visible.
Assuming that higher amount of cells can fix our ligation problem, I transformed several past overnight ligation reaction that consist of: GFP Composite + R2000, GFP Composite + pCat (I14033), GFP Composite + pTet (R0040), Positive Control (J23101), and Negative Control (E. coli on plain LB). The transformation protocol used here was quite dissimilar from the regular one because 800 uL of the new E. coli cells would be concentrated into 200 uL by centrifugation and resuspension. The heat shock would be done on the heating block for 30-45 seconds and the recovery would take place inside the shaker. After overnight incubation at 37 degree, the Positive Control and Negative Control plates contained numerous colonies."

The idea of starting an iGEM project the following year in new universities, such as the American University of Beirut, was also discussed. The event consisted of short presentations followed by longer conversations and took about 3 hours.

Grade 5s (age 10-11)
Brief Description:
In collaboration with Robogals Melbourne, NYUAD IGEM was able to integrate synthetic biology and bioengineering related topics into a hands-on engineering and robotics workshop at a local public primary school in Melbourne. Approximately 50 Grade 5 students at Camberwell Primary School had the opportunity to participate in the unique Robogals LEGO EV3 robotics workshop run by Robogals Melbourne. Robogals is a not for profit organisation founded in Melbourne that aims to encourage girls to pursue a career in engineering and other STEM related fields, seeing as their goals aligned congruently with many of NYUAD IGEM’s own outreach objectives, we integrated an informative presentation about iGEM and other opportunities in bioengineering and synthetic biology for the students to consider once they enter high school and beyond. It was a 90 minute workshop that introduced a wide range of engineering disciplines, highlighting the iGEM competition and what biosynthetic engineering is and the roles it plays in society, followed by a robotics workshop whereby students learnt to program their own Lego EV3 robot with a light and ultrasonic sensor. The students not only learnt about the wide scope of engineering and its applicability in everyday life but also had the opportunity to learn a new skill in an interactive and fun way! Special thanks to Robogals Melbourne for this wonderful collaboration.

We cloned G. LucidumGPD homology regions (pC13BJ, pc13BK, pC13BL, pC13BM). Yesterday's PCR reruns were run on a gel to make sure the right regions were amplified. All have correct bands! We column purified the reruns and digested with EcoRI and PstI. We also digested more pC13F with EcoRI and PstI and dephosphorylated the vector. We purified and ligated the reruns with pC13F. The cultures that looked good from yesterday's colony PCRs were miniprepped. We then made cultures and did a colony PCR of A.Pgpd in pSB1C3 GC from July 31st. A gel of the colony PCRs was run - colonies 1, 3, 4, and 5 looked successful and had the correct band insert length. A transformation of pA13AM+pC13E ligation did not work since the plate was contaminated. Sequencing of pC13AS #1, 3, 5 and pCh13W (hph BB) GC 3.1, 3.5, nGC 3.1 was prepared. An overnight culture of PpelA #2,3,5 was set up for miniprepping tomorrow and sequencing. We transformed pC13P+pC13E #3 and plated for cultures tomorrow, which we will then miniprep and sequence.
We continued working with the PCRs of the GPD homology regions and the successful ligations of the previous day's PpelA promoter, hygromycin resistance, and T7 promoter in front of the herbicide-resistance bar gene, as well as T7 polymerase behind a constitutive promoter and Aspergillus promoter.

WashU_StLouis,2015,Team:WashU StLouis#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," finely tuned in order to achieve optimal nitrogenase activity. We decided to use 2 different inducible promoters to give us more control over expression levels, and grouped the genes into ones we thought would need to be expressed at higher versus lower levels.
We decided to create 2 plasmids with 7 genes each rather than one plasmid with 14 genes, which would simplify cloning greatly. We designed one plasmid containing genes that we generally believed needed to be expressed at higher levels, including the enzyme structural genes.
In ordering the genes on the plasmids, we mimicked gene orders we observed in the natural Cyanothece cluster and in other minimal clusters in the literature. Since we did not have the resources to codon optimize, we also considered codon usage in placement of genes on the plasmids. One gene, cysE2, has particularly bad codon usage for E. Coli, so we placed it directly downstream of the promoter.
Primer Design and Cloning Strategy
We designed primers for use with Golden Gate cloning to create the plasmids. Our general strategy for primer design was to add a BsaI site and one intervening base before the fifteen-base RBS before the annealing portion on the forward primer. When possible, we used the first four bases of the RBS as the overhang for ligation, rather than adding in bases and creating a scar. On the reverse primer, we added a BsaI site and one intervening base before adding the reverse complement of the overhang that it should match up with. In designing primers, we considered:
maintaining a primer length of 60 nucleotides or less
having a melting temperature (T m) of the primer-template interaction between about 58 and 62 degrees Celsius
matching the melting temperature of primers in a primer pair as closely as possible to each other
maintaining a hairpin melting temperature as low as possible, and always less than the T m of the primer-template interaction
maintaining heterodimer and homodimer interaction delta G values to be less in magnitude than -15 kcal/mol
adding up to 6 adenines before the BsaI site where possible
having overlap sequences that are distinct enough from other overlap sequences used for the same plasmid
our criterion was to have a maximum of 2 of the same base in the same position. i.e. GACT and CAGT are acceptable as only A and T fall in the same positions. However, GACT and CACT are too similar and one must be changed to avoid improper ligation"

HUMAN PRACTICE —— INTERCRATED AND GOLD
Throughout the whole preparation process of Metlab, we paid attention to every suggestion from the professions and the peers.
April, we came up to build a metabolic-network-related tool, and soon consulted Prof. Tao to make sure that our idea is worth developing. At the same time, he raised the challenges.
May, when we were digging the background, the communication with Prof. Wang pushed us to enlarge our database for network alignment.
Summertime, we sought suggestions aboard. It is highly effective that we made our tool far more comprehensive and user-friendly by adding other related functions and achieving visualization.
In the meantime, we kept active communication with organizations and teams all over the world. Every presentation we made to others helped our Metlab become better.
Each step, we keep improving our project based on researchers'needs and doubts.
That’s what we truly care.
The details are as follows.
Expert Interview
Prof. Fei Tao
School of Life Sciences & Biotechnology
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Dr. Tao is now an associate professor of SJTU. He has been engaged in the research of microbial synthetic biology since he got the doctoral degree. He mainly focuses on developing efficient cell factories and advanced biocatalytic technology based on the concept of synthetic biology.
Our interview concentrated on the topic “Application of metabolic network alignment tool in the laboratory”. Dr. Tao told us design of metabolic networks in synthetic biology focus on these aspects: 1.Yield; 2. Efficiency(in A -> B, concentration of B/A); 3. Period. Then we briefly introduced the idea of our software (a metabolic network alignment tool). Dr. Tao was greatly interest in the tool. He also analyzed a number of factors that lead to the difficulty of metabolic network alignment. How to evaluate similarity of two metabolic networks? How to grade the result of alignment? How to evaluate similarity of different compound…… His opinion made us have a deeper understanding of how make our software more practical and functional in the laboratory.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," \frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_b} \approx 0.6             \]             However, in our model of dCas9-gRNA binding, we used \(\alpha_i\approx 0\). This simplification is justified by the fact that the inhibited level is very close to the autofluorescence level. Taking into account the leakiness of inhibition will make the model more realistic, but also render it more complex and less informative. Hence, the goal of the modeling will not be the exact reproduction of experimental results nor the fitting of unknown parameter. Modeling will be a computational tool that provides a qualitative description of our bio-transistors, a description that may  be used to design complex logic circuits.  By neglecting \(\alpha_i\) (which does not appears anywhere on the inhibition kinetic model), we obtained the following response for our transistor.
Inhibited GFP expression in E. coli.
Due to the simplification we made, the inhibited level is very low at steady state. Our model will thus accentuate the boolean ""character"" of our transistor.
Transistor chaining in E. coli
The possibility of chaining multiple transistors is needed in order to create complex logic circuits. Since our model does not suffer from leakage and biological noise, chaining should not be a problem. In the next graph we can see that the response of a system composed of two bio-transistors: the first one produces a gRNA that in turn binds to free dCas9 in order to activate GFP production.
Chaining in E. coli.
We can see that the stationary state of GFP expression is similar to simple activation. In addition, the superposition of GFP kinetic curves for chaining and simple activation shows a shift in time of the first case with respect to the second, as expected.
Simultaneous activation and inhibition in E. coli
As we explained extensively in the Binding section, in our system it is possible to have dCas9-gRNA complexes bound at the same time on the activating and inhibiting sites. In this case, it is not  clear a priori if this binding is completely independent or if there is an interaction between the dCas9s. Our experiments (cf. Results ) showed that the GFP production depends on the distance between the activating and inhibiting site. If we have an inhibiting site too close to the activating one, the GFP production will be smaller than in the case were we have activation alone, but it is still much higher than the basal level. Given these results, we can consider a binding model which is almost exclusive (\(J\gg 1\))."

We first had the idea that we should create a filter that the consumers can purchase to clean NPs out of their household waste. However, after the bioethics panel, the results showed that most people think WWTPs functioning under the government should be responsible for cleaning NP waste, because all wastewater would eventually accumulate in the WWTPs. Aside from analyzing the responses from the bioethics panel, we also tested products from NP manufactures (discussed below) that proved targeting wastewater would be the most ideal approach to clean NP waste. This is why we decided to focus our project on trapping NPs in WWTPs.

Apex Nanotek
To learn more about the applications of NPs, we visited a nanotech company that uses silver NPs to make various antimicrobial products. The researcher and manager of Apex Nanotek, Chery Yang, introduced us to their main product, which is antimicrobial nanosilver activated carbon. Pure activated carbon, commonly used to treat sewage and industrial exhaust, is prone to bacterial growth. To overcome this problem, they integrate crystallized nanosilver into the activated carbon for their antimicrobial effects. One of their products is a showerhead, with nanosilver activated carbon filters to kill bacteria when water flows through the showerhead.
We tested the product by comparing SEM images between tap water and filtered water from the showerhead. The showerhead decreased the number of bacteria and larger particles from tap water! However, we also observed the release of NPs from the filter, which will flow into wastewater. (Interviewed by Christine C., Kelly C., Yvonne W., Chansie Y., and Justin Y.)

Collaboration
In August, We were informed that the Nanjing-China team needed our help to build their model. Considering that the communication and collaboration is a truly important part of doing research of synthetic biology, we promised that we would help them. So, then, they sent us their documents about their circuit and the function they wanted to realize. Our team had a discussion and found something we didn’t understand, so we had a video conference with them to know more about their circuits and confirm those details that we need to build this model. When we had finished a half of the formulation work, they came to our school to visit some igem team and had a discussion with us. We showed them our work and asked for their suggestion and after that we confirmed more details and adjust a few equation. After we listed all the equations, we tried to simplify them. And then we begin to bury ourselves in coding, using the Matlab tool. We set a map with some parameters and some cells, with the map and cells’ state we can get new data of each cell and with the new state and the old map we got a new map and refresh it. With the right method and code, the only thing we needed is the right parameters of those equations. After finished that, we got the result which met our expects. Finally, we sent the code and equations to them and finished this work. With collaboration, we have got many communications with those who have the same dream in synthetic biology and learnt so much from each other.

Guelph,2008,Team:Guelph#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the gene's normal function. If you're lucky, you can find a natural mutant, or make one using random mutagenisis. However, in complex eukaryotes with tens of thousands of genes, it is impossible to expect that you can get knock outs for any particular gene you want to study. As of a decade ago, it began to be possible to use RNAi to selectively knock out your particular gene by making a transgenic organism expressing double stranded RNA with the same sequence of the target gene. For a eukaryote like corn, this makes it possible to knock out one particular gene you want to study, but it does require about a year for that transgenic corn to be made. An alternative in some eukaryotes is Viral Induced Gene Silencing, or VIGS, whereby the double stranded RNA is transiently delivered into the organism by a virus. VIGS has only been developed for certain eukaryotes however (not including corn), and even so is only a transient way to silence a gene, giving a scientist only a portion of the eukaryote's life cycle where gene function might be studied. We ask ourselves, can a system be made which could effectively silence eukaryotic genes using RNAi, but more quickly and cheaply than making a transgenic eukaryote and more stably and long term than by using VIGS? Our idea is that a normal endosymbiont of an organism could do this if it can be coaxed to produce this RNAi signal. Read on to find out how we'll test this idea...

So what is the stategy we should follow? Initially this  Hydrogen synthetic operon paper was inspiring us:

Its specific for a bacterial synthetic  operon and if we followed it we wouldn't have to rework things too hard in order to follow it.
However, this was not a perfectly Biobrick compliant strategy, and there were unecessary extra steps we'd have to follow so we reworked our strategy. Instead the strategy we followed depended on sequentially adding genes to an operon by cutting the a biobrick plasmid containing CrtE with SpeI and PstI, and adding each consecutive XbaI / PstI cut gene via ligation. The last gene will have transcription terminators on the end. Next we would add promoters, and uing EcoRI and"

Another observation is that, as the concentration of the antigen increases, the rate of the reaction (i.e. formation of the nanobody-antigen complex) reaches equilibrium faster (Figure 3.5 to Figure 3.9). This can be explained by the increased forward reaction rate which depends on the concentration of the GFP specific nanobody and antigen (GFP).

Also, MerR repress its own expression at Pr independently of Hg(II).  In our design, merR was isolated from the operon and assembled with constitutive promoters of some strength to maintain its expression intensity at certain level. For the same reason, the divergent promoter PR was also removed by deletion of its -35 region (Fig 1).

The -35 and -10 regions for both PmerR and PmerTPAD are marked with boxes, and the dyad symmetrical DNA sequence that MerR recognizes and binds to is marked with arrows under the DNA sequence. (A) The divergently oriented promoters are marked by blue box and purple box, respectively.  (B) In our project, the expression intensity of MerR should be maintained exogenously, so the divergent promoter PR (of MerR transcript) was also removed by deletion of its -35 region. The resulted promoter sequence is marked with a dark purple box Modiﬁed from (Hobman, Wilkie et al. 2005)
As shown in Fig 1, the key sequence for MerR’s binding is a region of interrupted dyad symmetry (19bp) located between the -35 and -10 haxamers of PTPCAD (The top strand). And the structure of PR (botton strand) is similar to PTPCAD in a divergent orientation. The -10 hexamers of PTPCAD and PR actually overlap by four bases. (Park, Wireman et al. 1992).

In summary, we know that under the control of the both promoter, AarC can express successfully. The results showed that AarC can let E.coli use acetate well but may can’t consume acetic acid as our tentative idea.
We have a dilemma that if we didn’t add so much acetic acid, we can’t detect it by HPLC because LB medium also have a same peak there. But we found that E.coli growth badly in 2mg/mL acetic acid. We guess because our E.coli have AarC enzyme, so when they dead in LB medium, AarC released and transformed succinate in medium and themselves to acetate. That is why in figure 9 & 10 the acetic acid is higher than control group. There are many problems and we need more studying in future.
Leucine Utilization
Overview
Goal: With the aim to enhance E.coli utilize leucine dramatically, we express liv operon heterogeneously in BL21(DE3)
Achievements: Successfully construct 6 plasmids in which the six gene from liv operon reside flanking with the same promoter, RBS and terminator. In addition, a similar plasmid containing whole liv operon was constructed as well. The expression level of the six genes has been scrutinized via quantitative PCR. The functions of all seven devices have been tested via spectrophotometer, the results of which suggest that all of the gene can reduce the amount of leucine in LB liquid medium.

Introduction
Leucine is one of the element that can be metabolized to isovaleric acid by microorganisms on foot and then delivers awful odor. Thus we design a kind of special strain can utilize leucine dramatically so that other microbe can’t have this kind of raw materials to produce chemicals that have unpleasant smell.

Besides, he established the scientific basis of the project.                                     He was responsible for building bridges among the different members of the group as                                     well as with the IQS University. On the other hand, he focused on the design of the                                     gene extraction strategy, working hand in hand with Roger. He also was in charge to                                     establish a potential collaboration with the UPF iGEM team, to assess whether the                                     extraction strategy that they formerly designed was robust or not. He was essential                                     for the design and launch of the wiki. Finally, he prepared several speeches in                                     Bars and restaurants to clear up misunderstandings related to celiac disease, as                                     well as the final presentation for the Giant Jamboree.

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Results STEP_-_-_TEXT.html,"fection.
At the beginning we transfected HEK293T cells with different TC/PC ratio. We used VEGF-STEP as an example. We controlled the final concentration of TC and PC respectively and changed it of the other chain (Figure 3). Cells were transfected 12 h after seeding and VEGF was added 24 h later. Photos were taken 24 h later under 561 nm exciting light.
Figure 3. Transcription ratio test. (a) Relative fluorescence intensity at different PC concentration. Relative fluorescence intensity is evaluated by grey level measurement of ImageJ. The dynamic range increases as TC/PC ratio rises, while the gene expression drops after 14.  (b) Relative fluorescence intensity at different TC concentration. It seems not to have a significant difference from 8 – 16.
Total Quantity
From the results above we could conclude that TC/PC = 12 is a relatively ideal ratio. So we chose this ratio for the following experiments.  Our model also confirmed the results and suggested that better dynamic range may be achieved by reducing the total quantity of plasmids. Thus we changed the total quantity, and obtained best effect at 0.75 fold of the original quantity (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Relative fluorescence intensity at different transfection quantity. The 1.00 indicates the original quantity of 3 μg/ml TC and 0.25 μg/ml PC. . The best dynamic range is found in 0.75-fold, presenting a 4.90-fold of reporter expression level.
To conclude the results of the overall VEGF test in HEK293T, the best transfection ratio is around 12, and the best quantity of plasmids encoding the two chains is around 2.44 μg per ml.
Further Results
We then use HEK293T cells to examine our D-Dimer-STEP (Figure 5a). It’s quite surprising that this system has extremely low background noise (data not shown), and reached a 3.17-fold dynamic range at the TC/PC ratio of 12. This results suggests that D-Dimer-scFv may has a better characteristics for STEP system than VEGF-scFv, and we plan to quantify related features of them and further examine their influence to the quality of the whole system.
Apart from tests in HEK293T cells, we also tested the TC/PC = 12 ratio in HeLa cells, but didn’t get expected outcome (Figure 5b). This means that transfection ratios and quantities must be measured and modelled separately"

Agents and tokens
Agents and tokens represent the constituent molecules of a system. Agents are quantified in terms of their population number and are characterised having binding sites. Whereas tokens are quantified in terms of their concentration and do not have binding sites.
Rules
Rules represent specific bio-chemical processes, and involve either tokens, agents or both. Each rule has an initial condition which must be satisfied for the rule to be valid. If the conditions are met, the rule is applied according to the rate.
Rates
Each rule has a specific rate constant which determines the number of times the rule is applied for each instance of the rule.
Observables
Observables determine the output data in terms of either agent count or token concentration.
MATLAB®
MATLAB® is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It can be used to analyse data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. For guidance on using MATLAB® please see the mathworks documentation .
The model
The model describes the absorption spectrum of the cell as a function of time and a given time invariant incident light spectrum. This is achieved by calculating the effect of the known light input on the individual light sensitive proteins. This information is then fed into a stochastic simulation of the biological pathways that computes how the population of sensors and pigments vary over time. The total absorption spectrum over time is given by the sum of the product of every protein's population and the corresponding absorption spectrum of the protein. In this section each of these steps in considered in the following subsections.
It will be helpful to read the theory page and the modelling software section of this page before reading further as an understanding of the biological pathways and software is important.
Sensor activation rate calculation
In the rule based model each sensor is thought of as a two-state binary system (on/off). In the on state it catalyses the phosphorylation of the primary intermediate, sending a signal to the downstream pathway. In the off state it does not.
Activation by light either turns a sensor on or off depending on the sensor species; red and blue light sensors are switched off when activated, while the green light sensor is switched on when activated. The activation rate is the forward rate of the rule that governs the state of a sensor. Its counterpart, the deactivation rate is the backward rate of the same rule and is constant. The activation"

Background
A group of rough-toothed dolphins surfacing synchronously
Origin Link
One of the most interesting and complex types of group behaviors in animals is that several organisms act simultaneously and repetitively at regular intervals of time.1 Ordinarily, this kind of behavior is called “synchronous”. It has been observed in Thailand that male Pteroptyx malaccae fireflies, congregated in trees, flash in rhythmic synchrony with a period of about 560 ± 6 msec (at 28°C). Males of a special Chinese species of firefly called Qiongyuying flash synchronously during mating season. Besides, we also observed that bees crawling in the same small area display a synchrony of wings fluttering in order to scare off intruders，and we filmed a video clip to demonstrate this phenomenon.
Moreover, synchrony has been described in a range of mammal groups, including odontocete cetaceans (a kind of toothed whale).2 The odontocete cetaceans behave synchronously when they breathe on the surface of water.

Origin Link
In the microcosm, a synthetic gene oscillator whose oscillatory cycle can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source has been designed by Jesse Stricker and his cooperators to accomplish the synchronous oscillation. It uses both E.coli and yeast as component cells. In this oscillator system, chemicals (IPTG, arabinose) are used as a series of signals to initiate synchronous oscillations within single cells of the colony.3

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,", no clear difference is observed between the samples harvested in the exponential growth phase and the samples harvested at the stationary growth phase. Suggesting that with the GusA reporter the level of repression is quite stable and not influenced by the accumulation of protein inside the cell. There is only one exception, pMTL82251 sgRNA A5 has a negative effect on the gusA activity measured at OD600 of 1.0 but not at the stationary phase. Furthermore, pMTL71401 sgRNA A5 has no effect on gusA expression. This suggest that the observed reduced expression of gusA for pMTL82251 sgRNA A5 during exponential growth is most likely due to an error in the assay. Only sgRNA A4 seems to behave differently when expressed from a different vector; showing strong repression in pMTL82251 and medium repression in pMTL71401. The observed discrepancy could be due to the difference between the copy number of the two vector backbones or a detrimental mutation in the PtcdA promoter or the gusA gene which inactivates the promoter or disrupts the gusA gene.
In the future we would like to repeat the GusA assay to characterise the activity of sgRNAs targeting PtcdB. Subsequently, the best sgRNAs to repress the PtcdA and PtcdB promoter can be expressed together with dCas9 in C. difficile to determine their effectiveness in repressing toxicity. In addition, different combinations of sgRNAs can be used in these assays to potentially increase the tightness of the system. Since we were not able to transform our construct into C. difficile but it has been proven that our construct shows the expected results, transforming the construct into C. difficile and conducting cytotoxicity assay will be ideal.
Antisense RNA
The ultimate objective was to incorporate the described asRNA system suppressing two C. difficile toxins into the phiSBRC prophage of C. difficile. The edited prophage could then be prepared from a stock C. difficile culture and used as a phage therapy treatment on patients suffering from C. difficile infections. To first demonstrate the efficacy of the asRNA constructs at suppressing toxin production the two constructs we created were cloned into a plasmid vector suitable for transforming C. difficile. The C. difficile cultures harbouring asRNA plasmids were compared to wild type C. difficile in terms of supernatant cytotoxicity using African green monkey kidney epithelial cells of the ‘Vero’ lineage. C. difficile cultures were monitored over five days in terms of optical density as"

Can Bees Ingest Culture?
Names: Dinula De Silva and Chris Issac
Objective: Determine if bees can ingest E.coli in liquid culture form with supplementation of sugar. Also, can mites survive on papers that have water and RFP liquid culture?
Procedure: Bees were obtained from the “Mighty Hive” near the penitentiary at 6:50 after a heinous struggle and lack of proper equipment. They were then fed RFP producing E.coli that had been supplemented with both glucose and sucrose sugars. The bees were then observed to determine if they were drinking the solution.
Mites were added to petri dishes following a sugar shake. The dishes had different paper derivatives soaked in treatment; H2O and RFP E. coli. They were then placed in the 27C iGEM incubator. They will be observed in the morning.
The bees were euthanized on EtOH, then surface sterilized in bleach, opened using a razor to expose the gut, and placed in LB to shake at 37C overnight. Problem: 50ul of kanamycin was added instead of 5ul. I suppose that’s what happens when you work a 13 hour day in the sun.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"To prove that our concept of splitting biosensors across multiple cells would work, we designed an IPTG sensor. The design of this system can be found in Figure 4. In this system, LacI is constitutively expressed in the detector cell and represses the production of LasI. When IPTG is added, it binds LacI, preventing repression. Therefore, in the presence of IPTG, LasI will produce C12, our first connector molecule. To determine that our system would work, it was first tested in silico. Details on the model of this system can be found on our Modelling page .

Figure 5: Colony PCR confirming the correct integration of the biosensor fragments into the vector.
Characterisation
The Framework characterisation has been performed using a BMG-Labtech fluostar optima plate reader in order to monitor the absorbance (OD600 nm) and GFP fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm).
The 3 cultures (IPTG detector, processor and sfGFP reporter) were grown separately in LB+ chloramphenicol on a shaker at 37C. After the overnight incubation the cultures were diluted to OD600 0.1 in order to achieve the syncronised growth to reach the late exponential phase. At OD600 between 0.5 and 0.7 the cultures were mixed in ratio1:1:1 and IPTG 1mM was added. To test the functionality of the processor and the output, tests with the specific quorum sensing molecules were performed as described below.
Reporter test. The culture carrying the reporter device BBa_K2205015 was also tested individually after induction with the connector C12-RHL 2 ug/ul as shown in the graph (Figure 6).
Figure 6: The reporter part BBa_K2205015 test shows a significant fluorescence increase after induction with the connecting molecule 2 C12-RHL.
