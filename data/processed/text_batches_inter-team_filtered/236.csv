""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
— Peter Carr, Director of Judging
We devoted ourselves to the educational, public engagement and public perception activities. At the meantime we also did a lot in user survey to upgrading our software. According to those issues, we hope our project could benefit the public and attract more people to be involved in synthetic biology.
Public Engagement
Science and Technology exhibition in Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
On Aug 8th 2015, our team gave a science show of our project for the residents in Shanghai Science and Technology Museum by free to initiate people's interest in interdiscipline.
Mostly, people were attracted by our post; they would come by although the content is unfamiliar with them. It was our pleasure to introduce the basic knowledge to them. Of course, most of the questions were asked by the teenagers who seems to have more interest in the new science field.
After the whole day, we got tired but felt meaningful. There are too many people who don't know the basic conceptions of biology, and in the end, we told to the staff that our team were willing to participate this exhibition next year.
Conference in Taiwain
During July19th-23th 2015, we took part in an International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held in National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. 5 of our team members went there to share our ideas with and offer advice to other teams most of which were from Asia. Jun Chen showed our project to all the others on July 22th, and we were offered many suggestions for updating our project, some of them were really useful.
In the end, Relationships were built with lots of teams, we also gained three teams to be our partners  for further cooperation.
Newsletter in Xiamen University
In order to let more and more college student be aware about our project, BASE, as our project name, is published by the Newsletter in Xiamen University on July 28th,2015. We want those students studying in the university to notice the interdiscipline, that's what we mostly value. We believe that nowadays plenty of questions need to be solved by the cooperation from different fields. So our team makes the introduction of this conception as an important part of our human practice.

Potential risks
Our project poses the typical risks of working in a biology lab. So we reduce those risks by fulfilling safety level 1 procedures as seen below.
Waste treatment
All biological materials (including genetically modified organism (abbreviation GMO)) or equipment, that was used for handling, is collected separately and autoclaved.
Transportation:
Closed boxes are used for transportation between labs but if possible, transportation between labs should be avoided.
Emergency reaction:
If lab coats or clothes start burning, use emergency showers.
If acids or other harmful liquids get into the eyes, use eye showers.
If injuries occurred, treat them with first aid-kits, report the injury, and go to the hospital if necessary.
If solutions with GMO is running down the bench (or other kinds of contamination), swap it and disinfect the place with Bacillol.
Protective equipment:
Lab coats are mandatory.
Safety glasses are mandatory in special areas of the lab and should be used in other areas if necessary.
Usage of safety gloves are mandatory in special areas of the lab and should be used depending on the working materials.
Other rules:
Do not work alone. There should be at least one person from the lab, who is not part of the iGEM team.
Do not pipette with your mouth.
Disinfect hands after contamination with GMOs.
Disinfect hands and wash them after working in the lab.
Furthermore our project includes the handling of non-canonical amino acids, which we treat according to their special requirements.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

We want to acknowledge those who helped throughout the project:
The University of Westminster, for helping organise and assemble the team, as well as paying for the teams expenses including the entry into iGEM.
Marko Obvran, one of the team leaders, contributed to the project by adjusting the goal of polystyrene biodegradation via his research on alternative chemical routes of styrene preparation, as well as working on integrating the project with the Human Practices aspect. This included leading production for “The Plastic Lab” video and critically analysing the current routes of natural polystyrene degradation. He also helped with page and logo design. Without him the iGEM project would have been based on an entirely different field and may not have had any application for society.
Kris, also one of the team leaders, led the laboratory portion of the iGEM project. He also spent time researching enzyme bioinformatics  and organising laboratory procedures. Without him the assembling and characterising of the BioBricks parts would not have taken place.
Sara Mubeen, who was responsible for the bioinformatics section of the project. She also immensely helped with team organisation and led the team when it came to outreach events such as the school visit. The team owes her a great deal as the BioBricks would not have been characterised had she not have been present in the team and the outreach events may not have been successful.
Jen, who was also part of the lab team within the iGEM project. He supported and carried out laboratory work including the Plastic Lab aspect of the project. Without him laboratory work including the Plastic Lab would not have been completed in time meaning no results would have been produced.
Timofey, the creator of the wiki for the iGEM team, he also helped with the Plastic Lab experiments. Without him, the website and entire wiki would not have been displayed for iGEM to see as he spent the majority of time learning to code and creating the pages on the iGEM domain.

Ethics and how the iGEM community Should behave
When working with synthetic biology, we have the urgent need to question our own methods and seek solutions that are focused care and monitor our actions with a clear and correct target. However, as a scientific community, we do not have a clear model to follow regarding this issue.
iGEM ​​encourages teams every year to deepen in this subject and try to improve on the work that has been done, however, although ethics is not a subjective matter, lends itself to interpretations, even when analyzed the same points from as many socio-cultural perspectives, as happens with the iGEM teams.
Every year we witness new breakthroughs in our field, every year we have the opportunity to see how each member of the iGEM community contributes to push the boundaries of knowledge in Synthetic Biology, every year, it is possible to characterize new parts, new vectors and new chassis, and this forces us also to question further.
So the question arises: Where should we draw the line ?, What is the limit to what we can do? and How do we do right?
A few days ago, we read a comic in which a futuristic dystopian perspective on what will be showing the progress of synthetic biology
And it's very funny, and somewhat unrealistic, but shows a potential reality that can happen if you do not take care of our work and we take a position of full responsibility in our day to day.
You can then conclude that it is necessary that the synthetic biology community, and particularly iGEM, which represents the vast majority of those who work in this field, we have an outline to guide us and be our reference for this field.
Professional codes of ethics are a way in which a complete professional community can agree on ethical guidelines on which to follow for the situations. For this, Team BIOSINT_Mexico we stick to an idea:
Create a code of professional ethics for the iGEM community
To validate our idea, we conducted a survey, which was attended by many iGEM teams and asked about his opinion regarding our"

Brochure Designing and Preaching
Our team of practice designed a brochure on knowledge about kidney disease carefully in order to                         make more patients with diabetes and hypertension recognize the dangers of the development of                         chronic kidney disease(CKD), and help the old to prevent CKD, hypertension and diabetes early.In                         July 2018, we held a knowledge preaching about the early prevention of CKD in Jianshan Community                         of Dalian ,and at the same time, we distributed our brochure designed by ourselves.In a summer                         house in the community, we distributed the brochure to some aunts,which lead them to understand                         the dangers of kidney disease, the causes of kidney disease, and methods for preventing early                         kidney disease. Besides, we answered many questions about diabetes and high blood pressure asked                         by those aunts patiently. After we had a further communication with community residents by                         interviewing them, we clearly felt that they had a deeper understanding of the dangers of CKD                         and the importance of its early prevention,which means our practice is successful enough.
Interviews with Doctors
During the summer vacation, the team members carried out practical activities throughout the                         country and went to the hospital to interview the specialists in the kidney department. We not                         only understand the serious situation that diabetes and hypertension cause the proportion of                         chronic kidney disease in China to rise year by year, but also know that patients with diabetes have no early and staged awareness. When patients come to the hospital for treatment, most of                         them have obvious symptoms and enter CKD phase III, and early visits and treatments are                         extremely important for the development of delayed kidney disease. At present, the diagnosis                         method of the hospital is mainly blood test, but the doctor said that if a non-invasive portable                         detection method through urine can be developed, it can not only alleviate the pain of blood                         drawing, but also have a very high rate of early detection and treatment. In this interview, we                         learned the importance and urgent needs of early detection in the treatment of chronic kidney                         disease and the importance of improving the awareness of early treatment of patients, and more                         deeply recognized the practicality and usefulness of our projects.
Product Research, Fun Marketing
In order to further understand the market demand for our products, the patient's recognition of                         products and their performance expectations for the products, we designed a questionnaire of the                         product. And to help people understand the superiority of our products, we have designed a                         product-based storyline, and we hope to attract more people who interest"

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Chemotaxis Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," of any particular chemoreceptor being occupied depends only on the external concetration of the chemoattractant, but not the total number of the chemoreceptors. Even if the threshold and saturation level of chemoreception does not depend on the chemoattractant concentration (Fig.3).  A different number of receptors would certainly allow for finer-grain adaptation, therefore the strongest promoter is chosen for the best sensitivity.

Figure 2(d): The probability of of bacteria in the running state at different levels of CheYp Figure 2 (a)(b)(c) show that the threshold detection concentration is 10-8 M, and the saturation concentration is 10-5 M. (modelling based on spiro et al [1], codes were modified by Imperial College iGEM team 2011).
Figure 3: The threshold and saturation level of chemoreception detection vs. the chemoattractant concentration. This graph shows clearly that the threshold and saturation level of chemoreception does not depend on the chemoattractant concentration.
The results from our modelling of the chemotaxis pathway show that the threshold chemoattractant concentration for bacterial detection is 1x10-8 M and the level where bacterial chemoattractant detection becomes saturated is 1x10-5 M, causing the bacterial response to the chemoattractant to becomes less efficient. And the strongest promoter is chosen for the highest sensitivity. In addition, the modelling of bacterial population chemotaxis in the next segment will further inform us about the whether our bacteria will be able to move close to the root and at which actual distance the bacteria should be placed.
Collapse
3. Simulation of chemotaxis of a bacterial population
3.1 Objective
Modelling the chemotaxis of bacterial population dynamics under experimental and natural conditions. The model of laboratory conditions will aid the wet lab team in designing their experiments. The model of real soil conditions will further inform our project about how and where we can place our bacteria.
Under experimental conditions, the chemoattractant diffuses constantly from the source. However, in real soil, the root produces malate all the time. Therefore, we assume that the distribution of chemoattractant outside the seed is steady and time-independent. Hence, the modelling of bacterial population chemotaxis will be built with different patterns of chemoattractant"

Kiwi organoleptic properties are definitely worth to be                         improved. It is a well-known source of dietary fiber,                         vitamin E, K, C and carotenoids. Those are needed                         nutrients in some isolated places where foreign fruits                         cannot arrive because of their early harvesting during                         their transport. Improving their organoleptic                         properties could let their preservation until they                         reached those destinations. Kiwi seed oil is rich in                         α-linolenic and Ω-3 fatty acids. These unsaturated                         acids are helpful in the prevention of cardiovascular                         diseases, which have significantly increased in China                         during the last half century. The positive impact of                         those nutrients could be higher by the improvement of                         kiwi organoleptic properties, as it may incentivize its                         intake.
Environmental impact
In terms of production, a slower fruit ripening is a                         logistic priority. Concretely in China, the loss rate                         of fruit is a 20% and barriers imposed to outer food,                         compromising the fresh fruit transport. Although there                         may be strict control policy for an optimum layout,                         there is always a stock being produced. Fruit storage                         means additional expenses in the control of conditions                         that affect organoleptic properties, and in 2007,                         Chinese storage facilities only could accommodate the                         15% of production (19)(20). This makes especially                         difficult the maintenance of small and middle fruit                         enterprises, which cannot cope a scale in the                         production with the lack of conservation                         technology.
Storage costs could be much minor in case of modified                         kiwis with slower ripening, reducing the risk of losing                         product, augmenting the stock quality and the                         competitiveness of final product prices. From the                         consumer perspective, better organoleptic properties                         enrich the gastronomic experience, facilitating the                         intake of positive nutrients mentioned above.
Socio-economic impact
Closely related with logistic in production, the use of                         natural resources to reach the expected demand could                         benefit as well by slowing the harvest losses. A stock                         with good and lasting quality would lead to a decrease                         of the fruit amount to be newly produced. Reducing the                         water and soil used to grow fruit is"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

Thursday (06/15/17)
Sense/Respond: Time to go back to work bright and early. A little after the crack of dawn, the engaged students immediately went to work preparing a digest. The scholars made a 15 uL digest along with a Master Mix. Interactive steps included preparing a mini-prep, mixing with enzyme BSr61-HF, enzyme KpuI-HF, buffer Cutsmart, and water. The remaining solution was then placed in incubation for 2 hours. In addition, students were excited to read and learn about plasmid cloning by restriction enzyme digest and restriction endonuclease. With a desire to learn more, the students trekked back to the lab and met with another qualified scientist to assist in the digest. Once the digest was done, the students made a gel and electrophoresis to analyze the DNA. The electrophoresis sends the DNA down the gel using a positive and negative charge and allows the students to see the amount of base pairs, and in this case also allows the students to see the cut DNA and replacement. However, the young scientists were very disappointed to find out the the digest did not go as expected and DNA did not get replaced as expected. Disappointed but not defeated, the students immediately went back to work and retraced their steps, beginning the process all over again. Things do not always work out in the lab and the students were eager to restart and achieve favorable results.

Safety. We take good care of you!
The uttermost anxiety of those who do not work with genetically modified organisms is concerning safety. We face this critical issue with a tripartite approach. Safety precautions concerning our project can be broken down to the following three topics: Firstly, safety considerations about the wet-lab project, secondly, the general lab safety and thirdly, software safety. In all of the three strands, we deliberated useful approaches and searched communication with safety advisors. Herewith, we wanted to get additional input which we could use for building up our opinion on which parts of the project could be critical or which measures would have to be taken.
General lab safety
The solid basis of safety in the wetlab is good laboratory practice. The best starting point for this purpose are personal safety precautions, such as gloves, safety goggles and lab coats. Besides this, a division of the lab into different areas is crucial, as we were 12 people working in our lab most of the time. We designated separate areas for documentation, which of course did not happen on the benches, for lab-work, where we also worked with genetically modified bacteria and an ethidiumbromide-area where we could perform gel-electrophoresis and gel-analysis.
Furthermore, we shifted working steps with β-mercaptoethanol, organic solvents and corrosives to the available fume cupboard. Naturally, we differentiated regular waste from S1-waste which, of course, is to be autoclaved. This should prevent any contamination of the environment with our bioactive material. We have received basic safety training for S1-work by the safety coordinator Mrs. Dr. Angret Joester before starting our work in the lab.

Parameters
Parameters play an important role in simulating, which would determine the behaviors of the system. In our modeling part, parameters in quorum-sensing e-oscillator are from parameter part of Original Full Model by Tsinghua-A iGEM 2011 and the paper “Rapid and tunable post-translational coupling of genetic circuits” by Arthur Prindle et al. And parameters used in dual-feedback e-oscillator are based on the paper “A fast, robust and tunable synthetic gene oscillator” and parameter table in HUST-China iGEM 2013 . Although these previous work give us some experience, we still adjust some parameters more reasonable in terms of our system and some experimental tests.

Natively, the PCs are enzymatically synthesized by phytochelatin synthase (PCS) from a glutathione (GSH) precursor and the amino acids in the resulting peptide are linked by the non-standard gamma peptide bonds (Cobbett & Goldsbrough 2002, Rea 2012). However, genetically encoded analogues (containing normal alpha-peptide bonds) of different number Glu-Cys (EC) repeats have been characterised, with the EC20 having the highest binding (Bae et al 2000).
Table 1. Metal ion adsorption increase of C. metallidurans cells with PC EC20 displayed on cell surface, compared to negative control. Taken from Biondo et al 2012
The main metal PCs confer tolerance to is Cadmium (Cobbett & Goldsbrough 2002) with a reported stoichiometry of 10 Cd2+ per peptide (Bae et al, . EC20 peptide has still showed good metal ion binding whilst fused to a cellulose binding domain (CBD) for water purification (Xu et al 2002) and when anchored to bacterial cell membrane to confer Cd2+ tolerance (Bae et al 2000, Chaturvedi & Archana 2014). PC EC20 has also been shown to bind many more heavy metals. For example, when displayed on the surface of Cupriavidus metallidurans, the cells capacity to adsorb ions increased by 31 to 219% depending on the ion (table 1, Biondo et al 2012). These binding properties of PC EC20 have been utilised in applications including a regeneratable biosensor of Hg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions to 100 fM–10 mM (Bontidean et al 2003), and to target CdSe/ZnS quantum dots to streptavidin expressing HeLa cells when biotinylated (Pinaud et al 2004).

We met with Michael Axelrod, who manages the Life Sciences Greenhouse at Stony Brook University. We met with Mr. Axelrod to discuss the optimal conditions to grow cyanobacteria. We also discussed the practicality of growing cyanobacteria for biofuels on a commercial scale to meet the demand of consumers. He answered a few of our questions regarding how to set up the incubators for our cyanobacteria. Mr. Axelrod also suggested we used 4100 kelvin fluorescent lamps as a light source in the incubators. He taught us about the limitations of growing plants (difficulty of controlling CO2, humidity, etc.) and lead us to pursue making our own growth chamber. In addition, he let us borrow a quantum sensor to measure light intensity as well as offered to let us use a growth chamber. Thus, we learned much about growing cyanobacteria under optimal growth conditions and considered the feasibility of our project and in turn Mr. Axelrod, who was enthusiastic in helping us troubleshoot aspects of our experimental design, and we were also able to engage him in a discussion of plants as well as cyanobacteria as a source of biofuel.

Zahid Syed, a politician from East Meadow, New York, has had an active role in his community. Having been involved in civic, politics, labor, and human rights issues throughout Long Island, we thought he would be an informative person to speak with in order to gain some insight to our project. After exchanging emails for a week, Mr. Syed and our team thought it would be much more beneficial to meet in person. After listening to our project and our outlook, he provided us with advice and possible logistics we may face. Understanding that our project may have the potential to end world hunger, Mr. Syed was fascinated, and he invited us back to many political events, allowing us to present our project and meet with more members of the local government.
July 5th: Meeting and Presentation with Advisors (Stony Brook University)
At this meeting with the advisors Dr. Balaszi and Dr. French we presented on the progress of our research as well as issues we were currently troubleshooting in the lab. Regarding modeling, Dr. French recommended that we consider flux balance analysis, a mathematical model for simulating metabolism if given specific input and constraints of a certain metabolite, over the incorporation of the Michaelis- Menten equation in"

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria"

As shown in the graph, 1mM of H2O2 was the lethal concentration for E.coli cells. On the other hand, less than 0.000001mM(=1nM) H2O2 has no influence on the survival of E.coli cells. These results suggest that a range of 1nM-1mM of H2O2 is the utilizable concentration for the E.coli Pen.

2. Compare the performances of the high copy vector and low copy vector
In making the E.coli Pen, we thought that it was important to select “ink.” The E.coli Pen, which focused on writing or drawing, is a first attempt in iGEM, so we thought that we should start to select an appropriate vector to produce “ink”, fluorescent proteins. As “ink”, it is necessary to keep writing or drawing clearly over the long term, and we therefore selected an expression vector with high transcriptional efficiency.
In general, pSB6 is a low copy plasmid which makes it more suitable for protein production than the high copy vector. However this information cannot be found in any sites related to iGEM. Consequently, we tried to compare the performances of the high copy vector pSB1 and low copy vector pSB6.
<Experiment method>
E.coli cells were cultivated at 37 ˚C until the optical density (O.D.600) of the medium became 0.4~0.5. Cells were suspended in PBS to obtain the initial O.D.600 = 0.5 because the LB medium has auto fluorescence, then the fluorescent intensity was measured using Thermo Labosystems Floreskan Ascent CF"

We started our collection by gathering words we were commonly using in our everyday lab work, but we soon realized, that we have to expand our search, because a lot of words are deeply integrated in our daily language and we are not aware that they could be misunderstood or not understood at all. In addition to our work on the dictionary, we visited several school classes around Bielefeld, where we presented our work and general information about synthetic biology in front of the pupils. At the end of each presentation the students gave their feedback on how well the topic was understood and which terms and phrases created the most difficulties. These words were then included into our dictionary.  With this, we hope to help other iGEM teams with their public outreach by giving them an opportunity to explain difficult tasks and processes in a way that is easier understandable for the broad public."
Carnegie_Mellon,2012,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Hum-Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," kit , have become part of the Lending Library of Kits of DNAZone , the outreach program of the Center of Nucleic Acids Science and Technology (CNAST) at Carnegie Mellon. The kits in the Library are loaned to high school teachers in the Pittsburgh area to be used in teaching Math and Science. We identified for the teachers how the use of our kit can help the High School students meet specific objectives from the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Science, Technology, and Engineering Education and the Pennsylvania Assessment Anchors . We have also tested the kit in several demonstrations in the Summer of 2012 to high school students enrolled in the Summer Academy of Math and Science (SAMS) at Carnegie Mellon.
A very important original property of our approach to Human Practices stems from the fact that the teaching materials we created are available to teachers in any Pittsburgh Public School District who can borrow them from the Lending Library of Kits and use them even after the work of the current CMU iGEM team ends.  Another original factor is the fact that we identified  for the teachers which objectives from the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Science, Technology and Engineering they can teach using the kit.  This identification should eliminate the barrier to adoption of the kit by teachers faced with tight time schedules to cover these objectives.
System Implemented with the Kit
As described here , our team engineered a fluorescence-based sensor that provides information on both transcription strength and translation efficiency of a promoter. The sensor is noninvasive, easily applied to a variety of promoters, and capable of providing results in a time frame that is short when compared to current technologies for the characterization of promoters.
The sensor is based on the use of an RNA aptamer (termed Spinach) and a fluorogen activating protein (FAP). The complexes of Spinach (mRNA-DMHBI in the Figure) and FAP (FAP-MG in the Figure) with specific dyes, DFHBI and MG, respectively, are fluorescent. Measurements of the fluorescence intensity of these complexes enables one to determine the concentration of mRNA and expressed protein for a given promoter. Analysis of the fluorescence data with an appropriate model leads to the transcription strength and translation efficiency for each promoter.
The Hardware/Software Platform
The goal was to create a model of our biosensor that clearly represents its main components and makes clear how the biosensor works.  We also planned to enable the students to simulate changes in the “environment” and to observe the outcome of these changes.  To achieve this goal, we built an affordable, microcontroller-based, hardware platform and also developed an associated, open-source, simulation software"

The recombinase Cre recognizes short sequences known (loxP) and is then able to excise DNA betweeen two loxP sites that are in the same orientation. Therefore, marker genes flanked by loxP sites can be efficiently excised from transgenic plants if Cre is present.
Light-triggered Killswitch
In order to prevent our moss from escaping into the environment, we have included a light-triggered killswitch. When exposed to red-light, a nuclease system is activated which destroys all genetic material, killing the moss and preventing the spread of genetic material of the moss. With this genetic circuit it would be possible to create an niche for the transgenic moss by just covering an area with a blue  filter foil. For more information, look at the killswitch page .
Biosecurity
Biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins. Physcomitrella itself is in no way pathogenic and is endemic to many parts of the world. However, just like with every transgenic organism, there is the theoretical possibility to use Physcomitrella to cause harm, e.g. when it is used to secrete toxic substances. Nevertheless, other organisms which have for example shorter generation times or are pathogenic by nature seem to be more appropriate for such dual-use applications. Additionally, none of the transgenic plants we created could be used to cause harm.
Labsafety
The lab we work in is classified as BSL 1 (biosafety level 1), according to the Union Directive 2000/54/EG and the German ""Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik ( GenTG )"" (law for the regulation of genetic engineering). There is a total of four Biosafety levels, with BSL 1 being the lowest and BSL 4 being the highest. This classification of the respective Biosafety levels is very similar to the one given in the World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Biosafety Manual . Work inside a BSL 1 lab, such as ours, involves no devices that are potentially harmful to the researchers if they act according to the general precautionary measures. Especially, no pathogenic organisms are used.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," that kind of subclinical information and that leads to scarring, and that leads to trichiasis and blindness later in life. But kids don’t complain that much anyway and there is often a lot of dust around these places so it’s like a facto of life that their eyes are bothering them a little bit, but they don’t complain about it. So it is not that they go to the clinic and have some test for chlamydia. The way it works is all through NGOs which have these programs and it is very public health-ish. It is based on a population and they make decisions based on what the prevalence is in the population. It doesn’t matter if yourself have the disease, all that matters is what’s the prevalence of the disease in your community.
Daniel C.:
It is not like the people go out to seek the doctors? So if we manage to develop this cheap diagnostic method, you would probably use it for mass screenings, right?
Dr. Keenan:
Yes. So what happens right now is that an NGO decides that it wants to do like a rapid assessment. And so they’ll pick a district and they’ll do clustering and sampling where they’ll pick a random number of communities and within that community they’ll pick a number of kids, age 1 to 9, and they go out and they just flick their lids and look for the signs. So you could easily do the same thing but just put a test in there. Just go in there and take a swab and test that way. But it is not really directed from the consumer. It is not like a goes to the clinic. I mean some people do, but only once they get trichiasis. Then they are uncomfortable. But a kid would never do that. A kid doesn’t tell its parents: „Oh my eyes are bothering me. Take me to the clinic to get tested.“ No, that will never happen. It is all gonna be directed by the programs, by the NGOs.
Kai:
Ok. Do you think that would change somehow if we were able to design a really cheap test that you could distribute to communities and they can just go to their local doctor and maybe get tested every year? Do you think that could impact somehow how you cope with the disease?
Dr. Keenan:
I don’t know. It is just not that symptomatic. You are asking a lot of people. If you are not symptomatic for the good of our community you should go every year and get tested? Sorry, but I don’t know if that is gonna happen. I think realistically it is gonna"

Overview
We devote to dividing the polyketide synthases (PKSs) and catalyze according to specific mechanism. Therefore, as if we standardize the genes which encode independent domains of PKSs, we can synthesize new kinds of polyketides by means of permutation and combination of domains.
In the process of analyzing the DEBS1 which catalyze and synthesize 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB)，the precursor of erythromycin, we know that each domain has independent and specific chemical reaction and function.
Name of domain
Function
Acyltransfer-ase, AT
Activating the extended unit------- propionyl group
Acyl carrier protein, ACP
Anchor the polyketide chain needed to extend
Ketocaylsynthase, KS
Combining the propionyl group with acetyl group at the end of the polyketide chain by forming the C—C bond
Keto-reductase, KR
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the β-hydroxyl ester bond
Dehydratase, DH
Dehydrating the extended unit and enabling it to form the α, β- enol ester bond
Enoylreductase, ER
Deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the saturated methylene
Thioesterase, TE
Removing the polyketide chain from PKS
By preliminary analysis of chemical reaction and function of each domain, we can conclude that it is available to analyze their own kinetic mechanism, and it's significant. If we simulate the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in each domain, we can finally establish kinetic model of PKSs related to all kinds of polyketides.
Aimed at the final goal of our project, we simulated the kinetic equations of chemical reactions occurring in"

Cell Free Protein Synthesis Systems Optimisation: Design of Experiments (JMP)
Abstract Overview of DoE for CFPS Systems: Components of the CFPS supplement solution premix were the factors of CFPS systems which were analysed, and the software program JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 2016) was used to apply Design of Experiments. In the first step, each supplement was created as a continuous factor within the JMP software, and the second step was to create an experimental design using DoE (the type of design depends on the question being asked; e.g. which supplements are the most important or what are the optimal concentrations for supplements A-D). CFPS reactions were then performed according to the generated design (step 3), and data was collected to be input back into the JMP software (step 4). The fifth step was to use the JMP software to produce models and statistical analyses of the data. The results could then be used to create a new experimental design"

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#UV radiation#_-_-_TEXT.html," order to respect the maximum lethal UV dose of bacteria and avoid mutagenesis factors in the cell. The following table illustrates the tests setup used:
After induction by UV the samples were kept in dark by silver paper to increase the RecA and LexA answer and let grown for 2h.   The OD sample is measured and the sample transferred in a 1ml eppendorf spinned at 6000-8000rpm for three minutes and  pellet collected in order to measure fluorescence level by microscope and Bacteria Visual Fluo Software.
Unfortunately, using Falcon tube and not the correct time/distance induction the experimental tests showed weak GFP expression using the construct with straighter promoter. It could be depended by the low sensibility of SOS system with our setup tests and not uniform irradiation of the sample. In Fig.3 is possible to see a leak answer by bacteria stimulated by UV at the distance of 4cm with one second time exposure.
Fig.3
In order to show the correct functionality of our construction, induction by peroxide hydrogen was used, in fact a low concentration of H_2 O_2 (1-3mM) results in SOS gene induction in wild-type cells [6], [7]. The induction of SOS by H_2 O_2 is an important event, since RecA and recBC mutant cells are very sensitive to H_2 O_2 treatment probably due to the lack of recombinational repair necessary for the H_2 O_2 – induced lesions [8].
The reaction of hydrogen peroxide with transition metals imposes on cells an oxidative stress condition that can result in damage to cell components such as proteins, lipids and principally to DNA. Escherichia Coli cells are able to deal with these adverse events via DNA repair mechanisms or OxyR and SosRS anti-oxidant inducible pathways which are elicited by cells to avoid the introduction of oxidative lesions by hydrogen peroxide. Among the systems the OxyR gene interacts with, there is the SOS response.
Protocol Used for Hydrogen Peroxide induction
The plasmid contained the LexA Operator was transformed into DH5alfa bacteria by standard protocol and one colony has been picked from plate and let it grown overnight in Falcon with 5ml LB broth with ampicilline.

Transmissibility
First, termites have the strong adaptability and viability. As long as there are proper temperature, humidity and nutrient, termites can survive.
Second, their reproductive capacity is severe high. In the breeding heyday, a mature termite queen's daily oviposition is over ten thousand. The spawning of one year reaches up to five hundred millions.
Third, termites could achieve different-distance spread and distribution by virtue of flight spread, pervasive invasion and factitious carry, owning to their strong transmission capacity.
The propagation of termites sometimes results in wide spread of termites' harm. Taking the Coptotermes formosanus as an example, which is the most harmful termite around the world; however this species once only distributed in several regions, such as Chinese mainland and Taiwan province. With the transportation of massive supplies in World War II, these termites' distribution range has gradually enlarged. At present this kind of termites has caused serious damages in numerous countries and regions, turning into cosmopolitan pest. According to incomplete statistics, all over the world, the annual expenditure of termites control exceeds a billion dollars.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR, a genetically modified toxins expression system with a delivery carrier cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis, and then kill the whole nest.
We choose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites. Separately over expressed in E.coli and another host, toxins were then delivered to the termites by the cell carrier. We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. Streptomyces avermitilis belongs to actinomyces, one of gram negative bacteria capable of producing multiple antibiotics. The insecticidal avermectin is one of secondary production of S.avermitilis. Judging that S.avermitilis is in Risk group 1, both the S.avermitilis itself and avermectin is safe to human.
Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers. We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport"
BNU-China,2016,Team:BNU-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," SSE reflects the variance in a certain level and this random difference is due to the selected sample’s random. For example, the measured length of the microtubule will be different when we add taxol into the test tube.
On the basis of the theory, our F test statistics is:
$$ F = \frac{SSA/(n-k)}{SSE/(k-1)} \sim F(n-k, k-1) \tag{4}$$
The numerator of the equation is a part of the dependent variable which can be explained by the change of the independent variable, while the denominator of the equation can be explained by other random elements except the change of the independent variable. The proportion of the change of independent variable in all change of the dependent variable becomes bigger, in other words, F has a higher value, independent variable influence dependent variable more.
4.0 - The F-test on the data
Our F-test’s null hypothesis is:
$$ H_0:μ_1=μ_2=⋯=μ_k   \quad  vs  \quad  H_1=\quad not \quad H_0 \tag{5}$$
\(H_0\) stands for that different values of the independent variable（the added taxol‘s concentration) make no difference to the mean value of the dependent variable(the light absorption value OD350), in other words, the independent is not important to the dependent variable. Then we use R software to conduct F-test, the outcome is shown below:
Fig.5 Outcome of the F-test about the data
From the outcome, \(F’s\) value is 1.337,  nearly 1. Apart from that, the significance is 0.27, bigger than 0.05. Therefore, we can't think the independent variable make distinct influence on the dependent variable.
Differential Equation Model
For studying the dynamic progress of tubulin assembling under the influence of Taxol, we build the differential equations to describe such progress numerically.
First we have to consider what happened in the tubulin solution. Protein filaments will assemble into the tubulins automatically by arranging dimers. Specifically, the GTP-cap can aggregate or disaggregate at one side of the protein filament. Besides, there are chances that the GTP can hydrolysis to GDP, which can no longer combine the new GTP. In this process, the length and amount of the tubulin are in the dynamic equilibrium or changing.
We know that the differential equations can describe the numerical relationships and patterns between related promoters. Based on these studies, we can"

Unnatural Base Pair Overview
The expansion of the genetic code is not solely confined to the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids into peptides,  it also means the incorporation of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) into the DNA. The introduction of UBPs into the DNA results in a semisynthetic organism which has been a long-desired  achievement in the field of synthetic biology. The research on UBPs bore several unnatural bases with different chemical properties.   For our project we decided to use isoguanine (isoG) and 5-methyl-isocytosine (isoCm) to expand the genetic code.  The establishment of novel   protocols for standard lab methods like   PCR and transformation were important in order to work with UBPs. Also, detection methods of UBPs in the DNA were required.
We were able to establish Oxford Nanopore Sequencing for   isoG and isoCm and developed a software to handle the data of unnatural bases.   We also developed the software M.A.X. that  suggests a set of restriction enzymes based on the neighboring DNA sequence of the UBP. With these restriction"

She hoped all the plants came to life, for she loved this lovely little life, loved her home and her planet. She promised to herself to protect her treasures. And she made it. The planet had been at peace, with any wars for several years. And you can see, the planet came back to life, the warm sunshine, the sunflower with a big smile, etc.
Two days later, Mr Careless finished his task.
“Thanks, you’ve had a long day.” Summer said to Mr Careless in a sweet voice, which sent shivers to Mr Careless.
“Pardon, any problem?” Mr Careless replied vigilantly, knowing that there was something wrong.
“In fact, I just wanna to inform you that Wind and Lily have set all the problems down.”
“So, all my hard work is in vain, what I have done is totally of no significance.” Said Mr Careless unhappily. “Oh, no. Not exactly. We just look up a book, in which mentions a way to test illness. And I think this work is significant. Don’t you have confidence in us?”
Mr Careless compromised, “if so, I have been a big help.”
“of course, you’ve helped us a lot. Without you, we can’t finished all this work.”
“I know, I am just a free coolie.” Mr Careless mumbled.
“Maybe we can try to make it a famous product and then sell it to others to get some money. With the money, we can buy some material to maintain the operation of the planet. Don’t you think it’s a wonderful idea.”
“Oh, not too bad.” Mr Careless answered.
“We can call the product ghost. It can test the thrombin in the blood sample, then judge whether the person is infected with W illness quickly. Oh , I make it. It’s really a miracle. My invention can not only test and clear small molecules, but also macro molecule matter.” Summer mumbled in a high voice on purpose so that Mr Careless could hear. She knew that though Mr Careless sometimes was reckless, he sparked her inspiration. Without him, she couldn’t have solved all the problems. But Mr Careless didn’t realize his importance. Summer hoped Mr Careless would always be happy.

Coupled with the short doubling time, V. natriegens is a powerful chassis not only for research purposes but also for industrial usage, where high productivity is crucial.
How are we accelerating metabolic engineering?
Figure 1: Metabolic Workflow established by iGEM Team Marburg 2018
For optimal execution of metabolic engineering we established a workflow, basing on the
DBTL
-cycle.   We use our Marburg Collection to build whole pathway libraries, which can then be transformed into our producer strain VibriXpress.  By using biosensors for product screening, we circumvent the expensive and time-intensive usage of
LC-MS
and learn which pathway variants are the most promising.   These findings can then be fed into our pathway-design, thereby closing the DBTL-cycle.   To further optimize these pathways, we planned to use directed evolution for more adaptations to that route.
Production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid
3-Hydroxypropionic acid
3HPA
As a proof of concept for our engineering workflow we chose the biological production of 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (
3HPA
).
3HPA
is a compound of high industrial value.   In 2004 the U.S. Department of Energy recommended
3HPA
as alternative to fossil oils for the chemical industry (Werpy et al.2004) .
3HPA
as a platform chemical can be converted into many other compounds like acrylic acid and acrylamide, which both are also precursors for further compounds.   According to an estimate of 2014, acrylates alone have  an annual market value of USD12 billion, making its precursor
3HPA
an optimal target product for our metabolic engineering approach.   By finding the optimal pathway to produce
3HPA
we could show the efficiency of metabolic engineering in V. natriegens as well as getting a big step closer to an alternative to fossil oils by biological, renewable resources.

Judd_UK,2017,Team:Judd UK#Pages#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," in with three different methods: analytically by integration, using the MatLab ODE function and using the Euler method. Unfortunately, it was not possible to solve analytically. but both the ODE function and Euler method worked and gave similar results. The most conclusive simulations being the iron vs amilCP graphs, as they show exactly how big the difference is in amilCP and iron varies, and with different FURt and time values.
Conclusion
Our cell-free system is only sensitive over a very small region of iron levels (0 to 0.6e6nM) which is below our minimum iron level of 2.6e6nM. Although decreasing FURt made it sensitive over a larger region, it still didn't cover any significant amount of our ranges and the change in amilCP was very minute when FURt was small. Likewise, increasing FURt made amilCP increase by more, but made the test sensitive over a smaller region. The model therefore quite conclusively states that the simple iron test we originally intended to make will not work. Although our wet-lab work was in vivo, it should be noted that a similar issue was observed - the test had no sensitivity to iron levels. 
However, this certainly doesn't mean the end of our project. We believe this global issue is very important, so a solution would be incredible useful. This being the case, we have a few things we could adjust to our project, based on the model. Perhaps our most promising was diluting the saliva sample. If we diluted the sample in a ratio of 1:99 with distilled water (which we could provide with the test kit), then the concentration of iron would be 100 times smaller, meaning it would fit almost exactly onto our 'zoomed in' region. Suddenly, our system is sensitive to the iron levels we need it to be. This being the case, our goals of finding appropriate values for time, FURt and DNA become feasible. As an example, here is a graph of varying FURt values.

    The gene cspD2 was ligated to the Pnz8149/msmK plasmid by one-step cloning (seamless ligation), and the recombinant plasmid was introduced into the constructed L. lactis NZ3900/pNZ8149-msmk-cspD2 strain using electroporation.
    The gfp gene was inserted as a marker gene, and cell viability was characterized by fluorescence intensity. The strain was tested for acid resistance and freezing resistance using a flow cytometer. The process of acid stress and cold stress is similar with the above demonstration process.
    Acid stress
    Deal with the samples under pH 4.0 with nisin as an inducer.
Fig 4 Number of colonies at acid stress (pH 4.0).
Fig 5 Survival rate at acid stress (pH4.0).
    The result shows that composite part can make the recombinant strain has 243-fold higher survival rate than parent one under acid stress.
Fig 8 The Comparison curve of survival rate under cold stress.
    After 4 consecutive repeated freeze-thaw tests, the recombinant strain was 47.5 times more viable than the control strain, indicating the antifreeze survival rate of the strain with increased overexpression of msmK-cspD2.

Real world research guided the development of our project
We investigated how the system we have created would fit into the real world which is summarised here . We have identified a waste material which is an economic burden to those who produce it, this material is called Solid Recovered Fuel(SRF) but we will refer to it as mixed waste from now on. It is made up of plastics, wood and fibres. By using this waste we can not only make a profit but also offer a more environmentally sound option for dealing with the waste where the alternative is polluting and resource inefficient .
The material we are producing has many great properties and is friendlier to the environment than petrochemical alternatives. It is biocompatible, industrially biodegradable and can be produced from sustainable resources. This material has a bright future, demonstrated by its many applications.
Trips to POWERDAY,(a materials recovery facility) and London City Hall highlighted the fact that recovering value from waste materials is one of the primary aims of waste management in London, the UK and Europe as a whole. Importantly it highlighted the need for social solutions combined with technical ones to reduce the waste we produce in the first place and then to maximise the recovery of as much of it as possible. It requires responsibility for our actions. Since we have created a method by which a new commodity can be produced, it would be wrong to not consider how it will be disposed of. This led to the creation of the Plastic Fantastic recycling module. We encouraged people to reduce waste and promoted recycling on our university campus with posters , highlighting 5 waste offenders. Through a strong social media campaign , we provoked discussion by sharing interesting and sometimes shocking reports regarding the waste issue.
M.A.P.L.E. - 3D printing the future
With our collaborators from the Royal College of Art, we have been considering how our system could be implemented in the future. We pictured how the technology could be used in different settings with various implications. Together we designed the futuristic company M.A.P.L.E. (Modular and Plastic Looping E"

What has been a workaround in the first place, turned out to be an improvement for our app and the Giant Jamboree. We had the possibility to introduce our app to the             other participants and at the conference the QR-codes will hopefully guide the attendees to the different posters.
But the QR-codes aren't the only way we want to bring the participants together. Our game ""Pathomon"" requires the direct interaction between the players, too.             To fight the so called giant outbreaks three ""scientists"" have to meet at the same place at the same time. To compare yourself with others you can have a look             at the leaderboard and see what university is the best in destroying viruses.             And if we really work together we even have the chance to eradicate all the viruses, at least at the Giant Jamboree.
German MeetUp
Dresden
We participated in the iGEM german-wide meetup from 30.06. to 02.07.2017 in Dresden    and had a great chance on getting to know nine other participating iGEM teams, their projects, people and the beautiful city of Dresden.
From 30.06. to 02.07.2017, three of our team members -- Hannah, Maximilian    and Benedikt --attended the iGEM German-wide meetup in Dresden. Overall ten teams    from Germany participated and introduced    their projects to each other while having an opportunity to find collaboration    partners and spent time together.     On Friday, we arrived in Dresden and the whole meetup started with    participating in several funny “ice breaking games”    as well as joining a local party of the TU Dresden.
The teams presented their individual talks on Saturday. This was a great    opportunity to present our project to other teams. We joined many interesting    talks about the several iGEM projects afterwards. Also, a guest talk was given    by a representative from PROMEGA. Hannah was lucky enough to win a special goody    bag for scientists.     After the talk session, we were going on a sightseeing tour with    the fantastic tour guides from the Dresden team. Getting to know the city    of Dresden was really great.
A great tortilla party at the Biological institute was organized by    the Dresden team, giving us a great time and many new connections to the other iGEM    teams. Afterwards we went playing pool billiard at local pubs with a reduced number    of members from different iGEM teams. It was great fun.

Figure 3. Tryptophan production of control and mutation stains
The control of E. coli Bl21 (ancestor of evolution) cannot produce tryptophan, but the other two controls with bitter defender part rbs30 and rbs32 showed very low tryptophan production of about 0.4mg/L. Obviously, the two evolved strains had much higher productivity of tryptophan. The productivity of the evolved strain of rbs30-16 was 2.4 times higher than that of control, while that of the evolved strain rbs32-3 was 2.7 times higher than the control. These results clearly proved our evolution strategy successfully evolved a strain with higher tryptophan from their ancestors which cannot produce tryptophan at all.

On August 11th, Team Darmstadt joined our laboratory to talk about our projects and exchange some thoughts and ideas in line with their Labsurfing project. We are glad we were a part of their big journey across different iGEM labs in Europe!
Moreover, we attended the iGEM Meetup Germany in Marburg from 31st July to the 2nd August to get insights into a huge number of other iGEM projects.
Team Marburg organised a meetup for all German iGEM teams lasting three days. Team Tuebingen sent two members to represent our team’s project and to look out for collaboration options. The weekend was filled with presentations of each team’s project, a canoe race and activities like barbecue and a  socialising party. Besides sightseeing and  pub-crawling, the teams could get in contact with each other and establish cooperations.  Our team was able to exchange useful tips and tricks regarding organisation and lab methods.
On Mai 2nd, we invited the iGEM Team Freiburg to visit our institute, introduce their project DiaChip (Team Freiburg) and talk about our project “Crellumination”.
We were highly exicted to listen to their project, which could provide a powerful tool for clinical diagnostics. We are happy to contribute to their project by providing them with a purified carboxyfluorecine labelled SpyTag. They will use this to bind pathogen-specific antigens to the surface of their diagnostic chip.
Our most important collaboration was the one with the iGEM Team Valencia_UPV , as we both work with the Dronpa protein in the iGEM competition 2015. This collaboration was very profitable for both teams as we were able to improve each others projects.
When we first got in touch, the iGEM Team Valencia had not yet been able to activate and deactivate Dronpa. We had previously stumbled upon the same problem and managed to solve it using higher intensity lasers. We recommended them to use similar contraptions.
Since both teams had little experience with the modelling of biological systems we discussed our ideas and thoughts regarding the modelling of the Dronpa activation with Team Valencia. Team Valencia attempted to implement the systems equations of their biological circuit with ‘pure/van"

For better project and scenarios
IGEM is not only a scientific competition. Since we are casting the synthetic biology on the real world problem, it forces us to consider about the ethical, legal, religious and social problems. Thus we collaborate with Synenergene, who aims at fostering responsible research and innovation in synthetic biology. The writing process of application scenarios and techno-moral vignettes prompts us to ground the plausibility and desirability of applications envisaged in our iGEM project.

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#Design#PLAsystem_-_-_TEXT.html," evolved Propionate CoA transferase who can take lactate as subtract and convert it into Lactyl-CoA, and an evolved PHA synthase which can polymerize monomer of Lactyl-CoA into PLA polymer. To do so, we started by looking for the sequence of Clostridium propionicum propionate-CoA transferase and we codon optimized the sequence for our bacteria P. putida. The wild type enzyme normally catalyzes the reaction: acetyl-CoA + propanoate <--> acetate + propanoyl-CoA. We introduced one amino acid mutation (A243T) found to allow efficiently convert lactate into lactyl-CoA [3] .
So, we used the same method for PHA synthase, we found two potential enzymes from different organisms. The first one was used in the iGEM Yale 2013 project (Pseudomonas resinovorans PHA synthase 1) and the second is Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 PHA synthase 1. We optimized their sequence for P. putida and performed quadruple important amino acid mutation (E130D,S325T, S477F, and Q481K) found for altering the substrate specificity and having enhanced activity towards (D)-lactyl-CoA [3] .
Finally, to increase the production of our compounds, we considered increasing the initial subtract as an important step. We decided to implement an evolved D-lactate dehydrogenase which could be useful for our system. We based the design on an article reporting a engineering NADH-dependent dehydrogenase (D-LDH*) from Bacillus delbrueckii 11842 that can super-efficiently utilize NADPH and NADH as cofactors. We looked for the sequence, we codon optimized it for P. putida and did the tree point amino acids mutation (D176S, I177R, F178T) [4] .
Implementation of the basic system
Once our basic sequences were designed, we had to think about how to express them in the cell. For that, we started with the design of our plasmid. In order to choose the best plasmid for P. putida, we asked for advice to Víctor De Lorenzo lab (CNB-CSIC) , which are working in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. He recommended the use of two SEVA (Standard European Vector Architecture) plasmids [5] , which were:

We made 0.5g of Lysozyme in 10ml of DI Water which we filter sterilised, where:
0.5g Lysozyme in 10ml DI Water 500mg in 10ml DI Water = 50mg Lysozyme in 1ml DI Water 50 000ug in 1000ul DI Water = 50ug Lysozyme in 1ul DI Water
Therefore, the amount of Lysozyme stock solution to add to a ml of buffer solution is:
50ug (Stock Solution) / 2ug (Desired Molarity) = 25 In order to obtain a solution with a final concentration of 2ug/ul,  the stock solution needs to be diluted 25 times. Desired volume = 1ml 1000ul / 25 = 40ul

40ul of Lysozyme stock solution is needed per ml of buffer solution.

Then we used threading method to predict the structure of Cry11Aa-2A. The result shows that we have three reliable model (two homologous model for Cry4Aa-2A and Cry10Aa-2A, and one hidden Markov model for Cry11Aa-2A) to predict their functions.
1) Cry4Aa-2A Homologous Model

A 17 year old student coursing last year of high school at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I was one of those kids doesn’t knowing what to expect and want from their life, but with the passing of the years I found a way into science and technology, I’m mainly interested in computer science, robotics and physics, but also liking to acquire and understand other areas like biology and chemistry. The main reasons I choose to join Genetix and iGem was to find a way to help others with my work and the possibility and to make other feel the way I do about science. This team has let me be part of something that can help our society, but it has taught me many things too, like teamwork and responsibility, letting me meet incredible people .  I’m sure all the information and abilities that I obtain here will help me in the future studying a career and fulfill my desire to create something that will create a change in society.

Objectives
To evaluate the evolution of biosafety concerns in iGEM.
To look at the types of containment system that have been designed by previous iGEM teams.
Procedure
We took the list of all iGEM teams since 2006 and looked at their wiki. If they had a containment system, we filled in the table that is below. In a more rapid way, we used Google™ search option to screen occurrence of biosafety terms (safety or bio(-)safety) or the occurrence of biosafety devices terms (semantic containment, kill switch, DNase). To do so, we used the following syntaxe with year '2006' and word 'safety' as an example :
safety site:2006.igem.org
We took into account the number of results, and we divided it by the number of results with the word 'igem' to normalize with the number of page on all the servers. We assume that there is on average a bit more than one ""igem"" occurrence per page (in the name of the page).
Results
We can see that the safety page rule creating in 2008 induced a increasing frequence of the word safety. This phenomenon started the kill switch trend. Deeper research through the manual wiki screen makes us realize that most of the kill switches were inefficient, or not even well characterized. In spite of the hard work of team Paris Bettencourt in 2009 on human practice, that raised many biosafety concerns, few teams made an effort to implement a serious biosafety device. Indeed we were able to put only about 15% of the 32 biosafety project that we selected in the wiki-screen in the biosafety catalog of the registry"

Public Concerns
Fear of genetically engineered organisms complicates bacteriophage therapy
Governmental Concerns

Public Questionaire
Objective
Evaluation of the german market regarding demand and necessity of an alternative for antibiotics.
Subjects
190 German participants in the Munich city center between the 8th and the 14th of October.
Methods
180 participants were investigated by random sampling in the Munich city center between the 8th and the 14th of October. The anonymous questionnaire was of our own design, using the Harvard University Program on Survey Research recommended by the iGEM organization.
Gender and age structure
180 people were surveyed, 53.2% being off age and 46.8% under age. 58.9% of the participants were female, 41.1% were male.
Did you take Antibiotics in the past?
Why did you take Antibiotics?
What are side effects of Antibiotics?
Do Antibiotics cause bacterial resisitance?
What alternatives do you know?
What would help you in trusting novel treatments?
Studies to prove effectiveness
Full disclosure
Open communication
Recommendation by a doctor
Results
Our survey shows, that the majority (91.1%) of the participants were already treated with antibiotics in their life. 71.6% of them are also aware that frequent usage of antibiotics can lead to resistances in bacteria. These results show the great demand for an alternative of antibiotics and that the population is aware of the problems the traditional treatment can cause. Regarding those results, it is quite surprising that only 4.2% of the participants know of phagetherapy.
In Phactory we try to tackle those issues by educating the public and considering their concerns regarding a new therapy method. 62.1% of the participants would hesitate to expose a sick relative to an experimental therapy like phage therapy. Some of them proposed steps that would make them feel better about trying a new therapy, mainly including Studies to prove its effectiveness, full disclosure,"

With just this moment, we were touched and were grateful for the opportunity! Next, we introduced the students to pipettes. They pipetted liquids and the DNA from the previous activity into small tubes. These small tubes were then turned into bracelets and necklaces. We fostered small discussion within groups with the help of the interpreters. The students asked insightful questions about many aspects of biology. With just this event, we learned that, just like the Deaf community, there are many groups that are not often reached. Although we may not have been able to reach all these communities, we are beyond happy to have been able to reach the Deaf community and are humbled by our experience.
Meeting with Nassau County Executive Laura Curran and Staff Members
Members of our iGEM team met with County Executive Laura Curran and two of her staff members, Sean Sallie and David Viana, to discuss the science behind our project, the implications of biofuel use on the economy, and the process of making biofuel. More specifically, one topic we discussed was how the revenue from producing biofuels could trickle back into funding the research behind these improving these processes. To this extent, her staff was very interested in increasing the sustainability of our project, and so we agreed to send our project poster and full wiki information after the Jamboree, such that they could help reach out to other leaders to help making carbon sinking more of a reality. We reached out to Laura Curran because she is a powerful and respected leader within Nassau County’s local government and we not only wanted her perspective on the importance of funding biofuel research but also we aimed to share our knowledge with an individual who had the ability to make impactful change in the community. The success of this meeting with local members of politics informed us of society’s growing acceptance towards using biofuel in reducing carbon emissions as well as the receptiveness of local politicians towards the concerns of local citizens. While most of our outreach events involve young children, this meeting provided us a chance to engage with political leaders on the topic of synthetic biology and create a dialogue centered around synthetic biology.

7. Ethernet 10M/100Mbps, WiFi, SATA
This board has very sufficient GPIO pins, it can make everything you think out, so we take it.
And the next is the another important device, named voltage magnification, since the voltage from microorganism reaction is very low, so if we want to read the value precise, before reading this value, we must amplify it, and then connect it to my MCU's simulation pins, and by the helping of A-D chip, we can make this simulate value to digital value, then, the MCU can process this value, what out's doing is display this value to screen this screen is a touchable screen, so the input to the MCU, we can make a software to access.
the connection of screen and pcduino
Software Overview
We design this software to read and process the voltage value. The design tool kit includes three part, the first is demo, since some all knows reasons, we cannot take microorganism outside, so, we have to make a module named demo, from the demo part, you can know, how this hardware and software work. The second module is analysis part, the hardware real working, reading the voltage value from the microorganism reaction, and processed by the formula we get this formula also by this MCU process and then get the value of density of oil plants. The third part is pre-calculation part, this part
Advantages
Our device has the function of detecting water pollution. Compared with the traditional detecting methods, our device has the advantages as convenient and economical.
Traditional way as AASer, AFSer, Oscilloscopic polarography, XRD and ICP-MS are very cumbersome so that in general, it needs people to collect the water sample and bring it back to their laboratory for testing. And at the same time, those devices are not only far more expensive for the public and family using but unaffordable for some developed countries as well.
Furthermore, traditional monitoring device is complex in using. People without particularly training cannot fluently use it. These problems above limited its application severely, especially when people need to monitor the water quality in wild, in long term real time or for normal families.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," VibriInteract. VibriClone is engineered to be a chassis for accelerated cloning. VibriExpress is engineered to be a chassis to speed up heterologous protein expression. VibriInteract is engineered to be a chassis for accelerated protein interaction studies based on the Bacterial Two-Hybrid system.
VibriClone
Why do we actually use E. coli for cloning? What are the reasons why E. coli is the one and only workhorse for molecular cloning? A big milestone in molecular biology was the first cloning in the 70's with the organism E. coli. Since this eventful step, the cloning has been constantly improved and accelerated. In addition, the strains of E. coli used for the cloning were adapted as best as possible to the requirements.
But what about the selected Chassi? Of course, E. coli is a good choice because it is genetically simple, has a fast growth rate and is now well studied. However, there are so many different microorganisms, maybe there is a species that is even better suited for cloning. We introduce to you the organism, it is Vibrio natriegens.  Imagine you have all the advantages of E. coli for cloning, but much faster and easier. Through the transition, it would be possible for us scientists to complete cloning in one day instead of three and as you all can imagine, that would speed up the entire science. The only thing missing so far to use V. natriegens as cloning host is the optimization and the characterization. Exactly this point is our project. We want to make V. natriegens accessible and useful for you so that you have a great advantage for your important work by the changeover.
Exonucleases and Endonucleases
Figure 1:Exonucleases and endonucleases can degrade DNA. Exonucleases hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds in DNA from a free end. Endonucleases hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds in DNA from a free end.
The wildtype E. coli strain has same nucleases. They are divided into two types: exonucleases and endonucleases. Exonucleases play an important role in cells in the repair of DNA, genetic recombination and mutation avoidance. The enzyme hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds in DNA from a free end (Lovett, 2003) .Endonucleases are enzymes that cleaves hydrolytically the internal phosphodiester bond of DNA and/or RNA and this leads to their degradation. Bacterial endonucleases are also called restriction enzymes."

Background
A diagram of the LuxCDE pathway, producing tetradecanal, the aldehyde substrate for use with aldehyde decarbonalase (ADC)
LuxABCDE is an enzyme complex submitted to the iGem registry by the 2010 Cambridge team. Within this complex, LuxAB produces luciferase (used by Cambridge's EGlowi) using 14-carbon aldehydes (tetradecanal) produced by LuxCDE. Since the aldehyde decarbonylase (ADC) in our project uses aldehydes to synthesize alkanes, we plan to use the LuxCDE complex in conjunction with ADC to produce 13-carbon alkanes (Tridecane).
Methods
PCR and Standard Biobrick Assembly
This method revolved around designing oligos to PCR amplify LuxCD and LuxE off of the LuxBrick; LuxE was not directly adjacent to LuxCD in the Luxbrick, and therefore had to be amplified out in two separate reactions. Homology on the ends of the two fragments would allow us to obtain a LuxCDE using stitching PCR, then ligate this fragment and ADC into psb1C3. We would then assay for alkanes.
Gibson Assembly
A basic diagram of a Gibson reaction. All components of the desired vector are left to ligate simultaneously, then transformed into cells.
We would design oligos with homology to amplify C, D, and E off of the LuxBrick. The homology would allow the enzymes in the Gibson reaction to chew back the homologous ends and ligate them togather. A 4-piece Gibson assembly was done on C, D, E, and the plasmid backbone with along with aldehyde decarbonylase and the product was then transformed into"

A malicious user may register many accounts to rate a specific part, in expectation of sharply increasing or decreasing its score. To avoid such frauds, we've added throttles at the interfaces of relevant actions. This will not prohibit counterfeiting thoroughly, but can reduce them to some extent.

When fluorescence was quantified in the microplate reader and signals were normalized on OD600, the results for mRFP seemed less convincing. This might be due to normalization strategy as discussed previously. Both experiments however equally demonstrate the usefulness of 5'-UTR for protein production in general.

In vivo characterization of 5'-UTR with mRFP. Relative fluorescence units were normalized on OD600. One might consider biases due to mRFP fluorescence emission at 607 nm like discussed previously. Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicates.
Cultures expressing sfGFP and mRFP, resprectively. From left to right: PT7-UTR-sfGFP (BBa_K1758102) , PT7-sfGFP (BBa_I746909) , PT7-UTR-mRFP (BBa_K1758106) and PT7-mRFP (BBa_K1758105) .
This was the case when 5'-UTR was employed in in vitro experiments: We observed a more than 3 fold increase in fluorescence. This clearly showed the importance of this enhancing element in CFPS, and further demonstrated that translation efficiency in vitro is a major issue for protein synthesis.
Importance of 5'-untranslated region (UTR) for in vitro protein synthesis. T7 refers to T7 promoter. sfGFP lysate refers to cell lysate won by sonication; cells were induced to produce sfGFP in vivo. Decreasing sfGFP lysate signal probably relied on evaporation. Mean values from two technical replicates are shown.
In vitro mRFP expression with construct PT7-UTR-mRFP ( BBa_K1758106 ) showed us that mRFP was not nearly as well performing as sfGFP. Although we observed a signal differing from the negative control, this signal was very low and raising very slowly, as depicted in the nearby figure. Thus sfGFP remained our reporter protein and we used it in all following CFPS reactions.

GMO laws and regulations
A collaboration with the Manchester Team provided us an opportunity to learn about the laws in our country regarding the research, use and commercialization of GMOs. Manchester Team invited teams from all over the world to look at GMO laws and regulation in their countries related to products containing genetically modified organisms.
This  legislation may be established by governmental institutions as is the case in Canada or outside institutions specializing in GMOs where government institutions only apply and enforce laws, as is the case in Brazil and the USA. However, there are countries that do not have a clear control of this, like Chile. These regulations impact the commercialization of products, both in foods and health (biopharmaceutics). In foods, most countries require the labeling of a product with a genetically modified product, as is the case in Brazil and Australia, whereas Canada requires this labeling only if there is a risk to the consumer. For registration and trade of medicines, it is necessary to describe all procedures and risk studies, which will be analyzed by the FDA or Anvisa, in the case of the USA and Brazil, respectively. Being recent, the use of GMOs is still new to the population and governments, which may lead to legal prohibitions due to lack of knowledge.
Here, we present the data we have collected about the questions proposed by Manchester Team, regarding the GMO legislation in Brazil.
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules and fiscalization of GMMs and its derivatives in the national territory. The National Technical Committee of Biosafety (CTNBio) is responsible for enforcing the laws and setting the rules for the construction, experimentation, cultivation, manipulation, transport, commercialization, consumption, release and discarding of GMMs and its derivatives.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) approves and inspects the use of GMMs and its derivatives in any products for human use (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food). The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Supply (MAPA) is"

Educative Survey
MOOC
Banning Plastics
To degrade or not
Silver
Gold
Regarding Human Practices, we have developed different topics : MOOC, evolving regulations on petroleum-based plastics and controversy on PLA degradation.
Initial investigation
We started our investigations by conducting an educative survey. Our goal was mainly to understand if the wide public had a good understanding of bioplastics and synthetic biology. But we also wanted to know if people were interested in bioplastics and willing to use it in their daily life.
We also noted that public policies are tending to gradually ban petroleum-based plastic consumptions. Thus, we wondered how this could affect bioplastic consumption.
On the need of public awareness
After conducting a survey on our project, it appeared that people would prefer resorting to PLA – and bioplastics in general - rather than petroleum-based equivalents. Yet, the consumption of bioplastics remains lower and this is quite a paradox.
As we noticed that people don’t know much about PLA, and even less about synthetic biology, we wanted to consider ways of communicating more efficiently on our topic. That’s why we decided to study MOOCs.
Controversy around biodegradation
While reading about PLA, we noticed there was a diversity of opinions on its biodegradability. Thus, we decided to adopt a skeptical point of view by performing an experiment to empirically observe what happens in daily conditions.
Project insights
We carried out our PLA system development and experiments before and during the human practices procedure. Even though it was complicated to combine both aspects, we managed to consider a way of potentially reducing PLA prices.
Indeed, high prices of PLA products compared with petroleum-based equivalents hinders its consumption. As those prices are partially related to"
