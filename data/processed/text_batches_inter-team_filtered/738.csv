Results
Mutagenesis PCR for different fragments;
1: 2-log-DNA-ladder,
2 & 3: fragment 1,
4 & 5: fragment 2,
6 & 7: fragment 3.
Lane 1 & 2 contain the expected Fragments (~ 600  bp). In Lane 3 there is a very thin fragment with the expected size (~ 1100 bp)  but smaller fragments can also be seen. Lane 5 does not contain any fragment at  all and in lane 6 there is the fragment of the expected size (~ 600 bp).      Both samples with fragment 1 were pooled, sample 3.1  was discarded and the whole PCR-product 2.1 has been separated in an agarosegel  and the fragment with 1100 bp has been cut out and purified with the Gel  Extraction Kit (c = 4,4 ng/µL). A second PCR for fragment 2 has been done in parallel.  All parameters remained the same but the annealing-temperature has been changed  to 62 °C.
Modified mutagenesis PCR for fragment 2; again there are two fragments with a too small size and the expected fragments are not high concentrated.
14.8 Test Expression
Aim: Test the expression of PheA-Arc1p-C-8x
Using the preculture from 14.7 60 mL of LB-Kan50 medium were inoculated with 600 µL of the preculture and incubated at 37 °C and 220 rpm until OD600 reached 0.5. The culture was cooled down to 18 °C and the protein production was induced with 12 µL of 500 mM IPTG. Over night the culture was incubated at 18 °C and 220 rpm. A glycerolstock of the strain containing the PheA-Arc1p-C-8x-pET28a plasmid was stored at -80 °C.

During the discussion the points were raised and a date was set for the discussion of the Knesset after the summer recess.
Signing Citizens for promoting the legislation to ease the lives of people with celiac disease
In July, Team Alergln signed citizens on a petition calling on the government to change the way it treated celiac patients.
The petition calls for the government to lower the prices of gluten-free food, enriching the menu of schoolchildren and gluten-free food day care centers the same way that vegetarian students are treated, even though vegetarianism is not a disease and celiac disease is.
The petition refers to the date of the initial test for identifying celiac, in compliance with our proposal to all those who will carry the disease genetically should perform a test to identify the disease. In our opinion, early diagnosis is worthwhile for the country as well as for the patient. Early diagnosis would save the State related diseases to celiac such as thyroid problems, cancer and more.
The petition was distributed on all social networks: Facebook, Google +, Instagram, Twitter. We also distributed the petition around Kiryat Shmona. Kiryat Shmona is considered a significant tourist city so there are a large number of citizens passing through in the summer.
Media Exposure
The media is the most meaningful way to expose an idea to the public in Israel and abroad. To this, we worked intensively to spread the idea to as many people as possible. At the same time exposure as an entrepreneurial product was equally important for us to raise awareness of the problem of celiac disease as described above.
Articles were written about the team in the local and national press. We were interviewed for an economic program on Channel 10 (Israel's second largest TV channel) and for the main news program on Channel 2 (Israel's largest and most popular TV channel). In addition to being in the main daily news, our story was aired on the popular children's channel in Israel and a radio program on ""Reshet Bet"".
It appears that exposure to the media enabled us to increase its sphere of influence which we wanted to achieve. Here are some media reports:

Caroll HS also made a flat Stanley and mailed it to us, this time being a microbe. We welcomed it to our lab and made it an honorary team member.
Online meet-up about fermentation factories – SCUT-FSE- China
We skyped with the team of the South China University of Technology about our respective projects. They are working to improve fermentation processes as well, using CRISPR in E.coli to defend against bacteriophages. We shared some insights about mutual problems we might encounter and the potential CRISPR offers to fermentation industries affected by phage infections.
Outreach
We developed our own card game and shared it with Team Franconia & in return also evaluated their card game. Their input helped us improve our design so that the game is a bit more fun and engaging. We hope our input also contributed to improving their game balance.
We were curious about the history of IGEM and have collaborated with the MIT team to visualize the development of tracks, teams, topics etc. MIT has provided us with a file stating these and Groningen has analyzed and visualized the content . This provides insight into how the competition has changed over the years, information about shifting interests and emerging trends and technologies.
To further strengthen the bond between different IGEM teams we also send & received post cards from different teams initiated by team Düsseldorf. The postcards should quickly highlight the main idea of the respective projects. We received a vast variety of post card designs and had a lot of fun reading through the other teams’ projects and designs.

Abstracts
In order to illustrate the implementation of our modeling and meaning better, we will divide the entire modeling of expression group into two parts. The first part is to verify the feasibility of the gene line of the expression group. The second part is to verify the model of the double fluorescence system as soon as the single fluorescence system was modified into a double fluorescence system before the experiment. In the modeling of the first part, we used the principle of Hill equation to construct a mathematical model which described the promoter activity in the gene line while considered the gene lines and combined the processes of inhibition, induction, transcription, translation, degradation and catalysis, and then determined the parameters in the model equation in various ways. Finally, the expression of the fluorescence system is described by the ordinary differential equation to construct the model. In the second part, we tentatively designed a single fluorescence system before the experiment, but because of the weak fluorescence intensity, it is not easy to detect. Therefore, we propose to use the double fluorescence system to detect the fluorescence intensity. We could achieve the effect of amplification signal and improve the detection limits and accuracy by using the ratio of GFP to RFP. We supported the construction of this part of the model through the support of the literature, and managed to play a guiding role in the experiment of the expression group.
Objective
One part of our aim of modeling is to verify the effect of signal molecules on the promoter and to make the biological expression process clearer and more organized. What’s more, the main purpose is to verify the feasibility of the experiments of expression group and guide the progress of the experiment more smooth. However, the expression of the gene line is relatively long, if the theory is wrong, and the mistakes are found after the experiment, there will be a great harm on the experiment schedule, and moreover, the change will be very difficult. Therefore, the feasibility of modeling validation before expression experiments can provide a theoretical basis for expression groups and provide guidance for the success of their subsequent experiments. In addition, the detection of biomolecules is usually difficult to achieve, because the amount of biomolecules in the human body is too small, so we considered using the double fluorescence system to achieve the amplification by mathematical model and detect the amount of material on . Therefore, we use the support of literature , use the model to verify the linear"

Several changes were made and we also had a small brainstorm about the eventual applications of our network. On the 21st we also went to The Hague for SYNENERGENE, more information can be found here.
Week 4 - 24/04 - 28/04
This week we started with designing the DNA of our constructs, in which we already were incorporating restriction sites to change the constructs if necessary. We also designed the constructs for different vectors, to be able to get a double expression.
May - First gBlocks ordered!
After a lot of work, redesign and adding details we ordered our gBlocks! We also got into contact with iGEM Potsdam, to see whether we could collaborate.
Week 5 - 01/05 - 05/05
This week we had a meeting with our professors to discuss the constructs we had designed so far. We got some feedback and we integrated this feedback into our constructs. We also looked into the literature to get more feeling for an eventual application.
Week 6 - 08/05 - 12/05
We also were busy working on the design of our constructs and had another meeting with our professors for some feedback. This week two of our team members also went to BCF career event, a career event for Bio, Chemistry, Food & Farma to look voor potential sponsors.
Week 7 - 15/05 - 19/05
We checked our constructs for secondary structures and we scrambled the 14-3-3 construct to make sure that we get 4 completely different monomers, to make mutation possible. Some members of our team also talked to Patricia Dankers (an expert at our university in supramolecular biomaterials, including hydrogels), about the feasibility of our gel as an application.
Week 8 - 22/05 - 26/05
We ordered our gBlocks! We also started designing primers for the linearization of our vectors. Also, a start was made for looking for literature for the model. Via Traci Haddock from iGEM HQ we also contacted iGEM Potsdam, to see if a collaboration would be possible.
Week 9 - 29/05 - 02/06

To ligate into the pSB1C3 plasmid specifically, we cut with E and P ligating into pXP218, and used SphI and SalI to cut. These restriction sites were created at the ends of our inserts by using primers that had the correct site.
For Gal1, the SphI and SalI restriction sites were used to create sticky ends when digested. This would allow the insert to properly ligate in the correct orientation into the PXP218 plasmid. GFP is required to be able to use fluorimetry on the plasmids to analyze fluorescence and to test our promotor. A small set of twelve nitrogenous bases between the GFP and Gal1 that was taken from other plasmids between a Gal1 and a various feature. Our team researched various plasmids containing Gal1 and took a sequence directly after the Gal1 promoter. The CYC1 terminator is used to end the insert while there is a biobrick prefix directly after the terminator. This is done to ensure it can be tested as an iGEM BioBrick. For Cup1 and Adh1, the same parts were used, except the actual promoter changed.
Our Promoters in Nature
Yeasts are an important expression host for the production of many recombinant proteins. The choice of the right promoter is a crucial point for efficient gene expression, as most regulations take place at the transcriptional level [1]. The promoters we have decided to use are MET25, GAL1, Cup1 and ADH1. All these promoters are found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and therefore make excellent choices for our project which deals with prion aggregation in yeast.
The first promotor utilized in our project design was the MET25 promoter. The MET25 promoter is repressed when cells are grown in the presence of methionine [2]. In previous experiments, the MET25 promoter has been used for the production of human serum albumin (HSA) and HSA-fusion proteins in S. cerevisiae [3]. In media lacking methionine, the MET25 promoter yielded high expression levels of HSA [3]. Furthermore, the MET25 catalyzes the synthesis of homocysteine from O-acetylhomoserine [4].
Secondly, the GAL1 promoter was also used in our experiments. Expression of the GAL1 gene in S. cerevisiae is strongly repressed by growth on glucose. It is shown that two sites within the GAL1 promoter mediate glucose repression ["
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#Cost Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure. [17]
We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

After some time, the number of cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves. So the cell density should not come to the maximum. What’s more, in the first model (the classical one), the cells grows with limited resources and space. But at the beginning of E.coli’s growth, the cell density is not high, and there are ample supply of food and living space. Therefore, we change the equation for cell density and give the following equations to construct the model for E.colis’ population:
The simulation result goes as figure 3.2 shows:
We also changed the initial value of AHL in our model. The results is given by figure 3.3:
E.co-Lock Model (in single cell)
We combined the MIN system model (in single cell) with the model for layered AND gates so that we can simulate the whole process of our E.co-Lock. We add the equations in MIN system into the layered AND gates model:
We use the whole equations to give simulations to E.co-Lock. When combined, the dynamic change of AND gates will affect the MinC proteins concentration, and finally make a difference on cell division. The results shows as figure 4.1:
Then we also wrote equations for wrong order, for example: 3 2 1 (first: aTc, second: IPTG, last: Ara).
All the parameters’ value are the same as the equations for 1 2 3. And if we use the equations for 3 2 1 to simulate, the result goes as figure4.2. You can see the huge difference.
Also we simulate the situation if you add the inducers by order 2 3 1 (IPTG, aTc, Ara). The result goes as figure4.3 (The equations for 2 3 1 are not written down here).
From the above figures, the model tells us that if you put the inducers in wrong order, you cannot unlock the AND gates and make the E.coli recover to the normal condition.
Besides, we developed a program in matlab. You can enter the kind of inducers as well as their concentration, the order you want to add the inducers, and the time interval between two inducers to see the results.

Meeting with experts
When our team started brainstorming for the project idea, our general knowledge of what would be feasible and what wouldn’t was quite insufficient. We had a many meetings right in the beginning of our project just to hear from different experts what they consider to be synthetic biology, what they thought of our various ideas and how they would proceed with the project. Especially talking with our primary PI Markus Linder directed our brainstorming and ideation, which finally led up to the final design of the project. Even though many experts gave us advice and guided our brainstorming, deciding about the topic and more precise plans were left for ourselves.
When we had decided on the top three project ideas, we met with researchers working with these different subjects as a part of the background research we did about the different options. We found about the Cyanobacteria research group of the University of Helsinki and met with them. And what a goldmine it was! Thanks to input from Kaarina Sivonen and her group, the decision about our project subject was finalized. We much appreciate that they truly dared to turn some of our ideas down, if they thought that these ideas wouldn’t result in a successful project. With ideas where they saw potential they encouraged us enormously. They have also helped us during the course of our project - for example the degradation part of our project would not have ended up being what it is without their help. We also practiced our Boston presentation and got feedback on that from them.
As we didn’t have much experience on protein production in yeast and as it was in a focal role in our project, we needed some help in planning our enzyme constructs. Alexander Frey from Aalto University turned out to be a great help in this. He helped us decide what kind of signal sequences we should have for protein secretion. He also questioned our choice to use yeast at all in the enzyme production, and made us broaden our thinking and justify our ideas. Putting much thought into justifications for our choices at this point of our project turned out to be very useful, since after that, we didn’t need to regret that we should have done something in a completely different way.
If the Cyanobacteria group and professor Frey along with his group affected the degradation aspect of our project the most, Jussi Jäntti and his research group from VTT likely contributed the most to the detection part."

Aim: Create new mutation fragment for eliminating a NcoI-restriction site.
The plasmids prepared on Saturday seem to be smaller as expected. For this reason a new attempt to eliminate the restriction sites was carried out. The amplification of fragment 2 (with primers iGEM 003 and iGEM 010 on 15.04.2014) did not happen without any problems such as unspecific smaller bands in addition to the expected one (ca 1000 bp). So this time primer iGEM 003 was replaced by iGEM 002 which would result in a smaller fragment of approximately 600 bp. Later on the fragments 1 and 3 together with the new created one, the digested pMa12 construct and the amyE-fragment (to overlap the region between fragments) would be transformed into S. cerevisiae for recombination.

Purdue iGEM team: Characterization Standard for parts registry
Concerned and aware that the current iGEM registry for characterization of genetic parts has some opportunity areas, the Purdue iGEM team is working on a proposal for a standard characterization protocol. In order to do so, they need the input and perspective from as many teams as possible. We are proud to say that the TU/e iGEM team is part of this collaboration project, working together with teams all around the world to create a standard characterization protocol.
So far, we have:
Participated on a video conference with the Purdue iGEM team in order to discuss the protocol draft.
Reviewed and analyzed the draft,and consequently passed on our suggestions for improvement of the protocol to the   Purdue iGEM team.
Filled in a series of surveys made by the Purdue iGEM team about the current registry and the protocol draft.
We are looking forward to keep working with them and the other teams involved in this exciting and ambitious project!
Here we give a list of the documents that we created for the collaborations.

LAND MINE DETECTION AND CLEARANCE
The assessment of land and its categorization as a suspected or confirmed hazardous area (SHA/CHA) is usually performed in two consecutive steps: non-technical survey and technical survey. Non-technical survey involves the use of a wide range of non-technical means, such as desk assessments and analysis of historical records, to identify, access, collect, report and use information to help define where mines/ERW (Explosive Remnants of War) are to be found, as well as where they are not, and to support land cancellation, reduction and clearance decision making processes [13]. This step is usually relatively cheap in comparison to the other steps involved in land clearance. However, as it can exclude large tracts of land from containing explosive material, its impact is large in terms of square meters.
Technical survey is applied to further investigate land categorized as SHA or CHA by the nontechnical survey. A wide range of methods and techniques is applied for technical survey. The technical survey can be a separate activity, it can also be integrated in the clearance procedure. Any technical survey methodology should be planned such that it provides a very high level of confidence that if hazard items are present they will be indicated. The goal of a technical survey is to identify, confirm and improve definitions of the boundaries of hazardous areas and the nature and distribution of their contents [14], i.e. locate land mines such that they can be cleared or, when no evidence of mines is found, continue with land release without the application of land mine clearance.
The main method of technical survey is manual detection by the use of metal detectors. Most mines have very high metal content can be easily detected in this way. Land mines with low metal content have been developed but these are rarely used. This method is considered relatively save and precise. When, due to magnetic ground or scrap metal contamination, the use of a metal detector is not efficient, manual area excavation may be performed. This process is really slow [5].
Next to these manual methods, which are slow, expensive and dangerous, dogs are used for technical survey. Dogs can be trained to find land mines using their ability to smell TNT. However, it is generally accepted that dogs cannot reliably pinpoint the source of the explosive in a densely mined area where the scent from more than one source may combine [5]. Next to dogs, rats are trained to detect land mines by the company APO"

Multiple Start Codons
A frustrating yet commonly observed phenomenon in the lab is the production of unexpected proteins. These occurrences may be explainable by multiple start codons in the mRNA strand. Codon slippage is a theory practically untouched by research, and this project aspires to shed some light on the issue.
Multiple Start Codons
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
TECAN Data
The initial circuit for this project has recently been completed. The relative fluorescence of both RFP and sfGFP reporters was tested in a TECANM1000.
The graph above shows the relative fluorescence of two reporters corresponding to two start codons in the circuit. The reporters indicate the ribosome's preference for one start codon over the other in protein translation. Super-folder GFP (sfGFP) is preferred in this construct, as shown by the high amount of relative fluorescence. Though the amount of green fluorescence significantly outweighs the red fluorescence, there is still a measurable amount of RFP expression in the cell. The presence of both reporters indicates that multiple start codons may be possible in DH10B E.coli, since the ribosome recognizes both start codons and initiates the translation of both proteins.
Further Application
This construct tests only a 7-nucleotide separation between start codons. Since these preliminary results show that the recognition of multiple start codons is possible within the cell, further research will continue to investigate the effect of ribosome binding site translation initiation rate, as well as length between codons, on codon slippage. To view the full list of intended sequences which will be tested in this genetic circuit, please visit our parts page.

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#Project#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," a delay function, so that after five seconds we go from cold to hot and transcription proceeds. The last promoter is a sucrose sensitive promoter that is activated by high sucrose concentrations. The way we have modelled it, is a basic Michaelis-Menten model that is dependent on the sucrose concentration.
Result from the Model
Plot of the sucrose sensitive promoter activity (black) and sucrose concetration (red)
As the promoter activates transcription of the SST and FFT genes we see the Fructose (blue) and Glucose (green) concentrations rise
The fructose and glucose is converted to trisaccharide (orange) in a 2 to 1 ratio by SST
The trisaccharide is converted into inulin1 (pink) by the addition of a fructose moiety.Through the iterative additon of more and more fructose units to the inulin chain we observe the elongation seen first as inulin2(blue) then inulin3(black) and inulin 4(red). Please note the time delay between the tops of the trisaccharide and inu1-4 graphs, this indicates that they are causally linked.
Finally we see the end product Inulin5 (yellow line) that accumulates as the system eats up the continuously added sucrose.  What is noteworthy is that even though there is an initial spike in the concentrations of sucrose, fructose, glucose and all the inulins they all level out eventually (except for inulin5) this inducates that the system has found an equlibrium and now functions as an inulin generator.
Discussion
Is our model sufficient to predict the behaviour of our construct? There are too many variables in a biological system to make any real simulation but we can make some predictions on the behaviour. Our model contains approximately 27 different parameters that are adjustable. With this being a model we simply started out by having all the constants set to either 1 or 0 but this is way too simplified and resulted in some strange behaviour. By fine tuning certain parameters such as the enzyme decay rate or how hungry the bacteria are for glucose we can adjust the plots to fit certain behaviour, but seeing as we haven’t gotten much data from our practical characterization experiments it is nearly impossible to find a perfect fit. For example we could argue that the excess glucose produced doesn’t seem to follow a very well defined behaviour, but again this is due to too many unknown variables on how the bacteria would handle the situation. If we had more time we could fiddle around with the enzyme rates, rate"

To analyse the metabolites extracted from both wild-type DH5-alpha and DH5-alpha expressing our delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes, we made use of the MIB’s in-house Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). This technique was chosen because of its high mass accuracy and sensitivity. Upon analysing the most abundant metabolites extracted from our expression strains and comparing this data with the most abundant metabolites extracted from wild-type, it is apparent that a massive increase in linoleic acid (incorporated in phosphatidylethanolamines, PE) has occurred. This is demonstrated in the figure above. The chromatograms produced for the delta 12 desaturase expression strains, along with further characterisation, can be found on the Parts page.
Further analysis
The data obtained from the LC-MS was enormous. 2721 metabolites were detected in the samples, and so we filtered this down to the 43 fatty acids and phospholipids incorporating the compounds we were interested in (oleic acid and linoleic acid). A heat map was generated (seen below) showing the abundances of these 43 phospholipids and fatty acids in the 17 samples we run on the LC-MS. From this heatmap the diversity of detected compounds and and high dynamic range can be seen. For the characterisation of our delta 12 desaturase BioBrick construct, a focus on the individual compounds of high intensity was necessary. An example of this can be seen in the bar chart in the work flow diagram below. Here you can see that, when fed with oleic acid (to a total w/v concentration of 0.1% and 0.5%), the amount of linoleic acid found within this representative phospholipid is much higher in the delta 12 desaturase expression strain than in the wild-type DH5-alpha strain. From this data we can confidently conclude that the delta 12 desaturase is converting the substrate oleic acid into the linoleic acid. Currently, the linoleic is incorporated into a phospholipid, but expression of the tesA gene (biobricked previously) would cleave the compound away to give free fatty acid.

For high Tm primer pairs, two-step cycling without a separate annealing step can be used.
Extension: The recommended extension temperature is 72°C. Extension times are generally 20–30 seconds per kb for complex, genomic samples, but can be reduced to 10 seconds per kb for simple templates (plasmid, E. coli, etc.) or complex templates < 1 kb. Extension time can be increased to 40 seconds per kb for cDNA or long, complex templates, if necessary.
A final extension of 2 minutes at 72°C is recommended.
Cycle number: Generally, 25–35 cycles yield sufficient product. For genomic amplicons, 30-35 cycles are recommended.
2-step PCR: When primers with annealing temperatures ≥ 72°C are used, a 2-step thermocycling protocol (combining annealing and extension into one step) is possible.
Amplification of long products: When amplifying products > 6 kb, it is often helpful to increase the extension time to 40–50 seconds/kb.
PCR product: The PCR products generated using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase have blunt ends. If cloning is the next step, then blunt-end cloning is recommended. If T/A-cloning is preferred, the DNA should be purified prior to A-addition, as Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase will degrade any overhangs generated.
Additives:
DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organosulfur compound with a high polarity and high dielectric constant used in PCR to disrupt secondary structure formation in the DNA template. DMSO is believed to hydrogen bond to the major and minor grooves of template DNA, and as a result destabilizes the double helix structure. This is particularly useful in templates with high GC content because the increased hydrogen bond strength increases the difficulty of denaturing the template and causes intermolecular secondary structures to form more readily, which can compete with primer annealing. Thus, the addition of DMSO can greatly improve yields and specificities of PCR priming reactions, test a variety of DMSO concentrations between 2-10%
Glycerol: Similarly reduces secondary structure. Use 5-10%.
Formamide: Formamide is a widely used organic PCR additive. Formamide is thought to work by binding in the major and minor grooves of DNA, destabilizing the template double-helix and lower melting temperature. Formamide is usually used at 1-5%.

Whilst this does seem like a mountainous flaw in the objective of our project, it need not be. Rather, it provides our team with the chance to explore and design some novel, groundbreaking techniques in biosensor design to circumvent this “problem.”
Furthermore, viewing our project in this way neglects the crucial engineering phase in the development of any new technology. E.coli is the host for our biocircuit in the context of the lab, and is essential in proving the fundamental scientific function of the isolated Mycobacterium NBB4 genes EtnR1 and EtnR2. That’s not to say, however, that E.coli must play a part in the transition of this biotechnology from lab to market. One of the biggest potential areas for further research, and what our team envisions for this technology in the future is the development of a cell-free biosensor.
Technology Review
When assessing currently available and emerging technologies, there are many ways to potentially immobilise whole cells such that a functional biosensor can be developed with a much lower, if not completely negligible, biosafety risk. This is a realistic and reasonable phase of development before advancing to a cell-free model.
Polymer anchoring
A simple and established method of enclosing cells, enzymes and proteins into sensing devices is through anchoring of these molecules into various polymers. There are many examples of these, including polyacrimide, agar, agarose and chistosan (Close et. al., 2009). Immobilisation occurs due to affinity interactions (Cosnier and Holzinger, 2010), however reaction times are often slow because of diffusion through the polymer (Close et. al., 2009).
Sol-gels
Sol-gel is the name given to a class of materials that are formed when a three-dimensional network is formed out of solid particles that are suspended in a liquid as a colloid (Brinker and Scherer, 2013). These gels are most commonly silica-based, and can be described as ‘porous glass gels’ (Close et. al., 2009). Bakul et. al. (1994) presented that silicon sol-gels can effectively trap and immobilize proteins in their matrix with minimal impact on the function, specificity or selectivity of the protein. However, Kuncova et al. (2004) emphasises that the encapsulation process is not optimal for whole cell as the silicon content can result in cell toxicity, while Flinkinger et. al. (2007) attributed increased cell death to alcohol toxicity when lyog"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#lungRanger_-_-_TEXT.html," behaviour. Cell–cell signalling allows a colony or group of organisms to behave in a coordinated fashion to regulate processes contributing to virulence, antibiotic production, biofilm formation and other developmental programmes. In some cases, bacteria are capable of responding to signals produced by other species of bacteria; eavesdropping on their competitors or synchronizing with collaborators.
The autoinducer signal molecules produced by bacteria are a structurally diverse group of compounds. Many Gram-negative bacteria use N-acylhomoserine lactones as signals, although other fatty acid derivatives such as cis-unsaturated fatty acids are also found1.
In order to sense these chemical signals, bacteria often employ two-component signal transduction systems allowing them to respond and adapt to a wide range of signals and stimuli including nutrient availability, cellular redox state, changes in osmolarity, quorum signals and antibiotics. The canonical two-component signal transduction systems are composed of two proteins; a sensor histidine kinase which responds to a signal and a cognate response regulator which mediates the response via altered gene expression (a schematic of this is shown in Fig 1). The perceived signal is directly translated into a change in transcriptional regulation, the decision-making level of a prokaryotic cell at which cell-cell communication is integrated with other sensory inputs.
Microbial Infections Associated with CF
In a healthy respiratory system, the upper respiratory tract is colonized by a wide variety of microorganisms, while the lower respiratory tract is maintained in a sterile state by the various immune defences of the host. Failure of any of these defences results in susceptibility to pulmonary infection. CF patients have an abnormal mucous composition in the airways and are particularly vulnerable to microbial infection. Such infections are responsible for the early mortality associated with CF.
Ultimately 80-95% of patients with CF succumb to respiratory failure brought on by chronic bacterial infection and associated airway inflammation3. Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium, is the most common pathogen that colonizes the CF lung in the first few years of life (Fig 2), however Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered the most important pathogen in progressive, severe CF lung disease4. P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and chronic colonization occurs in 60% of CF patients by 18 years of age (see Fig 2). These patients can also be co-infected by other pathogens such as Burkholderia cenocepacia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
One of the most problematic of CF pathogens is B. cenocepacia,"

The very beginning. Three team members, Gosia, Eva and Dmitry met each other to discuss the possibility of joining iGEM competition this year. Straight after that Rosie joined the team.
March 2008
The idea to participate in iGEM was presented in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MBB)  in the students and staff committee meeting. The head of MBB Department, Prof. D. Hornby agreed to help us in managing this project.
April 2008
The team now consisted of 9 members, mostly joined by MBB Level 2 students. The early brainstorming took place. However, no ideas that would be feasible to complete during the summer and would have actual impact on science appeared.
A new science orientated society  was established within the University of Sheffield Union of Students. The initial purpose of the SynBio society was to help students within the University to participate in iGEM next year, along with that a Scientific Journal Club with monthly meetings is on the agenda

Project Abstract
English: Kidney sensing – toward a bacterial biosensor engineered for early stages chronic kidney disease
     Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is characterized by alterations in kidney functions and structure, affects millions of people worldwide and a large portion of them is unaware of it. Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C.  Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a threshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C. We envisioned it as a fast, simple and reliable tool for CKD screening and diagnosis.

Applied Capsule ingredient statement
(The structure of polyacrylic)
At the inside of capsule, it contains polyacrylic resin to control the dissolving process of the capsule. Polyacrylic is made from Methacrylic acid, Methyl propiolate and acrylic ester in different proportion. Nowadays, polyacrylic resin II and III are the common material used in coating. The effective portion of polyacrylic resin is its carboxyl. When polyacrylic resin in low PH environment, the carboxyl will combine with hydroxyl ion and form salt, so that it is easier for bacteria to pass through.
Storage information
The probiotic medicinal product contains viable bacteria in a high concentration. For this reason, it should be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature ranging between +2° C and +8° C. An interruption of chilling for a few days will have normally no influence on the number of viable cells. Therefore it is much available for patients to get effective products.
Safety
In case of a prolonged heat exposure, however, the bacterial cells will to some extent lose their viability. No toxic substances will be developed.
Sensitivity
Because the capsule ingredient has been designed consummately, we can make sure the bacteria will not be released in wrong position, so these bacteria will work intensively. Specific speaking, our engineered bacteria show distinct color-depth difference when exposed to different concentrations of tetrasulfate and thiosulfate, ranging from 0.01 mM to 1mM. The probiotics are able to produce (Flow-process is following), and there will be an obvious result when the chromoprotein mix with excrement for we have down an experiment about color modulation (the result is following)

In the flagellar-building process, flagellin are exported out of the cell sequentially by the flagellum-specific export apparatus. F.

Delivery
A major part of our project involves investigating what is the best way to deliver our biofilm-degrading and antimicrobial enzymes to the site of infection in the urinary tract.
As we have mentioned above, patients with recurrent, complicated cases of UTI often get their infections from an already-inserted catheter which may have to be there and cannot be removed for a variety of other medical reasons. In view of that, we decided to conceptualize an initial delivery method which was centered on the catheter.
Our AlgiBeads design involves encapsulating our therapeutic, enzyme-secreting bacteria in sodium alginate beads. These beads are immobilized in a modified section of a catheter, from which the bacteria can secrete the therapeutic enzymes into the infected urinary tract. On our Design page, thorough consideration was given to the AlgiBeads delivery method, including issues of safety and practicality.
However, based on some preliminary data obtained for gene expression and diffusion rates, our computational models predicted that the equilibrium concentration of enzymes in solution based on the AlgiBeads delivery method would be too low when compared against the known concentrations required for biofilm degradation.
As such, we have had to instead consider an alternative delivery method - the introduction of our enzyme-releasing therapeutic engineered bacteria into the urinary microbiome, whereby the problem of low enzyme concentration in solution will be overcome by the close proximity between the therapeutic bacteria and the pathogenic bacteria. Another benefit of having therapeutic bacteria as part of the microbiome is of course that the treatment becomes preventive in nature, with the therapeutic bacteria now part of the bacterial community in the body constantly releasing pathogen-killing enzymes.
Of course, altering the microbiome comes with its own set of hazards,"

Therefore, without ALR, a lack of D-alanine in auxotrophic mutant bacterial inhibits cell division and cell growth (Aguilera, 2008). (B) In the presence of lactate, lactate binds lldR, preventing its binding to bind the operators. Consequently, ALR is expressed and catalyzes the conversion of L-alanine to D-alanine which is required for the survival of bacteria.
Part 2:
RIOT Transponder
Here, we use the CD44v6 antibody, which is conjugated to a bacterial peptide called hasA. hasA is part of the Has operon system, which when bound to hasR (found on the surface of the bacterial cells) leads to a cascade of reactions within.
The Has operon is another critical sensor for the RIOTsystem. The proteins involved in the operon are hasA, hasR, hasS and hasI. hasA is an extracellular haemophore and it binds to bacterial cells expressing hasR, the hasA receptor. This binding causes a conformational change in hasS (an anti-sigma factor), which then releases hasI, a sigma factor. hasI then binds to its specific promoter (labelled as pHas) to trigger expression of genes under pHas. In the RIOT system, the gene expressed is luxR, which is required to activate the RIOT suppressor.
BACKGROUND:
In this case, we are using the Has operon to activate the luxR feedback system. In the bacteria cell, hasR, hasS and hasI will be constitutively expressed. hasR is expressed on the outer surface of the cell wall and acts as the receptor that binds to hasA. hasS will be found on the inner surface of the membrane of the cell.
Normally in the cell, hasI, which is a sigma factor, is bound to hasS, which is an anti-sigma factor. This prevents hasI from activating the production of luxR. But when hasR is bound by hasA, this leads to conformational changes that result in the release of hasI by hasS. hasI will then activate luxR production.
CD44 is a cell membrane protein involved in normal cell function (cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion). However, one notable isoform, CD44v6, seems to play a major role in cancer progression, facilitating cell migration and invasion and is commonly upregulated on the surface of cancer cells. The"

Summary of Week 11: August 15 - August 21
In our experimental attempt to characterize the Notch-Delta interaction, we used co-culture of CHO and Hek293 cells as well as stable cell lines of Notch-containing and Delta-containing cells from Elowitz to observe the trans-activation of Notch by Delta. Other experiments using CHO cells, which are more difficult to transfect than Hek293 using Lipofectamine, were carried out to observe the behavior of CHO transfected cells.

Kenneth - Updates on Experiments: Latest iteration of base FACS code: removes the mean line on the histograms. Moves the quadrant lines to 200 for everything, since I've been seeing 200 as pretty much the max for the Blank samples. Can be easily changed. Results are in for dox ladder of Elowitz CMV-TO CHO cells [iGEM2011:Elowitz CHO Dox ladder], free delta induction of Elowitz receiver CHO cells.&nbsp;[iGEM2011:Free Delta Induction of Elowitz Receiver CHO]  FACS data is in for TRE:delta mcherry and TRE:mKate experiments TRE_mKate dox ladder part 2|iGEM2011:TRE_mKate dox ladder part 2], however, due to loss of blue channel, cannot gate. Instead, using the top X% percent method to process data. The MATLAB code takes in the data and only keeps the top X% of data. In this case I used 50%.
Co-Culture of Elowitz CHO cells: taken pictures also at 48 hours. Will bring to Weiss lab to process images. Redoing the experiment again, this time with 80:20 ratio as well. Will take pictures and FACS on Tuesday
CO-Culture of HEK and CHO cells:

On September 23rd and 24th, our iGEM Team was able to host a booth at the NYC World Maker Faire, a family-festival/science-fair where the public was invited to learn more and interact with the future of science and engineering. We invited Columbia NYC iGEM to our booth to present their project alongside ours and assist in our Fruit DNA Extraction activity. Children became “scientists,” using household chemicals to visualize clumps of fruit DNA and learning how to pipette their DNA solution into microcentrifuge tubes, which they brought home as a necklace or bracelet. For this activity, we asked Columbia iGEM to bring some supplies, such as additional fruit and sandwich bags, as well as manpower (the kids tended to come in packs).

Dylan visited our world when our universe's membrane collided with an adjacent one. A being composed of energy, but not matter, he chooses to veil himself in a human guise because he found the stares distracting. Because he exists independently of time, he experiences all of time simultaneously, and does not believe in free will. When we asked him whether he could tell us if we'll win, he simply shook his head and replied cryptically ""If you immediately know the candle light is fire, then the meal was cooked long ago"".

Dr. Lars Angenent - Biological and Environmental Engineering
Lars Angenent is interested in converting organic materials with undefined mixed cultures, defined mixed cultures, or pure cultures of microbes to generate specific products, such as the energy carriers – methane; carboxylates; electric current; n-butanol. Pretreatment of the biomass may be necessary to increase the conversion rates, and therefore Lars Angenent is also interested in physical/chemical (e.g., dilute acid method), thermochemical (e.g., slow pyrolysis), and biological pretreatment steps. In regards to bioprocessing steps, Lars Angenent studies anaerobic digestion, anaerobic fermentation, bioelectrochemical systems, syngas fermentation, and ABE fermentation. Other areas of interest are biosensors and biocomputing devices that are based on bioelectrochemical systems (BESs); and photobioreactors.
For organic waste conversion into bioenergy, Lars Angenent is promoting the carboxylate platform as an important platform in biorefineries because water and nutrients must be recycled while bioenergy yields must be maximized. This platform is based on microbial conversions with undefined mixed cultures"

By Air, Sea, Rail or Road
By Rail Newcastle is accessible via the Newcastle Railway Station, which lies on the main East coast line of Britian. The station was opened in 1850, designed by John Dobson, a famed designer in the North East, and built in collaboration with Northern engineer Robert Stephenson. Robert Stephenson's father, George Stephenson was a pioneer of steam powered railways. The station is located in the city centre near the River Tyne.
By Road Newcastle lies on the A1 road which follows the route of one of the historic roads of Britian, the Great North Road. The Great North Road was used for some of the first national mail delivery coaches from London to Edinburgh. Some of the University's main buildings including King's Gate are on the roads around the Great North Road.
By Air Newcastle can by reached by catching one of the many flights to Newcastle International Airport. The airport was opened in 1935 and is located just outside the city in Woolsington. The two most popular flights from Newcastle are to London Heathrow and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
By Sea the city of Newcastle lies on the River Tyne. Ferries run to various destinations in Europe from North Shields - the mouth of the Tyne on the east coast. Why not come and see our vast array of Bridges.

The Gibson-transformed cells yielded a lot of mutants, with significantly more on the Gibson plates than on the negative controls ones. One strange thing with the J61002 Plac-RFP: the negative control  cells were weakly red fluorescent, while for the Gibson assembly some of the cells were expressing RFP. We'll see the results of the colony PCR tomorrow, but it's possible that the cells are autofluorescent...
Vincent made an extension PCR for both the RFP and Lysis T7 promoter variants (36 samples). The extension PCR had an elongation time of 1 min. or RFP and 2 min. for Lysis. The protocol is avaible in the protocol section.
Clearly the RFP T7 promoter variants went well, but the T7 Lysis promoter variants ... not so much. Vincent made liquid cultures of all the T7 lysis plasmids (both C5 and K1) and put them in the incubator. He also pelleted all the C5 RFP liquid cultures and the K1-Lys cultures that he had made on Monday (6 colonies per promoter) thinking that he had not yet achieved a full T7-lysis. The pellets are being kept in a special box called ""Pellets"".

Nadine ran the colony PCRs on a gel and got strange results.
For J61002 Plac-RFP, the negative control cells are definitely red - although they should not contain RFP -  and the colony PCR that includes a primer on RFP is positive. The colonies 8-10 were still white on the plate, but here again the colony PCR is positive. Perhaps this comes from the template plasmid used for the PCR (J61002 Ptet_EFP); since the miniprep failed we have to wait before sending the samples for sequencing.

However, we would need to recycle the water we recover from our process back into the extraction because the compressed air is dissolved in water. We eliminated the design option using chemical coagulation because we would need to incorporate a backwashing step to remove the calcium chloride that would be attached to the PHB. We also eliminated electrocoagulation, based on the fact that it was not selective for PHB within our media.

This week we ran PHB produced from the two different parts made by the synthesis group on the HPLC. We were able to detect peaks for crotonic acid for the samples extracted from both parts. This confirms that we did indeed produce PHB using our parts.
Week 26: October 30 - November 3
This week we melted commercial PHB in a steel mold of a small wrench to see if the plastic could indeed be used for that purpose. On cooling, the plastic hardened, but proved difficult to free from the mold, breaking when we tried to push it out. Perhaps a silicon mold would work better.

We also made a new batch of spores with the more recent supercompetent B. subtilis colonies we obtained from Dr. Wong and stored them at 4°C and -20°C.
Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
We were surprised to see white B. subtilis colonies growing on spec plates. The transformed colonies should have been red since the thrC integration vector contains both the RFP and spec cassettes. Untransformed cells (comK strain) do not carry the spec cassette therefore they should not grow on spec plates; this was confirmed by plating untransformed cells on plain agar and spec plates.
In order to ensure B. subtilis was actually being transformed with our PCR product, we did a colony PCR (Fig. 19.1) using thrC specific primers. We expected to see a 2300 bp product which is the size of DNA within the homologous regions in the thrC vector, this region includes the spec and RFP cassette. We either saw bands around 3000 bp or around 700 bp for B. subtilis transformed with PCR product. A B. subtilis colony that was transformed earlier in the year and expressed RFP also produced a 3000 bp band. Untransformed cells gave us a band around 600 bp). These results suggest that RFP expression was turned off in B. subtilis colonies in which a 3000 bp band was amplified. A mystery band around 700 bp was visible for a few of the samples. A different set of primers which amplified 150 bp more were used for a cPCR (Fig. 19.2). cPCR on untransformed colonies (comK) produced a product around 650 bp while the mystery bands appear around 850. This gel suggests that B. subtilis was being transformed. We speculated the transformed colonies containing the smaller bands kept the spec cassette (675 bp) and removed the RFP from its genome. Dr. Wong had warned us about B. subtilis constantly remodeling its genome under stress.
Figure 4: A cPCR using thrC specific primers was done on B. subtilis colonies transformed with PCR product. P2, P3 and P4 colonies were obtained using Primers containing varying amounts of homologous sequence (293 bp, 190 bp and 125 bp of homologous sequence respectively).

She holds an optimistic view on gene editing, especially using AAV and CRISPR-Cas to treat genetic disorders. She hopes that gene editing can be made available in five years’ time, and to replace traditional methods of treatments, which are comparatively ineffective or cumbersome. For example, the enzyme replacement treatment for Hemophilia, she pointed out, requires the patient to receive the treatment continually and also posed to the possibility of a severe immune response.
When asked about DNA editing and RNA editing for disease treatment, she thinks that DNA editing has a major advantage over RNA editing, which is a relatively lower cost. As RNA editing needs to be tailored to the individual patient, and the effect is not as durable as DNA, the cost for customization and continual treatment would make it more expensive. On the issue of safety, she is not worried too much on that of DNA editing, as she believes that RNA editing, whose effect being transient, is also able to cause a severe immune response and result in organ failure in a short time. While the negative effect of DNA editing is long-lasting, its advantage of fixing the gene permanently, in her view, outweighs the potentially disastrous effect. 
In spite of that, she also finds value in RNA editing — for cancer treatment, some are analyzing transcriptome to identify the disease-causing transcripts, one layer above protein profiling, because the same gene can produce multiple transcripts due to alternative splicing, therefore, when the genome is not erroneous, and when defective proteins are too many to be corrected, it is important to identify the transcripts and correct or knock down them. The major problem now, she asserts, is that RNA is very unstable as compared to DNA or protein, and the transcriptome changes from time to time, from cell to cell, making it especially hard to analyze.
 Training Doctors from Duke-NUS Medical School 
We also interviewed training doctors Dr. Tracy Koh and her fellow colleagues from Duke-NUS medical school to see how future doctors view such an issue. 
Figure 7. Photo of our interviewer with training doctors
We raised the issue of safety to the interviewees, and they agreed that safety is indeed a big issue as the patients would be worried about the risks of receiving the treatment, especially when it is not so well-tested at this stage. From a technical point of view, apart from efficiency issues related with CRISPR-Cas, delivery system would also be a problem where target cells may not be reached. Only by having enough clinical trials can we ensure the safety level, which takes a long period to accomplish. From the public’s aspect, they may not have"

Especially interesting in this context is the first step catalysed by an adenylation (A) domain  which is the activation of the corresponding amino acid using ATP to yield an adenylate intermediate and thus closely resembles the corresponding step of the  ribosomal pathway (Sieber and Marahiel, 2005). However, in contrast to the limited repertoire of amino acids the ribosome uses there are A-domains known that  can select from hundreds of proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic building blocks. Nevertheless the peptides that are assembled seem to be limited in their size  to about 50 amino acids (Caboche et al., 2008). Intrigued by the multitude of possibilities these A-domains offer we wanted to make their utilization within the  ribosomal pathway possible to overcome the size limit of NRPSs.
To reach that aim, we planned to create a fusion protein that has the capability to activate amino acids derived from NRPSs’ A-domains and tRNA binding capabilities  derived from aaRSs.
Figure 1: Model of the RiboSURF.
Structural characterization of the Arc1p-C tRNA binding domain
Our choice for these two domains were on the one hand PheA (BBa_K1329005) from gramicidinS synthetase  which was already well characterized and has been shown to activate L- and D-phenylalanine also in a non-native context (Stevens et al., 2006) which is a necessary  criterion for the construction of our enzyme. On the other hand the search for a domain that conferred tRNA binding capabilities faced the challenge that the tRNA  binding domain is often established by the correct spatial arrangement of parts of the peptide chain. Finally; in the case of the C-terminal part of Arc1p (Arc1p-C) (BBa_K1329004) from S. cerevisiae, we found a domain that shows these binding capabilities in  one peptide strand and thus was accessible for further engineering by the introduction to our fusion protein. However, structural information on this domain and a  structural understanding of how this domain interacts with tRNA was crucially missing. Therefore, we crystallized Arc1p-C (Figure 2A) and determined its crystal structure  to 1.8 Å resolution (Figure 2B). Data were collected at ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiatian Facility, Grenoble, France.

We received an invitation to the XXVI International Congress for Beekeeping Updates in 2019.
Detailed Description
After receiving feedback from beekeepers, we looked into bees’ anatomy and behavior in a healthy environment. We were looking to enrich our investigation with the point of view of a veterinary expert. Dr. Tanus provided us with an hour and a half of his time to listen to our work. He began by introducing the arrival of foulbrood in Mexico and mentioning the National Program for Honey Harmlessness and Quality, which appeals to European standards (since the EU is Mexican honey’s largest purchaser). Among these standards, Mexico asks honey producers to create antibiotic-free products.
On American Foulbrood, he called the larvae’s first 24 hours “crucial”, since it is the time their defenses are at their lowest. He remarked that there aren´t effective remedies to these diseases, only preventive methods.
He said that bee colony arson was frowned upon and claimed that wood should not be used indiscriminately . When one suspects spores are present, it is imperative to change hives and flame the boxes by blowtorch, this is sterilization.
On our own account, we found NOM--SEMARNAT/SAGARPA-2007 which sets parameters under which it is legal to start fires on forestry, agricultural, and cattle land. It allows fires for the control of bacterial diseases, after meeting several requirements.
He mentioned foulbrood incidence has declined since 2008 thanks to the Good Honey Production Practices manual which recommends changing boxes and preventive strategies for beekeepers. He mentioned MSc Juan Diego Perez de la Rosa, Head of the Department of Genomic Sequencing at the National Center for Animal Health Verification Services, who has cultured Paenibacillus larvae for identification, from samples taken in 17 different states of the Mexican Republic.
Tanus stated that it is impossible to say that there is no presence of foulbrood in Mexico without first conducting an epizootiology study in the country. He clarified that the word of a beekeeper is not in doubt; however, it might be hard to obtain real data as it is a mandatory complaint issue, so there is distrust of the producer. He shared some characteristics that differentiate both foulbrood. He also commented on the incidence of these diseases throughout the seasons.
Dr. Tanus suggested liquid application (in the form of syrup) which beekeepers could feed their hives. This syrup (sweetened water) could contain the peptides in it and be fed directly to the box. This way, nurse bees would feed on here. Since Africanized bees appeared,"

Duke,2009,Team:Duke_-_-_TEXT.html,"3HB), which is not elastic enough for general plastic applications. But when phaCAB is expressed with cat2, a succinate degradation gene from Clostridium kluyveri that produces the 4HB monomer, the copolymer poly(3-hyroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate), or poly(3HB-co-4HB), is produced (Figure 3). Poly(3HB-co-4HB) is more elastic and thus has potential to be used in a variety of applications.
However, bioplastic production is currently too costly to be used widely. For example, poly(3HB-co-4HB) pathways that have been developed so far produce copolymers with very low concentrations of 4HB, the monomer that gives the copolymer its elastic properties. This could be because the enzyme that catalyzes PHA formation, PHA synthase, has higher affinity for the 3HB-CoA substrate (100%) than the 4HB-CoA substrate (0.03%).
Figure 3. Pathway for poly(3HB-co-4HB) synthesis [Madison and Huisman, 1999]
In addition, the 3HB pathway uses acetyl-CoA, an input to the citric acid cycle, as a precursor, but cat2 uses succinyl- CoA, an intermediate in the cycle. Since more processing is required to obtain the 4HB cursor, the pathway may naturally favor production of the 3HB polymer, resulting in higher 3HB composition in the final copolymer.
Thus, this project aims to develop a more efficient biopathway for poly(3HB-co-4HB) while increasing the 4HB monomer composition predictably. To achieve this goal, we designed vectors with various combinations of the phaCAB operon and the cat2 gene so that genetic manipulations can be made to the genes for PHA synthase and precursor processing to increase bioplastic production and quality.
Figure 4. The reddish tint present on some colonies indicates the presence of PHA granules in the bacteria
3HB genetic pathway
The phaCAB operon genomic DNA from Cupriavidus necator was cloned into PCR Blunt II-TOPO vector as the backbone and the cloning product was transformed into bacteria cells which were then plated on kanamycin (50 μg/ml) plates. Successful insertion of phaCAB was shown by Nile Red fluorescence in colonies (Figure 4).

iGEM Stockholm 2010
We are a group of undergraduate students studying life science with professors as mentors at Stockholm University. This is our website about our work and effort in representing our school as Team Stockholm in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition against other teams from all over the world.
iGEM is an international research competition focused on synthetic biology. Each team is given a kit containing biological parts for practical work, which takes place at each teams' university. The use of these biological parts in combination with self-designed parts, will lay the ground for building innovative and useful new biological systems and operate them in living cells.
This competition opens for students to think “out of the box” when engineering living organisms to be applied as tools for solving problems in healthcare, bioenergy, chemical and material production and bioremediation, to name a few.
The principles in the field of synthetic biology is to combine science and engineering in order to genetically design and build living cells with novel biological roles and systems, aimed at overcoming the obstacles in modern life.
Stay tuned for daily updates in the run up to the finals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)!

Due to the fact that in the country most of the people tends to emit judgments without really having the correct information, the misinformation of the overall population (including workers of the public sector such as governors, senators and mayors) is the regular/normal situation day a day and nothing seems to be changing, at least in the short term set.
Therefore, we’ve been implementing a couple of activities where we can explain and instruct the generations soon to be graduated from high school and college freshmen what is Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology and the high spectrum of applications they offer: this through a series of workshops where they are shown how to use certain softwares for plasmid assembly and gene blocks constructions, as well as simulations of DNA replications and all the machinery involved in these kind of processes; and a mini-summer camp where they are exposed to all the things Tec de Monterrey is doing in its science faculty in campus Queretaro, where the schools of Biotechnology, Agronomy and Food Science Engineering try to develop new sustainable projects in order to help the community and give it the much needed tools to improve old fashion techniques of production of any kind of bioproduct that are harmful to the environment, non efficient or more wasteful of resources (especially in a part of Mexico where the climate seasons tend to be a bit harsh and there’s a severe problem with water supply and usage).
The camp consisted on a series of conference talks from different professors of the university, lab workshops imparted by members of the Biosint_Mexico team, and of course several outdoor activities. There were talks about the current global situation of the biotechnology, an introduction to the basics of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, the approach of genomics in personalized medicine, as well as two wetlabs: DNA extraction and Bacterial Transformation. It was greatly perceived by the majority of the attendants and professors of the faculty, since no other student association of the school does anything similar.
Synthetic Biology and Bioinformatics Workshop         Carried out on March 12th, this workshop consisted on a 6 hr class where we talked about the basics of Synthetic Biology (how it works, what is its ultimate purpose, the tools required to built Biobricks,its prefix and suffix, assembly of plasmids, the use of PCR, the election of the correct chassis for insertion, etc.). After that we explained how to correctly use 2 softwares: Desktop Genetics and Geneious, both facilitators for the assembly of genetic parts.

Turner Farm’s organic certification requires that they plant organic seeds if possible, use no unnatural chemicals or genetically modified seeds in production, and that the land must have been organic for a certain period of time. The employees we spoke with preferred local, non genetically-modified agriculture, mainly for environmental reasons, including reduced chemical dependence, and for food quality. However, operating a farm organically leaves the farm susceptible to diseases and pests. At the time we visited the farm, they were having issues with potato fleas, and mentioned that they had had infections of downy mildew on their tomatoes and onion blight in years past. In order to combat pests, they are able to use some organic pesticides, such as milk, which has fungicidal properties, and some forms of bacteria, as well as other physical methods, such as blow fans, electric fences, crop rotation, raised beds, cover crops, and cover cloths, to prevent pests, weeds, and outside animals. In addition, the farm is able to use organic materials in lieu of chemical fertilizers, including composted chicken manure, fish emulsions, manure, strategic cover crops, and mulches such as sheeps’ wool, old mushroom logs, and leaf compost.
Although Turner Farm’s work requires them to not use unnatural chemicals or genetic modification, their end goals relate in many ways to the end project: both use innovative solutions to reduce dependence on environmentally harmful materials while improving food quality and production."

Why would our project be relevant??
It is possible to couple it with another systems. For example, it could help to know if a nutrient is lacking
We will take the medium into account for the modeling.
We will model a channel, and this is new(at least in the beginning), it has never been done
It is possible to regulate it with accuracy if we manage to reduce the noise.
We could use it in other projects (like PONG).
We could see at which level could we modulate the internal part of the system.

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," dreadfully wrong. I paid too much attention to the optical power, but the light intensity, which is dependent on the solid angle (and Lionel Bastard, my optics teacher, told me so well how important this solid angle is primordial), which depends on the viewing angle, is a better way to choose the light source. What I should actually have done is to take a LED with the highest light intensity possible and the lowest viewing angle, and determine experimentally the optical power with the photodiode. From that, I had several possibilities. I could simply change of LEDs, but I didn’t want to waste my time. I thought of using lenses to focus the light on the sample. It would have basically looked something like that:
It is a very schematic scheme, but it sums up the idea and the issues this idea brings. The LEDs are in the same plane that the photodiode, the focal object plane of the 1st lens, behind the emission filter. A 2 lenses assembly focus the light on the sample which is in the focal image plane of the second lens. The fluorescence light is reemitted on the photodiode which is on the same plane that the photodiode. This system raises 2 issues. Firstly, the filter would have been to selective, the light intensity on the sample wouldn’t have been high enough. Secondly, the viewing angle of the LEDs demand the numerical aperture. To get the full light beam, I would need a lens with a numerical aperture higher than sin(150°/2)=0.9 and a focal of 1.4 cm, which I did not find.
The last solution before changing of LEDs is to get them closer to the sample. I changed the eppendorf holder for the aluminium plates, in which I installed the LEDs very close to the sample, so that I don’t need to take care of the viewing angle. This arrangement has given me the best results so far, as I could see a sensitive difference between a non-fluorescent sample and a fluorescent one. At this point, I have what seems to be a qualitative fluorescence detector, with a bad sensitivity. The measurements can all be found here under the name “fluo_dilution_quantitative_measurements”
The first experiments were done by hand, which explains the few values in comparison with the last experiments which voltages were measured with the Arduino. The values are significantly different as I faced many issues during the experiments (LEDs short circuit, not perfect dark, auto-inhibit fluorescence phenomenon), which makes difficult to compare them. However, one can learn a few"

Overview
Knowing that collaboration is the tenet of iGEM competition, this year we have collaborated with three iGEM teams, a high school team (SHSBNU-China) and two undergraduate teams (Tsinghua-A, Peking). By collaborating with these four iGEM teams, we can seek out help whenever needed and receive prompt feedback about our project design and Wiki contents.
Collaboration with team Tsinghua-A
Having been known each other for a long time, we were quite thrilled to reach out to our old friends Zhaojian Wang, Shuailin Li, Chenhao Wang, Chi Zhang and Wanlin He, five team members from Team Tsinghua A, and form a very healthy and constructive relationship with them. In retrospect, it turned out to be a very worthy journey with them.
During the brainstorming stage, we shared our ideas to each other and got useful suggestions to modify details. And whenever we got results, whether positive or negative, we would discuss and analysis together.
Their team consists of students from school of life science or department of automation. With friends majoring in life science we could talk about strategy and technology in wet lab works, while with those from department of automation in their team, we could exchange experiment in terms of math and modeling.
Zhaojian and Chenhao, with excellent social skills, were able to get in touch with many other iGEM teams and invite them to Tsinghua University. Zhaojian always shared the information with us and communicated with them together. Additionally, Zhaojian took great photos during communications.
Thanks Team Tsinghua-A! we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “goodbye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after. In the future, we would really look forward to creating more memories with them.

The pathways on the right half of the cell are genetic expressions of the 3 enzymes involved in the plastic synthesis pathway.  The pathways on the left represent the actual P(3HB) production pathway.
As can be seen in the Key (above), the yellow, solid circle represents a reaction object and for each object parameter the following needs to be specified for the simulation to work:
Rate equation or kinetic law (e.g. mass action, Michaelis-Menten etc.)
Parameters in the rate equation
Species involved in the reaction
Value and units for each parameter
Simbiology will then use an ODE solver (ode15 or sundial) to solve these ODEs and give a plot of the specified output(s) (concentration level of a species over time, for instance).
Note that 3HB deg, Acetoacetate deg, AcetoacetylCoA deg and 3HB-CoA deg are degradation rates (all = 0.035/min, please see assumptions below) of the corresponding species formed along the P(3HB) synthesis pathway.

1. Low concentration: increase the cycle number/decrease the annealing temperature. 2. Unspecific amplification: increase the annealing temperature/decrease the cycle number/use less template/increase the cycle number of the first round in overlapping PCR/perform gel extraction to get the desired fragment.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Analyses
1. Weight the appropriate amount of agarose powder. In our experiments，we used 1.0% gel for DNA fragments that between 200bp~7000bp, 2.0% gel for fragments that between 100bp~200bp, and 2.5% gel for fragments that under 100bp. Furthermore, if the gel is used for gel extraction or other operation requiring completely separation of different fragments, higher concentration should be used. 2. Dissolve the agarose powder in TBE solution buffer by heating it in microwave for about 5 minutes until no solid material can be seen. 3. Add EB solution (5μl/100ml) after the agarose solution cooling down. 4. Place the comb into the gel mold. Apply the agarose solution to the mold and wait for 30mins~1h to get the solid agarose gel. Attention: being exposed under light for too long can cause the degradation of EB. So put the ready-made gels into a box with TBE solution buffer as storage. 5. Mix the DNA sample with 6× loading buffer or 10× loading buffer (to denature the enzymes) or use reaction buffer that already contained loading buffer. 6. Load the DNA sample to the gel. Set voltage and time to 130~160V and 30~15mins. 7. Check the result and capture the figure in UV box.
Purification & Gel Extraction

After each study the user task was altered or refined further to clarify the task and increase student comfort in testing out our software project, and participants were compensated with gift cards as appreciation for their assistance.
Working for the future
An overall trend we noticed this summer in dealing with safety concerns in the wet-lab is that communication, collaboration, and proper documentation of experimental procedures and data all have important impacts on the success of synthetic biology experiments.  We have documented all our software concerns and videos concerning safety in our iGEM 2012 website , to allow for intuitive use of our software and for future references to computational teams, and encourage iGEM teams of both wet-lab and computational tracks to document their research meticulously.

Human Practices
This year, because our project has real potential to positively impact our small community, we did a lot of work in human practices. Evidence of our impact are the two articles in which we have been featured in our local newspaper, “The Rocky Mountain Outlook”.  The first article published introduced who we are what the iGEM competition actually is. It outlined our project as well as the potential impact on our communities’ wastewater treatment challenges. The second article was published when we hosted an Alberta Innovates and GeekStarter jamboree at our school, where all five Alberta iGEM teams competed against each other in a pre-competition.  This allowed for us to learn about others projects and meet our nearby teams.  This article focuses on the $8,000 grand prize that we won at this Alberta GeekStarter jamboree, earning us the distinction of best overall project, and “most potential impact”.
We have also been interviewed by the local radio station, mountain FM, where they asked us many questions about our project, iGEM, and the upcoming competition. The interview allowed us to get the word out about our project and connect with not only Canmore, but also the surrounding communities such as Banff, Exshaw and Lake Louise.
A significant human practices achievement was having one of our team members, Alina Arvisais and one of our teacher supervisors, Mrs. Puurunen, went to visit the wastewater treatment plant in Canmore. They learned about the current methods employed to deal with the hair issue, as well as the workers’ opinions concerning our project and it’s potential application in this industry. This visit allowed us to learn more in depth-information about the issue, and really visualize and understand how a Keratinase-expressing bacteria could be used in bio-reactor systems already in place.  We got some amazing photos… and won’t soon forget the smell.
Our team also did a few presentations to not only educate our community's leaders, but also to help in our fundraising goals. We spoke with our local Rotary Club chapter, including presenting to their members at a breakfast meeting. We received a gracious donation from them for our efforts to solve a community issue, and got some valuable mentorship from them regarding how to approach our ongoing fundraising plan.

For next week, this is the list of things we need to accomplish:
1. Order new dropout media that has raffinose as its carbon source rather than glucose
2. Once the new media has arrived, we need to prepare the proper double dropout mix for media and for plates
3. Glycerol stock successful transformations from 7/4 and from 7/8
4. Additional double transformations of parts
5. (Most importantly) we need to run Test #1 again using what we learned yesterday.  Of course, 1-4 simply prepare us for re-doing Test #1
Concerning our next round of transformations, we have decided to focus on preparing for the test of our three available repressors.  This include GliR (Z0415), LexR (Z0412), and YY1R (Z0416).  One of the main reasons for focusing on these parts is that we currently lack a null activator part, so we cannot complete rigorous tests of our parts individually.  For testing these three parts, we will need to complete the following transformations:
GliR
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
3. pRS304* + GliR reporter (Z0510)
4. GliR (Z0415) + pRS306
5. nullR + GliR reporter**
6. GliR + GliR reporter**
LexR
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
7. pRS304* + LexR reporter (Z0418)
8. LexR (Z0412) + pRS306
9. nullR + LexR reporter**
10. LexR + LexR reporter**
YY1
1. W303 transformed with pRS304* and pRS306
2. null repressor (Z0411) + pRS306
11. pRS304* + YY1R reporter (Z0511)
12. YY1R (Z0416) + pRS306
13. nullR + YY1R reporter**
14. YY1R + YY1R reporter**
** Indicates transformations that have already been accomplished.
Note the double transformation scheme, which allows us to use the same trp- ura- dropout media for testing all transformations"

I. Overview
This year's SHSBNU_China Team is trying to develop a highly efficient, low-cost and modularized biomaterial to decompose synthetic dye, the Biofilm x Laccase system, using the methods of synthetic biology. Here we wish to share our experiences of safety control.
II. Safe Project Design
We considered safety in every part of our project. For example, CotA Laccase, biofilm and the combination of them in a sewage filter. In this filter, PHA plastic, bacteria containing CsgA plasmid or CotA plasmid, laccase, and plasmids from both bacteria should all be considered a potential danger. To prevent the possible escape of these ingredients, improvements on the designing of the filter were adopted.
First, semi-closed container design would form an effective barrier for biofilm coated PHA plastic beads. PHA plastic beads could be replaced and disposed after expiration. It would also be considered as an advantage that PHA plastic, a biodegradable material, is non-toxic and can be decomposed easily.
Second, we planned to add a secondary oxidation step, by treating the sewage effluent by sodium hypochlorite. This step will remove any bacteria or biomolecule such as plasmid and laccase if they got escaped from the filter. The oxidation step has already been proven to be effective by years of use in Hanghua sewage plant.
Safe Lab Work
""Haocong Li is doing experimental operation following rules""
""Fangning Luo is doing experimental operation following rules""
According to the requirements of iGEM policy, we performed safely in every experiment followed by some basic regulations as follows:
Thorough experiment and regulations should be understood by participants.
Experiment steps with any probability of contamination should be performed in a biosafety cabinet.
Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission is strictly prohibited.
Wear rubber gloves during all experimenters.
Sanitize the lab using UV-light every day.
Fire, electric heaters, and microwave ovens should always be monitored by a teacher while operating.
All liquid and solid waste containing living organisms must be autoclaved before dumping.
The last person to leave the lab should make sure that water, electricity, gas, and air conditioners have been turned off, and doors and windows have been locked before.

Campus talk
December 7th, 2011. The previous team leader- Yunxiao was invited by the new leader- Yu Zhao to give a short talk about the introduction of igem to all of the peers in life science college in Tsinghua University. Approximately 70 bioers attended the meeting. When recalling the detail of the competition last year, Yunxiao was still very exicted. Almost all of the attendants was inspired by the words giving. A certain number of people asked about the detail of the competition. Yu Zhao said later that he predict this year, Tsinghua will surely have a very competitive representative team for iGEM, and surely, everyone participated in it will enjoy the process. Pump it! Tsinghua, 2012, aim for MIT!
Week1
Our team  leader zhaoyu invited many experienced iGEMers such as zhangyun xiao  ,liguanqiao and wangshiqi . They introduced to us the project the did last year  ,and the basic concepts of synthetic biology and iGEM . Students in our school  are very interested in this game and they ask so many questions so that the  campus talk last almost for the whole afternoon .
 
Sign up for the game
After the campus talk ,numerous students were deeply attracted by synthetic biology and iGEM .We designed an application form and put up it on renren website . More than 50 people sign up for the game ,and according to their self-introduction ,we rejected some who don’t have enough time . Then ,those left will have lesson together to see if they are really interested in synthetic biology.
Week 2 and Week 3
The team  leader made a application form ,which focus on the applicants’ scientific  research experience and some specific skills such as art design ,wiki design .  We publicized iGEM through renren.COM which is the most popular website among  Chinese students .Also at the help of director and monitor of all the class in  life of school ,We sent our application message and email to every student . We  left enough time for applicant to think about it .

Macquarie_Australia,2016,Team:Macquarie Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of nafion gives it a high chemical stability and ionomer properties make it an ideal selective membrane for hydrogen protons which can migrate across sulphonate groups [3]. In addition to this, Team Macquarie reshaped our bio-chamber to make it triangular. As H2 gas bubbles towards the surface, it will bubble into the air pocket at the tip of the bio-chamber which will feed it straight through the nafion membrane and into the gas cylinder [4].
Fig 4. Mr Bennett hard at work after teaching the Macquarie Team some basics about voltage and generators.
Mr Brian Bennett, director of Public Image Electrical Contracting, chatted to the team about using hydrogen to produce electrical energy. Mr Bennett hypothesised that a small scale generator would require approximately 7.2k Wh/day.  These estimates enabled Team Macquarie to make calculations relating to the quantity of modified E. coli cells required.
The Design
Team Macquarie 2016 is proud to present our conceptual design, “The Living Battery”.  This self-sustaining system requires only sunlight and media to produce H2 gas which will be stored and used to power hydrogen fuel cells. This method of H2 production is renewable and eco friendly as it does not result in the generation of any undesirable, harmful or polluting by-products.
Dimensions
Based on team Macquarie 2015’s PSII model, the hourly theoretical yield of H2 is 0.8mL per mL of modified E. coli cells (109 cells). A generator that could be used to power appliances inside a car would require about 7.2k Wh/day. As hydrogen has an energy per mass content of 143 MJ kg or 40k Wh, our bio-chamber would have to be large enough to hold approximately 20.77L of modified E. coli cells [5].
Fig 5. The calculated dimensions of the bio-chamber. The length is 1.4m, the width is 1.1m and the height is 0.015m
Biochamber
The Bio-chamber is the core of our design. It is where the E. coli cells are stored and the H2 gas is generated and transferred through a nafion membrane into a storage cylinder.
Perspex was chosen as the outer material of our bio-chamber due to its high absorption of wavelengths (200um to 400um) which protect the modified E. coli from ultraviolet radiation UV A, B and C rays.
The inside of the Perspex layer was laminated with clear My"

Finally, putting the two models together, we found that in the detection range, there is a good fit out of the linear relationship curve. This is a relationship curve in typical condition, the reaction time t1 = 2h, t2 = 1h.
There are some parameters and initial values of variables for equations:
Summary
On the one hand, the modeling work of sensing part has an important guiding significance to biosensor experimental work and the whole project principle design. We have theoretically put forward the scientific and reasonable scheme, and have set out a goal and standard for other work in the team. project's design is based on insight we have gained from modeling. On the other hand, we have made an assessment of the whole of our project. As a project located in the diagnosis category, we use the model to predict the linear relationship between the material concentration, which is a good proof of our project is feasible, and has obvious advantages -- template.

But what truly interest me within it, is the great potential that we have thrue science to change the world for better. The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) I had been in over seven muns in the past three years both as delegate and as chair. My most beloved hobby is parliamentary debate, I I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.
