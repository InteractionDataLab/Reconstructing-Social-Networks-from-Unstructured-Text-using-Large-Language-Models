For those who are not willing to follow a full class on a topic but still want to improve their understanding of science and other ethical matters, TED is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote “ideas worth spreading”.       By organizing TEDtalks conferences that are freely available online, this organization is contributing to the popularization of many topics from science, psychology, new technology or global actualities.       Speakers are often talking about biotechnology and we invite anyone interested in synbio to check out Craig Venter talks among others really interesting contents!
Social networks for synthetic biology popularization and development
How can we talk about free, open content, without talking about social network?       If some websites and Youtube Channel are already providing a great popularization work such as ASAP Science, IFLS (among others) it is also possible for both beginners and long-term scientists to use social network to learn about the actuality of their field, to get in touch with others and to debate about new ideas.       In this perspective, the website Quora is allowing people to ask questions and to receive answers from the world experts on the topic!       The scientific community is especially active on this site and is dedicated to explain through constructed argumentations all the concepts you have ever wondering about.
Twitter can also be a great tool in order to get in touch with scientists and companies and debate! The #DistractiglySexy hashtag is a perfect example of how a social media can be used to convey a message and bring to knowledge some concerns that would have remained unknown without it.       It is also a great way to follow the news, learning about recent discoveries or events.       For those of you, who are not familiar with Twitter, our team have conducted a short study using recent analytical tools to identify the main actors you should follow to be informed about #synbio !
Here is a screenshot of the social network analysis we carried out using the software NodeXL and SocNetV! Some of the more active actors on #synbio for the last 10 000 tweets using this hashtag have been  @Synthsysed, @Synbiobeta, @Seqcomplete, @DrTomEllis, @biobasedchem, @amyelizatayler, @biochemphd, @bioSYNergy_dk , @Caiyizi, @PortlandPress, @ChainBiotech, @KerrLorraine, @Synberc, @kunjapur among others !

HSi Taiwan developed a test to determine the presence of toxins in traditional Chinese medicines. They recognized that because Chinese medicine fell somewhere between herbal supplements and actual medicine, it was a grey area for regulation and therefore the source and quality is not properly scrutinized. Not only did these high school students create sensors that could detect lead, copper, arsenic, and aflatoxin, but they also designed and built a physical device for the consumer to actually test their medicines, shown in the picture below.
Imperial College London worked on developing a communication system between cells, called quorum sensing, “to maintain stable coexistence of different cell types and allow the ratio of different populations to be stably maintained.” No biological process lives in isolation. Not only are cells able to sense their own growth and culture conditions, but they are inextricably intertwined with different species that make up their ecosystem. Take our microbiome, for example: a healthy microbiome contains a range of microbial species, however, those different species must maintain a proper ratio to be balanced. The ability to grow different populations of cells together will give us an insight in understanding how natural cellular systems work together, as well as allow us to build more complex systems and circuits.
Lastly, LMU-TUM Munich began to tackle the problem of an increasing organ shortage by building a 3D bioprinter with the goal of one day printing out organs de novo. The team repurposed an Ultimaker2 3D printer by building a new extrusion nozzle for it that can deliver a precise flow of liquid containing both the matrix and the cells. However, what made this team shine is not the printer that they built, but the approach they took to solve the scaffolding problem.
Currently, bioprinters rely on scaffolds to form the base on which cells are seeded. This presents many difficulties, including the need to assemble multiple 2D scaffolds to create a 3D object like an organ, then the subsequent dissolution of the scaffold to leave only the cells. This process makes 3D bioprinting cumbersome and expensive. Munich’s solution to this problem is to allow the cells to bind to each other immediately upon printing so that the cells themselves are structurally sound and are without need for a scaffold.
As a judge, I believe what made these projects extraordinary, and what earned them the title of iGEM World Champions, was not only their ambition, nor their progress on accomplishing that ambition (although that certainly counts for a lot). It was the thoroughness in which they completed"

Studies have shown multiple correlations between being in contact with air pollution and diseases that implicate inflammatory response or cell multiplication. Those correlations are statistical, and it is nearly impossible to prove scientifically the real impact of pollution over health, as it is only a co-factor (even if some in vitro tests are made). But the idea that both outdoor and indoor pollution impacts on health is generally admitted. A significant step is the 2016 OMS report, which quantify and affirm the correlation between air pollution and risks for human health.
The problem with air pollution is that it’s very difficult to make legislation on it. We have to inform, educate and act for a real change. We then asked him about the recent European decision about endocrine disruptors (The EU didn’t set a maximum concentration for endocrine disruptors), Dr Nhân Pham Thi explained to us that this decision is sad and difficult at the same time. Because those pollutants are only co-factors, there is no “truth” about them. You cannot know the limit between setting a realistic level for health and overly restrain the industry. With air pollution, there is always this contradiction between the qualitative approach (everyone agrees that it’s a problem) and the quantitative one (find precise, reliable experiment that shows the real impact of pollution is nearly impossible and would cost a lot).
City Hall of Paris
On September 11th, we presented our project to the City of Paris. Mrs. Caroline Daude, Transport Consultant, and Mr. Serge Orru, WWF France Advisor and Former Director, welcomed us to discuss our project. They were very interested in our project and in the fact that we are a multidisciplinary team. When we have our prototype, we will have to go back to City Hall, to discuss their support for the development of our project. Their remarks also helped us to develop our scenario. Together we discussed about how our product could integrate the Parisian ecosystem.

All the activities went smoothly, and the students seemed to enjoy the themselves and were eager to answer the questions we asked them about why scientists use the techniques in the lab. The only issue we ran into was that the RFP activity was meant to take half an hour, but it only took about 15 minutes. Luckily the students were interested in the equipment in our lab, so we were able to take the extra time to answer their questions about that.
Overall, the event went well. Students were very interested in the lab techniques and enthusiastic to learn more about synthetic biology. We received the following written feedback from Ms. Marroletti after the event:
“First, the kids absolutely LOVED visiting the lab, and very quickly felt welcome there. The activities were excellent, engaging and meaningful. I liked that you provided all the materials and instructions, and had the kids follow along, while you and the team circulated. That helped get them acclimated to the lab in a way that gave them responsibility for the steps involved.
The gels are much more complicated, but putting it into a problem scenario made it fun and relevant. I think they really enjoyed the process and all the attention they got from the team. It was nice to hear you all sharing even more information, as appropriate, when interacting with students who have more foundational awareness.
Letting them plate some bacteria was a treat. I will share those with them this week. The only thing I can think of to mention as a point of growth is to know your purpose when engaging an audience. The activities are interesting and fun, but it's important to know what you want the students to come away with. In this case, no problem--we want them to come away loving our college labs and eager to come back as an undergraduate. In that effort, it was incredibly successful.""
Additionally, ten students visited our lab during their free time two days later because they said they thought our research very interesting and they wanted to learn more about synthetic biology and being a student researcher.

Safety questions:
 
     1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
 
     Researches could raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety, but we take our efforts to minimize such risks.
     First, the major part of our project is in silico simulation, which will cause little researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety issues.
     Second, during our wet-lab experiment, we took several trainings on laboratory safety issues, which include standard experimental operation, emergency management and biosafety instructions.  Such trainings will guarantee researcher safety, public safety and environmental safety.
     Third, the E.Colistrain and plasmid used in our wet-lab experiment is highly commercialized which is bought from bioengineering company.  Genes used in our wet-lab experiment are got from iGEM competition or bought from bioengineering companies.  Highly commercialized and widely used issues usually have little safety risks.  So, the strains, plasmids and genes we used will raise little researcher safety, public safety and environmental safety problems.
 
     2. Do any of the          new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
 
     None of the parts we constructed this year raise any particular safety issues that we can foresee.  Biobrick are made based on standard parts got from iGEM competition and commercialized parts got from companies.  So, there is little potential risk in raising any          biological safety issue.
 
     3. Is there a          local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
 
     Yes.  The biosafety issue of our project is          under the supervision Department of life Science, Tsinghua University.  Our protocols are submitted to the supervisors and advisors to evaluate if there is potential biological hazard.  We also had several trainings on laboratory safety issues given by the lab manager during our project.
 
     4. Do you have any          other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts,          devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
 
     When it comes to the issue of biosafety, instructions are necessary.  For the iGEM competition,"

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#parts#submitted parts_-_-_TEXT.html," gate can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements. For example, if you want to activate the gate in presence of aTc and AHL, you just have to put the recombinase after the promoter activated by LuxR/AHL ( BBa_R0065 ) and the promoter activated by aTc under the repression of TetR ( BBa_R0040 ).
Even a relatively small amount of recombinases can switch the DNA fragments. Therefore, it is really important to control the recombinases expression with a well-locked promoter. You can look at our specially designed regulation sequence (riboregulator) to get as low as possible any undesired expression and production of the recombinases ( BBa_K1132005 , BBa_K1132006 , BBa_K1132007 , BBa_K1132008 , BBa_K1132042 ).
In the present design, because of the promoter, the polymerase PolT7 is needed to express the gene. This promoter have been used, in order to have an higher level of expression, it can be assimlar to a amplificator. It is why we design one parts with the gate, the RFP inverted and the polymerase T7 after a promoter (BBa_K1132037).
Resetting the gate to its basal state requires a series of excisases capable of switching back the sequences to their native state.
The same type of design was used to build a XOR gate ( BBa_K1132004 ).
Furthemore, if the gene is inserted inside the gate in the forward direction, the gate will not be an AND gate anymore, but it will only be activated in the presence of PhiC31 and in the absence of FimE.

BBa_K1132004: XOR gate with recombinases switching gene regulatory sequences and ORF
This XOR gate was built with one promoter and one restriction sites BamHI surrounded by the PhiC31 integrase site and the FimE sites. The idea is to insert an inverting gene between the recombinase sites with the help of the restriction site. To transcript the gene, the gene will need to be in the right way, to have been switched one time only by one of the both recombinases. This is a XOR gate.
The input signals for this gate are the production of either one or the both recombinases PhiC31 and FimE. The output can be choosen at will"

A snapshot of CRC
Colorectal cancer is the third most common non-skin cancer in both men and women. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Over the past decade, colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased in all racial/ethnic populations except American Indians/Alaska Natives. Men and women have similar incidence rates through age 39; at and above age 40, rates are higher in men.
Differences exist between racial/ethnic groups in both incidence and mortality. African Americans have higher mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups and higher incidence rates than all except American Indians/Alaska Natives. Incidence and mortality rates are lowest among Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders. Overall colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates have been declining over the past two decades; these declines have been attributed largely to increased use of screening tests.
Risk factors for colorectal cancer include increasing age, colorectal polyps, a family history of colorectal cancer, certain genetic mutations, excessive alcohol use, obesity, being physically inactive, cigarette smoking, and a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Effective colorectal cancer screening tests include the fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Standard treatments for colorectal cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, cryosurgery, radiofrequency ablation, and targeted therapy.
Assuming that incidence and survival rates follow recent trends, it is estimated that $13.8 billion will be spent on colorectal cancer care in the United States in 2014.

Using pcDNA3.1 as the vector and Qiagen’s “SuperFect® Transfection Reagent” kit as the transfection method we expect that no exogenous mCherry will be expressed after the transfection because the PMDS inhibits dCas9-p65 to enter the nucleus. Only after photoactivation with 400 nm, violet light will PhoCl be cleaved and irreversibly release the dCas9-p65 which now enters the nucleus. Inside the nucleus it associated with the gRNA and binds to the 13 different binding sites on the mCherry reporter. The transactivation domain p65 subsequently induces activation of transcription of the mCherry gene.
The presented experiments are our designs which we could not conduct during the summer anymore because of time issues. However, we encourage future iGEM teams to use the designs we worked on over the summer and continue where we stopped (which counts as further characterisation of an existing BioBrick and is a Gold medal criteria).

LACE systems can be modified in a wide variety of ways. As described above many approaches are based on the exchange of one transactivation domain with another (e.g. VP64 with p65). Transactivation domains activate gene transcription in a local fashion and generally don’t activate more than one downstream gene.
A fundamentally different approach is the exchange of the transactivation domain with epigenome modifying proteins. Hilton et al. 2015 designed a dCas9 fused to the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 and tested its ability to activate gene transcription for a range of genes in comparison to a dCas9-VP65 LACE system. The dCas9-p300 fusion protein catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 at its target sites, leading to robust transcriptional activation of target genes from promoters and both proximal and distal enhancers. This means that dCas9-p300 is able to induce transcription in proximal and distal genes up to 46 kb away from the dCas9 binding site. These results indicate the possibility of using epigenome modifying enzymes in LACE systems and its usefulness in our proposed guidance system for tissue engineering but they also point out the complex interplay of mammalian gene compaction and gene activation and how much we still have to learn to make our vision a reality.

Alberta,2010,Team:Alberta#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," parts that were uploaded to the Parts Registry were tested extensively, as this was required for their operation in the BioBytes 2.0 system as documented. All the parts were checked using PCR and gel electrophoresis to ensure proper size. The untransformed constructs that were made, including the octamer, were shown using gel electrophoresis to be of expected length.  All of the parts that worked in the transformation experiments have been shown to work in vivo. This also shows that they all work within the BioBytes 2.0 assembly standard.
Helping Other iGEM Teams
Many of our team members completed many of the online questionnaire that were distributed by the other iGEM teams. In addition to this, we sent in our funny pictures to the Cuckoo Clock competition.
We had a two day conference, aGEM, with the University of Calgary and the University of Lethbridge. At aGEM , we constructively criticized the other teams' projects and provided helpful insights into the respective strengths of each teams' projects. We also met with a variety of professionals involved in the synthetic biology sector and conversed with them regarding their thoughts on synthetic biology and our project.
Development of The BioBytes 2.0 Standard
The BioBytes 2.0 standard was designed and developed by our team for this year's competition. It allows for the rapid assembly of BioBytes into larger constructs. BioBytes 2.0 does not require the production of a new BBF standard, as BioBytes 2.0 parts are BioBrick compliant. For more information on the BioBytes 2.0 standard, see our BioBytes 2.0 page.
GENOMIKON: The Educational Toolkit
The major focus of our project was to create an inexpensive synthetic biology tool-kit that could effectively be used in a high school setting. We have tested our BioBytes 2.0 Assembly Method with a group of high school students. In the course of an afternoon, they were able to successfully construct a 4-Byte plasmid, which was transformed into E. coli. This represents a huge innovation beyond the current capacities of high school labs and is sure to garner a wave of excitement in not only synthetic biology, but in subsequent student generations.

Quorum Sensing
During the design of the project, it came to our mind that NO is a highly unstable molecule. So NO signal will decay over increased ditance. But how to amplify this signal of disease and further regulate it? We thought of Quorum Sensing system in microbes. When a gutrio detects NO molecule, it will release a more stable signal for other gutrio to respond to the disease along with it.

TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html,": We contacted two doctors from the gastrointestinal oncology department of the AMC-Amsterdam. Thereby we hoped to get their opinion about the usage of our device (making use of GMO’s) in the intestine. Also we asked them for suggestions to further exploit our idea.
Result: Both Prof. Dekker and Prof. Van den Brink were very enthusiastic about the idea of an easy-to-use device for cancer-screening. Thereby Prof. Dekker emphasized that she could see great benefits in the development of a test that can be used at home. This would not only decrease labour-intensity, as most test need to be performed in a lab. Also it would diminish the time a patient has to wait for his/her results.   They engaged in a brain-storm session about potential target-molecules. They told us that nowadays human hemoglobin is mostly used to detect intestinal cancer. The presence of this substance indicates abnormalities, as normally no blood is to be expected in the intestines. The negative result of this test is very reliable. And a positive result requires follow-up research to make a distinction between intestinal cancer and other diseases like inflammatory diseases and haemorhoids.  Another substance they considered to be useful for our research is CoxII-RNA. The presence of this substance in the intestines, indicates cancer.
For the detection of inflammatory bowel diseases, they suggested the use of Calprotectin.   When we asked them if they thought our ideas were feasible, they were quite positive. Prof. van den Brink could tell us about research being performed to use bacteria for secretion of microbiological medicines in the intestines. Earlier one of these researches had been performed within their own group. Thereby they encountered one strict criteria, which was that the bacteria should be of the non-colonizing type. If the colonization of our bacteria could be restricted, than they could see great perspectives for the use of a system that interacts with a disease.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Public relations_-_-_TEXT.html," highlight congress is organized, where representatives from academia, industry and politics meet to discuss the future of biotechnology. This year, parts of the iGEM Team Bielefeld were invited to actively participate and present posters about the 2010 and 2011 projects.
The event began with the address of welcome by State Secretary Dr. Helge Braun , followed by keynote speeches of industry representatives. Afterwards it was time for a coffee break and the poster session. Last year’s Freiburg and Weimar-Heidelberg Arts team as well as this year’s Potsdam team were also there so we could team up after the poster session. The iGEM team Bielefeld was able to present a poster of our 2010 MARSS (Modulated Acetosyringone Receptor Sensor System) project and a poster of our 2011 Cellfree S-layer Based Bisphenol A Biosensor .
As the congress was in the beginning of July, we did not present any results of our 2011 project, but showed what our concept and idea is. A lot of people were interested in the concepts of Synthetic Biology, iGEM in general, ethical discussions and the shown projects. Inspired by our posters we had some interesting talks and debates with representatives from academia, industry and politics. The expert audience showed a lot of interest, often asked for more detailed information or even suggested new and different applications for our cell free biosensors. Our project raised a lot of interest, because there was a big focus on cell free systems at the conference, so we fitted in quite well. These are supposed to be one of the visionary next steps in biotechnology. Apart from cell free systems, the strategic process points out the current trends in biotechnology. These are Systems biology, Bioinformatics, Synthetic Biology and BioBricks, as well as Nanobiotechnology, especially self assembling molecules. Witpout knowing this when choosing our project, this shows that we are working on an state of the art and innovative project.
The poster session was followed by a panel discussion and workshops on the future innovations of biotechnology. During the breaks and workshops we were able to further get in contact with the other participants and promote iGEM. Additionally to the whole scientific exchange, it was realy nice to get in touch and share some experience with the other iGEM teams.
For the iGEM team Bielefeld the Strategic Process conference was another great experience, to promote our project and to get in touch with a lot of new people. This event was special, because the participants were mainly composed of an influential expert audience. Additionally we"

For the river and soil, Pantide comes from the mother nature and is biodegradable. Therefore, there is no pesticide residue problems.
For other animals, Pantide is species-specific which means it is non-toxic to benefitial insects and doesn’t damage the human body.
Market Costs and Social Costs
Not only does Pantide protect corps but is biodegradable and non-toxic to human body. We believe that this new kind of pesticide would solve the problems of food safety to cut the market costs and social costs.
Smart Detector
The device combines the microcontroller single chip, Arduino, with detection of many situations such as the number of specific pests, temperature, and humidity level.
To achieve the two-way communication between the device and the application, we use the Internet of thing (IoT talk) to connect both of them and transfer the instant information to the users anytime and anywhere.
According to information and the forecast of degradation rate, users can decide when to spray Pantide or just spray the water.

UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay
The other assay was the UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay from Promega. The Assay was used in order to test the functionality of the NodC enzyme. NodC is an N-acetylglucosamine transferase that uses UDP-GlcNAc as donor molecule. The NodC transfers N-acetylglucosamine from the UDP-GlcNAc to single N-acetylglucosamine bricks and UDP is set free. The free UDP is converted to ATP via a UDP Detection Reagent. This ATP generates light in a luciferase reaction which can be measured using a luminometer [13] .

Figure 8. Princip of the UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay. The NodC uses UDP-GlcNAc as donor molecule and transfers N-acetylglucosamine from the UDP-GlcNAc to single N-acetylglucosamine bricks and UDP. The free UDP is converted to ATP and the ATP generates light in a luciferase reaction. [13] .

Expression and Purification
The nodC gene was expressed under the control of constitutive Anderson promoter (BBa_K2380025) and by arabinose-inducible AraC promoter (BBa_K808000) in E. coli Top10. Due to the E. coli cell's own proteins it was not possible to verify the NodC protein clearly. During the overexpression of the desired protein the cell's own proteins have also more time to express. To verify the expression of the NodC enzyme a SDS-PAGE was done after the purification instead (Figure 9).
We tagged the enzyme with a His-tag and purified the NodC enzyme via an ÄKTA system . The fractions were collected and the purity was examined via a SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE shows a band at 21 kDA (Figure 9, red arrow) which fits to our protein size. The verification was done by using these fractions for a functional assay for the enzyme. The assay shows enzyme activity and therefore the successful expression.

The final active ampicillin concentration is then converted into a reproduction rate for the particular E. coli cell (figure 1 (C)).
Model II
The computed reproduction rates, 1.0532 h-1 for optimal, 0.7248 h-1 for moderate and 0.1569 h-1 for bad affinity from model I are transferred to model II , the competition model. This model simulates how E. colis with the given reproduction rates grow together in one flask.  Furthermore, to model the several successive [inoculation steps] of our project, we simulated a transfer of a determined proportion of every culture after some time, immediately followed by a new cultivation round. In the laboratory, the pipetted amount of culture is assumed to be binomially distributed. Since the assumptions for applying an approximation according to the de Moivre-Laplace theorem (Rosenkrantz 1983) are fulfilled (n, corresponding to the number of cells, being large), we use the normal distribution as an approximation to the binomial distribution. The growth behavior under several inoculations is depicted in the following movie:
Your browser can not play this video.
As a result model II creates a 3D plot that shows how long the cultivation must last and how often an inoculation must be done till the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached. For our system we want to reach a proportion of 95 % of the total culture mix. The 3D plots for our 3 test affinities can be seen below:
Figure 14: Time between inoculations.
Since the pipetting in the inoculation step follows a normal distribution and the r also fluctuates, we get slightly different results when running the program. That's why we take the time period and inoculation number at which the 95 % mark was reached for all 3D plots as reference points. For our three affinities the program predicts a minimal cultivation period of 8 hours and at least 11 inoculations.

The 50 closest related protein sequences contained in each the library were subjected to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using clustalO ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ ). with standard parameters for protein alignments. For library generation iv), each query sequence was BLASTed separately and the 50 best results of each query were combined i.e. a total of 250 sequences for the MSA.   After library generation, the following three methods were employed to design different synthetic T-domains.
1. Consensus Method
Based on the  .clustal file obtained from the MSA of the homology libraries, a consensus sequence using the UGENE software ( http://ugene.unipro.ru/ ) with a threshold of 50% was created (i.e. if an amino acid appears in 50% or more of all sequences at a specific position it is considered as a consensus amino acid). For the creation of the synthetic T-domains, this consensus sequence was used to fill the gaps where there was no consensus amino acid with the original amino acid from the indC T-domain. By this approach, T-domains were generated which might deviate from the original sequence at positions with at least average conservation but coreespond to the original one if there is less conservation.
2. Guided Random Method
In this approach, the multiple sequence alignments (MSA) generated by the consensus method was used. Implemented in R, a position-specific profile was generated which has the same length as the MSA and contains the rate at which amino acids occur at any given position of the sequence alignment. The synthetic T-domain is created by position-wise generation of the sequence where the probability of choosing an amino acid at a given position is determined by the rate in the profile.
3. Randomized Generation Method
For generation of synthetic sequences by the randomized generation method, every amino acid was assigned a score of 1 or 0, i.e. occuring at least ones or not at all at a given position in the MSA. In the subsequent generation of the synthetic T-domain sequence of the synthetic domain, any amino acid assigned 1 had the same likelihood of being chosen at this position. Seven synthetic T-domains were designed based on differnt combinations of the homology libraries and sequence generation methods.

Conclusion: PUR Esterase EstCS2 is active!
Enzyme activity of PHB depolymerase (phaz1)
It can be seen from the Western Blot results that phaz1 BBa_K1149010 was being expressed. To show that this enzyme has esterase activity, colourimetric assays were performed using the substrate analog para-Nitrophenyl butyrate. When the ester bond in this substrate is cleaved, 4-Nitrophenol is released. This is accompanied by an increase in absorbance at the wavelength 405 nm and a colour change from colourless to yellow. The concentration of 4-Nitrophenol produced could then be calculated with the Beer-Lambert Law, as the extinction coefficient of 4-NP at 405 nm is 18,000 M-1 cm-1. This experiment was performed with both the crude cell lysate and purified PHB depolymerase. Our data shows that this enzyme is definitely active.

A Mathematical model captures the essential dynamics of the system in the form of mathematical equations and helps to study and analyze the biological system before stepping into lab work. All of the chemical reactions in the system can essentially be written in the form of differential equations that capture the biological processes in the cell. These equations can then be simulated and the dynamics can be analyzed, in order to understand how a particular network is going to behave inside the cell.
The two molecular processes that are central to the functioning of a cell are transcription and translation. The cell consists of DNA, which contains all the genetic information of the cell. It contains information for synthesis of various proteins required for normal functioning of the cell. The process of transcription leads to creation of mRNA from DNA which contains the information for protein synthesis. This mRNA is then translated into protein with the help of ribosomes and tRNA.
Thus, the entire set of reactions happening inside a cell leading to the expression of a gene can be broken down into the following –
Here, the major processes occurring are as follows -
mRNA
mRNA is being produced from the plasmid DNA that has been introduced into the cell via transformation, by the process of transcription.
The mRNA produced is also being degraded, because it has a certain half life (just like radioactive elements decay, all chemicals have a half life, and so do DNA and RNA!).
Protein
Protein is produced from the mRNA transcript by the process of translation.
Protein is also degraded since it has a half life, similar to the mRNA.
What needs to be noted before we start to write a model for this is that this is a very simplistic model that makes use of several assumptions and simplifications. This is because biological systems are"

This was done to have an idea of the consumption of glucose by the different strains, measuring the growth of these bacteria at OD 600 nm.
We wanted to see if the degradation of Quercetin is enhanced or inhibited by the presence of glucose.
Surprisingly, Glucose didn’t have the effect we expected.
Pseudomonas was slower but almost unaffected in its degradation of Quercetin while, the microbes from the two soil sample were not able to degrade Quercetin!
We thought that the diauxie phenomena described by Monod, could explain these results.
It is important for us because it’s a way of understanding how the strains are using the Quercetin: is it used as a carbon source via the carbon cycle for growth of the strains or, is it used by another pathway that do not permit the growth of the microbe but is effective in the degradation of the Quercetin (for a toxic compound for instance)
The only solution we found to solubilize quercetin was putting it at pH 12, which would obviously have an impact on bacterial growth.
Thus, this prevent us of doing a kinetic experiment to see the evolution of the growth of a strain with quercetin and glucose at the same time by measuring OD600nm.
Nevertheless, we tried to make an experiment to see if there was a glucose repression with Pseudomonas when we put at the same concentration (1g/L) Glucose and Lactose.
As you can see on the graph M9+P+G+L (M9+Pseudomonas+Glucose+Lactose) there is no shift in the growth curve of Pseudomonas in presence of Glucose and Lactose.
That means there is no Glucose repression. Further reading of paper confirmed us that there is no Glucose repression for Pseudomonas putida.
We tried to find a new method to measure the growth of strains in liquid media in the presence of Quercetin by measuring absorbance at 600nm.
We tried to solubilize Quercetin in mineral oil and make an emulsion with a two phase solution: Quercetin in the oily phase, Strains in the water phase.
As you can see, when we begin to shake the emulsion, the separation in two phase is not perfect and Quercetin pass through the aqueous phase.

BBrickIt
This year, at iGEM Team ICT Mumbai, we developed an easy-to-use tool to BioBrick DNA parts. We call it BBrickIt. Based on our experience while BioBricking our parts, we found ourselves alternating between many programs as well as the task of manually adding the prefix and suffix based on several criteria as defined by the RFC10 standard. We therefore decided to develop a software that would enable a user to perform all actions required for biobricking their standards in a single interface. More information about our software can be found here . We contacted this year's iGEM teams and requested them to try out the software and provide their feedback and suggestions. Many teams filled out our survey regarding the software including Team VIT Vellore . They also tried out our software for their sequence and sent us a screenshot of the same!
Feedback from iGEM teams
Many teams asked us to make a comprehensive user manual for this software and without any delay we created one and shared with all of them. The user manual can be accessed on our software page here .
We initially uploaded a .exe file on Github, which worked only on the Windows operating system. As the MacOS is also widely used, we also uploaded a MacOS version of BBrickIt on the GitHub repository.
Reviews of BBrickIt
Numerous teams tried out our software and we got superb responses from many of them. Kalyani from iGEM UCSD commended our software saying, “Amazing Work!”
iGEM IISER Kolkata were extremely happy to “bypass the hectic job of having to think of prefix and suffix sites, scars, illegal sites etc. before planning to clone anything in the standard vectors!” They used our software with 5 genes that were part of their project, and it worked amazingly well and without any bug.
Kyle from iGEM Washington University, St. Louis said, “The tool is easy to use and well outlined.” This software would have helped them catch that they initially forgot to add the BioBrick prefix and suffix to their gene sequence!

Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html,"Ap2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

Human Practices!
Bacterial microcompartments are fundamentally an idea that many people in the general public can understand; micro-scale boxes that you can use for storage and containment. At the Second Mile High Meetup, which was attended in part by community members, and at the Andrews dorm on CU campus, a dormitory consisting primarily of non-biology majors, we presented some of our research and introduced the idea and possible applications of bacterial microcompartments.
We discussed how our system worked, how we were implementing it, introduced the idea of incorporating non-canonical amino acids into proteins, and presented our ideas on how one might use a bacterial microcompartment. People were engaged on the idea of this ‘microscopic box’ and what they might think you could use it for. The idea behind having a box that you can open and close is close to universally understood, so the concept of a micro-scale box was one many could engage with!
Mile High Meetup #2, Denver Biolabs 10/14/16
Present to the Denver biolabs team and a larger crowd of the community that supports the biolabs. Sparked great conversation for community labs and further research in the field. Our hope was to assist in education the public about the benefits and possibilities of biological research.
Andrews Hall Science Symposium, University of Colorado 10/24/16
Andrews Residence Hall annually displays the research opportunities available to students on campus and asks current students to present the research they have be doing. The final presentation of our research before the Jamboree, was given to the incoming class of engineering students at Andrews Residence Hall. Many inspired students began to show their interest in doing further research and were excited to learn about our project and the opportunities on campus."

Fig 1. Interview with Dr.Samuel Yu and Ms.Christine Chiu from HKUST
Interview with Human Practice Judge from Outside Our Institution
Fig 2. Skype interview with Prof.Tom Richard from Pennsylvania State University
To further broaden our perspective of human practice and our understanding of the purpose and impact of human practice in iGEM we also contacted a past human practice judge from outside our institution. Prof. Tom Richard has kindly agreed to have an online interview with us using Skype.
He defined human practice as understanding of non-technical parts of synthetic biology, which clearly has issues and concerns regarding the general public and involve ethical, legal and security concerns. Prof. Tom Richard emphasized that they are looking for projects that are more novel and insightful that might generate new ideas and opportunities. We asked if he thinks any specific target group may have more impact than the other groups. He said there are two kinds of target group he sees as important: people that will actually have broad impact through their position (policy makers) and individuals that will have life long impact (young generation).
During the interview he also pointed out that art and culture has very important relationship with science and technology and should be explored more. He explained that they provide different window on science and technology for both general public, who often do not understand technical definitions and also for scientists and professionals in the field, because it helps them think in different ways. We also discussed about the prospective of new track in iGEM called “Policy and Practice” and effectiveness of surveys and talks, which are the most common projects in iGEM human practice.

Elution
Carefully transfer Minicolumn to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 µL of Nuclease-Free Water to the Minicolumn. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge at 16.000 x g for 1 minute.
Discard Minicolumn and store DNA at 4 °C or -20°C.
Gibson Assembly
Modified from Gibson et al. (2009)
This assembly method is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA molecules. By coordinating the activity of a 5' exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase two adjacent DNA fragments with complementary terminal sequence overlaps can be joined into a covalently sealed molecule, without the use of any restriction endonuclease.
Preparation of DNA molecules for in vitro recombination
Generate the complenentary sequence overlaps by PCR using the Phusion DNA-polymerase. If necessary add 5 M Betain in the reaction mix by reducing the amount of H2O to decrease the number of false PCR products.
Seperate the PCR product of interest by gel electrophoresis, extract the products via Gel Extraction .
In vitro recombination
Preparing assembly mixture
320 µL 5x isothermal reaction buffer
0.64 µL of 10 U ml-1 T5 exonuclease (for DNA molecules overlapping by greater than 150 bp add 3.2 µL of 10 U mL-1 T5 exonuclease)
20 µL of 2 U mL-1 Phusion DNA polymerase
160 µL of 40 U mL-1 taq DNA ligase
add ddH2O up to a final volume of 1.2 mL
Aliquote 15 µL of the assembly mixture and store at -20 °C
That 15 µL assembly mixture on ice until use
Add 5 µL of the purified DNA molecules in equimolar amounts (between 10 and 100 ng of each fragment).
Incubate the mixture at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min with 60 min being optimal.

Suicideswitch
Fig. 5: Genetic elements of the Suicideswitch and its expected performance.
As a backup plan to make our Sporobeads even safer, we developed the Suicideswitch. In case the spores do germinate, due to degradation or destruction of their outer coats, e.g. by high pressure, the Suicideswitch will be turned on.
We take advantage of an alternative and heterologous σ factor and the target promoter. Both are not present in B. subtilis and therefore not recognized by any other σ factor of B. subtilis.
The alternative sigma factor ecf41Bli aa1-204 ( Wecke et al. 2012 ), which derives from B. licheniformis a truncated version constitutively ""ON"" is synthetically linked to one out of two σG-regulated promoters ( PspoIVB ( Steil et al. 2005 ) responding strongly or PsspK ( Steil, Völker et al. 2005 ) responding weakly). σG is the last σ factor activated in the forespore. Consequently, Ecf41Bli aa1-204 is produced quite late and only in the forespore. Ecf41Bli aa1-204 then activates its unique target promoter PydfG ( Wecke, Mascher 2012 ). This promoter is fused to MazF ( Engelberg-Kulka, Amitai 2005 ). Activation of PydfG therefore leads to the expression of MazF, a bacterial toxin from E.coli degrading"

The only change to the protocol is that 8 microlitres of ach of the prepared samples were placed into the wells. This is because the pSB1A3 plasmid is a high copy plasmid so the concentration of DNA will be high. Apart from that, the protocol was adhered to.
The results from the gel can be seen in the 'Results' section below.
Midi Preps
Mathew adding other Midi-Prep solutions to the transformed E.coli cells
The cell lysate floats at the top of the syringe barrel - eventually all of the clear solution below it will be transferred into the binding column
When looking at the mini-prep restriction enzyme digests on the gel, it was noted that although the bandwidths seen weren't what was expected the bands that did form were consistent for all three cultures. This could be down to a number of factors - the most likely factor, in these circumstances, are the restriction enzymes (see below in 'Results' section). Because of the consistency of the samples in the gel, both digested and undigested, it was decided that the Metal Sensor team prepare midi-preps of the pSB1A3 plasmid.
The protocol used was SigmaAldrich's MidiPrep protocol . The Spin Method (i.e. using a centrifuge to move solutions through the column) was the preferred route in this protocol and all the steps involved in this procedure were carried out, up until step 11b. The DNA was then stored in the freezer for use tomorrow.
While the Metal Sensor team had prepared three overnight cultures to be used in the midiprep today (the three cultures derived from three colonies of E. coli all containing pSB1A3 and BBa_J33206) only one of these colonies was taken forward for midipreps. It was decided that the overnight culture grown from colony 1 would be used for midipreps - this was because of the clarity"

Uptake
Short Summary
Uptake of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates is of major importance for the development of a semisynthetic organism. The nucleotide transporter PtNTT2 from the algae Phaeodactylum tricornutum was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and comprehensively characterized. We designed and tested five different variants of the transporter and we demonstrated that certain variants of the transporter can facilitate uptake of iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP from the media.
Computational Analysis of PtNTT2
Zhang et al. used an N-terminal truncated version of PtNTT2, lacking the first 65 amino acids, since they observed some kind of toxicity resulting from the native N-terminal sequence (Zhang et al., 2017). For our project, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of PtNTT2 using the prediction software Phobius (Käll et al., 2007). Using Phobius, we analyzed the signal peptide and the transmembrane topology of PtNTT2. The analysis revealed that the native"
NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," and surface display of proteins of interest we decided that our control plasmid should involve the same parts. We built a plasmid nearly identical to the
antibody plasmid in our system but substituted a yeast-optimized eCFP biobrick for the antibody gene.
At the outset of this system we observe the eCFP protein localized into the nucleus. Upon addition of galactose Cre recombinase linked to a nuclear localization sequence should be transcribed off of the Gal promoter, translated in the cytoplasm and then imported into the nucleus of the cell. There it recombines the plasmid between the two loxP sites. This brings the eCFP into a fusion with the secretion tag rather than the nuclear localization tag, so we should observe an eventual exclusion of CFP from the nucleus and secretion from the cell.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(21), 8429-8434.
In order to understand our system and analysis, some basic knowledge for Turing pattern is needed. We’d like to introduce some mathematical basics of Turing Pattern to make it easier to understand our project.
1.Stability
The idea of “stability” is so important in our modeling.Consider conditions of  $ \frac{du}{dt} = f(u, v), f(u_0, v_0)=0\\   \frac{dv}{dt} = g(u, v), g(u_0, v_0)=0 $  where u is the concentration of activator, v is of inhibitor. So both u and v are functions of time(t) and location.
Suppose $(u, v) = (u_0, v_0)$ and a fluctuation then occurs to the point.  Let $(u_0 + u_s, v_0 + v_s)$ be the point after the fluctuation occurred.   Here we can write the differential equations as     $ \frac{du_s}{dt} = f(u_0 + u_s, v_0 + v_s) \\    \frac{dv_s}{dt} = g(u_0 + u_s, v_0 + v_s) $
Given $u_s$, $v_s$ are small, we can expand $f$,$g$ around $(u_0, v_0)$ excluding the terms whose degree is over one.
That is     $ \frac{du_s}{dt} = f(u_0 + u_s, v_0 + v_s) = f_uu_s + f_vv_s\\  \frac{dv_s}{dt} = g(u_0 + u_s, v_0 + v_s) = g_uu_s + g_vv_s $  where $ f_u = f_u(u_0, v_0),\\  f_v = f_v(u_0, v_0)\\  g_u = g_u(u_0, v_0),\\  g_v = g_v(u_0, v_0) $     ("

Backend Part
Django
Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern.
Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code, it emphasizes reusability and ""pluggability"" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. It also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface, which is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
Python 3
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. It is cross-platform and it interpreters are available for many operating systems.
Nginx
Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer.
Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.
Standford CoreNLP
CoreNLP is a program of natural language processing, it provides a set of human language technology tools. It can give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc.
It makes it very easy to apply a bunch of linguistic analysis tools to a piece of text. A tool pipeline can be run on a piece of plain text with just two lines of code. CoreNLP is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. With a single option, you can change which tools should be enabled and"

The transformation efficiency of the electroportation was significant higher than of the chemical competent cells. Therefore, an own stock of electric competent cells was made.
Agar plug assay
TR235 (E. coli with construct to detect adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces) arrived from Princeton (Thomas J. Silhavy). Cells are viable, growth curve done. 11µm PS beads shown to be moved by bacteria (MG1655); we observed ‘jiggling’ of beads when bacteria present (not seen in no-bacteria control). Also, we observed significant movement in different directions (distances of approx 1x to 5x length of the beads by eye) of beads that were close together, suggesting that movement was not due to currents in the medium. We saw no distance covered in almost all the control beads, a few moved small distances, so some currents are present. Bacteria and beads were left together for ~30mins to allow time for adhesion. No movement has yet been seen when the bacteria and beads are not left to adhere. We will look again at this, as we may have not previously looked closely enough (photographing over a time course of a few minutes).

Circles represent position at 0 mins, one colour for each bead. For example, the bead that starts in red circle    moves down and right, while that in the yellow circle moves left.
Chemotaxis assay (Yu, H.S. et al. (1997) FEMS Microbiology Letters, 156, 265-269.) has not worked so far. Currents can be seen flowing from the aspartate plug, pushing bacteria away. The focus of this week will be on getting this fixed, with a view to combining chemotaxis and the ability to move beads, allowing us to move beads in a particular direction.
The GRN for switching on the chemotactic response by binding to a bead, and signaling to nearby bacteria that a particle is in the vicinity, is almost finalised.

She has majored in several different subjects such as physical, biology, business etc. Her interdisciplinary background makes her an excellent candidate to be interviewed for this project which involves physics, bioinformatics, synthetic biology and art. She introduced us mechanistic principles of plasma on its medical use and shared us with her insights on plasma applications. After discussion with her, we all deeply believe that plasma is a promising tool to solve many medical problems in the future.
Besides, we shared our experience of taking part in iGEM, as well as our views on synthetic biology and interdisciplinary studies with these experts. On the last day, we went out for a barbecue and had a great fun together.
Meet ups
(In July and August)
We met up with several iGEM teams, exchanged project ideas, discussed problems encountered in the experiments as well as collaboration possibilities. Through these discussions, we got lots of suggestions on our experiments and human practice. Besides, we took part in the 5th CCIC in Shanghai and 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM meet up in Taiwan. As a team that for the first time participates in iGEM competition, taking part in these events is extremely useful as we could learn a lot from other teams. Also, it provides a great platform to find potential collaborators and make friends, which is really exciting and beneficial.
We also initiated several private meet ups with some iGEM teams , including XJTLU-China, NUS-Singapore-A and ZJU-China. We visited their labs, identified their problems and offered several suggestions to help them improve their projects. Also, they provided some pertinent suggestions to our project as well."

Choise of chassis
""In iGEM, and synthetic biology in general, the microorganism that is being worked with is referred to as the cellular chassis (shăs'ē, chăs'ē). For most iGEM teams, the chassis will be E. coli, but you are not limited to working with E. coli in iGEM. Some of the past chassis have been Bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus, yeast, and even some mammalian cells.
So, why does it matter that different chassis are used, anyway? Well, beyond their different growth requirements and quirks about competency (the ability of an organism to take up DNA), different chassis have different innate abilities. These innate abilities may make the chassis more worthwhile to work with than another microbe, e.g., E. coli. Because while E. coli is the best researched microbe, it may simply not have a trait you need for your project."" - http://umassigem.blogspot.com/2009/02/concepts-cellular-chassis.html”

Ciprofloxacin resistance cassette in BBa_K823023
To design a ciprofloxacin resistance cassette we designed a gBlock that contains the Bacillus subtilis promoter PAtpI, which is active from a very early stage of germination and includes a ribosome binding site. The gBlock also contains the original qnrS1 gene sequence from E. coli. qnr genes code for pentapeptide repeat proteins. These proteins reduce susceptibility to quinolones by protecting the complex of DNA and DNA gyrase enzyme from the inhibitory effect of quinolones. Finally, this gBlock contains a double terminator BBa_B0015 from iGEM as well as the prefix and suffix for BioBricks. In summary the ciprofloxacin cassette consists of the following parts PAtpI+RBS+qnrS1+2TER. BBa_K823023 is an available BioBrick from igem Munich 2012. It is an   integration plasmid for Bacillus subtilis, which can be used for   cloning in E. coli as well. An RFP is inserted in BBa_K823023 for more   efficient screening after transformation. Construction of ciprofloxacin resistance cassette in BBa_K823023 integration plasmid was performed as described in the following.
PCR
Experiment:
The sequence of the qnrS1 gene was amplified from the gBlock qnrS1 E. coli ordered from IDT. Primers used for the    amplification were F-qnrs1 E.coli and R-qnrs1 E.coli/ (primer sequences can be found here ).

iGEM is a great opportunity for international cooperation between scientific communities.  With politics taking up major air-time in the media, iGEM provides an ideal platform for breaking down prejudices by encouraging teams to work together toward the advancement of science.  We collaborated with the Paris Bettencourt iGEM team by contributing to their newsletter. As part of the newsletter we gave feedback to most of the teams who participated, regarding questions they had. We hope our feedback was helpful to many teams. We contributed to the Bettencourt team by participating in their ""Human Microbe"" project. They also helped us deal with wiki templates.

For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the escape happened accidentally or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, thet are both high and tunable in the fermenter, so our device will initiate when temperature and density are both low. We used thermal sensitive regulator (NUS iGEM2017)(Piraner et al.) and quorum sensing regulator (MIT iGEM2004) (Canton et al.)as our sensor, with sRNA(Storz et al.) and tetR family repressor PhlF(Glasgow iGEM2015)(Stanton et al.) as the signal inverter. We added an integrase (Peking iGEM2017) controlled by the thermal sensitive regulator which will enable the promoter of a lethal gene to potentially express when temperature rise in the fermenter so that bacteria can survive at the very beginning. Also, we built a model to stimulate the minimum autoinducer required at the beginning of the fermentation, same as the purpose of integrase. This model is for keeping bacteria alive at the very beginning of fermentation. Together they form a NOR gate that will lead to cell death through genome degradation when both temperature and density decrease.
For Therapy
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria. The device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle(Shapiro et al.), release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermosensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
For Metabolic Stress
We applied capacity monitor (Ceroni et al.) to quantify the expression burden of all our systems, and to reduce the metabolic stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking iGEM2011) and cold-regulated 5’UTR region (Ionis Paris 2017). This device only involves one transcriptional regulator, which will be less energy consuming.

Intro: Today I created glycerol stocks of Yeates' cage cells.
The stocks were created at 10:00 am, after letting the cells incubate in 5 mL LB overnight. Given the length of the incubation time, it is possible that the cells grew past the log phase. Three cryo tubes were each filled with 0.5 mL of iGEM 50% glycerol stock (sterile filtered 4.23.15 by VCL). Then 0.5 mL of bacterial culture was pipetted into each tube. After vortexing to mix, the tubes were labeled and stored in David's section of the -80C freezer in Sri's lab. They were placed in the upper right quadrant of the box with all three vials in a row. The remaining cell solution was bleached and disposed.

Greek European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Alumni Meet-up - Dilofo, Greece
The EMBL Alumni Relations program, that includes meetups all over Europe is built to advance EMBL and the relevance of life science research in the scientific community and society at large, by fostering connections between the Laboratory, its member states, current EMBL staff, the EMBL alumni and the public. After contacting the EMBL Alumni in Greece and informing them about our team, iGEM Competition and our project, they kindly invited us to their meetup to present our work. PIs and researchers from all over Greece were participating, coming from multiple backgrounds such as Medicine, Molecular Biology and Structural Biology. It was a mind-opening experience for us, since the attendees seemed not only thrilled with our idea and our experimental output, but also more than willing to give us advice and share their insights. Being surrounded by people with remarkable research experience and scientific boldness, we felt very welcome and lucky. The conversations we had after the end of the presentation were invaluable to us, since we talked about our project, its future potential and societal impact. Their enthusiasm is something we cherish and their advice and support was essential, as it showed us that we were on the right track, with quite a few possible ways to move forward.

Ariana was offered a place at Birkbeck in 2011. At this time, higher education reforms took over with tuition fees tripling and the removal of part-time education grants. She feels privileged to have gone to such a distinctive institute at the heart of London and owes her great academic experience to Birkbeck.
Ariana graduated this year from Birkbeck, University of London with a BSc in Biological Sciences. Her final year project was on investigating protein nano cages, and throughout the years had research internships on protein crystallography, tissue engineering and bioinformatics. After iGEM Ariana is starting a PhD in Interdisciplinary Biosciences at UCL.

Thanks to being able to B. xylophilus.
In Japan,a new strain of pines resistant to B. xylophilus, attempts are being made to select strains of pine that show natural resistance to B. xylophilus and mate them.
However, this method has several problems and has not been put to practical use [1].
1. The pines are not 100% resistant simply because they show improved resistance to B. xylophilus.
2. In the case of gardens and sightseeing spots, characteristics of the strains such as branching should be emphasized, but such considerations are limited using this method.
3. Under stress, B. xylophilus itself may evolve to become pathogenic to currently resistant pines.
These problems could be solved by making recombinant RNAi pine trees expressing dsRNA.
Figure 1 RNAi pines will solve the problem of pine-wilt disease.
However,
1. It takes at least B. xylophilus by injecting them into the trunk.
2. It is not yetB. xylophilus.
3. There is currently

the same order Tylenchida as B. xylophilus, escaped from the parasitism of M. incognita by making the plant express dsRNA [2],[3]. That is to say, the application of B. x. B may not be limited to feeding RNAi to B. xylophilus.
15% of all nematodes are plant parasitic nematodes which have stylet similar to B. xylophilus [4]. These nematodes have caused enormous damage to important crop plants including potatoes, eggplants, rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and carrots, resulting in an estimated annual loss of $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide [5]. Therefore, urgent measures are required. RNAi expression in plants"

Parameter estimation
After using a bibliographic approach (see bibliography based estimation) to                     find the parameter values of the subsystem sgRNA, we ended up in the                     following uncertain parameters:
Binding and unbinding rates of Rhamnose with RhaS.
Binding and unbinding rates of Rhamnose:RhaS complex with Pbad                             promoter.
Degradation rate of RhaS
We applied sensitivity analysis for these parameters, using the same rate                     ranges as dcas9 subsystem and the degradation variation is 0.001 to 1. The                     results are shown in Figure 5 where you can see that the most influential                     parameter is clearly the binding rate to Pbad promoter.
Figure 5: Sensitivity analysis on uncertain model parameters. Sample                         from each parameter: 20.000. Parameter sets: 120.000.
Binding and unbinding rates of RhaS to Rhamnose do not have any effect at                     all and we assume this is due to the very big concentration of Rhamnose in                     the system. (set to "

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Design features
This vector backbone was designed as a modular integrative vector for S. cerevisiae. In this section, the main design features for vector engineering and for the genome integration of the vector are reported.
Vector engineering features:
The cloning site is not the same as other RFC10 compatible vectors. It contains a RFC10 BioBrick Prefix (<partinfo>BBa_G00000</partinfo>) and a SpeI restriction site instead of the original BioBrick Suffix. However, the presence of unique EcoRI and SpeI sites in the cloning site fully supports the assembly of the desired BioBrick parts in the cloning site upon EcoRI-SpeI digestion. This design feature has been forced by the presence of illegal XbaI and PstI sites in the TEF promoter in the LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette (<partinfo>BBa_K300989</partinfo>). This vector does not support the 3A Assembly.
The two NheI sites and the two AvrII sites flanking the default HR integration sequences <partinfo>BBa_K300986</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300987</partinfo> enable the engineering of this backbone by assembling new user-defined BioBrick integration sequences upon XbaI-SpeI digestion.
This vector can be propagated in E. coli at high copy thanks to the pMB1 replication origin and the Ampicillin resistance marker present in <partinfo>pSB1A2</partinfo> (=<partinfo>BBa_K300988</partinfo>), that is one of the standard parts that compose this integrative vector.
Standard verification primer binding sites VF2 (<partinfo>BBa_G00100</partinfo>) and VR (<partinfo>BBa_G00102</partinfo>) are present in the <partinfo>pSB1A2</partinfo> (=<partinfo>BBa_K300988</partinfo>) backbone. They can be used to verify the vector length and sequence comprised between the two integration sites.
Genome integration features:
The LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette (<partinfo>BBa_K300989</partinfo>) enables the selection of positive yeast integrants on YPD agar plates supplemented with 200 ug/ml of G418 geneticin. Once integrated, this cassette can be excised upon Cre recombinase activity. This allows to perform multiple integrations in the same strain, always using the same dominant G418 resistance marker.

Lysis Module
Our team designed but was unable to test this module due to the limitation of not being able to work directly with Streptococcus       Pneumoniae (Biosafety level 2) in our lab. This module proposes to kill Streptococcus Pneumoniae upon detection when coupled       with the detection and regulation modules by releasing specific bacteriophage lytic enzymes, Cpl-1 and Pal.
Amidase (PAL)- cleaves the peptidoglycan between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine
Lysozyme (CPl-1)- cleaves the glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
Fig ? . The lysis Module.
The enzymes are tagged with osmY (Washington 2012) via a linker to be exported out of Escherichia coli. Both enzymes have       very different N-terminal catalytic sites and share a similar C-terminal cell wall attachment site, which binds to choline in both cases.       Cleavage with either of these enzymes results in a weakening in the cell wall, which leads to the externalization of the cytoplasmic       membrane and ultimate lysis of S. pneumoniae.

BBa_K764022 Hyaluronan synthase
Encodes hyaluronan synthase (hasA) that performs the following two reactions:
UDP-α-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + β-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-(nascent hyaluronan) = UDP + N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-β-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-(nascent hyaluronan)
UDP-α-D-glucuronate + N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-β-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-(nascent hyaluronan) = UDP + β-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-β-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-(nascent hyaluronan).
This generates hyaluronan, a virulence factor in streptococcus pyogenes if linked to lipid A molecules in the cell wall. Hyaluronan is also present in human joints and skin as a lubricant.
This gene was synthesised by reverse translating the amino acid sequence by codon-optimisation (Accession Number: L20853).

We wanted to keep cuvettes as containers because they are cheap and easily available. Also our design needed the following changes
No magnetic stirring
No manually controlled potentiometer
Data logging on µSD-card
New concepts
We could demonstrate that aeriation via common disposable syringes and needles was possible and sufficient to homogenize a S. cerevisiae culture at a tolarable amount of foaming.
In addition, we managed to replace the potentiometer by a set of low-pass filters combined with the 8bit PMW output-pins of the Arduino. This cut down the cost for the potentiometer and enabled us to use an automatic calibration routine to find the level of saturation for the photodiode.
We designed our own measuring cell. Compared to Martin's version it has a simpler locking mechanism to hold LEDs and photodiodes in place. It is also much smaler, takes three cuvettes and has connectors for aeration.
After debugging our circuit on breadboards, we designed printed circuit boards. Ten boards only cost US$ 10, plus shipping.

iGEM 2016 is over. We have received both, positive feedback about our creation and many suggestions on how to improve it. We created this prototype with the purpose to share it with hackerspaces, high schools and other iGEM teams world wide. Therefore, we have decided to move the project to github now to have a transparent platform for developments. The  files for the robot we brought to Boston are still linked above as a documentation.
If you want to build your own or contribute, please wait until the our github page is up and running or contact bensc[ot]dtu,dk.

Here is our journey in iGEM
Nov/2012
SUSTC-Shenzhen B had its new recruitment. About 70 freshmen readily started their iGEM journey.
winter holiday
During the winter holiday, we are separated in several groups to prepare for the Journal Club. When back to school in March, each group were supposed to give a presentation of what they had learned during the winter holiday every Monday and Thursday. In this way, we cooperated to learn basic knowledge of synthetic biology.
Mar/2013
We had our first brainstorm, the organizer asked us to come up with fantastic ideas no matter if they are practical. At that time, we hardly knew anything about synthetic biology, but it did not bother us to have bats in the belfry.
Mar/2013
We moved from Journal Club to Project Review. Each of us picked one iGem project in which he/she was interested and went over it in spare time. Still in Monday and Thursday, 6 students every time, we talked about the projects we chose and shared them. During this time, some students left us with various reasons, which is quite a pity.
Mar/2013
We were divided into dry lab and wet lab.
04.04.10
We had our second brainstorm. At that time we had the basic synthetic biology knowledge and our ideas were much more practical.
04/10/2013
We had our second brainstorm. At that time we had the basic synthetic biology knowledge and our ideas were much more practical.
17/04/2013
Our team had the first meeting. We classified the past software projects and discussed what we were going to do this year. These projects inspired us a lot and this meeting lasted for more than 4 hours with logical genetic designer (LGD) as the primary choice.
14/07/2013

iGEM Competition
iGEM began in January of the year 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during the Independent Activities Period (IAP). Students designed biological systems to make cells blink. The course grew into a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition spread internationally - 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, 84 teams in 2008, 112 teams in 2009, 130 teams in 2010, and 165 teams in 2011. Designs range from a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, to banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, arsenic biosensors, Bactoblood, buoyant bacteria, etc.
October 2014
The search for a new KU Leuven team has started. Ex-iGEM’mers introduced the iGEM competition showing a movie in auditoria, spreading flyers and posters.
November 2014
The ex-iGEM’mers and advisers organised information sessions on the 4th, 5th, 13th and 20th of November at different faculties. Candidates could apply until the 23rd of November by sending their CVs and motivation letters.
December 2014
The interviews took place on the 10th and 11th of December and the ‘lucky 13’ team was formed. The first get-to-know-each-other meeting was organized on the 19th of December.
January 2015
‘Exams, Exams, Exams’. January was a quiet month for iGEM but we had a lovely team and a crazy summer to look forward to.
February 2015
Unleashing the bundled enthusiasm during our first brainstorm session on the 11th of February generated seventeen primary ideas for an unforgettable project. Eventually, we chose eight topics for further investigation.
March 2015
Researching and discussing the eight chosen ideas enabled us to select three top notch projects. After a deeper insight and with the hints from the advisers in our heads, the final topic was chosen. On the 31st of March, all our excitement converged into that one idea: Pattern Formation.
April 2015
On the 21st of April, we shared our topic with the advisers"

Concept
A promoter PyeaR can be activated when it senses the nitrate and nitrite (Lin, et al., 2007). The BBCS-Bristol 2010 iGEM team constructed the biobrick K381001, which is composed of a PyeaR promoter, a strong RBS B0030         and a reporter gene GFP. It can emit green fluorescence when detecting nitrate so that it can also be served as a nitrate sensor.
PyeaR is repressed by NsrR protein under no nitrate or nitric oxide condition, and is activated when nitrate or nitrite is existing. In theory, the biobrick K381001 can’t emit fluorescence under no nitrate or nitrite. However, the data         showed that it could still be activated. In order to improve the biobrick K381001, we decided to add an additional nsrR binding sequence to it so as to reinforce repression and decrease interference. As a result, fluorescence basal level         can be decreased. And detection will be enhanced.
Functional test
By adding an nsrR binding sequence to K381001, we successfully decreased the fluorescence basal level. That is to say, under no nitrate induction, we can get lower fluorescence and maintain detection ability to do more accurate nitrate         detection without interference by other factors.
Figure 1. Comparing with original PyeaR-GFP, our new biobricks can lower the fluorescence basal level because the fluorescence is lower under no nitrate induction after different culture time. And the function of PyeaR-RBS-NsrR-GFP             is better of the two new biobricks because it lowered much more fluorescence.
Figure 2. Our two new PyeaR-GFP were induced 12 hours in different nitrate concentration, and showed that they still sustained the ability to detect nitrate.

Collaboration with team Aachen
While we were working on our project, we had connected with several other iGEM teams. We  worked really well with a student team from Aachen, Germany. They had a similar topic as us, so  collaboration was easier due to common ground. Firstly, we had a few conference calls with them  and after exchanging our experience with already conducted research and preparations for iGEM, we  worked on possible ways to solve the problems we all pointed out. Furthermore we discussed other  ways of collaboration.  We helped them with their Human Practises by filling out their questionnaire  on lab organisation and also conducted several tests for them.
They were investigating the degree of GMO pollution in the laboratories we worked in, which is  indeed a valuable problem to explore. When dealing with something with such power to transform  the world as synthetic biology has, safety is very important, both in the outside world when we try to  apply our ideas to everyday lives and in the lab as well. GMO pollution in the lab is an important  question because it concerns our safety and the safety of other people we interact with, so we were  glad to be able to participate in their study.
We conducted several swab tests on different surfaces with agar chips by placing 3 on each selected  surface for 5 seconds and then placed them in petri dishes.  They were incubated at 37°C and after  24 hours we received the following results:
The agar chips were maid according to the protocol they have sent us:
•prepare 250 ml of LB medium with 2% Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast  extract, 5 g Agar),
•sterilize the black chip-mould by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol,
•fill the mould with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes,
•use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings,
•move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula,
•store at 4 °C.

Assay Preparation
Take 3 independent colonies from each plate of your controls and samples and place each colony into 5 ml of LB with the appropriate antibiotics.
Leave to grow overnight at 30°C.
Take 50 μl of each overnight and inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB containing the appropriate antibiotics. Do this twice for every independent colony.
Allow these to grow at 30°C shaker until the O.D of each inoculate is between 0.3-0.5
Once the O.D is between 0.3-0.5 take 3 x 1 ml samples of each culture and place into separate Eppendorf tubes.
Take a further 1 ml and place into a cuvette and  subsequently measure the OD600 marking down the OD for each replica.
Spin down the 1 ml cultures of each replica at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes.
Remove the supernatant from each 1 ml culture and freeze cell pellet for later use in the β-galactosidase Assay.

Discourse:""A specific ensemble of ideas, concepts, and categorisations that are produced, reproduced, and transformed in a particular set of practices and through which meaning is given to physical and social realities"" (Hajer 2000: 44)
Dual-use technology: Technologies which can be used for more than one goal, usually having both civilian or peaceful purpose and military aims. They imply a dilemma ""because it is difficult to prevent their misuse without forgoing beneficial applications. [...] [M]any of the emerging technologies with the potential to do the most good are also capable of the greatest harm"" (Tucker 2012 :1).
Ecological modernisation: Optimistic theory ""that aims to harness the power of human ingenuity for the purposes of harmonising economic advancement with environmental improvement"" (Cohen 1997:108; Huber 1985; Jänicke 1985; Simonis 1988).
Ethnography: The study of people's actions in everyday contexts, which means that the research takes place in the field. Data collection usually occurs unstructured through participant observation or through informal conversations. The researcher focusses on a small group of people to facalitate in-depth study. The subsequent analysis of the data ""involves interpretation of meanings, functions, and consequences of human actions and institutional practices, and how these are implicated in local, and perhaps also wider, contexts. What are produced, for the most part, are verbal descriptions, explanations and theories; quantification and statistical analysis play a subordinate role at most"" (Atkinson and Hammersley 2007: 3)
External accountability:(for synthetic biology) Accountability to the people outside the community of practising synthetic biologists, whose lives are affected by the implications of the technology. As a social actor, this community provides external accountability by acknowledging that there are concerns from others with regard to their actions within their scientific discipline. Internal accountability, on the other hand, refers to already existing chains of command within an institution (Zhang et al. 2011).
Governance: Refers, in its broadest sense, to the various ways and processes in which social life is coordinated. Therefore, alongside markets, networks and hierarchies, conventional governments are one of the modes in which institutions can be involved in governance, meaning that many heterogeneous actors are involved. Hence, the distinction between state and society has blurred so that new ways of governing are introduced, whether is be beyond the territoriality of the nation-state, or networks between government and other entities,"
