Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Minimal Arc Gag
We attempted to characterize our purified Arc-min protein with the use of sedimentation velocity data gathered through analytical ultracentrifugation. We prepared samples from both Arc-min and Arc-full, but were only able to observe any sedimentation from Arc-min. This suggests that there were insufficient amounts of Arc-full protein to run on AUC. The data that we observed for Arc-min indicate that the protein monomers aggregated which can be observed in the aggregation boundary in Figure 10 ( top left, absorbance; top right, relative intensity).(Refer to our Experiments page for more details on AUC.)
Figure 10. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation results and simulations. (top left) Converted relative light intensity sedimentation rates into absorbance to compare to simulations. (top right) AUC sedimentation rates of Arc-min (top-right) measured in intensity of light at 217 nm and spun at 30,000 rpm. (bottom left) Modelled expected sedimentation rates of an Arc-min monomer and (bottom right) hexamer. Simulated data is based on estimated molar masses and globular anisotropies, using identical experimental conditions used in the actual experiment.

Purification of P22 and SP-Cas9
Figure 11. Nickel Affinity Chromatography Purification of SPCas9 using a gravity flow column shown on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein ladder is the 10-240kDa prestained ladder from Biobasic. The protein can be seen at the 245kDa mark. Lanes right to left show the stages of purification from Cell pellet, Lysate, supernatant flow through, column washes, elutions and the regeneration of the column.
The Purification of SPCas9 using nickel affinity chromatography was successful in terms of isolating the protein.  Although yield is low compared to the levels of protein seen in the wash samples and lysate, protein was isolated. Further purification of smaller proteins was done by using a centrifugation spin column with a molecular weight cutoff filter of 50kDa. Loss of yield is likely due to overloading the column with supernatant and not"

Assembling and testing the 14 recombination sites
We have successfully cloned the Rox ( BBa_K2406000 ), Vox ( BBa_K2406001 ), VLox ( BBa_K2406002 ), and SLox ( BBa_K2406003 ) in to pSB1C3 biobrick for use. Their functionality is demonstrated in the measurement constructs, described above.
We have also cloned ten additional target sites that can be recognized by the Cre recombinase. They are called Lox511 ( BBa_K2406008 ), Lox2272 ( BBa_K2406009 ), Lox5171 ( BBa_K2406010 ), LoxN ( BBa_K2406011 ), M2 ( BBa_K2406012 ), M3 ( BBa_K2406013 ), M7 ( BBa_K2406014 ), M11 ( BBa_K2406015 ), Nuoya ( BBa_K2406016 ), and Zsoka ( BBa_K2406017 ). They are all proved to be functional by in vitro assay using cell lysate containing Cre recombinase.
In vitro recombination assay using cell lysate containing Cre recombinase. In the experiment, linear oligo containing a complete target site and miniprep containing the identical target site are mixed together with cell lysate (+) or water (-).  In the lanes with cell lysate (+), a smear can be seen, indicating that recombination occurred between miniprep to form concatamer. However, one can also see a brighter band within the smear, indicating that recombination has occurred between the linear oligo and the circular plasmid, thus linearizing the plasmid.
Quantitative measurement of recombinase activity
We have co-transformed both of our T7-LacO-recombinase generator and our measurement construct into E. coli BL21 (DE3). These strains are then incubated with or without IPTG, on either LB plate over 48 hours, or in LB media in plate reader. We have thoroughly characterized the recombination efficiency of the five recombinases, and determined what combinations are the most orthogonal pairs for future applications. To access all of the raw data for the measurements we carried out, and the basic statistical parameters we calculated, e.g. standard error, download the Excel file below.

Kill Switch
Background
Principle
Background
To ensure that our bacteria do no harm to both people and environment, we need to put a set of kill-switch system into the bacteria, so that we can control the growth of them by changing the contents of culture medium.
In our project, we trigger the kill switch of E.coli by adding IPTG into the culture. IPTG can induce the expression of gene coding Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) downstream the lactose operator, so that the growth of E.coli will be inhibited.
Principle
Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) binds LPS on anti-gram negative bacterial surface tightly, forming a biofilm. This can prevent nutrient from entering the cell, causing the growth inhibition. Also, the biofilm can prevent plasmid spreading to the environment and gene pollution.
Besides, to make LALF cross the cell membrane and bind to LPS, we still need  an efficient protein export signal sequence of E. coli to lead LALF into extracelluar environment.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

The world is changing.   Except this, we were also invited to Shanghai Shixi High School, a famous high school to deliver a lecture named Synthesis + Biology = Synthetic Biology to expand their view. University: iGEM club During our summer vacation, we attended a sharing meeting with BIOS (Biology Intensive Orientation Summer) students who were learning basic biological technique to discuss our project and absorb positive opinion to polish our STEP system. Despite their relatively poor experience in research, but their fancy thoughts did inspire us and make our project more charming.
In Fudan University, iGEM exists as a club. In this semester’s giant meeting of all clubs, iGEM has attracted much attention from students of all majors and some showed great interest in iGEM. Through our introduction, they had a deeper understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology and got deeply fascinated by the idea. It’s predictable that next year, there will be more students fond of synthetic biology taking part in iGEM to share the fun.
3. STEP into Art
Are you attracted by our mascot on the poster? It’s a set of ""Tuanzi""（团子）！Really cute , aren’t they? Each represents one of our team member and instructor. Pipette, protein, E.coli, culture medium, camera, computer engineering… As part of our team culture, Tuanzi are our little bonus, for us and for other iGEMers. They were printed on sweaters and key rings, delivered to friends, instructors and others who gave us a hand during our preparation. Also we will bring them to Giant Jamboree. Thanks to them, more and more people come to know our team, realizing that iGEM involves more than wet-lab students. No matter what you are responsible for- human practice, modeling, art design and so on- we wish to express gratitude to every member’s effort in iGEM.
As a cutting-edge therapy, cellular immunology is really a hot spot. Mostly people only know it by the media, but hardly understand how it works. To make the public get acquaintance with the STEP system and how it comes to our mind, an animated video was created. Producing a video helps us reflect on the whole project design as well as plays an educational role.

Conclusion
Future interlab studies should make use of cell-free
Our mini-interlab experiment indicated that cell-free systems can be considered reliable when optimized and could give reproducible results upon following standardized protocols. However, we would propose that more teams participate in this experiment as it is in the case of iGEM-interlab. This would confirm the efficiency of cell-free expression system and the technical variability when executed via various teams with good reproducibility.
Collaboration with iGEM Tübingen 2018 team
In order to test deimmunization tool BERT in the context of a meaningful application, > iGEM Tübingen 2018 team < collaborated with us. Their project focused on the usage of antimicrobial peptides fused together with self-assembling scaffolding proteins as a potential alternative to classical antibiotic treatment.
Dissecting Science
As a pilot team we were honored to collaborate with Marc Santolini in his project “Dissecting Science”. In this project, he aims to study the making and the learning of Science in situ by using the iGEM scientific competition as a model. iGEM presents a unique opportunity to bring together groups of scientific thinkers in a competitive, collaborative, and scientifically rich way. The participating teams share their project and their lab book in open wiki websites.
The study of these wikis has allowed to pinpoint the role of student interactions in the success of teams. Yet, the dynamic nature of these interactions in the lab has remained elusive. How do students collaborate? How are subgroups formed? What is the frequency of interactions with mentors/PIs? How do these interactions lead to better learning (skill spreading), productivity (BioBricks/project size), creativity (project uniqueness) and success in the competition (medals and prizes)? To answer these questions, his team investigated for the first time the interactions in the lab for the our team as a pilot, with the end goal to reach out to a large number of teams. Such interaction was mapped by: 1) using MIT Rhythm badges in collaboration with Oren Lederman and Jordan Reedie from MIT Media Lab; 2) analysis of team interaction through the Gmail, Slack and self-report survey.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria can enter a host orally during ingestion of contaminated food or water and cause a disease called salmonellosis.   This results in the inflammation of the small and large intestines, which is manifested in symptoms of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a fever.  Salmonellosis will normally subside in four to seven days on its own, but antibiotics can be taken to help destroy the bacteria in the digestive tract.
Once ingested the Salmonella colonize the intestinal epithelium.  It enters enterocytes, M cells, and dendritic cells.  If the Salmonella reach the submucosa then they can internalize in macrophages, which become their hosts.  Salmonella can live in many different types of host cells and this improves its survival.  The bacteria invade cells using the type III secretion system Spi1. This is a highly specific process that relies on the expression of several bacterial factors.  Effector proteins rearrange the actin cytoskeleton causing ruffles in the cell membrane allowing the Salmonella to be internalized.  In addition, adhesins on the surface of Salmonella assist in attachment and internalization.  Once internalized, the Salmonella replicate in the modified phagosome utilizing a second type three secretion system, Spi2.
Virulence Factors: 
Type I secretion systems BapBCD and SiiCDF secrete the surface proteins BapA and SiiE, which assist in adhesion and invasion of the host cell. 
Flagella give the Salmonella a motile function, which can assist in infection. 
Flagellin causes inflammation of the intestinal epithelium while preventing cell apoptosis.  
The environment of the host cell contains insufficient resources for the survival of the pathogen, so Salmonella utilizes several ion transporters to acquire the necessary resources. 
Host cell proteins bind most of the available iron, so Salmonella produce siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin, to ensure that the pathogen receives the required amount of the mineral.   
CorA, MgtA, and MgtB are Mg2+ uptake systems.

Live server offers a live preview of the wiki to see changes while editing the wiki. VS Code also features multiple useful functionalities like a colour picker or CSS peek, with which elements of the wiki can be styled easily.
Setting up a version control system (Git, GitHub)
Git is useful to keep track of the progress of wiki editing.
Using this version control system it is possible to go back to certain control points, which is particularly useful to inexperienced users because they will be able to experiment without fear of damaging what is already done.
Connecting this service with an online server like GitHub, multiple team members will be allowed to edit the wiki simultaneously and keep control of all changes.
Implementing this tools is essential to edit the wiki by multiple team members in an ordered and progressive way.
Styling the wiki: Introduction to Bootstrap 4
Bootstrap is a front-end component library which will allow inexperienced users to have an easily customizable and stylish wiki design.
It also incorporates elements to make the wiki responsive, so that it will adapt to mobile devices.
In this first tutorial you are going to learn what is bootstrap, how to create a navigation bar for the iGEM wiki and how to correctly implement Bootstrap in the wiki following the iGEM rules (avoid using CDN).
Styling the wiki with Sass
Sass is an extension of CSS which, among other things, allows the use of variables to define styles.
This can be very useful to modify multiple styles changing just one parameter.
Bootstrap can be compiled from Sass files, so that we can take advantage of Sass to edit the wiki in a faster and smarter way.In this tutorial you are going to learn how to install Sass and use it to change the style of a simple example.
6.1 Installing Sass
6.2 Introduction to Sass & example
Styling the wiki: Customizing
Bootstrap using Sass
Bootstrap can be implemented in diverse ways, but compiling the styles using Sass provides the inexperienced user with multiple advantages that will be explored later on. In this brief tutorial you will learn how to set up Bootstrap to be used in combination with Sass in under 10 minutes.
Styling the wiki:
Hands on example
Finally, in this tutorial you will learn how to make use of the advantages of Sass to customize the navigation bar that was created before using Bootstrap alone.
Using this method you will be able to quickly style the rest of elements of your wiki and design a personalized look for your project.
Simulating wiki templates using IFrame
Mediawiki templates are very useful to introduce elements which are present in multiple pages of our wiki, like the navigation bar and the"

Hospitals and clinicians should keep up with the breakthrough of medical technology, enrich the knowledge reserve of gene therapy technology and its treatment, and meet the new challenges at any time to promote human health.
Q: Systematic drug-given method of the current microRNA antagonist therapy may induce adverse consequences, such as complement activation, hepatotoxicity, and so on. Do you think that means that this therapy is still immature? How about the acceptance of these risks?
A:Obviously, microRNA antagonists can treat diseases from the very beginning by inhibiting the expression of target genes at the gene level, and have shown good efficacy in a large number of clinical studies and clinical trials. As you have described, some of the side effects associated with new therapies also exist. There may be individual differences, and there may be some deficiencies that require further improvements. When the microRNA antagonist therapy enters clinical trials and FDA (sFDA) approval process, the treatment effect and its risk will be evaluated, and then mature therapy will be approved. For the new treatment, the patient's acceptance may be different, most of them need to be informed before the medication, and it is necessary to sign the informed consent.
Shuo Tu is a Teaching assistant of biochemistry and molecular biology department of Nanchang University, and her main research direction is tumor cell apoptosis.
Q: what role do microRNAs play in medical treatment nowadays?
A: Although microRNAs are currently used in early cancer detection in most cases, they may appear as adjuvant treatment in the future.
Q: What new challenges do you think microRNAs antagonist might pose to future medical scheme design?
A: The most important challenge is personalized care. It would be ideal to design treatments based on the patients' genetic sequences. Gene therapy is nothing more than just specificity, so the key is to find the most specific impact factors or biomarkers of disease, and change it to reach the therapeutic effect of disease. Therefore, the effect of antagonist treatment is determined by whether the first stage can find the key target.
Q: Systematic drug-given method of the current microRNA antagonist therapy may induce adverse consequences, such as complement activation, hepatotoxicity, and so on. Do you think that means that this therapy is still immature? How about the acceptance of these risks?
A: Liver toxicity depends on whether the drug is toxic itself, before or after metabolization, or it is toxic only to the individual populations. If the drug itself is toxic or metabolized to produce"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html," Its potential cancerogenity is the result of chromium VI being , able to enter cells , while this is not possible for chromium III compounds. Inside of the cells, chromium IV is reduced to chromium III and can not leave the cells anymore, where it results in oxidative stress reactions (Mitchell D. Cohen et al.). Because of its toxicity the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a limit of 50 µg/L chromium in drinking water. In contrast to this guideline concentrations of 120 µg/l chromium were detected in drinking water in the USA (Guidelines for drinking-water quality 2011, WHO 2003).
Detection
Chromium in drinking water is detected trough atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or ion chromatography with post column derivatization and UV visible spectroscopic detection (U.S. EPA, OW, OGWDW, SRMD, Technical Support Center). Moreover, chromium detection at home can be detected by a basic titrimetric method using an iodide reaction for measurement (GIORGIA).
Our chromium biosensor
We work with the chromate inducible operon of Ochrobactrum triti ci5bvl1, which enables a tolerance for chromium VI and superoxide. The expression of the operon depends on the bondage of the repressor chrB to the operator sequence (Branco et al. 2008). The  chrBACF operon ( BBa_K1058007 ) and the chrB repressor were introduced by the team BIT 2013.

What They Did For Us:
The two plasmids were first transformed into DH5α cells and grown overnight at room temperature in LB broth with chloramphenicol added. The two plasmids were treated under three conditions: one uninduced, one induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and one induced with 1 mM IPTG. The protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll a operon was tested with four genes, all of which showed good expression rates (Figure 4.). The Mg chelatase operon was tested for five genes, however the ChlH and ChlD genes showed lower than expected or no expression at all (Figure 5.). We are investigating as to why these two genes had lower expression once inducted.
Formula:
2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1 = Ct(uninduced operon genes) - Ct(Chloramphenicol gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes) - Ct(Induced Chloramphenicol gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2 - ΔCt(control)1 to get ΔΔCt

In order to analyse the concentrated dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

Note the dxCas9 is only one band on the 8% PAGE. The purification will be continued however, we will look deeper into this observation. What causes this double band? Is there degradation, or some other interaction with the dxcas9? Also what happened during the final dialysis step to remove the double band? Trace amounts of contaminating background is observed, however dxCas9 is significantly more in quantity and the background was tolerated for functionality testing.

UVR8 - dTetR fusion: a UV sensing protein
Three different fusion strategies were carried out to verify the best UVR8 dTetR fusion [ link to the partsregistry ]. Tet DBD stands for TetR DNA binding domain.
1. Full length UVR8 without a linker
2. Full length UVR8 + [GGS]x2 linker (+6 aa)
3. Truncated UVR8 (-13 aa which are not seen in the 3d structure)
You can find the split TetR DNA binding domain containing a BamHI restriction site which allows it to be fused to any protein of interest containing the corresponding restriction site. This allows you to test if a protein of interest is able to dimerize.
p-ABA generator
We constructed one pab operon consisting of the pabA and pabB/C gene from Lactococcus lactis to overexpress p-ABA. Therefore we used the biobrick parts BBa_K137055 and BBa_S04039 as a template to construct the wished composites.
Biobrick K909016 will be used to show that p-ABA is produced, while the operon can be cloned downstream to any promoter.
UVR8 - system: In a second step the pab operon will be cloned downstream of the pTet promoter. Derepression of UVR8 by UV irradiation leads then to p-ABA expression.
Decoder:
In a second step the pab operon will be cloned downstream of the PL promoter with operator sites TetO1 and LacO1 . In case blue and red light is present, p-ABA will be produced as a blue and red light response.
Dual input promoters
In our case we want the decoder to have AND logics. Therefore we designed 3 different dual input promoters, all of them derived from the λ-phage promoters PR and PL:
1. Modified PR promoter with operator sites OR1,OR2 and LacO1
2. Modified PR promoter with operator sites OR1,OR2 and TetO1
3. Modified PL promoter with operator sites Tet"

Wet Laboratory Training : Noreen Casey and Jenny Duane, Technical  staff in the School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork
The UCC iGEM team embarked on a week-long training programme in June to gain proficiency in molecular biology techniques, especially those relevant to the production of recombinant DNA and protein in the laboratory. Learning from experienced laboratory technicians in the UCC Biochemistry Training Labs, and PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from the Cork Cancer Research Institute, we learnt best practices used in biochemistry to generate high yields for successful design, cloning and validation of plasmids. Through practising techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis, and SDS Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we were able to astutely assess the success of various standard, 3A and Gibson assemblies
Presentation Coaching - Blackstone LaunchPad
UCC Blackstone Launchpad is an experiential entrepreneurship programme open to staff and students in UCC. They are specialists in aiding start-ups to build an effective business plan, overcome obstacles and grow their business. Our iGEM team identified Blackstone Launchpad as excellent potential mentors, to aid us with building out the idea of our biosensor project, effectively carrying out market research and aiding us in our presentation and outreach skills. This turned out to be the case as Peter, Alexis and Trish’s experience proved invaluable in each of these areas (pictures below). While our iGEM team was made up of multidisciplinary students, none of us were from a business background and we had very little experience in this area. Blackstone Launchpad’s expertise helped us more effectively gather and analyse the market research behind our project. Their help in building out our project idea and project plan was immensely useful and streamlined our work together as a team, making accomplishing tasks much more efficient. Their experience in aiding start-ups to build effective pitches and presentations, we found, proved to be one of their greatest contributions to our"
IONIS_Paris,2015,Team:IONIS Paris#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," demonstrated it, in our digital area, education, through MOOC and open access are more easily available than ever.       Nevertheless, people still have to develop interest in a topic in order to reach information, sometimes overcoming language barriers and finding information that remains both scientifically correct and understandable!
Our purpose during the overall competition has been to bring people to understand the field, its risks and opportunities and to invite them to develop their own opinion.        This objective in our mind, we chose to develop our project through different supports and strategies.
Combining gamification and popularization into effective teaching strategies
What is gamification?
Gamification is a recent term describing the use of game-like designs and mechanisms in order to facilitate the understanding of non-fun topic, to motivate and engage people in theirs tasks.       Why learning should not been amusing?       Well, our team was pretty sure it should be, which lead us to develop our Bio-Console and Mobile application!
Our Bio-Console
According to our purpose, choosing a bio-console as a support for our project was a perfect fit!       Microfluidics is nowadays of a great importance thanks to its many applications from diagnosis to single-cell analysis.       Thus, combining this high-tech support to a game seems great to get people interested in the potential application of such systems.       In addition, we could get them more sensitive about safety issues thanks to our kill-switch and make them discover the great possibilities of optogenetics.       Still, our main objective was to ensure that our system would be safe of use by two kinds of “game over” to make sure no spreading would occur when using the console.
However, some ethical concerns were raised from our choice: should we “play” with living organisms like in our game? We debated this problematic and came to the conclusion that making bacteria a playful companion in a game of fluid and light would not harm neither the organisms, neither environment nor human beings.       In addition, the Bio-Console is not expected to be an industrial scale project and the demonstration of the microfluidic device does not necessarily require the use of bacteria to reach its popularization purpose.
Our Mobile Application
Available on Android systems and respecting the open source philosophy of the iGEM, our mobile application development has been conducted in order to create an educational but still fun game in order to make people of any background more likely to get informed about biotechnology and synthetic biology.       As we needed to make choices between our many ideas of mini-games, we have chosen to focus our first mini-games on safety issues and good lab practices and to introduce our bacterial hero!

Droplet coalescence
In-silico mutant determination
Modified nucleotide inhibitory effect
During the development of CAT-Seq we have developed three different in-depth mathematical models that have immensely helped us create a well-working system.
Mathematical description of droplet coalescence
Efficient reaction mix enrichment by droplet merging was an extremely important aspect of CAT-Seq as it is directly responsible for the accuracy and information retainment degree. Yet, the droplet merging was immensely inefficient, as droplet coalescence techniques contain multiple parameters that requires precise tuning. For that reason we have developed an in-depth mathematical description of the droplet merging. Explore the model by clicking here .
In-silico determination of Esterase mutants
In order to assess the CAT-Seq accuracy and precision, using in-silico methods we have derived CAT-Seq esterase mutants which had different activities, which would be later used for Catalytic Activity Sequencing performance benchmarking. Explore the model by clicking here .
Modified Nucleotide inhibitory effect model
While researching the literature we have found out that modified nucleotides (which we are using as substrate nucleotides) might sometimes affect the amplification efficiency of Phi29 polymerase. We were concerned by that fact because the amplification efficiency was important for us, as nanopore sequence requires long amplicons. For this reason we have derived a mathematical model to assess the modified nucleotide inhibitory effects on the DNA amplicon length. clicking here ."

FJNU-China,2018,Team:FJNU-China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," currently drawing more attentions for its economical applications.On top of due to limited application scenarios and biosafety issues, it is often difficult to put these genetically engineered bacteria into practical use. In addition to public and government acceptance is also a concern in our project.     In order to solve these problems, 3+net is a new concept of the environment track, which was jointly proposed by East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) and many universities in China. The purpose is to provide guidance and reference for the bioremediation field. 3+net was separately elaborated from the three perspectives of application, biosecurity and society, and explored the relationship among the three aspects. In order to provide more feasible suggestions for people, it is better to apply laboratory results into technologies, resulting in enormous social values.
    Base on the collaboration with East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) , we try our best to apply the results into practical applications and produce greater social values. In scientific methods, we cite some simple methods, such as designing suicide switches, knocking out resistance genes, genome integration, visualization of genetically engineered bacteria, hardware design, network monitoring, and so on. We summarize the current common suicide switches for different types of environmental conditions.

We also wanted to test the case of probes with the amplicon having the PAM sequence not on the large loop, but on the stem instead (i.e. a double-stranded PAM, as usually required in Cas systems, and not single-stranded). We considered in this case three different alternatives:
Changing 4 bases in the large loop in order for them to be complementary to the PAM sequence, without adding more bases. This leads to a 19 bases-long stem, a 10 bases-long ""small"" loop and a 8 bases-long ""large"" loop. The template sequence of the amplicon is the following one:
5’-ATAGTTN'AAANNNNNNNNTTTNAACTATACAACCTACNNNTGAGGTAGTAGGTTGT-3’  (with N' being the base complementary to the N in the PAM)
Inserting 4 more bases complementary to the PAM on one end of the large loop (after ATAGTT), without changing any base. This leads to a 19 bases-long stem, a 10 bases-long small loop and a 12 bases-long large loop. The template sequence of the amplicon is the following one:
5’-ATAGTTN'AAANNNNNNNNNNNNTTTNAACTATACAACCTACNNNTGAGGTAGTAGGTTGT-3’
Inserting 4 more bases complementary to the PAM on one end of the large loop (after ATAGTT) and 4 more bases at the other end of the large loop (before the PAM sequence), in order to keep the original length of the large loop (16 bases). This leads to a 19 bases-long stem, a 10 bases-long small loop and a 16 bases-long large loop. The template sequence of the amplicon is the following one:
5’-ATAGTTN'AAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTTNAACTATACAACCTACNNNTGAGGTAGTAGGTTGT-3’
These three alternatives led, respectively, to Probe 7, Probe 8 and Probe 9.

On getting a license for the Biosafty Level 1 lab he set up in his parents' home
Cathal was granted a license from Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency to create genetically modified microbes in his parents' home. His is the only such license in Ireland held by an individual, all others being held by academic or industrial labs. ""I set up a lab there and invited the EPA out to take a look and them… they gave me the license. They took their time thinking about it, I understand it went to high levels of the EPA to get a sign off on it and ultimately they decided to take a risk on me and I’m grateful for that because in the end I didn’t cause any problems for them. I ran a pretty normal molecular biology lab at the lowest category of risk. I tried to generate a few open source biotechnology products, I had some mixed results, nothing marketable and ultimately the start-up failed. I learned a lot from that failure and looking back I did everything wrong. So you know, nothing that would upset a regulator.""
Cathal on Synthetic Biology's impact on industry
""Synthetic Biology brings down that risk by allowing much more rapid development times and a much more fine-grained control over the design of your product or bio-product.""
Advice for prospective Biotech start-ups
After setting up his lab, Cathal founded his own biotech/synthetic biology company called GlowBiotics. Although it failed, his experience has proved useful in his current role as director of the IndieBio EU programme. Now he advises startups going through IndieBio on mistakes they should avoid in order to be successful. This is his advice to anyone considering creating a biotech start-up. ""Don’t go it alone, don’t be too risk-averse.""
""I would never recommend that anyone go out and do a start-up on their own, because this was too much, there’s paperwork, there’s regulations, there’s tax returns and accountancy. And then there’s the actual science, and that science can be very time-critical; it can occupy your time.  And then there’s marketing; what good is a product if you don’t have customers. You need to be able, at the very first stage you need to know who your customer is, find them, meet them, build up this relationship before you ever have a product to sell them and find out what they want. That is too much work for one person to do all these different things, wear all these different hats.

The z-score was 21.57; the cutoff for statistical significance was a z-score of 1.895. Therefore, our data was statistically significant and we can accept the alternative hypothesis, Ha: Absorbance ≠ -1.806. This leads us to conclude that IL1B protein recognizable by IL1B antibodies is being made.

SMALL MOLECULE
For our small molecule test case we chose to detect aflatoxin, a small molecule produced by Aspergillus fungi species that infects many agricultural crops, including cannabis.2,3 Aflatoxin also causes a number of health problems in people when inhaled or ingested by immunocompromised patients. We fused two single chain antibodies targeting aflatoxin ( BBa_K2876005 and BBa_K2876003 ) to the lambda repressor and alpha subunit of RNA-polymerase III ( BBa_K2876002 ) described in Dove, Joung, and Hochschild in order to create two fusion proteins capable of activating transcription in the presence of aflatoxin (Figure 11).

Meetings
From the very beginning our team established two equally important goals for the project: 1) finding an existing problem; 2) developing a theoretical concept to solve it. For this reason, we consulted with a number of specialists such as gastroenterologist and medical microbiologist, who advised us on theoretical and practical parts of our project. Most importantly, throughout the project timeline, our team kept in touch with clinical geneticists, one of whom is the leading Lithuanian physician specialising in the treatment of phenylketonuria.

PKU patient‘s association and summer camp
As we are designing a product meant for a particular public, our most important task is to communicate with potential users: ascertain the necessity of our product and adjust its design to their needs. For this reason, we cooperated with association ‘Dalia’ - an organisation, which brings together all the PKU patients from Lithuania and several families from Latvia and Estonia. We were provided with all the relevant information on the disease, the patients and the available treatment. Moreover, our team participated in the annual summer camp for PKU patients in which we not only presented our idea, but also met the people who are likely to use our probiotic. The possibility to discuss our idea with affected people or their relatives were really useful for further planning of our project and also inspired us to try our best. Read more
Survey on probiotics
As a part of collaboration with Oxford iGEM team, we have conducted a survey on the probiotic delivery system in both United Kingdom and Lithuania. The survey contained several questions regarding people’s preferences in the appearance, intake method and frequency of the probiotics. The intention of the survey was to aid the design of a probiotic, which would meet the needs of the potential users. The survey provided us with the thorough understanding of the people’s needs regarding probiotics. It helped us to fulfill our project in the way, which is the most appealing to the potential users and this has always been our primary aim. Read more

Dear reader, thank you for subscribing to our monthly newsletter. Via this platform we will keep you up to date on our project: Fifty Shades of Stress!
Our first month in the lab
July was the first month working full time in the lab on our project: Fifty Shades of Stress. The first succesful transformations were performed and the the first results using                                                     the GFP-strains were obtained.
Our PCR experts Daphne and Mees succeeded in isolating the DNA from all the promoters we intend to use during our project. Daphne is also the current record                                                     holder within our team for using the most                                                     pipette tips. Together with Germaine, they finished the first transformations. Our own “Classy” Jazzy explored the dangerous world of Streptomyces together with Marijke. Despite a few really smelly                                                     infections,                                                     Jazzy finished the first overlay to test our bacteria. Lotte has become an expert in pouring agar plates in the first few weeks, while Maaike performed the first attempt to synthesize a                                                     megaplasmid,                                                     unfortunately without success.

We made minipreps of yesterday's culture. Thanks to our ""double check"" medium we found which colonies were well picked. Finally we had minipreps of tubes HarFAR 1, 2, 3; EaDAcT 3 and AtrΔ11 2, 3.
Once we had the minipreps, we perform the digestions to check which were correct and send them to sequencing. This time we selected RsaI instead of BanII. The in silico digestions were as follows.

Where，[S]  is the substrate concentration, [E] is the initial enzyme concentration, [P] is the product concentration.
2.1.2  Law of mass action
The law of mass action is: the rate of the elementary reaction is proportional to the power of the concentration of each reactant, wherein the power exponent of each reactant concentration is the stoichiometry of the reactant in the reaction equation, and the proportional constant is called the chemical reaction constant. . For the following biochemical reactions:
By the law of mass action:
\[\frac{{d[C]}}{{dt}} =  - \frac{{d[A]}}{{dt}} =  - \frac{{d[B]}}{{dt}} = J\]
\[J = k \cdot [A] \cdot [B]\]
Where，J is called flux of chemical reaction.

At a constant concentration of enzyme, the Michaelis-Menten equation describes the relationship between reaction rate and substrate concentration. Therefore, the biochemical reaction of glucose to butanol is described by equations (2)-(9).

Informing Design
We consulted numerous experts in various fields to ensure that the design of the AuxIn system respects all relevant social, ethical and legal issues.  One module of our system, Gene Guard , is a direct result of brainstorming around the issues involved in the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although we have only reached the proof of concept stage, we have put a lot of thought into how AuxIn may be implemented as a product and the legal issues that would be involved.

Legal issues
1. Goal
In order to implement our project in the field, we are going to have to release genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the dryland environment. Aside from the scientific issues surrounding the release of GMOs, we also need to take into account the legal issues. We need to incorporate these ideas into our design so that our project can become a viable product that could one day be used in the field. The legal issues will not only affect the design of the bacteria themselves, but also the method of implementation and the nature of the trials we carry out to verify our project.
2. Action
We looked into the main laws that would affect the operation of our finished product. To help inform our design, we investigated the legal issues surrounding GMOs and living modified organisms (LMOs), in particular, the issues relating to their release. This will allow us to include the legal limitations into our specification as we design our system, meaning that our system will be designed with every intention to release the bacteria safely and legally.
From our Human Practices panel , we found that there were two important documents that we should study. The first is the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , which is an international agreement for sustainable development that contains some very important principles. The second document is the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety , an international agreement that seeks to establish guidelines for the safe release of GMOs without harming biodiversity"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html,").  In mammals, the progesterone biosynthesis pathway begins with cholesterol. Enzymes convert cholesterol to pregnenolone to progesterone. Figure 1 shows a highly simplified version of the reference pathway for steroid hormone biosynthesis in mammals from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to highlight the progesterone biosynthesis pathway.
The organism we are engineering, Y. lipolytica, does not produce cholesterol naturally, but it does produce a cholesterol precursor: zymosterol. In Y. lipolytica however, only the zymosterol-ergosterol pathway exists. We considered engineering three non-native enzymes (circled in blue in Figure 2) into Y. lipolytica to complete the zymosterol-cholesterol pathway, due to the common pathway to progesterone in mammals starting from cholesterol. However, because ergosterol is the yeast’s preferred pathway product, navigating through the cholesterol pathway would require completely knocking out the pathway to ergosterol (starting from ERG6 on the right). The addition of those three genes, plus the additional genes needed to take cholesterol to progesterone, PLUS a pathway knockout required too much engineering for the timeframe of our project. The enzymes highlighted in green exist in Y. lipolytica, see the end product of ergosterol circled in pink. The enzymes highlighted with white do not exist, and would need to be engineered into the organism.
We needed to figure out how to create progesterone in a creative way. We found that we could create a synthetic pathway to progesterone, directly from ergosterol (circled in pink in Figure 2). This was beneficial because that pathway exists naturally in Y. lipolytica. In Y. lipolytica and other fungi, ergosterol serves similar functions in fungi as cholesterol does in animal cells (Money, 2016), meaning that while the pathway does not currently exist in the organism, it is possible to convert ergosterol to progesterone. We searched through research articles and found the work of Duport et al.(CITATION??!!) who outlined the possible pathway to convert ergosterol to progesterone using five genes. The first gene is for the enzyme ∆7-sterol reductase (∆7Red), isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, which reduces ergosterol to ergosta-5-enol and ergosta-5,22-dienol (Waterham and Wan- ders, 2000). The next gene encodes for bovine side-chain cleavage cy"

Safety Questions
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:     researcher safety,     public safety, or     environmental safety?
1.a:
Escherichia coli (TOP10): BSL 1
Citrobacter braakii: BSL 1
Bacilus Subtilus: BSL 1
No. Our project does not raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety. We extracted phytase genes from non-virulent E.coli , C. braakii , and B. subtilus host organisms in a Biosafety level  1 environment.  Phytase genes from Aspergillus niger were not extracted but synthesized using Gibson assembly; thus, we did not have contact with the A. niger itself. The Pgad gene was obtained from the 2011 HKU team in a plasmid, thus we did not have contact with lactococcus lactis bacteria as well. Even if the project does not go as planned, there is very little risk to any researcher as all the reagents, genes, and bacteria used in the experiments are safe and non virulent.
1.b:
No. Our project does not raise safety issues in terms of public safety. While the goal of the project is to increase the bioavailability of iron through the degradation of phytate in the digestive system, the actual risks of exposing bacteria to the human digestive system are extremely low. People consume bacteria every day, many of which have beneficial effects such as the numerous probiotics in yogurt. Thus, consuming one more type of bacteria should not be an issue. Even if our bacterium was released or misused, it contains no virulence genes that could harm the public. Because of this, our engineered organism exhibits a low public safety risk.
1.c:
No. Our product will not be exposed to the environment because it is designed to be used in fermented food stocks, specifically yogurt stocks. In the event of a spill, our engineered organism does not produce toxins and should exhibit a low environmental safety risk.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,      did"

Figure 4. The part we design to produce L-lactate(LB medium).
After we transferred our part into E.coli BL21, we found there was little difference between the experimental group and control group.
Figure 5. The yield of lactate in flask-shaking fermentation condition (LB medium)
In order to enhance the transformation efficiency from glucose to lactate, as well as improve the characterization of our ldhE part, we decided to knockout the the pflB and poxB.
Figure 6. Lactate metabolic pathway. The pflB and poxB knocking out and ldhE insertion will result in the accumulation of lactate.
1.2 pflB knockout
PFL is a crucial enzyme in the glucose metabolism under anaerobic condition, which can catalyze one molecule of pyruvate to one molecule of formicate and one molecule of acetylcoenzyme A (AcCoA). According to metabolic pathway, pyruvate is consumed both in the PFL and LDH reactions. In the wild type E. coli, LDH reaction is not as competitive as the reaction through PFL, and therefore, knockout of the PFL related genes will contribute to redistribute the metabolic flux. When the PFL pathway is blocked, E. coli will conceivably alter the distribution of these products to overcome the imbalanced reducing equivalents caused by the pathway knockout. Therefore, knockout of pflB not only decreased the carbon flow to acetyl-CoA under anaerobic condition but also reduced the anaerobic consumption of NADH through reductive TCA. [5]
After the knockout of pflB, though the growth rate was slightly slowed down, the yield of lactate of engineered strain was improved greatly and showed a significant difference from the wild type MG1655. From the result, we can see our part functioned as expected.

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," living bacteria in collection chamber would be very dangerous for patient (could result in sepsis) if no additional purification steps are implemented.
It is thus quite evident that membrane is probably one of the most important component of our final product.
However as we couldn't obtain satisfactory biomimetic membrane we were forced to improvise and look into what nature could offer us. One of the possibilities was to use egg yolk membrane - the biggest membrane we could obtain and robust enough for experimenting.
Figure 1: Schematic of the device on which membrane was tested.
Experiment: Hypothesis and setup
The goal was to prove that only the secreted proteins can pass the membrane and not the bacteria. We believed that bacteria would recognize the phospholipid bilayer characteristic for eukaryotic cells and secrete the protein via injectosome.
Detection of increase in fluorescence from samples taken from collection chamber would mean a successful demonstration of our idea. However the solution in collection chamber has to remain sterile, otherwise we would get false positive result. (i.e. bacteria could pass to collection chamber and start producing protein which increases the fluorescence).
The following illustration provides the somewhat simpler explanation of the setup of the experiment .
Figure 2: Description of the experiment. In time intervals a sample was taken from the collection chamber. Fluorescence was measured to detect if protein was being secreted (mCherry), while plating was performed to check whether bacteria crossed the membrane. Since our strain was resistant to Chloramphenicol, we used agarose plates with added Chloramphenicol. This way only bacterial strains with resistance to this antibiotic could grow on the plates. In order to prove that the colonies on the plate were indeed the strain we were working with arabinose was added since it induces production of mCherry protein in our strain. If colonies turned red then we can safely assume that the bacteria has somehow breached the membrane and that detected increase in fluorescence in collection chamber was indeed a false positive result.
Technical details
The following experiment has probably not yet been done. The experiment therefore required a great deal of improvisation, flexibility and imagination, not mentioning the number of trials before optimizing the protocols.
Strains used
For preliminary experiments the following strains of SIEC (Synthetic injector E. coli) bacteria were used:
All had chaperone and mCherry as a reporter protein.
Legend:
I = injectisome, (+) means functional injectisome, while (-) means the plasmid is lacking promoter in front DNA that in encoding injectisome.

COLLABORATIONS
NYMU_TAIPEI
We have continued and strengthened our long-standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). They troubleshooted our cloning procedure and design of primers, gave us protocols for assaying biofilm production, and trained our future iGEMers (Leona and Catherine).
In return, we helped add to the characterization of their lactose-induced suicide mechanism: the Holin-Endolysin-NrtA system ( BBa_K2350021 ). We measured the population of their kill-switch bacteria in different lactose concentrations, and find that our results are consistent with their findings.
We independently tested the function of NYMU_Taipei’s lactose-induced kill-switch system. Different concentrations (0-250 mM) of lactose were tested for their effects on bacteria population. Experiment: Yvonne Wei
Additionally, this year two members from TAS (Catherine and Leona) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments and human practices for NYMU throughout the year. In Boston, they will also help NYMU present their project at the Giant Jamboree.
CGU_Taiwan
We first met the CGU_Taiwan team at the end of our presentation for the Asia Pacific iGEM Conference hosted at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU).
They were excited that our biofilms were able to trap nanoparticles, and wondered if they could trap ink particles as well. CGU_Taiwan is working on improving the procedure to manufacture reprocessed paper. They found that a process called “flotation,” typically used to de-ink paper, could cause significant paper fiber loss. They wondered if biofilm could potentially replace the current flotation process to preserve paper fibers. We offered to test this for CGU_Taiwan. We used a similar experimental procedure as our preliminary biofilm trapping experiment. The results suggest that our biofilm can trap ink particles. As shown below, the relative absorbance of ink decreased by approximately 50% when mixed with biofilm.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#preservation system_-_-_TEXT.html," Three technical replicates of the OD600 were measured every hour via the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.
The Two-Plasmid System for UBP Retention
The retention system was engineered to preserve the unnatural base pair (UBP) isoG-isoCm in vivo. This intention requires the uptake of unnatural nucleotides from the media and a selection pressure on the plasmids carrying the UBP. We developed a two-plasmid system for the retention. As described above, the first high-copy plasmid (pSB1K3) BBa_K2201027 contains the truncated version of PtNTT2 for the uptake of isoGTP and isoCmTP and cas9 for the digestion of all plasmids that have lost the UBP in vivo . The Cas9 is guided by five sgRNAs ( BBa_K2201077 ) that bind every possible point mutation that leads to the loss of the UBP. Those sgRNAs are part of the second plasmid. This plasmid BBa_K2201032 is a composite part of BBa_K2201077 and BBa_K2201017 . We decided this plasmid to be a low-copy plasmid (pSB3C5), because a high-copy version could possibly cause a greater mutation frequency. The second plasmid also contains a different antibiotic resistance than the first plasmid for a selection of bacteria carrying both plasmids. The UBP was part of the oligo UBP_target and was assembled with the linearized backbone of BBa_K2201032 . Primers ( 17tx and 17we )  for the linearization via PCR were used so that the Gibson Assembly with the oligo UBP_target leads to a frameshift within the sacB coding sequence of the mRFP-sacB fusionprotein. Hence, a successful Gibson Assembly enables the transformed organism to grow in the presence of sucrose later on.
In vivo Experiment for UBP Retention
The Romesberg lab (Zhang et al., 2017) was able to proof retention of their hydrophobic UBP in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the nucleotide transporter PtNTT2 and Cas9. Therefore we transformed BBa_K2201027 into E. coli BL21(DE3) via heat shock with the goal to produce chemically competent cells containing the retention plasmid afterwards. Those chemically competent cells were used for a second heat shock transformation of the second plasmid BBa_K2201032"

Figure 2: Fluorescence (Excitation 485 nm, Emission 528 nm) of V. natriegens after 0 and 3 h incubation in LB + v2 + 2 µg/mL chloramphenicol.
In figure 2 the increase of the fluorescence after 3 h incubation is shown in all devices. The devices 1, 4 and 5 are clearly more fluorescent, so the expression of the fluorescent protein is higher. This might be caused by a stronger promotor activity in these devices compared to the positive control and the other devices.
The results of the Vibrigens InterLab Study are comparable with the results of the iGEM InterLab .
iGEM Team TU Darmstadt
Very much in line with the iGEM philosophy we utilized an existing BioBrick (developed by TU Darmstadt 2017 ChiTUcare ) as starting point for our novel approach. Thus we utilized the chitin synthase (NodC, BBa_K2380002 )  and two different chitin deacetylases (NodB, BBa_K2380041 and COD, BBa_2380043 ). We were happy to build on their experience and vision, applying chitosan as an antimicrobial coating, similar to their implementation of it in their hydrogel for the use of wound healing patches. In agreement with last years team members from Darmstadt, we have received the relevant BioBricks as plasmid DNA from team TU Darmstadt 2018 ( combimer ).
In several chats via e-mail and personal communication at the European Meetup in Munich they provided us useful information concerning the expression and purification especially of the deacetylase NodB. This particular enzyme poses some difficulties on the purification process as it is produced in inclusion bodies. Therefore, we concentrated on COD as chitin deacetylase.
Thanks to iGEM Darmstadt we saved a lot of time on the construction of the initial basic parts for our chitosan subteam. Furthermore, we are glad to share our parts and experience with team Darmstadt for further development of a chitosan producing genetically engineered machine."

Project description
We are planning to use dCas9 and asRNA to silence the production of toxins A and B in C. difficile which is known for causing hospital-acquired diarrhoea in the western world. We want to prove a concept of asRNA and/or dCas9 as an alternative to antibiotic treatment against C. difficile. As a result, we will neutralise the negative impacts of bacteria on human health rather than completely killing it.      We will create and test a promoter library in both E. coli and C. difficile, express anti-sense RNAs in C. difficile, express dCas9/sgRNA in E. coli and C. difficile. dCas9 is planned to be used to repress the reporter gene gusA,  by dCas9 binding to the toxin promoters placed upstream of gusA, in E. coli and C. difficile. If this repression is successful the system will be used to repress the C. difficile toxin genes.
Whole organisms
E.coli DH5 alpha, E.coli Sexpress (A derivative of NEB Express containing the R factor R702)
C. difficile SBRC 078 (clinical isolate), C. difficile bacteriophage phiSBRC
Risks the organisms pose
E. coli is the model lab organism and has low, but not non-existent, virulence. It is very unlikely to cause disease in healthy adults. The risk group mostly includes young, elderly, immunocompromised people and is spread through injection or contamination of broken skin with bacteria which can cause inflammation"

Introduction
Science, as we see it, should be accessible to anyone who seek it, regardless of his/her occupation, age or gender.                We think it is essential for everyone to understand the basic principles of life and learn about the elementary processes of biology.
To achieve this, we designed and organized activities suitable for the following age groups:
- Kindergarten kids.
- High School students / teenagers.
- College Students.
- The general public.
- Seniors.
In addition to organizing the activities, we have created a ""Do It Yourself"" booklet including all the activities.                The purpose of this booklet is to enable other iGEM groups or educators to repeat and improve the activities.
Kindergartens
Introducing young children to the wonderful and interesting world of science is the best way to encourage them to be curious,               ask questions about life and not be afraid of the unknown.
This is why we met with the scientists of the future, and provided               them some of the basic tools of science.
With the help of Nobel Prize winner - Prof. Dan Shechtman, we contacted three scientific kindergartens (kindergartens  aimed                to teach science) and  arranged  three  meetings  for  each.
The goal of these meetings was to teach and explain the different aspects               of water. For example, the three states of water: solid, liquid and gas. Furthermore, this activity provided the children with the basic               tools required to tackle scientific problems in the future.
For more information, see our ""Do It Yourself"" booklet for kindergartens.

So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share. The most likely progression of dNANO would be first to patent the technology. Once we own the exclusive rights, TEC would then suggest connecting with industry partners who we would licence our toolkit to. Alternatively, TEC also suggested an option to a be likely route, where we would give the company exclusive rights to our technology for 1-2 years. In this time, logistical aspects would be dealt with the company such as scaling up production or further developing the technology in house. We would then licence out the technology to company once the option expires. TEC has also given insights into how other factors can play a role in whether startup is successful or not. For example, does the technology in question address a market need? If not, then demand for such a technology will not exist and the startup will fail. Other pitfalls, are that start-ups fail to recognize how long it takes for technology to become commercialized and end up bleeding themselves out financially. At the moment, the market share for nanotechnology has been slow, however most efforts are focussed on drug delivery. Perhaps, future innovations in DNA origami should be directed at novel drug delivery methods?
As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share."

DANGEROUS CHEMICALS
We tried to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals whenever possible. We have completely banned a                         number of dangerous chemicals, such as ethidium bromide which had been replaced by anthocyanin                         for our DNA gel electrophoresis. At the same time, we have restricted the use of dangerous                         chemicals (such as acrylamide) which must be clearly placed in marked areas in the laboratory. And we were also required to keep the chemistry reagents in classified storage.

Several IMAC and SDS-pages were run, see (Read more). In all cases eluent 1 was found to be empty. This is not surprising because the eluent volume is so small that the proteins will not come out until eluent 2. Because of this we decided to skip eluent 1 for the negative control in the presented SDS in fig. 3. Eluent 2 consists of several proteins; every protein that does not bind to the IMAC should come out in this step. Eluent 3 seems to be where our colicin Fy is eluted, since it shows a band at the correct length, 50kDa. The negative control did not show any band in 50kDa and expression could therefore be confirmed. Since the colicin was eluted at elution 3 no band can be seen at elution 4.

Appendix 1 displays an earlier SDS-page that was run with more constructs. Since there were more constructs we could not try all elutes, since they did not fit on one gel. The existence of colicin Fy in the construct with J23106 could be seen. Due to this we continued to try further characterization with this construct (SDS-page gel before).

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," 100 ns molecular dynamics  (MD) simulation of our models verified that the models were stable in solvent and that we could further work with the models to estimate the binding affinity between enzyme and substrate. Steered molecular dynamics simulations showed that CsADH2946 is specific to its substrate crocetin dialdehyde and that it has an affinity in the µM range to the substrate. The estimation of KM from the experimental activity measurements also showed that CsADH2946 has a high affinity towards the substrate crocetin dialdehyde, in agreement with Steered Molecular Dynamics results. All modeling results show that CsADH2946 is a very good enzyme for usage in the crocin pathway and thus in our project. Read all about how modeling contributed to our project in the Modeling page
Demonstrate your work
We successfully integrated the first five steps of the crocin pathway from FPP to zeaxanthin into the E. coli chromosome. The result is a E. coli strain expressing zeaxanthin. We have created sequence verified BioBricks of our enzymes in the extended crocin pathway: CaCCD2, CsADH2946 and UGTCs2. We have also characterized these enzymes with experiments and simulations. We are the first to purify and confirm activity of CsADH2946 as well as measuring the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. We created and combined the zeaxanthin producing strain with a plasmid containing the extended crocin pathway which gave us an E. coli strain including the entire production pathway from FPP to crocin. Read all about this at the Demonstrate page, Zeaxanthin strain page, Crocin Pathway page and the Results page."

Introduction
We design and develop a software tool, iGame, which supports database written in MoDeL format, to perform task of automatic modeling. Actually, automatic modeling is a database-dependent network-searching-and-developing process from the initial conditions. Besides the database, users are required to provide initial environment condition, such as initial plasmids with biobrick parts. iGame will generate the network of the biological system in SBML standard. Please refer to User_Interface to know more about input and output of iGame.
Algorithms for automatic modeling will be shown in the following sections. An overview is as follow:
Section Algorithm flow chart gives an overall description of the general framework of our algorithms;
Section Special reactions and volume strategy tells details about the methods and strategies our program utilizes to handle with some special reactions;
Section Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme provides details of sorting as well as weighting scheme and their functions;
Section Structural pattern match of template species provides details of the core algorithm of iGame: how to find matchings between template species defined in database and species existed in the bio-system;
Section Generation of products based on reaction templates describes the mix-trim-split method to generate products.
Algorithm flow chart
Before stating our own algorithm, we will first make an analysis about the difference and difficulty brought by introducing a new language system. The general algorithm idea is common: find out all species and reactions between them. Ignoring the efficiency of program, the most obvious method is doing the following recursively until no more species is generated:
find reactions between species have been found and generate products as new species
Similar idea applies to our program. Some modifications must be made because in other software tools, reaction-searching is name-based. However, in our program, it is structure-based. Matching of species name is much easier than that of Chain-Node structure, which is featured as the most important part of our program. In addition, process of products generating is not as easy as just creating a new species with specific name, too. Their structures are required to be constructed under rules defined in MoDeL at the same time. The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.

This week, we also performed PCR on phaC gBlock to amplify the sequence to produce more phaC gblocks in case we need to digest more. The PCR did not work. We attempted PCR again with Taq polymerase instead of pfu and diluted the primers. The results showed a band the size of the template, but the gel bands appeared smeared.

Week 17 (AUG 21 - AUG 27)
We were having troubles cloning in PhaC into a vector. We theorized that this was due to the restriction sites being placed close to each other. We decided to try blunt ending PhaC into the vector containing PhaBA. To prepare the samples for the blunt ending, 2 samples of pET29b were digested using HindIII; the 2 microcentrifuge tubes were labelled 1 and 2. After digestion, the enzyme mix, dNTPs and blunting buffer were added to each of the two tubes. The mixture was heat inactivated at 70 degrees for 10 minutes. DNA cleanup was performed on the mixture in the two tubes. The DNA was resuspended in the elution buffer. We performed a nanodrop on the DNA but the concentration was negative, which indicated that the DNA cleanup did not work.

 We divided the instrument into eight functional modules: microfluidic chip, confocal detection of optical path, power board, structure, serial screen, microcontroller, temperature control module, peristaltic pump.Their size and position in the instrument can be seen in the picture below .
  The power supply provides the rated voltage for each power unit. The structure printed by 3D printer is used for fixing individual components.The microcontroller is responsible for controlling of the work of the various components,passing information to the serial port, processing the data of the detection.The serial screen is responsible for displaying the test results, and providing the human-computer interaction platform.The microfluidic chip is used as a platform for the entire reaction, and the detection is also done directly on it.Temperature control module and peristaltic pump assist microfluidic chip to achieve it’s function.The confocal detection of optical path is used to detect the fluorescence intensity.Here we will introduce their function one by one.
   
I Temperature control module
 Temperature control module provide constant temperature environment in the chip for two reasons:1.E.coil need constant temperature environment when they restore activity from freeze-dried state;2.E. coli have the best growth and metabolism state in constant temperature environment.
1.1 Design:
  Temperature control module consists of four parts, namely: alumina ceramic, heating piece, temperature sensor module and it’s supporting control module.The alumina ceramic is the base of the chip, and the chip is connected to it. The rest of the temperature control board is located on the instrument, and the chip is placed on it when used.The alumina ceramic allow the chips to heat evenly.The control module control the work of the heater piece.The temperature sensor provide temperature information of microfluidic chip to the microcontroller at real-time.
   
1.2 Material:
  Alumina ceramic piece’s thermal conductivity is 23W/(m^2*K), and the size is 45 * 30 mm. Heating piece’s rated voltage is 5V, the power is 10W, and the size is 40 x 40mm. Temperature sensor’s accuracy is 0.1 ° C.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the risk of cancer in the future [12] .
As a result, there is still a need for away to accurately screen high risk population groups  for NSCLC and minimize unnecessary procedures. We believe that our system could be that solution.
Late presentation of symptoms
Our system can be used in screening by setting cut-offs appropriately. Abnormal miRNA levels can show cancers in their early stages [13] . Our test could rule out cancer in an individual, and refer those with positive results for further testing.
Equivocal test results
The results are easy to interpret as miRNA levels can be several times higher or lower in patients with cancer - through adjusting the cut off values, and using multiple miRNAs in tandem, cancer can be ruled out in many patients. This has the potential to be more efficient than radiologists interpreting a CT scan.
Furthermore, our test is highly specific but would have lower sensitivity (see gold HP) whereas CT scans are highly sensitive but have lower specificity. By using the results of both in combination, rates of false positives could be massively reduced.
Ease of use
Blood sample can be taken by someone with minimal training without a highly trained radiologist required. The processing of the miRNA would be easiest and most efficient in a specialist lab. However, there are kits for miRNA extraction [14] that could be used in rural areas, and combined with our cheap £4 fluorometer , it could allow screening for cancer in developing countries.
Cost
Our system is cheap, less than £17/test ($23). Most doctors said that liquid biopsies could be more cost-effective. See our cost analysis on our modeling page for an exact breakdown.
Invasiveness
Our system for NSCLC simply involves taking a blood sample, making it minimally-invasive. However, miRNAs found in other body fluids (e.g. urine, saliva) could allow for completely non-invasive diagnosis. For example using miRNAs in urine to diagnose prostate cancer (see below )
Timeframe
Results from our system are available within hours. The processing of blood to purify miRNA would take ~2 hours according to expert Dr Dan Pregibon currently. However, there is scope for this to be automated. After adding the purified miRNA to our sensor, and quantifying fluorescence, different miRNA levels could be distinguished within hours (peak fluorescence occurs within 10 hours). See our results page for more details.
Dr Desai, a consultant radiologist, said that the results of a blood test using our sensor could help to relieve a patient’s anxiety far sooner than is currently possible."

Improvements
It is super easy to accomplish  your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.
We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.
It is great significant  to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.
The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing  technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.
The society  is still growing. That is why chatting and communication  could be considered as an important facility in our society.
New Features
Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or  plugin.

In order to test whether your bacterial strain contains an active mutagenesis plasmid, pre-testing is recommended before starting PACE using this strain. Therefore, the following steps have to be proceeded:
Pick a single colony of the bacterial strain containing the AP and MP. It is important, that all strains carrying a MP are plated on plates containing a minimum of 25 mM Glucose (100 mM recommended) for prevention of the induction of the mutagenesis. Additionally, the plates used for single colony growth should be containing the appropriate antibiotics for AP and MP, as well as tetracycline for confirmation of F-pilus positive plasmids.

PCR results with primers P1/P4 (Fig.7) showed that an amplicon of ~2.3Kb was present in all but one screened clones, while the MG1655 negative control showed the expected 546bp length for a non-integrant. MC-RFPflip-C did not show the P1-P4 amplicon because the reaction failed: the tube was damaged and the reaction mix was completely evaporated at the end of the PCR program. For this reason, a PCR was performed again on this clone (Fig.8).
The ~2.3Kb amplicon was consistent with a single integrant of <partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo>-PconRFP without the R6K-CmR DNA fragment, thus validating the successful excision of the FRT-flanked DNA fragment containing R6K-CmR and confirming that PconRFP was still present in the correct locus in single copy.
Figure 8: colony PCR with P1/P4 on MC-RFPflip-C clone. The blank is the reaction mix without bacteria. Expected amplicon for correct construct in the correct position: 2.3 Kb.
These results showed that, even if the clones were multiple tandem integrants, they became single integrants after marker excision. This is because the Flp recombinase mediated the recombination of all the FRT sites of the multiple integrants until only a single FRT site was present in the Phi80 locus, thus leaving only the single integrant of interest without the selection marker in the genome.
Validation of the marker-less phenotype:all the 6 clones were assayed as described in the Materials and Methods section. They all showed a low variability and their fluorescence was lower than their two parents, i.e. MC-RFP-A for the MC1061 strains and MG-RFP-A for the MG1655 strains (see Fig.9). This result is consistent with the copy number of the PconRFP construct in the clones, in fact both MC-RFP-A and MG-RFP-A were multiple tandem integrants, while MC-RFPflip-A,B,C and MG-RFPflip-A,B,C were single integrants, as described above.
All the MG-RFPflip showed a very low relative RFP synthesis rate when compared to the other strains, but the signal is systematically grater than the fluorescence of the negative control, thus validating the phenotype for the MG1655 strain.

Part Collection
1.Parts Collection One (Engineered Biofilm Subunit CsgA with SpyCatcher and HisTag)
a) In order to realize covalent link of two proteins, we make use of SpyTag and SpyCatcher system (see our Linkage System on Biofilm Page). The SpyTag is fused to HydA of the hydrogenase system, thus a SpyCatcher on CsgA would enable Spy-tagged Hydrogenase to be covalently attached to CsgA In the meantime, to endow biofilm CsgA protein with additional functionalities (such as specific binding to QDs or Nanorods in our case), we append one or two HisTag  at the N- or/and C-terminus of the CsgA-spycatcher protein.  This lead to two new constructs, HisTag-CsgA-SpyCatcher-HisTag ( BBa_K2132001 ) and HisTag-CsgA-SpyCatcher (the former being sequence confirmed and submitted).
➤ CsgASpyCatcherHisTag (E. coli) - BBa_K2132001
➤ mCherry-SpyTag (E. coli) - BBa_K2132003
b) To determine if  expression of the two proteins is successful, we constructed mCherry-SpyTag to test the activity of the SpyCatcher on the CsgA. mCherry-SpyTag is thus submitted as BBa_K2132003 , sequence confirmed.
2.Parts Collection Two (Hydrogenase gene clusters)
We utilize [FeFe] Hydrogenases originally from the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum (coding sequence: hydA, BBa_K2132004 & BBa_K2132005 ) to accept electrons and therefor enable catalytic production of hydrogen in our project. Synthesis of heterologous [FeFe] hydrogenase in E. coli requires co-expression of HydE (coding sequence: hydE, BBa_K2132006 ), HydF (coding sequence: hydF, BBa_K2132007 ), and HydG (coding sequence: hydG, BBa_K2132008 ).
In this collection, we sub-cloned the coding sequence into the pSB1C3 individually, with two appended tags at the N-terminus (His-tag"

During this activity, we met different kinds of people, and most of them were curious about our project and its procedure, some of them even asked whether this product will go public or not. 
What impressed us the most is that we met our seniors when he was giving out free hugs. He gave each of us a hug, which is an encouragement to us. The mutual aid like this is the value that we want to put stress on and convey.) Although there were some people who didn’t coordinate, instead of feeling upset, we remained optimistic and searched for another subject. In the end, we got nearly a hundred opinions on our project. This not only made our data more detailed, but also gave us the power to move forward.
 
 
We choose Taichung Train Station, National Science Museum, CMP block museum of arts, Taichung City Hall, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, Maple Garden, and National Taichung Theater to make the poll.

S&T month
S&T Month is a tech activity hold by Mingdao annually. In the period time of five weeks, teachers and students trained in Physics, Chemical, Earth science, Biology and iGEM lead the other students to have an inside look into the world of science. 2017 Mingdao Team arranged two days of experiment and one day of a lecture. It is because iGEM still remains unfamiliar to them that the registration is quite enthusiastic. Such an optimistic start it is our campaign on iGEM has.  
The first experiment is plasmid DNA extraction. After explaining the concept of it, we divided them into six groups, and chose a leader from our team members for every group. Most of the students had never used pipette before, which made them tense but eager to try. After all, what we students usually use are always droppers, beakers…and so on. 
  During the experiment day, we showed them our newly-opened-up lab and had them take turn operating at the same time. They all felt it cool and funny to extract the plasmid, and showed more interest in the experiment, electrophoresis, the next day. Not only did they ask questions enthusiastically, but they were more skilled because of the practices the day before.
As for the lecture on the third day, we"

Welcome to the world of creation and imagination!
As the world enters upon an age of human nature destructions, of resource starvation and the ignorance of ecological balance, the earth is more and more under the control of human beings, there is less room for the survival of animals, various kinds of microorganism are being killed and regenerated circulatory in laboratory.
However, there exsits a special kind of bacterial, who is too diligent to be willing to be controlled by human, they use their magic power to learn certain skills to being survived successfully. Reviewing their developmental history, their ancestors made great contribution to the world under successive human experiments. They show us the meaning of Biobrick, they grasp the ability to adapt themselves better to the outside world, they know how to realize their value furthest and greatly, they are the E.COLI!
Now let us begin the E.COLI magical mystery tour~~

In order to give users a clear and definite goal on input. The whole input process is divided into two main steps: Compartment Construction and Plasmid Construction. In the first step, users only need to focus on the input of environmental condition, compartment, spatial structure of compartments, and the species contained in each compartment. In the second step, only plasmids are editable, and users can click on each of them to assemble biobricks into functional device. Of course, useful tips will be given along with your input process.

At the same time, we constructed the constitutive promoter with in-promoter (Fig. 12) on the plasmids with different copy numbers to see the express of the RFP started by in-promoter.
Fig. 12 the circuit constructed on different plasmids.
4. Employed different RBS and promoters with different strengths to change the inhibitor
In order to achieve the goal of regulating the threshold of plasmid number and finally control its number to meet different needs, we decided to set up different groups consist of different RBS and promoters with different strength
Table 6. The strengths and efficiencies of different promoters and RBS
Fig. 13 Constitutive circuits to reappear the threshold concentration of inhibitors. Only few will be selected and used to prove the concept of plasmid sensing.
By now, we can give you a summary. By combining with our modeling part, we have successfully proved that:
(1) The plasmid copies can affect the concentration of inhibitor in the constitutive circuit.
(2) The concentration of inhibitor can affect the in-promoter’s activity and affect the expression of killer gene in the end.
(3) Our system can help the cell sense the number of plasmids.
(4) The number of plasmids can affect the expression of killer gene.
When the plasmid number is above its threshold, the concentration of inhibitor being high enough, the killer gene can be repressed completely.
When the plasmid number is below the threshold, the inhibitor won’t work anymore, the killer can get the chance.
Killer device
Since the lethal efficiency of killer genes will decide the capacity of general circuit, so we have to:
1. Prove that the toxin protein we selected can successfully express and the lethal effect is obvious
2. Adjust the translation efficiency of toxin proteins through replace ribosome binding                                 site (RBS), thus to adjust the threshold
3. Construct gene circuits connecting killer device and inhibitor device
4. Find another possible way to produce the lethal effect
Results:
1. Successfully constructed the testing circuits of toxin proteins [Part: BBa_K2120002 and Part: BBa_K2120003 ]
2. After transformation, we measured the OD600 to draw the growth curve and observed the function of toxin protein.
3. In addition to B0032, we selected a stronger RBS B0034 and a weaker one B0031. Through measuring OD600, we demonstrated that we can adjust"

Introduction (May 29 - June 2)
The first foray into human-computer interaction! We started with a basic introduction to the concepts of HCI research and the lab's particular goals and projects. Also included were the subteams our labs were divided into - I ended up in the Information Workflow and eLab Notebook groups, but my team members were to arrive next week. Still, since it was just the inofmration-gathering phase at the moment, being able to communicate via email was more than enough.
But before I started with workflow and ELN research, Consuelo sat me down in front of Samsung surface and gave me a thick Surface-programming training manual to work on. It was my first contact with XML and C# - they reminded me a lot of HTML and CSS/JS, though, but that does make sense. It was an interesting experience to dissect the logic in the code I was instructed to write and see familiar patterns in it.
Once that was done (which was a shame), it was time to start researching the ELN. We had a number of preliminary readings to do, which covered the current state of commercial ELNs to new and dramatically different implementations of the technology. It was quite a large volume of information to process, but it's exciting to see that technology in labs is a lot closer to the futuristic equipment shown in the media than I'd previously thought.

Agnes is originally from Linköping and will soon be finished with her bachelors             in             biology at Linköping University. As a team advisor Agnes will be supporting the             team             with her experiences from last year’s project. She is very hopeful regarding the             subject and is eager to make a contribution in the research field of green             fuels.
Biology is not Agnes only interest; photography is another one. She likes to             photograph everything from people to nature to macrophotos of things like             flowers.             If you are in Linköping and want company taking photos of things and people,             contact             her and she can accompany you!
