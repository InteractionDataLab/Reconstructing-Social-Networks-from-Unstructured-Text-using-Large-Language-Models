TU-Delft,2012,Team:TU-Delft#part1_-_-_TEXT.html," localization of the receptor into the membrane.
When inducing the niacin receptor strain with niacin we observed that the flow cytometry peak of the induced receptor strain was shifted to a lower fluorescent intensity. This might be an indication that the cells stopped growing and thus there was a reaction on the ligand! For the banana receptor strains we had difficulties with the DNA staining in combination with the ligand Isoamyl acetate.
Recommendations
During growth of yeast cells transformed with the expression vector we observed two things: not all the cells maintain the right plasmid and the cells grew slower than wild type cells. A reason for this could be that the expression of the receptor is disadvantageously for the cells. Therefor we recommend for future work to use an inducible promoter instead of a strong constitutive promoter. In that case one can make the yeast cells expressing the receptor just before testing the strain.

*If the CZ works with the aequorin, the next step will be testing the PCZ with the aequorin.
Ken Chen has a plate reader, but we don’t know if it is a fluorescent plate reader (this would be useful for the characterization of the transfections with aequorin and CHR2)
Shine light at 475nm and detect at what wavelength?! We want to use a plate reader that will allow us to account for timing because if we’re shining light and detecting the same wavelength that we’re shining, we won’t be finding real data?
We want to shine the light, turn the light off, then measure
What if we: add coelenterazine, some is taken up by the cell, add gaussia to the solution (and it’s a big protein that can’t get into the cell), so it will take all of the extracellular coelenterazine and use that to make light, this light will activate the CHR2 which will take up the calcium, then (some of the coelenterazine is assumed to be taken up by the cell), and aequorin will use the coelenterazine and calcium to emit another light.  All of these wavelengths are around 480nm.
So we should see the background light up, and hopefully a little bit later we will see the cells themselves light up
Things we need to think about: how long each of them light up for (there is information in the kinetics of each of these components, along with their half lives, in the email that Jordan sent us)
How long did the luminometer measure the gaussia: 10 seconds (that’s how long the light shines)"

star_borderAs a team, we registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and  attended the Giant Jamboree in Boston, MA.
star_borderAs a team, we finished our Wiki, submitted our Judging form, completed our Poster, and presented at the Jamboree.
star_borderWe clearly laid out the work done by students on the team, advisors, our Wiki design collaborators, ensuring every individual and group involved in our project has been credited for their work on our Attributions page.
star_borderWe improved the characterization of two existing biobrick parts, namely BBa_K1900002 (E. coli tolC) and BBa_K1291571 (Horse Radish Peroxidase Type C).
check_circleSilvercheck_circle
star_halfOur team designed and tested the function of a new part BBa_K2589000 and a new composite part BBa_K2589002 based on BBa_K2589000 with the addition of the trc-promoter ( BBa_K2042004 ). The expression and functionality of these parts was analyzed and presented on the appropriate pages in the Registry.
star_halfWe were able to Collaborate in a significant way with the 2018 Cornell iGEM Team by receiving mentoring and materials that have improved our team function as we deal with a large influx of new members. We have also provided data regarding water safety and Outreach effectiveness through surveys to the IIT Kanpur iGEM team and the Copenhagen iGEM team.
star_halfWLC-iGEM spent a significant amount of time considering and analyzing the possible impact of our project on the community and environment, speaking with members of the public and water resource experts, and engaging a wide portion of our community in our project and Bioengineering through our Outreach efforts.

Protein Expression
Dominant Sectors
Proteins are expressed through transcription, translation process. Transcription involves RNA polymerase binding, RNA formation; translation involves the binding of ribosome complex to RBS site, elongation and termination. The bindings of first two processes are the limiting and rate-defining step.All of these substances can be degraded, therefore each has a degradation rate. It can be seen how many parameters there are!
Models usually relay on searching the parameters from previous works, but the values are measured under different conditions by different methods so the errors cannot be simply ignored. To make things worse, the ordinary differential equations are sensitive to parameters, and the errors will be amplified with time.
To exemplify how error can be amplified, we would like to use model and parameter values from previous iGEM competitions. We appreciate the work done by 2015 TU Delft iGEM Team [13] . They measured the fluorescence which is similar to our methods, therefore we choose their results for illustration.
We add a normal-distributed random relative error with a maximum of 5% to each of the 9 parameters in their model, which is far within the significant digit of these parameters. The procedure is repeated for 100 times, with the results of which we estimate how error in parameters will influence the predictions. Figure 9 is the calculation result, and the red area is the 70% confidence interval. The mean relative error is around 10%.
Fig. 9
Prediction of GFP and errors of 2015 TU Delft iGEM Team’s model by adding random relative error with a maximum of 5%. The green curve is the mean value, and red area is the range mean value added and subtracted by the standard error.
The example above clearly demonstrates the fact that, ODE model is sensitive to the values of parameters. Therefore, a model with as many as 9 parameters collected from different sources are not only unnecessary but also unreliable.
Can there be a model that fulfill the same functions as the traditional models, but with less parameters and with the least experiments? Actually, it is possible.
Generally, the processes of protein can be precisely modeled as equation (9).

Team Substrate Analytic:
Anthracen control
Ethinylestradiol control
We analyze Anthracen and Ethinyl estradiol from the 13th September. As you can see in the following figures Anthracen distingrates and Ethinyl estradiol on the other hand was stable. The corelation between the first peak and the other two peaks on Ethinyl estradiol may a pipetting mistake since the other two peaks are nearly simular. Distingration on Anthracen, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, were tested in different media and we determine that it depends on the Britton-Puffer ( read more )

In addition, rheumatoid arthritis can also increase the burden on the national economy. The United States has once carried out an epidemiological survey, showing that annual cost on rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid-related treatment is more than 1% of its GDP. Though there is no such exact data in China, it is estimated that the financial loss caused by this disease is not less than the United States. As the aging problem becomes increasingly prominent, this national economic burden will become more and more heavy. If a new treatment can be designed to cure this disease radically, it will be of great significance in promoting public health and people’s health conditions.

Finding new treatments
CAR-T, short for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy, is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. This is a new cytotherapy that has existed for many years but hasn’t been used clinically until some recent improvement. Similar to other immunotherapies, its basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to specifically remove cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6, T cells are differentiated and enriched by in vivo injection of cytokines, and then the target cells are separated by cell surface markers. Next, the cells are engineered in vitro with CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor), and are amplified by cell culture to a certain number before returned to the patient's body. In this way, the engineered T cells can kill the target cells specifically in vivo.
Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cytotherapy
We discussed how to design a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis during our group meeting (Figure 7) and with our advisor in depth. Eventually, based on traditional CAR-T, we chose Treg cells as engineering targets in the purpose of curing rheumatoid arthritis, and we innovatively introduced a Syn-Notch system to enhance the stability of the engineered Treg cells in vivo. We came to form a new Syn-Notch CAR-Treg system (the overall idea shown in Figure 8) after some optimization on our design.

This Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be followed in research laboratories, where workers are likely to be exposed to biological pathogens. We have to obey to the rules of health, safety, and preventive medicine applied in public services in France (Decree No. 82-453). This decree refers to the Labour Code, Public Health Code and Environmental Code.
Basic rules in a lab
We have to apply the basic safety principles in all laboratory rooms:
- It is forbidden to smoke in all rooms.
- It is forbidden to drink and eat in the laboratory rooms.
- It is compulsory to wear a closed lab coat in cotton.
- It is compulsory to wear closed shoes.
- Long hair must be tied back.
- Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory.
There are also others precautions when working with biological organisms:
- We need to wash our hands regularly.
- It is compulsory to wear gloves except for the use of an electric burner.
- In some cases (UV light, projection risk), it is compulsory to wear protection glasses.
Safety in the Lab
- Equipments: As soon as we manipulate in the lab, we have to wear the following personal protective equipments (a conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves, closed shoes, gloves, glasses if needed).
- Storage: 3 cup-boards for different kinds of chemical products: flammable, acids, bases.
- Waste: Different trash containers are available in the lab:
- One for biological waste. This waste will be autoclaved before being thrown out.
- One for common waste.
- Special waste for chemicals.
- Special waste for waste in contact with ethidium bromide.
- Biological safety cabinet: To work into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms, we have used a biological safety cabinet (FASTER – Ultrasafe). This BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation. A control of maintenance is done each year. The last control was executed on October 25th 2015.
- Water-bathes: We often used the water-bathes for transformation or digestion, etc. They can be dangerous because of the exposition to hot or even boiling water. To protect us, wearing a lab coat and special gloves was indispensable. The same equipment is necessary for the microwave.
- Ethidium Bromide: For some manipulations (to reveal gel electrophoresis), we have used ethidium bromide and UV light. Thus, a dark room is dedicated for that. This room is"

Meeting with Dr Sharon Dixon - Head of the Inclusivity Group at the University of Exeter
On 27/09/16 we spoke to Dr Sharon Dixon, a senior lecturer in Sport and Health Science and current head of the Inclusivity Group at the University of Exeter, for her experiences of gender inequality and her view of what needs to be done to change the lack of diversity in science. Dr Dixon’s views compounded many that we had heard from the interviews with both students and academics over the process. Whilst Dr Lewis spoke positively about how much the university had progressed over the last few years in terms of equality and diversity, Dr Dixon commented on how bad the problem was before:
There was no recognised mechanism for reporting back to anybody, we didn’t really know who we were reporting to.
What was surprising was how long ago this was - only around 7 years. In that sense, the university, and universities in general, have come a long way in the last 7 years, coming from a system where the main role of the head of Equality and Diversity was
receiving emails from students who require extra time in exams
, which many would argue isn’t related at all to Equality and Diversity. Dr Dixon did warn however that:
By having Athena Swan, gender has taken over and has become the only issue
This confirms some of our fears about the fight to change equality and diversity in science. When we began working on equality and diversity, we had the view to look at diversity in science as a whole, however, the more people we spoke to the more we looked into gender inequality and the more we saw how much of a problem it was. Therefore we can understand why the university would be focusing so much on improving gender equality, however if gender has become the only issue then we cannot condone that. Dr Dixon went on to talk about the new Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group was set up to combat other issues like disability, sexuality and ethnicity.
This university is very very positive, there is that support structure at this university
Dr Dixon echoed many of the views raised by Dr Lewis, of the importance of role models and mentors to the development of both students and academic staff. Dr Dixon did stress however that mentors and role models do not need to be gender specific, and this may be a way of changing the more unconscious biases in gender. If we encourage people that a mentor can be someone who has experience of certain areas that you require help with, no matter the gender, then you might be able to reduce"

Synthetic biology: from unique chassis to synthetic consortia
Synthetic biology is based on Nature everlasting possibilities, usually by inserting genetic information from microorganisms into a single and unique chassis 1 , 2 , 3 . However, a single chassis could present inevitable limits (high genetic burden, incompatibility of some elements with the chassis, too complex design…). These start to be a limit in synthetic biology, its perspectives and applications 4 . An emerging solution is the use of synthetic consortium (figure 1). Synthetic consortium have the advantage to require less amount of genetic information into a single chassis to achieve the required process since different microorganisms can share the genetic burden. Moreover, the components of the consortium could be selected to reduce the genetic modifications and increase the chance of success, for example, by taking advantage of already existing signaling or metabolic pathways. Several successes of those synthetic consortia, such as production of bio-electricity 5 or shortening bio-manufacturing process like C-vitamin synthesis 6 have provided insight into the strength of this approach.
Figure 1: General concept of the cell to cell communication. This cascade of events will be developed in our project.
Such approaches are still rare in the iGEM competition, maybe because they require to combine classic strain engineering with information processing strategies. So, our challenge was to demonstrate the power and feasibility of synthetic consortium approach to open new perspectives and applications to iGEMers.
As a proof of concept, we developed a strategy against cholera. It is based on a cascade of events starting from an engineered Escherichia coli strain mimicking Vibrio cholerae. It triggers a sensor bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, which in turn activates the effector cell (the yeast P"

The Team
We are descendants from a place that emerged from a very slow geological process from millions  of years ago. Results that still impact the world. This place is called PANAMA. A place where history can be divided into many chapters. Beginning with the linking of North and South America, enabling the exchange of species from both locations, making evolution possible to make use of this place as a huge laboratory. Years later in our history this became one of the scenarios for pirates looking for gold in the new world. This earth that links the world, owns one of the greatest engineering milestones, The Panama Canal , and now the expansion of it is without precedent. We as young scientist are part of the enterprise involving genetic engineering through the iGEM competition. Now Panama has two great engineering projects, one is the expansion of the Panama canal as a macro engineering project and our project as micro and nano scale engineering. This makes us pioneers in this field in our country.
This year our team is composed by students from the University of Panama , Latina University of Panama and one student from Technological University of Panama . All of us studying different careers such as Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry and Engineering. Also is very important to mention that we do have new members on the team this year, and also that we had participated in someway of the creation of the new team from Panama which is the UTP-PANAMA . Good wishes for them...
We were advised by several Academics representants. They all did an amazing job of providing us a positive feedback. That´s why we are very grateful with all of them.

Before synthesis, blast the primer using software like Vector NTI or other methods to check the specificity. The primers are synthesized by GeneWise. After the arriving of the primers, perform a quick spin and then dissolve the DNA powder using ddwater in the given volume.
PCR Volume:
If the PCR product will be used for testing, we suggest that the volume should be under 20 μl. If the PCR product will be used for any downstream operation (eg. Purification, gel extraction, restriction enzyme digestion), higher volume such as 50μl should be used. And for every sample, there should be at least two parallels. So, mix the total mixture in a 1.5ml centrifuge tube beforehand and then separate the desired volume mixture into each PCR tube is recommended.
PCR Reaction Mixture:
We used 2×PrimeSTAR Mix from TAKARA and 2×Taq Master Mix from LifeFeng for PCR reaction, which have already contained buffer, magnesium, dNTP and polymerase. The amount of primer should be at around 10μM and the total amount of template should be under 200ng as the protocols require (less template is needed if use genomic DNA or plasmid DNA as template, see specifically in the protocols of the products). Additionally, the bacteria liquid template must not be too much or else small fragments of bacteria may cause a jam while performing gel analysis. And pay attention to the overlapping PCR: the amount of the two templates should be equal and the primer is added later (see specifically at the example “Overlapping PCR”).
PCR Conditions:
Denaturing conditions-94℃～98℃ for 5~15 seconds. For bacteria liquid PCR, longer denaturing time (10~15minutes) is required for completely cell splitting. Annealing temperature-the annealing temperature is usually 3~5℃ lower than the melting temperatures of primers. If the melting temperatures of two primers differ greatly (for example, >5℃), try gradient PCR to find out the appropriate annealing temperature. Here are examples of the three kinds of PCR that we used in the experiments:

There is no significant difference between whether people have specific religion and the answer “YES/ Partly YES”.  There is a significant difference between whether people have specific religion and the answer “NO”.
In conclusion, it seems that whether having specific religion can influence whether GM is ethically permissible or not.

Conclusion
In the result of the questionnaire we conducted in 2013, we can see the influence of religion. To the contrary, the effect of knowledge level is not observed. However, in the questionnaire in 2010, people’s attitude varied according to knowledge level. In this time, since our aim is to shed light on effect except for knowledge, we made fewer question to measure knowledge level. This is why a knowledge level made next to no difference to this survey. Learning from the result of the two survey, because we should not interfere with others’ religion, we have to give them knowledge about synthetic biology considering what each individual believe in.
Future Work
From the questionnaire we conducted, there seemed to be a difference in the tolerance of genetically modification, depending on the answers’ religion. Moreover, this difference may have generated not only from religion but also from the difference between region and culture. We would like to conduct surveys on factors such as region, culture, economic development, and so on, in order to find out which factor influence the tolerance.
Other Activities
Life Science Seminar in High School
Toyonaka high school conducts some programs to increase the number of students who learn university-level biology. As one of the programs, we held a seminar in Toyonaka high school at (2013/1/12-13). In this seminar, we lectured molecular biology and experiments to the students. Through this activity, students seemed to feel a familiarity with life science and we were able to give essential knowledge.

On Saturday we flooded these plates with 10 mL of broth, scraped of the top agar, placed the agar and broth into a centrifuge tube, and spun it at 4C and 12000 rpm for 10 minutes. The contents were then poured into clean 15 mL tubes and labeled T4Do-UV 7.5 min and T4-Mut-UV 7.5 min.
We then removed 50 uL from each lysate and placed on parafilm to prepare an electron microscope grid. The grids were suspended on top of the droplets for 20 minutes. The grids were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH = 7) by placing the grid on a 50 uL droplet for 2 minutes.  The grids were dried and imaged on x-ray film.

IngenuityLab_Canada,2016,Team:IngenuityLab Canada#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html,"addou: The geekStarter Workshop was fantastic. It was definitely an enjoyable experience and quite an opportunity to speak to previous competitors and other authorities in the field of synthetic biology. The opportunity to have some one on one time with each presenter was really good in allowing a different perspective to be addressed in regards to the project and its development. Also having the presentation in regards to the protocol and regulations for IGEM was really good. It gave a better understanding of what is looked for and areas to address. One thing that would have been great to have would have been some time to interact with other teams competing and attending the workshop. Beyond that it was a great and informative weekend!
Sharing our wonders
Date: June 28, 2016
Our team spent a morning at the St. Elizabeth Seton School to encourage them to explore the wonders of science. The Grand 9 students were very interested in the science experiment and the team dynamic exercises that they took partake in with the iGEM team. Extraction Strawberry DNA using common household items such as detergent and alcohol showed them that science experiments are not exclusive to lab but can be performed at their home or even in a garage lab. In the audience when asked If any of their houses had solar panels, surprisingly not a single hand was raised indicating that none of their houses were had their own solar panels.
Students were asked if they knew the source of the electricity their home is receiving and not a single person could confidently answer it. This showed that lack of adoption of solar panels and also the lack of awareness regarding energy source. The students were also intrigued by new type of solar cell that we presented as our iGEM project that uses plant's component, the photosystem II protein.
Our short interaction with the junior high students enhanced their scientific knowledge but also it showed that our project has potential to create awareness and a new type of system that have higher efficiency compared to traditional solar cells. The foundation of using plant components for energy can transform in wide adoption of solar panels as a renewable source of energy.
Thinking back to square one
Date: August 26, 2016
On May 2, the day we started working at a lab, our supervisor emailed us a list of buffers to prepare. News flash, working with each other running around figuring out how the new lab functions all the hassle brought the e reign of craze and tension over us. Advisor meticulously watched every detail of our work. Questioned and corrected every error and gently guided us throughout the way. For some of us, the basics such as adjusting pH of a solution, degassing, filtering, and doing everything"

EVENTS
The European Experience
The concept of the European Experience 2016 was both simple and bold: two teams would work together in order to organize in Paris the gathering of most of the iGEM 2016 European teams.
It all started during the brainstorming sessions of our team. We talked about the previous editions of the iGEM competition, and realized that, if America or Asia had regional meetups every year, Europe didn’t have one since the end of the « official » iGEM regional meetups system. We therefore had the idea, for the first time in the history of the iGEM, to organize a big event of our own. We also wanted to make this event a collaborative project with another iGEM team. That is why we worked with the Evry iGEM team to carry out the project.
The event, named The European Experience 2016, aimed to bring together European iGEM teams in order to:
Share our iGEM experience / adventures (successes, failures, issues, knowledge, human experiences...)
Create partnerships and strengthen the bonds between the attending teams
Train the pitch and presentation skills in order to prepare to the Boston Giant Jamboree
To discover the projects of other teams
Allow a cultural exchange and the discovery of Paris, the City of Light
Increase the general knowledge about Synthetic Biology through conferences and events

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Other languages_-_-_TEXT.html," De voorgestelde strategie doet denken aan het eeuwenoude Trojaanse paard gezien bacteriën niet in staat zijn gallium te onderscheiden van ijzer. Wij zijn ervan overtuigd dat we met het aanvallen van een zeer goed geconserveerde metabolische pathway een succesvole tactiek hebben gevonden om multiresistente bacteriën te bestrijden.
Het iGEM team van Hamburg werkt dit jaar aan een Trojaans-paard-aanpak voor het bestrijden van multiresistente bacteriën zoals Pseudomonas aeruginosa en Klebsiella pneumoniae met als uitgangspunt synthetische biologie. “Trojaans paard” impliceert dat we een vector gebruiken die een doeltreffend drug aanlevert dat zal opgenomen worden door de beoogde bacterie. Deze vectoren zijn sideroforen, een polypeptide klasse die gesynthetiseerd worden door bacteriën om hun ijzervoorraad aan te vullen zodat ze kunnen prolifereren. Sideroforen hebben een hoge ijzer affiniteit and zijn in staat om vrije ionen vanuit de omgeving of andere moleculen te halen door een sterk chelaatcomplex te vormen. Het vermogen van sideroforen om ionen te complexeren is echter niet gelimiteerd to ijzer. Dit gegeven willen wij uitbuiten. Met een chemische uitwisselingsreactie zullen we het ijzer vanuit de siderofoor verwijderen en er gallium ionen aan toevoegen zodat een gelijkaardig complex gevormd wordt dat dan opgenomen wordt door de beoogde bacteriën. Gallium heeft echter bewezen cytotoxische effecten. Omdat sideroforen zeer specifiek zijn voor bepaalde pathogene organismen zal zo’n therapie enkel deze organismen aanvallen zonder de normale flora van de gastheer aan te tasten. Om een werkend systeem te creëren, zullen we all disciplines van onze teamleden combineren. Onze Bio-wetenschappen en Biologie afdeling zullen bacteriën manipuleren om twee soorten sideroforen te creëren van de salicylaat pathway, namelijk Pyochelin en"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized BBa_B0034 corresponding to mean strength of 1.
Stronger ribosome binding sites increase the yield of translated proteins and in turn increase the number of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides. This increase is inversely proportional to the assigned mean methylation score. Based on this fact, the activity results can be extracted from mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) and correspond to ribosome binding site strength because the same enzyme and substrate nucleotide concentration were used during the activity recording. The catalytic activity sequencing results were compared to earlier measured in bulk RBS strength results. The comparison once again concludes the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The ribosome binding site strength, extracted from the DNA sequence reference nucleotide count correlates with measurements made with accurate standard assays. These results display the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the strength of regulatory sequences and its ability to assign accurate phenotype to genotype linkage.
Toehold riboswitch activity and orthogonality sequencing
The constructed Toehold regulatory sequence library constituted of different toehold and triggers pairs was constructed subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was extracted and sequenced with Nanopore. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different regulatory sequence were filtered and extracted.
Figure 23. The evaluation of Toehold-Trigger riboregulatory sequence orthogonality using CAT-Seq.         The catalytic activity of esterase genes, regulated by different Toehold switches were measured using CAT-Seq. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded regulatory construct DNA template was filtered and essigned. Low methylation scores correspond to actively expressed protein and are only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present verifying the already measured orthogonality of regulatory parts.
The graph displays the mean methylation (reference nucleotide count) scores assigned to each barcoded toehold-trigger construct read. Based on the results, low methylation score are only assigned to those parts, that are constituted of Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group. This means that esterase enzyme was expressed and catalyzed the conversion of substrate nucleotides. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results. Based on this fact, it can be concluded that CAT-Seq activity sequencing method can be utilized as a precise and accurate way to screen and assign the activity and orthogonality of regulatory sequences in a high throughput"

ADOPE
The aim of ADOPE is to develop a complete method for gene doping detection. The design of this method was an iterative process, with constant evolutions based on data obtained from wetlab, drylab and interaction with stakeholders. The final method consists of four main steps: sample preparation , prescreening , targeted library preparation and DNA sequencing and analysis .
Figure 1. The flow diagram of our detection method ADOPE. With the four steps sample preparation, prescreening, library preparation and sequencing.
1. Sample Preparation
The target of our detection method is the specific gene doping DNA, which is extracted from blood samples. Based on the advice and expertise of Aïcha Ait Soussan and Dr. Ellen van der Schoot of the Dutch blood bank Sanquin, we developed a specific extraction and verification protocol to handle the relative low concentrations of gene doping DNA expected to be present in the blood ( Lee et al, 2001 , Ershova et al, 2017 , Zinkova et al, 2017 ). These concentrations were predicted by modeling the process that the administered gene doping DNA goes through in the body. The model also determined the detection window of our method. By applying the modeling results in the wetlab we optimized the sample preparation for the detection of gene doping. The main steps of the sample preparation are shown in"

As for our Human Practices element of iGEM we will be collaborating with the team from St Andrews at the World Debating competition next week. We plan to present both the pros and cons of synthetic biology which will then be followed by an informal discussion into the various issues associated with synthetic biology.
While work on the microcompartment continues the rest of team began cloning their individual projects onto the biobrick plasmid. As well as this an expression strain of E.coli MG165 were transformed with our plasmids so that we may carry out experiments allowing us to fully characterise what we have cloned.
Diary: Week 9
The seven genes which encode the bacterial microcompartment have successfully all been cloned into E.coli and have been fully sequenced. The focus of this week was to make all our bacteria with the various targeting proteins such as GFP/mCherry and ferrtin competent so that they may be transformed with plasmids which have the microcompartment genes.
On Sunday we took part in our discussion along with the iGEM team from St Andrews with participants from the World Debating Competition. This event was a great success with some excellent input from all that took part. Videos will be available soon. Towards the end of the week we all went out on group outing termed the ‘Last Supper’ to a local Italian restaurant which serves the best Italian around many thanks to our supervisor Frank Sargent for taking us there.
Diary: Week 10
The final week of iGEM is upon us. The majority of this week was spent performing Western Blotts and protein purifications as well some 35S radioactive labelling experiments which have provided some very interesting results which will be spoken about in Amsterdam. iGEM has been a brilliant experience and I think I speak for the whole team when I say it is something that if you have the opportunity to do you should definitely take part. The competition provides a great deal of lab experience something which is much sought after but also allows you to take part in a new and very exciting field of biology.

MOS(KIT)O A biosilica-based detection device for (re)emerging arboviral infectious diseases
           
The global distribution of arboviruses.
The massive use of insecticides causes resistance in mosquitoes.
After many brainstorming sessions and after an exhaustive literature search...
MOS(KIT)O emerged!!
Abstract
Vector-borne (re) emerging diseases are responsible for severe epidemics worldwide. In most cases, vaccines or treatments are not available, and insecticides are the primary source for vector control. Consequently, over-spraying of insecticides impacts the environment and leads to the selection of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Therefore, we developed a novel diagnostic device, Mos(kit)o, that includes a fixed or mobile mosquito trap and a biosilica cellulose composite patch from genetically modified E. coli bacteria. The design of the patch creates a multilayered matrix coated with antibodies able to detect a wide panel of vector-borne pathogens and insecticide-resistant proteins from captured mosquitoes. Additionally, the patch will have 2D barcoded readouts, generating an environmental surveillance database. A precise map of vector hot spots will provide a better assessment and response to vector-borne diseases, assisting local health authorities with anticipating and preparing for an epidemic. Our tool will be user-friendly, safe, and applicable.

OpenScope is intended as a more general, digital solution, with each user developing its different aspects to suit their current needs. In this respect, it differs greatly from conventional microscopes.
Figures 2-6: (left to right) OpenScope, Commercial Fluorescence Microscope [1], Foldscope [2], FlyPi [3], Smartphone Microscope [4]
Social Impact
We envisage OpenScope having a significant impact in many different applications:
Education: Bright field microscopes can be found in most secondary schools and some primary schools. Fluorescence microscopes are far beyond the budget of most schools. By introducing synthetic biology to students at an early stage of education,  through the use of fluorescence microscopy, it may be possible to address the communication gap between researchers and the general public. At our Outreach Event there was significant  interest from teachers to have synthetic biology and the techniques that underpin it implemented in the school curriculum. OpenScope makes this a possibility. It also allows for integrated learning across many STEM subjects including computer programming, microscope assembly projects and interactive homework exercises.
Research: Most research labs can afford even the most expensive microscopes, but budget constraints mean there is usually only a handful for the entire department. OpenScope is a tool that can be used alongside the commercial microscopes to enable researchers to quickly image new samples, or perform time-lapse imaging. OpenScope is compact, allowing it to be placed within fume hoods or incubators. This facilitates imaging in environments well beyond the lab bench. Lastly, OpenScope addresses the need for highly customisable research equipment that can be tailored to specific experiments
On the move: OpenScope is light-weight and can be battery powered. This makes it ideal for fieldwork and travelling. It can also be controlled by remote access, allowing you to check on your samples in the lab from the comfort of your home.
Developing countries: It is hoped that OpenScope will provide access to techniques previously reserved for privileged laboratories, and represent a low-cost tool that any lab anywhere in the world can modify and make their own
Integrated Design
Integration of Pre-Existing Microscope
Our design incorporates a number for key features that were developed as part of a contemporary project at the University of Cambridge [5]. The PiScope is an inverted brightfield microscope that uses 3D printed parts in a flexure-based mechanism for sample translation.
Although OpenScope is an upright microscope, it makes use of plastic flexure in the microscope stage to give fine control"

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour20_-_-_TEXT.html,"bohydrates are digested to glucose molecules in the human gut. From here they travel into the blood system and are transported all around the body. Muscles use glucose as an energy source by degrading it  through heat producing processes. Remaining amounts of glucose are stored as glycogen in the liver or as  fatty acids in adipose tissue, which allow us to maintain the needed blood sugar level during starvation.
Proteins are made of amino acids that act as the major building blocks for all enzymes and proteins in the  human body. Furthermore proteins are a structural component of bones, muscles and the immune system.  There are 20 common amino acids, from which 10 are essential, which means that the human body is  unable to synthesize them and we need to get them through the diet.
Fats are built up by long carbon chains and function as an energy source. Fats can be stored in the adipose tissue where it insulates the body and protects organs against pressure and stress. Additionally, some  fats are of vital importance as they are involved in the uptake of fat-soluble essential vitamins. Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012: Nutrition for everyone.

We spearheaded an RBS characterization effort across three different teams - ourselves, University of Pittsburgh iGEM,          and Alverno College iGEM - using three different biological systems: one in-cell, two cell-free solutions. We sent a          blinded version of the RBS library to University of Pittsburgh’s iGEM team, who then proceeded to characterize the          RBSs in the cell free system S30. We also sent a blinded library to the high school team Alverno, who characterized          them using Richard Murray’s TX-TL cell free system. Our collaboration brought about the first time in iGEM, to our knowledge,          of measuring the entire RBS community library over a variety of induction conditions. Such rigorous characterization of the          RBS library, and iGEM parts in general, is necessary to ensure the validity of the use of those parts. Particularly with the          RBSs, this characterization allowed us to have greater confidence in their ability to tune the amplitude of any given transfer          function. These parts were critical in securing a portion of our circuit control toolbox. They also provided the teams we         collaborated with the ability to use them in their own genetic circuits. Further, such rigorous characterization encourages -          and often requires - collaboration between teams.
We also collaborated with the high school team of Broad Run iGEM. Broad Run iGEM had used activities from our 2015 educational          outreach activity booklet in their outreach events. Our main Education and Public Engagement project is the creation of          learnsynbio.org, which is a collection of educational videos and materials for high-school age STEM students. We worked with          Broad Run to facilitate the incorporation of the LearnSynBio module into their advanced biology classes. We also provided          guidance and advice on the development and implementation of their mathematical modeling in MATLAB.
We also participated in the Interlab Study .

Our Backbones.
Standard BioBrick cloning is a universal way of putting two BioBrick parts together to build a new BioBrick part. Despite several alternative cloning methods allow the assembly of multiple parts at one its simplicity and the broad availability of compatible parts keep it the 'de facto' standard of the iGEM-community.
Using standard BioBrick cloning, the generation of translationally active parts requires often more than one round of cloning. The ability to easily test the functionality of a protein before cloning them into complicated circuits has the potential to prevent many unsuccessful experiments of iGEM teams and may improve the characterization of the parts in the parts registry. However the extra amount"

Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343007_-_-_TEXT.html," half and to darkness on the right half.
Since exposure to blue light should decrease the phototaxic bacterias tumbling frequency, the expected result was that the colony which was placed between the light and dark half of the plate would spread out in the darkness and would not move further when it reached the light. This is counter-intuitive, since decreased tumbling should lead to a longer distance traveled. What happens at the microscopic scale in semisolid agar is that the agar creates a matrix like structure where channels are running through the agar, that the bacteria can swim through. The decrease in tumbling frequency of the bacteria will make it harder for them to find the channels in the agar to swim through, which leads to them being trapped where they were placed. The result is that a colony which shows an increased run time, will look as if it was non-motile on these plates [ 1 ]. Our results showed exactly this; the bacterial culture had spread out onto the dark half of the plate and did not get nearly as far on the half exposed to light. This experiment was done with a normal wildtype MG1655 and a non-motile strain of E.coli, DH5alpha, as controls. As expected these cells did not show anything like the behavior described above, which indicates that the effect stems from the modification of our photosensing bacteria.
These results were useable, but not fully conclusive, since there were some non-optimal conditions present in this experiment. We used ambient light instead of pure blue light, and the exposure to light for the multiple samples was not exactly even. Therefore we had to improve our experimental setup and see if we could reproduce these results with a more reliable setup.
Experiment 2
The experiment described above was repeated in a more controlled environment. This means that there were no changes as to how the plates or bacterial cultures were prepared, so we refer again to protocol PS1.1 in regards to how this was done. The difference lies in the setup of the light-controlled environment. What we did this time was that the plates was illuminated from above by a single light source in an otherwise completely dark environment, we prepared a cut-out so that the light would only hit one half of our plates and the other half would remain in the dark. Since the problem with the last experiment was that the light source was just normal white light (which contains a lot of different wavelengths), this time around we used an optical filter so that only light with a wavelength of around 470nm could pass through, which resulted in a blue light shining down on the plates. The light-source itself was a"

Help SCU_China by developing SD Finder
In our communication activities, SCU_China team introduced to us an interesting idea. They want to find out SD sequence in DNA and analyze the strength of the SD sequence that affects translation issues. Then, they can standardize the strong SD sequence, so that it can be reused in future.
But there are two barriers in their works. One is how to find out all of unknown SD sequence in a DNA sequence. The other one is how to analyze the strength of SD sequence.
To deal with these two problems, we cooperated with SCU_China team( https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCU_China/Collaborations ) and CHINA_CD_UESTC( https://2015.igem.org/Team:CHINA_CD_UESTC/Collaborations ) team to study how to find out SD sequence and analyze the strength of it.
Then we developed an online software based on browser—SD Finder, which is used in helping users predict the location of ORF and SD sequence in DNA. User only needs to type sequence that needs to be predicted, select the initiation codons and termination codons. Then comes the prediction.
Online software based on browser—SD finder
We provide the related information about ORF and SD sequence in the result page. The column of SD sequence lists a 13bp sequence from -2 to -14 in upstream of ORF. We also tag the position of SD sequence signals with red. And the last column lists the type of the strength of the SD sequence.

Report about the teacher'workshop in Paris (Bastiaan).
Everyone was very motivated, we also met members of the team from Groningen (NL). An introduction was given in which we were told we are at the beginning of a new era. We should not exppect to solve large problems like cancer but start out slow and easy. Some teams are larger than ours (12 members) and some are already working with parts in the wet lab.
The main wiki page should be the WiKi on iGEM. Two weeks before the Jamboree this will be locked! If nothing is there it will not be evaluated! Also be sure we have all information on the wiki before this closing date.
In general: Documentation is one of the most important parts of the iGEM project!
Beware errors are possible in the current DNA archive. Be sure to check by restriction analysis if you have the correct construct! If we foind an eronous construct the correct one can be dsipatched quicklly
www.partsregistry.org : large source of information on the parts, also protocols for extracting the DNA from the provides folder and making compentent cells. Registering parts: Start registration from the start of developement or even generation of the idea.
We have to impress/stunn/amaze the Judges: generate a novel and original idea (poineering, cutting edge, ambitious). Split the idea in steps/milestones and work on one step at the time (kind of modular organisation of the project).
Teams are invited to contribute to an inter-lab comparisson within iGEM.
Many protocols can be found on openwetware, however be aware the ones in the iGEM registry are tested and proven to work, using other protocols are on your own account (if you do, document/report)
Building on previous projects is encouraged, as long as you document it well and be sure to refer/acknowledge iGEM and the specific team.

Collaborations among iGEM teams are one of the essential parts in Human Practices, for we have become companions with other iGEMers because of the reciprocal interactions. This year, we have done some collaborations including experience assistance, mentoring a new team.
TaiwanPP_FTP
Overview
TaiwanPP_FTP is a software collaboration between NYMU-Taipei and NCTU_Formosa. As the teams that both care about agricultural issues, we collaborated with NYMU-Taipei iGEM team to create innovative software that can predict the tendency of pest prospering shortly. The software will able to give detailed information of farm condition and give advice for farmers to prepare earlier before the threat.
We built up a prediction model by using the most popular way called machine learning for a variety insects. Through training a computer with a great amount of data, the computer will be able to analyze the relationship between input conditions and the outcomes. Finally, it can provide an accurate prediction which is the useful information for farm owners.(go to Website )
Figure 1. The screenshot of the website.
The Aim of TaiwanPP_FTP
We hope this tool could be user-friendly. All the information could be accessed through the Internet freely. It is remarkable if users could use the existing data to recreate another great application for the world. The product was a convenient web page that will show the predicted number of pests in the following three days of each observation station in Taiwan. All the source code and data are already on GitHub.(see on GitHub1 and GitHub2 )
The Process of Collaboration
This software is the cooperated product of National Chiao Tung University and National Yang-Ming University. The member of NYMU first developed this idea. The member of NYMU was responsible for developing the software including raw coding for data collection, data processing, prediction voting establishment and web development, while the member of NCTU was acting as a consultant and advisor that refined the code and debugged including stuff"

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"

ATTRIBUTIONS
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
The sheer amount that our project has developed since its inception is extraordinary.  The amazing work here at NUSGEM definitely would definitely not have been possible without the invaluable guidance and unfailing kindness of those who have helped us in one way or another. In this spirit, credit must be given where it is due, and we would like to express our utmost gratitude to the following people and organizations who saw the value in our humble project,  and selflessly offered their expertise for the betterment of our project.
We would like to wholeheartedly thank Associate Professor POH Chueh Loo and Assistant Professor Jimmy Chih-Hsien PENG, our greatest cheerleaders.  Both of these Professors toiled tirelessly for our project since its conception, and provided the team constant direction and well-meaning motivation every step of the way.
PART 1: IDEA GENERATION
The team brainstormed project ideas from February to late May.  During this period, the team received constructive and detailed feedback on all of our preliminary project ideas from Professor Richard KITNEY from Imperial College London  - he was a great critic, and imparted the wisdom gleaned from his many years of iGEM involvement to us. Professor Paul FREEMONT, also from Imperial College London, was instrumental in opening our eyes to the fashion industry that was fraught with issues, and provided us with much-needed inspiration to pursue a problem within the fashion industry.
PART 2: WET LAB
Lab work began in late May.  We were fortunate to have a team of treasured advisors and instructors who patiently guided us in our experiments  - Dr. LIM Yan Ping, Mr. ZHANG Jingyun, and Dr. Saravanan Prabhu NADARAJAN, who taught us the fundamental laboratory techniques necessary for our experiments, gave us a primer on interpreting laboratory data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           showed us the ropes"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Only a small numberof chemotactic signals have been identified for H. pylori. Thebest-haracterized chemoreceptor is TlpB, which is requiredfor chemorepulsive responses to acid, as well as the quorumsensingmolecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) and H+.  TlpB is the first bacterial chemoreceptor of known function shown by crystallography to contain an extracellular PAS domain. Strikingly, a molecule of urea is found within the canonical ligand-binding site of the PAS domain, bound in a manner predicted to be sensitive to changes in pH.

Overview
Poverty in taking reliable and repeatable measurements remains a key obstacle in establishing synthetic biology as an engineering discipline. The Measurement Committee has been studying the measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) over the last several years by interlab. The most commonly used markers though GFP is in synthetic biology, labs often resort to making relative comparisons, which makes it difficult for labs to share and data and/or constructs.
The goal of the fifth iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements by answering the question ""Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD? ""
As we know in the previous study, the fluorescence value measured by a plate reader is an aggregate measurement of an entire population of cells, we need to divide the total fluorescence by the number of cells in order to determine the mean expression level of GFP per cell. Due to the fact that the ""optical density (OD)"" of the sample is an approximation of the number of cells varying from lab to lab, we decided to use a special silica beads that are roughly the same size and shape as a typical E. coli cell to set up a universal, standard ""equivalent concentration of beads"" measurement.

About the Project
Mosquito intelligence terminator(MIT)
   The  Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT) is designed and optimized to be an ecological and environmental friendly mosquito pesticide. MIT is an  engineered E. coli secreting crystal proteins isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis to kill mosquito larvae, or commonly known as wrigglers. These crystal  proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes  only and are not pathogenic to mammals.  We designed a temperature-dependent genetic  circuit expressing high levels of crystal proteins at room temperature only,  thus production does not occur at incubation temperature. In order to make an  environmentally safe insecticide, our design also incorporates a genetic circuit  controlling the population size of E. coli, thus a surplus will never exist
as E.  coli population is self-maintained within the system. This intelligent  terminator is not limited to mosquitos only, as the intelligent terminator system can be custom fitted with  different cry genes to other insect species. Currently, with more than one  hundred crystal proteins targeting various insect species, our design may  potentially serve as a promising pest control solution in the future.

Our School
National Chiao Tung University
   National Chiao Tung University was founded in the suburbs of Shanghai in 1896, sixteen years before the birth of the Republic of China, at the suggestion of Hsuan-Wai Shen, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Ching Dynasty. The University was first named Nanyang College. It was established to meet the urgent"
UT-Tokyo,2013,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"1] the system with only one negative feedback loop of AiiA. Their system generated synchronized oscillation. This system shows bursts without any external stimuli. The burst is not suitable for the Analog Clock, because it means inappropriate addition of clock hands. TetR and 2 sRNAs were added in our clock device. These additional suppressors may lead to stronger repression and prevents burst of other clock hands.
Figure 12 Multi-negative feedback system.
The excitation wave
Here, the propagation of excitation wave is explained concluding the discussion above .The positive feedback loop and Multi-negative feedback system drive the “clock hand”, the excitation wave of gene expression. The propagation of excitation wave is generated as follows (Fig. 13);
0. Cells are in the resting state. They are ready to respond to the stimulus by AHL.
1. Cells are activated by AHL synthesized by neighbor cells and express mCherry. These cells are the “clock hand”.
2. The LuxI is also expressed at the same time and synthesize AHL to activate neighbor cells.
3. The supressors are also expressed to make unresponsive state, which prevents “clock hand” go backwards.
Figure 13
Clock hand (visualization for naked eyes)
The clock device has 2 reporter genes for dual-reporter assay, which allows accurate measurement of gene expression intensities.
mCherry is a red reporter protein for the “clock hand”. mCherry expression intensity changes dynamically, being increased by AHL stimulus and decreased by 4 suppressors.
amilGFP is yellow “control” reporter protein for ratiometric measurement with mCherry. amilGFP is constitutively expressed independently from clock “gear”.
Without “control” reporter, background noises (changing agar plate environment surrounding cells, amount of resources for gene expression, cell population density, degradation tag activity, etc.) might obscure the dynamic gene expression of interest (=“clock hand”). Comparing the mCherry expression with amilGFP, you can clearly track the “clock hand” for a long time and will notice the unimportant noises disturbing the clock.
mCherry and amilGFP have strong color, which is visible to naked eyes under natural room light (Fig. 14). You can easily see the gene expression without special equipment.
Also, both of them are fluorescent protein and have different excitation and emission spectra. Measuring fluorescence (e.g. fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, …) will be a good way to measure the gene expression accurately. You can measure both fluorescence and color under natural light with one BioBrick device"

Out of necessity, we realized that many upgrades were necessary for the centrifuge to be fully functional. These included:
The  “spin” function
This function, shown in the video, deserves special attention. The function is activated by simply pressing the knob, quickly achieving a high speed and depositing all the liquid at the bottom of the tube, being crucial for speeding-up virtually all the experiments. And this was a direct result of the practical application of our hardware
Better RPM reading and setting
Reduced acoustic reverberation
Anti-vibration support
With use, nuts and bolts got out of place and to use the centrifuge started be quite dangerous. The problem was reduced with a silicon support, and the pieces we used to make it are also present in the documentation.zip
Better interface
Personal touch - “Harry Potter” themed modifications!
We also added a little bit of creativity to our code, with a lot of “Harry Potter” themed puns. It might sound silly, but this kind of thing really cheered us up a little in those days when everything seems to go wrong in the lab. In the end, science is not only about making the world a better place, but also about having a good time while doing it.
Finally, we also made some considerations that, due to the deadlines were not (yet) implemented. These included an increase rotor radius to achieve more RCF power, which would enhance the efficiency of our MiniPreps and to print a rotor with PCR tube spaces, making it easier to spin down low-volume reactions.

Hii!! Today was a big day for us! We decided our method for mercury quantification. It is available in method’s section! Now, instead of keep working on the new constructions, the entire team will work on the identification! We’re also dedicating our time on production and methods to quantify Hg that was remediated and accumulated! REALLY IMPORTANTS steps!
Tomorrow we’re going to use the spectrofluorometer for the first time! We made inoculum in liquid medium LB with ampicillin 100ug/ml of DH5α without modified genetics as “blank” and DH5α with plasmid p26G for high GFP’s expression, as positive control tomorrow!! Lets go!!!

Since sequencing confirmed a MetA biobrick, we transformed K12 cells with the remaining stock of our plasmid, so we could amplify it.
All relevant transformed strains from yesterday grew well on the plates. We are now ready to properly do the fluorescence calibration experiment, but due to time constraints, we are going to do it on Thursday.
-Jacob
July 19
We tested the growth rate of our 3 main auxotrophs in various (log scale from 100 pM to 10 mM) concentrations of the amino acids to do monod kinetics. We also miniprepped our metA biobrick (so we have enough to send to the registry and use for experiments), new potential candidates for other biobricks (tyrA and ArgC), our construct which is identical to 13M on plate 3, except on a different plasmid, and a biobrick that we received from the registry. Sequencing to follow.
Joe has, to the best of my knowledge, identified potential biobrick colonies for the DszB,C, and D. Again, sequencing to follow.
We have, in the past few days, designed a plasmid that will aid in the testing of biobricks. The primers are to be designed and ordered today, if all goes according to plan. The primers that we tried to order through the lab a while ago spent some time in bureaucratic limbo, but I think they have been ordered now. Again, no one appears completely sure of what has been ordered, and one of our chief contacts on the subject has apparently gone on vacation.
It appears that Joe and Grace were attempting the fluorescence calibration experiment, but things apparently were going wrong, and we have not yet analyzed the data completely.
Concerning the kill switch plasmid parts, we want to take the psb1C3 plasmid, add a constitutively expressed LacI gene, and a lac promoter and rbs immediately before the cut sites. This way, a toxic protein can be well controlled. In fact, while we are designing this for toxic proteins, it could have uses in general protein production. Previous attempts for using the lac promoter on a high copy plasmid have failed leaky expression) due to the lack of the LacI protein produced in the genome. This new plasmid design remedies this, and will be accomplished by Gibson assembly.

To assist teachers in implementing these new standards and framework we have also created an education course for Virginia teachers. The course details the inclusion of synthetic biology in classroom lessons using the theme of long term space travel to engage and excite students of all ages. This course was made possible through the support of a NASA Mini-Proposal and can be found here .
What are Standards of Learning (SOLs)?
The Standards of Learning outline the expected learning outcomes for all 1,293,049 students in the Virginia commonwealth. The standards are divided by subject once students reach secondary programs. All Virginia teaching professionals utilize the standards as the infrastructure for lesson planning, and subjects covered in the Standards of Learning are expected knowledge as evaluated on state examinations. The Standards of Learning applies both to specific knowledge and skill development. By integrating into the Standards of Learning, synthetic biology will be a required subject for all Virginia students.
What is a Curriculum Framework?
The Curriculum Framework provides additional guidance for educators. The framework correlates to the standards of learning but provides more specific learning objectives for each standard. The framework is intended to amplify, clarify and define the components of each Standard of Learning.
