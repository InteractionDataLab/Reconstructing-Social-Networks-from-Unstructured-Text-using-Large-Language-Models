Using these criteria, we designed 10 mutant cages for PCquad and 3 mutant cages for O3-33.
2. The second step of the project is protein expression and verification of cage formation. We attempted expression of five of our best PCquad designs and all three of our O3-33 designs. Expression was done using standard expression protocols and purification was done using his -tag nickel column purification while cage formation was verified using Dynamic Light Scattering.
Dynamic light scattering is used to determine the approximate size and polydispersity of small particles in solution. A beam of light is shown through the sample and the fluctuations in the light due to the movement of the small particles is measured. DLS is dependent on size to the fourth order so it is very important to filter out any large particles such as dust before conducting the experiment.
In our experiment, DLS was used to determine whether or not our protein cages formed as well as the purity of our samples. A radius around 8 nm for PCQuad (WT +mutants) and a radius around 6.5 nm for O3-33 (WT + mutants) as well as a polydispersity below 30%, indicated by DLS meant a pure sample.
3. The final step of the project involved testing our successfully formed mutant cages for disassembly in the presence of Thrombin protease. The mutant cages that had successfully formed cages were treated to Thrombin protease at various concentrations and durations. Disassembly of cage was verified using a combination of SDS page to see if the individual subunits cut at the locations of the cleavage site insert and DLS to see if the entire cage structure fell apart.
General Protocol
60 uL 0.2 mg/ml protein cage samples used for thrombin assay
For each protein cage tested, a sample was subject to thrombin while another was not
Added 1.25 uL of 460 units/ml bovine thrombin stock to each sample (0.69 units) to each sample that was to be subject to thrombin every 4 for hours for 16 hours
An SDS-PAGE gel was run to assay for cleavage and a DLS test was conducted to assay for protein cage disassembly

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," the miniprep protocol was actually required for plasmid extraction. If it were possible that it could be done at a lower speed, it would both reduce cost, improve durability, and have a safer product. Given the same starting culture, we tested the effect of centrifugation speed throughout all steps of the miniprep protocol to determine the speed of the motor in our lab-in-a-box. A commercial benchtop microcentrifuge was used to perform this miniprep, and a Qiagen miniprep kit was used for plasmid DNA extraction.
Our results show that DNA recovery is independent of centrifugation speed between 17.9k and 8k x g RCF. The plasmid DNA concentration was similar throughout all speeds, and the gel confirmed that the plasmid was indeed the constitutive RFP vector (~2 kb). However, the 8k x g RCF bands on the gel looked more faint in two thirds of the samples, and we decided to pursue a speed of around 10,000 x g RCF for our design.
Centrifuge Calibration
The centrifuge needs to be calibrated prior to use because the input from the Arduino is in units of microseconds rather than RPM. Since the motor does not have a way to sense this, we needed to correlate the microseconds sent to the speed controller to the speed generated.
We used an infrared reflectance sensor to calibrate the centrifuge. The sensor sends infrared light, and detects how much of it has bounced back. The body of the motor is reflective, so we placed a thin strip of electrical tape on the motor, which will absorb all of the infrared light. From this, the Arduino can detect the time elapsed between two readings when infrared light has been absorbed, and therefore can calculate the speed of the motor. The calibration was conducted with the centrifuge rotor placed onto the motor.
From our results, we found that the speed of the Arduino could not be fast enough to detect very high RPMs. which would need sensitivities of tenths of millisecond. We were able to get three clear data points to correlate the control action / microseconds sent to the ESC and the corresponding RPM. From the maximum control action, we extrapolated to about 12,000 RPMs, which corresponds to 11,290 x g RCF, more than enough for miniprepping plasmid DNA.
Incubator Test
The incubator needs to be calibrated as well because the thermsister can only cause a change in voltage. While a theoretical approach can be used to calculate the temperature, we decided to do"

Before the team was granted access to a labspace all team members and advisors underwent several safety training courses from Northeastern University’s Environmental Health and Safety Department. Team organizers worked closely with EHS and other faculty throughout the summer to ensure a safe working environment. Training courses taken by team members included chemical hygiene and laboratory safety, autoclave safety, and biosafety. These courses covered all of the fundamental skills of lab safety including proper use of personal protective equipment, proper treatment of chemicals and biological materials and proper disposal of all of the materials that we would be using in the lab.
Safety hazards were kept to a minimum and no notably dangerous chemicals or biological agents were used.
Parts used in this investigation were by and large genes from harmless organisms with no biosafety level rating. There are two exceptions: One AMP, BBa_K2431010, was taken from a sequence from E. coli K12 a BSL 1 organism. And BBa_K2431013, which, codes for Cecropin P1 is found from Ascaris suum, a roundworm which infects pigs. Ascaris suum is considered a different species than the roundworm responsible for human ailments but is still rated as a BSL 2 organism. No work with these organisms was done at any point, the relevant antimicrobial peptide DNA sequences were synthesized chemically and then amplified from there, thus there was no safety risk associated.

In our project, we expect that plasmid DNA interacting with a Carbon nanotube will be internalized into the cell and then expressed, this is a system we call “Carbon Carriers.” This construction allows us to confirm the success of the experiment: if the resulting cell turns out to be fluorescent, we can confirm in a simple and efficient way the expression of our gene and the success of our     experiment.
Our goal is to prove that carbon nanoparticles can be a novel and efficient method for celltransformation and transfection in models such as E.coli and Bos taurus Oocites.

Aim:
The CMV is a promoter, we selected this part for it being the only option as a mammalian promoter. Also, as noted in the iGEM wikis, this is the sole mammalian promoter and is actually part of a lacl-gene. Also, as described in the wiki, we chose this promoter because of its ability to induce fluorescence in bacteria, as accomplished by DTU Denmark.
For our project, since we were working with both mammal and bacterial models, we decided to   include this promoter.

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#TSS_-_-_TEXT.html," are not only used as memory devices based on DNA level in basic orthogonal memory modules, but also used to build the sequential memory structures which control the memorizing process.
Logic gates
The input of logic gates are Target and Clock signals(Fig.3 a). It is obvious that Target signal is the one we want to record. Although Clock signal seems unrelated, it is helpful to provide the circuit with time information. It serves as a time license. When Clock signal is on for the first time, the following parts start to work and record the present information of Target signal. After that, Clock signal turns off, stopping recording and beginning to prepare for the second record in the next time period.
Figure 3 | Logic gates. a, logic scheme of logic gates. Reltionship between inputs and transformed information received by promoters is shown; b, overview of the logic gates circuit design. TF, Transcriptional facters.
Logic gates(Fig.3 b) are employed in this project to process the raw signal from Target and Clock, and control three promoters, PC, P-C and PC&T. As a result, this part is like a bridge between the signals and sequential memory structures, which makes both signals can be highly customized to record various targets of interest with appropriate clocks.
Sequential memory structures
The key step in recording the changing process of a signal is the distinguishing between the signals recorded at different time point. We accomplished the distinguishing work with our sequential memory structure. The structure is consists of segments of orthogonal memory modules, each one is capable of responding to the target signal and executing the memory process alone. The structure is under the strict control of the clock signal and logic gates mentioned above, so that only one memory module is activated during one recording period. The structure is delicately designed in a way that different memory modules are turned on and off in a sequential order corresponding to their spatial relations on the plasmid. By answering to the same signal at different time point with different memory modules, the circuit can distinguish these signals and finally put them in the proper sequential order. The structure is the most important part of our sequential memory device. And it is the only difference between Two-signal system and Multi-signal system.
The main idea of this part is to make the memory modules follow the order from the Clock signal. Here we made an interactive animation below to help you to better understand these important structures.
Try to move your mouse slowly from the left time zone to the right one.
This animation will show you how our system works when it meets the Target Signal below.

OUR INTERLAB OBJECTIVES
The iGEM Interlab 2018 aims to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements that were shown in previous interlab studies which use an optical density (O.D.) as the normalization method of fluorescence. Since O.D. is an approximation of cell number, the interlab this year attempts to address the problem by two orthogonal approaches. Hypothesized that silica beads have similar light scattering properties as the cells due to their similarities in size and shape, one of the approaches is to convert the absorbance of cells to the absorbance of a known concentration of silica beads [1]. Adopting a more direct normalization method, the other approach is to normalize the absorbance of cells by absolute cell counts or colony-forming units (CFU).
Method:
All procedures were performed according to the given iGEM protocol [2], except that the O.D. measurement setting was changed from OD600 to OD595, due to the limited options of plate reader in HKUST.  After further discussion with the iGEM headquarter, we retained the data to be OD595.

Immobilization Tags
To achieve a covalent immobilisation of the different enzymes to an agarose membrane we chose three different immobilisation tags. All of them consist of two peptide chains which specifically bind to each other in solution and yield a covalent bond. For immobilisation purposes we used the SpyTag, the SnapTag and a split intein engineered from gyrase b of Synechocystis spec. PCC6803.
SpyTag
The SpyTag-sequence was taken from the iGEM registry and consists of a small peptide chain, called SpyTag, and a bigger protein-like structure, called SpyCatcher. Both BioBricks were created by Team TU-Munich in 2013 and can be found under the identifiers BBa_K1159200 (SpyCatcher) and BBa_K1159201 (SpyTag). The short SpyTag polypeptide (AHIVMVDAYKPTK) was C-terminally fused with 6-aminohexanoic acid as a spacer, followed by a carboxyfluorecine labelled lysine residue and a cystein residue for binding of the SulfLink. With this we achieve a fluorescent marker in our peptide to yield an indicator for correct immobilisation of the SpyTag to the target protein or the matrix. Because of the cystein residue at the N-terminus of the SpyTag, it can be covalently bound to a matrix via sulfo-link ( for further information about the SpyTag have a look at our page about synthetic peptides ). In order to immobilize our enzymes, they were C-terminally fused to the coding region of the Spy"

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"9 plasmid and plasmid containing mRFP and a control guide RNA (control-gRNA) that did not target any sequence on either plasmid. All experiments were performed with minipreps that were verified by Sanger sequencing.If the Cas9 protein is active, it should bind to mRFP and create a double-stranded break in the gene. This DNA break will be repaired by the non-homologous end joining mechanism, which either accurately restores the break or imprecisely repairs the break through the addition or deletion of DNA bases, resulting in indels or frameshift mutations. Often these imprecise repairs result in knockdown of the target gene (Figure 4). Therefore, we would expect to see fewer red colonies and low levels of mCherry fluorescence in our experimental sample, and red colonies and high mRFP expression in the samples without the guide RNA targeting mCherry.
Figure 4: Cas9 and guide RNA devices. The plasmids for our cotransformation are intended to work together; the gRNA guide contains the sequence that directs the expressed Cas9 protein to cut mRFP, our reporter protein.
Figure 5 shows that the cells co-transfected with Cas9 and the control-gRNA transformed normally with reasonable efficiency and expressed RFP, resulting in pink colonies. In Figure 6, the transformation was much less efficient, and we hypothesize that one possible reason for this is that Cas9 activity could be stressful to the cell. It produced mostly white colonies, indicating that the Cas9 combined with the mRFP-gRNA were capable of knocking down RFP expression.  We did observe seven very large pink colonies, and we speculate that the mix of phenotypes is a result of differences in DNA repair among individual cells.
Figure 5: Cas9 and gRNA template cotransformation. The cells pictured were transformed with our Cas9 plasmid and a gRNA guide that did not target any gene. Most colonies on these plates were red, as expected.
Figure 6: Cas9 and gRNA guide cotransformation. The cells pictured were transformed with our Cas9 plasmid and our gRNA plasmid targetting mRFP. Most colonies on the plates were white, indicating that the mRFP gene had been prevented from expressing.
To verify further that Cas9 knocked out mRFP expression, we grew 15 mL cultures of each experimental condition and evaluated the mRFP fluorescence using a plate reader. We also included a negative, non-fluorescent control where we grew cultures of TOP10 cells that"

Frontend
User Interface:
We introduced a new user interface. The beautiful new interface is based on the Bootstrap framework, however, which is highly customized. We disabled the built-in module Glyphicons and replace it by font-awesome. We coordinated our color schemes and our logo to make a nicer look. Short animations during transitions were added to provide better experience.
Structure
To improve the user experience, we build Biohub 2.0 as a single page application (or short for SPA), using the advanced MVVM framework Vue.js. Vue.js relies on webpack (not forcibly, but recommended) for pre-compiling, which encapsulating everything into a single file. This is inconvinient for a website with a plugin system, so we analyzed the code generated by webpack and developed an approach to load components dynamically. It is the theoretical basis of Biohub 2.0's plugin system. You can refer to Main.vue to see such mechanism.
Backend
Plugin
Last year, Biohub introduced a concept called the Plugin System, with which new functions can be integrated into the platform and accessed by other users easily. However, it had several deficiencies:
The framework is static, which means the list of plugins are validated and loaded before the server starts up, and cannot be mutated during runtime. This will lower the performance if plugins are frequently installed or removed.
The framework is not friendly to developers. Neither assistant tools nor documantations are provided for target developers.
The framework does not consider the cooperation with frontend. In fact, Biohub's frontend has no awareness of the plugin mechanism. The names of the plugins and the links to them are actually hard-coded into its navigation bar.
Such flaws are fixed or improved in Biohub 2.0. The new plugin system are designed as hot-reloadable, as you can read in our demostration page, which allows plugin list mutations during runtime. A command-line tool biohub-cli.py and brief guidance as well as multiple utilities are provided to simplify the developing workflow. Based on MVVM framework Vue.js, we develop a customized mechanism to load plugins dynamically.

Basic fermentation
The use of plant biomass for biofuel production will require efficient utilization of the sugars in lignocellulose, while in terrestrial plants the content of cellulose is quite hard to use.[1] By contrast, cellulose in macroalgae has looser texture and lower proportion, which makes it an ideal material for biofuel production.[2] As a coastal university, we have a profound theoretical foundation of the sea and of course, algae. Therefore, it is natural that we think of algae as our substrate.
However, we soon meet with another problem---the main sugar used by trains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae currently in bioethanol production is glucose. Other saccharides such as xylose and cellobiose are relatively harder to ferment. It means a lot more energy and cost we need to donate to pretreatment. Therefore, if we can design a recombinant strain capable of using xylose or cellobiose, it will be a big step further since the yeast can take the place of chemicals and fulfill the task itself.
Before the construction of the plasmid, however, we need to deal with glucose repression.[3] We all know that even yeasts engineered to ferment xylose cannot utilize xylose until glucose is completely consumed, which makes the process of fermentation rather slow when in present of glucose. To overcome these bottlenecks, we decide to separate the fermentation of xylose and cellobiose into two yeast strains, which means substrates can be transported into the cell thus isolate glucose from their shared environment and avoid their mutual interference. In other words, intracellular hydrolysis of cellobiose minimizes glucose repression of xylose fermentation. What's more, we can also lighten their metabolic burden using this strategy.[4]
Fig 1.1 The whole diagram of basic fermentation.
Now we can begin our project.
After grinding our Enteromorpha into powder and extracting polysaccharide we get the remains of algae which has the same content as Enteromorpha waste. Because in industrial manufacture, the former one can be well utilized, we mainly focus on the residue of algae containing cellulose and hemicellulose majorly. For a higher"

At the same time, one of the 2017 iGEM teams TUDelft , attempted to preserve the Cas13a protein using the TDP proteins, and they also tried to preserve the bacteria with the TDP proteins and obtained amazing outcome.                  In our project, we are going to use TDPs to help preserve the protein Cas12a and OMVs.
Abstract
We have carried out research on TDP proteins this year. On the one hand, we plan to preserve the Cas12a required for protein detection and OMVs required for treatment with TDPs. On the other hand, as the wiki says, TDP is a new biological activity protector with great potential. So we are going to use TDP proteins to simplify existing methods of preserving proteins and bacteria.
There are two novel protein families with distinct subcellular localizations named Cytoplasmic Abundant Heat Soluble (CAHS) and Secretory Abundant Heat Soluble (SAHS) protein families, according to their localization. In our project, SAHS1 was used to preserve the proteins and CAHS1 was used for the preservation of the bacteria.

Formal Lab Session - 27th July 2009
Running the gel for RFP and GFP bioricks
Today we prepared the gel with 0.8% agorose for last week's rescued plasmids which contain RFP and GFP biobricks. The final solution was 500ml using 4 gr of agorose in total.
We mixed 9ul of DNas with 1ul of the buffer and centrifuged shortly. The rest of the DNAs are then put back to the freezer.
Finally we run the gel. We loaded the ladder to the first and fourth wells, GFP to the 2nd and RFP to the 3rd well and set the voltage to 120V which was then reduced to 90V.
Below are the images:

We designed biochemical assays in order to evaluate the effects of our circuits on life span of bacteria, cell mass, and ultimately bioethanol yield
Figure 5: Representation of our experimental plan/ assay no. 1.
Figure 6: Representation of our experimental plan/ assay no. 2.
Figure 7: Representation of our experimental plan/ assay no. 3.
Figure 8: Representation of our experimental plan/ assay no. 4.
In the assay, step by step:
First, cultures of KO11 are grown in 4 groups:
#1: KO11 control group (non-engineered: without gene insertion)
#2: KO11 containing only FucO as insert
#3: KO11 containing only GSH as insert
#4: KO11 containing both GSH and FucO
With the experiment groups above, the steps (below) of our biochemical assay has been applied and we have compared the results.
Secondly, in order to set our experiments to fermentation processes done in real-life, glucose is added to the medium. In biorefineries, glucose is obtained from the pretreatment methods, specifically dilute acid pretreatment.
Then, the bacteria are exposed to toxic furfural, which is the main byproduct that occurs in the pretreatment process.
At this point, real life pretreatment and fermentation conditions are supplied and in order to make a comparison in terms of the difference our genes create. Then, they are placed in incubation and OD measurements at Abs 600 at 1-hour intervals are obtained.
We can conclude that if the bacteria have an increased tolerance to ROS and furans, causing higher OD values will indicate that the bacteria have gained higher cell mass and thus, the ethanol yield will automatically increase.
As of our hypothesis, we expected to see the best ethanol yield, the longest lifespan and the greatest cell mass in group #4 (assay no. 4) since the KO11 would carry the best qualities in terms of genes. Of course; the least ethanol yield, cell mass, and the shortest lifespan would be observed in group #1 (assay no. 1) since it is the un-engineered KO11 strain of E.coli that is intolerant to byproducts.
Apart from the biochemical assay we conducted in which we’ve seen bacteria growth and OD differentiations, we’ve also reached an expert involved in ethanol production from KO11 strain of E.coli. We’ve sent her bacteria samples from four of our experiment groups and she helped us test the bioethanol production of them to have a comparative analysis.

On Sunday, an interesting talk was given by Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun,    who used to be an old iGEM advisor. He presented some of his supervised and very    interesting iGEM projects of Dresden.
Then the Dresden team offered some workshops for us: e.g. a speed-dating    for iGEM collaborations and a workshop for the “iGEM goes green”-initiative, introduced    by the iGEM team Dresden. Again we had a great time and learned many things about the carbon    footprint of the everyday lab work. Please visit the website of this beautiful project to learn     more about this initiative ! During our time in Dresden we found     many potential collaboration partners such as Cologne-Dusseldorf, Berlin and Potsdam.
After a short coffee break and the closing ceremony, where a photograph of all iGEM teams    has been taken, we made our departure from this beautiful city.
We would like to thank the iGEM Dresden team for organizing the whole meetup. We had     a great weekend and loads of fun getting to know the other teams and their projects!
European meetup
Delft
From the 6th to the 8th of July we were invited from the iGEM Team TU Delft to come    together at their university town. So four of our team members had the possibility to take part    at this year´s European Meet up. Amused by the mistake of the naked-camping- place we    booked an Airbnb in our neighboring country and set off by car at 5 AM on the 6th of July.    Tired of the long drive and walk we met several teams at an All You Can Eat in Delft in the    afternoon which was proposed by Team Delft. There we had the first chance to compare notes    with the others and look for some collaboration partners. Despite our tiredness we had much    fun and Leo enjoyed the free beer. Even on our first day in the Netherlands we found out that    there are more bicycles than people in this country. That is why you have to pay more    attention to bicyclists than to cars. The next day, after forgetting our poster and running back    to our Airbnb to take it, we all met at the university in Delft. Two biologists gave lectures on    iGEM topics and provided the basis for discussions. At lunch we met Team Freiburg. Or    rather Team Freiburg met us. They knew some of our"

Because of this, AFPs exhibit thermal hysteresis, a property that creates change in the freezing point of water without affecting the melting point. This allows organisms that produce AFPs to survive colder conditions by reducing the temperature at which dangerous ice crystals form (Jorov et al, 2004).

Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," a 2 L bioreactor. Growth curves were approximated by fitting a logistic function (line).
The growth curve from shaking flask cultivation revealed that the mid-log growth phase correlates to an OD of around 2. In bioreactor cultivation the mid-log growth phase is prolonged, due to the better aeration of the medium, and corresponds to an OD between 4 and 6. We harvested cells at OD 4, 5 and 6 to test which harvest point is most suitable to produce high quality cell extract.
Protein content (grey) and fluorescence intensity (blue) in cell extract in different cultivation conditions.
The test revealed that the protein content is higher when cells were harvested at a higher OD, with OD 5 yielding the highest protein content. In addition, the cell extract from OD 5 produces the highest fluorescence intensity in the TXTL test. Compared to a cell extract from shaking flask cultivation the signal is reduced to about 60 %. The most likely cause for this result is that a higher fraction of proteins in the OD 5 cell extract is inactive, possibly due to protein damage during cell lysis (at the time of this experiment, cell lysis was not yet fully optimized).
The comparison of cultivation methods revealed that cultivation in a bioreactor is an applicable alternative to shaking flask cultivation and offers great potential for upscaling of cell extract preparation. In our 2 L lab-scale bioreactor we were able to produce 20 g of cell pellet, compared to 4-5 g that 2 L of shaking flask cultivation yield.
Sonication and Lysozyme Improve the Performance of Cell-Extract
Sonication
We tested three different cell lysis methods: beat beating, French press and sonication. Beat beating is an inexpensive and widely employed method   but upscaling is problematic, and the preparation is tedious and time-consuming. High-pressure cell disruption in a so called ‘French-press’ is also   used but these devices are very expensive and not widely prevalent. This contradicts our effort to provide a generally-applicable protocol for preparation   of home-made cell extract. A sonication device on the other hand is available in most biochemical labs as it is a commonly used method for cell lysis in   protein purification protocols. Nevertheless, we started by comparing all three lysis methods with settings commonly applied for cell lysis.
Our initial test showed that cell lysis by sonication yields extract with up to 2.8- and 4.4 fold higher expression than cell lysis by bead beating and French press respectively. These findings combined with the limited options of optimization for"

Abstract
iGEM is not only a scientific competition which provides a stage for us undergraduates to display our work done at the laboratory but also a driving force to popularize synthetic biology to the public. Furthermore, considering the theme of Asia division this year is system biology & society, we organized a series of activities related to society and the public.
From July 16th to 17th, We held a lecture entitled ""Contemporary introduction to synthetic biology"" with corresponding campus fair and exhibition in order to help high school students make a better understanding of synthetic biology, genetic engineering and biosafety. Thanks to the summer camp hosted by Xiamen University, thousands of high school students from Fujian Province took part in our activities related to our theme. On the one hand, we let the high school students have a better understanding of our project and iGEM via the lecture. On the other hand, we expected our elucidation to express how much genetic engineering contributes to our daily life in food, energy, material and so on. These students are just like seeds we sow to help synthetic biology and genetic engineering well understood by the public, which is really important and meaningful to the popularization of synthetic biology and iGEM.
In addition, before the lecture we made a survey about popularization of synthetic biology & iGEM in high school students from all over Fujian Province. It is not only to get some important and cogent data about popularization of synthetic biology & iGEM but also to get some feedback about the effect of our lecture via comparing their attitude and reaction to our questions before and after the lecture. What’s more, we designed a special series of cards with the theme of synthetic biology for the campus fair.

attTn7 Insertion Site
Is attTn7 insertion site higly conserved?
Goal
To study the level of conservation of the Tn7 transposon recognition site (attTn7) over the phylogeny.
Background
Tn7 is quite a specific bacterial transposon which encodes five transposition proteins (TnS, A, B, C, D and E) ( Peters et al, 2001 ). TnsD is one of the targets selector which inserts Tn7. TnsD recognizes a specific chromosomal site, known as an attachment site (attTn7), and modifies the DNA structure allowing the binding of TnsC, TnsA and TnsB ( Waddel and Craig, 1988 ). These two last proteins insert the transposon. Therefore, insertion takes place preserving expression downstream the essential glmS gene ( Gay et al, 1986 ). It has been reported that the TnsD binding site is found in E.coli in the last 36bp of the glmS ORF ( Kuduvalli et al, 2001 ). This site encodes the active site region of GlmS whose amino acid sequence is nearly completely 100% conserved in all organisms ( Milewski, 2002 ). However, when considering nucleotide sequences, this attTn7 site has not been totally characterized in a wide range of organisms. In 2010, Rupak et al. reported a schematic representation of the nucleotide attTn7 recognition site obtained from the alignment of 25 bacterial glmS genes which have the Tn7 family transposon and the homologous Drosophila, zebrafish and human genes ( R"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#HeavyMetals_-_-_TEXT.html,"5)).
in vivo characterization
In addition to the other heavy metal sensors, we constructed a sensor for lead detection. It consists of the repressor PbrR which binds at the operator box downstream of the pbrAP promoter. The binding of the repressor is reversible in the presence of Pb2+ Ions. Those ions can weakened the repressors binding and hence, all genes downstream of the pbrAP promoter can be expressed. Like the former sensors this one encloses a sfGFP for detection via fluorescence. So if no lead is present in the media, the repressor binds to the operator box and the pbrAP promoter is blocked meaning that the transcription of sfGFP is prevented. No fluorescence signal is the results. By supplementation of lead, the repressor is separated from the operator box and the genes downstream of the promoter can be expressed.
The pbrAP promoter, the operator box and the PbrR repressor are parts of the chromosomal lead operon of Cupriavidus metallidurans (figure 2). This was cloned and transformed into E.coli KRX. This operon includes now the promoter pbrAP ( BBa_K1758332 ), which is regulated by the repressor PbrR. The PbrR belongs to the MerR family, of metal-sensing regulatory proteins, and is Pb2+-inducible. Our sensor system comprises pbrR ( BBa_K1758330 ), which is under the control of a constitutive Promoter and pbrAP and a 5’ untranslated region, which controls the transcription of a sfGFP and increases the fluorescence. Fluorescence implemented by sfGFP protein is the measured output signal (figure 3 and figure 4).
Figure 2: The concept of our in vivo lead sensor ( BBa_K1758332 ) which consists of the repressor under the control of a constitutive promoter ( BBa_K17583230 ) and the operator and promoter sequence of the lead inducible promoter. An untranslated region in front of the sfGFP, which is used for detection, enhances its expression ( BBa_K1758332 ).

○ Introduction
Naturally, the bacteria have developed several kinds of acid resistance system to ensure the survival under extremely acidic environment [11]. GlsA is a newly characterized functional gene in E.coli which encodes an acid-activated glutaminase [12].
This kind of glutaminase is able to catalyze a reaction in which the glutamine (Gln) and water will be transformed into glutamate (Glu) and gaseous ammonia [13]. The free gaseous ammonia will consume the proton (H+) and increase the intracellular pH (Fig.9). The robust glutaminase activity only exists at pH 6.0 or lower. The highest activity is obtained at pH 4.0, followed by pH 5.0 and 6.0. In contrast, GlsA is not activated at pH 7.0 and 8.0 [14]. The dependence on pH makes it an effective tool to respond when necessary.
Fig.9 The mechanism of GlsA
With the presence of extracellular glutamine (Gln), the membrane amino acid antiporter GadC will transport Gln into the cytoplasm, subsequently the glutaminase encoded by GlsA will transform Gln to Glu (glutamate) and release gaseous ammonia. Besides, the production glutamate is able to anticipate in a decarboxylation process led by decarboxylases GadA , and the latter process will also consume H+. More details about GadA wil be discussed in fine-regulation circuits .

The functional gene GlsA is used for acid resistance in our project and is able to regulate the intracellular pH when the environment turns to acidic. It has been reported to protect E.coli from extremely acidic environment so we came up with the gene circuit of acid resistance part (Fig.10). A strong constitutive promoter J23119 controls the transcription of GlsA. The function of glsA will be activated under acidic environment and it will play a"

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Mexico had seen our project too and were also interested in collaboration. We held a Skype conference in mid July to discuss where to take the project. Both teams wanted to hold their own in the project as appearing too dependent on another team may have hurt our chances at the Jamboree. The agreement was to share DNA, some characterisation data, and any hints and tips that we picked up while working with the common parts and protocols, but to otherwise continue working as before.
The parts
By the time we had our Skype conference, Mexico had already ordered several genes from Mr. Gene. As it seemed they had a larger synthesis budget than we did, they very generously offered to send us them when they arrived. All of the genes were mutation-free and codon optimised for E. coli. These were:
LuxY - the protein we were originally going to fuse with LuxAB to produce green light. We have since decided to use the natural firefly luciferase, but Mexico are still working on this fusion.
LovTAP - we were having problems with LovTAP at the time. We later discovered a frameshift mutation in the BioBrick. It cost us several weeks but luckily Mexico's copy got to us just in time.
CcaS - The PCB-containing and light-absorbing component of the green light sensor. Edinburgh and Mexico were working on different versions of the green light sensor,  both of which require CcaS.
NB: Mexico sent us more than 3 tubes of DNA. They sent us the subunits and composite part for LovTAP and both original PCRs are BioBrick versions of some genes.
Mexico then requested several things from us that they had been unable to get hold of:
LuxAB and LuxCDE - we had sent them these previously but the versions we sent were those that last year's team had submitted to the Registry which turned out to be incorrect. At the time we sent the new copies, however, we still hadn't managed to create a self sufficient glow.
LumP - this had also been amongst the original genes sent to Mexico. So far as we know, it never worked for them and we are unsure as to why.
Ho1/PycA - the phycocyanobillin synthesis genes. Whilst they had CcaS, they did not have the PCB for it to work. We had a copy in order to build the red light sensor so we sent it on.
The LovTAP readout system - they had synthesised LovTAP but their copy did not have a downstream reporter. We sent them our trpR"
Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#ScienceSam_-_-_TEXT.html," getting my PhD mentor to take pictures of me doing stuff. I’m really lucky that both my PI, and who is also the PI of iGEM, [is so into sci comm] but you’ve mentioned people don’t take science communication seriously and he’s gotten flack before from some older scientists in the department for “selling science” too much. Yeah, it’s really dumb. We are funded by the government and also through taxpayer’s money via the government. So it’s really irresponsible to not communicate what you’re doing. The people whose opinions I care about know that, and are super supportive. So I guess we talked about this the entire conversation, but I’ll put it out there in case you have any last closing comments. Where do you think science communication is lacking? And how do you think we can improve it? Great question. I want to ask it to you back, but I’ll go first. I think it’s lacking in “trendiness”, we’re so archaic, and every other part of the world is so much more tech savvy and advanced, using new social media platforms and then you go on some science Instagram and it’s so boring and lame. We just need to be cooler I think, more palatable to younger people because we’re trying to bring those people in. I think if our goal is to bring people into science and change mindsets as much as possible we need to target younger people and if we want to target younger people we need to be cooler. Straight up we need to be trendy. Why aren’t more people live streaming, or taking trendy pictures in the lab? Why aren’t more people on snapchat showing their lab? How come every science video-like you’ll look at one video production agency, you’ll see there food video and there so awesome but their science ones are kind of boring…like whyyy. We just need to make it more fun and get people trusting scientists. People don’t trust us, they think were evil. We bust our asses for everyone and people don’t know that because we don’t invite them in. I feel like someone who makes science trendy is Scishow on Youtube. It’s Hank Green- do you know who John Green is? He’s written a lot of young adult books- his brother is a biochemist who dropped out of academia to pursue science communication. He runs a bunch of different [shows]. Like Crash Course for school topics but also just Scishow for science news, they have a couple different channels.

Uptake of Cellobiose
While cellulose is too large to be pass the cell membrane, transportation of cellobiose is a common feature found in many organisms. An example is E. coli that utilises the membrane protein lactose permease (LacY) Sekar R, Shin HD, Chen R. Engineering Escherichia coli Cells for Cellobiose Assimilation through a Phosphorolytic Mechanism. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 2012;78(5):1611-4. , whereby the cellobiose is enzymatically catabolised in the cytosol.
Degradation of Cellobiose to Glucose
Through evolutionary events, many organisms have developed the ability to express enzymes, capable of breaking the β-linkage in cellobiose. E. coli expresses the periplasmic β-glucosidase encoded by the bglX gene, which is known to have said feature, hydrolysing the cellobiose β-linkage UniProt entry for bglX . Saccharophagus degradans expresses a different enzyme that efficiently cleaves the β-linkage in cellobiose, namely cellobiose phosphorylase encoded by the cep94A gene. This enzyme phosphorylates the cellobiose at its β-linkage, resulting in the degradation of cellobiose to

We get the callus by callus induction of rice seed, after that we will transfer the carrier into callus by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. If we get positive callus, we should cultivate it to complete plant by plant tissue culture. Finally we will obtain the transgenic rice plants and harvest the rices.

Alert : Water is in distress!
Human activities are responsible for an important pollution of drinking water as well as sea water. Yet, water is the most precious and fragile ressource, as it's vital to every living organisms. It covers 71% of the Earth and in this huge amount of water, approximately 97% is saline and 3% is freshwater. (Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security, 1993)
Figure1: Water on Earth
There is a broad range of polluting elements that exists. In the marine environment, we can mention nitrate, nitrite, heavy metals, phenols, plastics, PCB, pharmaceutical residues etc.... All these elements can distrupt the fauna and the flora.
These problems especially impact the whole food chain of marine biotopes. Thus, mankind is both guilty and victim of this catastrophy.
This year, our objective is to develop a filtrating system which could allow sensing and eventually degradation of pollutants.  To this end, we chose to work on elements belonging to the most important classes of pollutants of the marine environment.
Targets
Phenols
Phenols and their close derivatives are molecules which are widely distributed in nature. They are widespread contaminants whose sources are both natural and industrial (Fahmida Karim A. N. M. Fakhruddin, 2012).
The largest use of phenols is as an intermediate in the production of phenolic resins, which are low-cost, versatile, thermo set resins used in the plywood adhesive, construction, automotive, and appliance industries.
Phenols can be used as a general disinfectant, as a reagent in chemical analysis and it's"

This particular graph was equal to the sum of configurations 24, 37, and 40. The graph below represents the sum of configurations 9, 16, 23, and 26 and corresponds to the PR operator region. The negative effects of CRO on the OR3 operating region can be seen as the concentration of CRO increases the transcriptional probability goes down as CRO binds to OR3 blocking RNAP. The positive effects of CI can also be seen as the increase in CI concentration prevents CRO from being formed allowing RNAP to bind to OR3 and proceed with transcription.
Using this distribution and sum of probabilities the following two differential equations could be produced relating the rate of change of protein concentration to the probabilities of transcription and kinetic constants.
The above equation corresponds to the rate of repressor production R that occurs at PRM, while the following equation corresponds to the rate of CRO production at PR.
By solving this simultaneous system of nonlinear differential equations, the production rate of protein at PRM and PR can be determined which in the case of the lambda phage consists of CRO and C1 repressor.
The above graph shows the concentration of CRO protein and C1 repressor as a function of time. As can be expected initially both repressor and CRO are produced but as the repressor protein degrades or is cleaved by recA protease, the rate of production of C1 repressor approaches zero due to the inhibitory effects of the CRO protein on OR3.
Modeling Done Since the Regional Jamboree
A paper found on the effect of ionizing radiation on D. Radiodurans called A Model of Interactions Between Radiation-induced Oxidative Stress, Protein and DNA Damage in Deinococcus Radiodurans by Igor Shuryak and David J. Brenner was used to model the relationship between double strand breaks and intensity of ionizing radiation.  A value of 200 Gy was chosen for the radiation intensity as that seems to be a slightly less than lethal dose for E. Coli.  Modifications were made to the parameters in the model due to the increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation of Escherichia Coli.
At a constant dose rate the equilibrium number of double strand breaks can be calculated.  This can then be applied to the number of single strand breaks that occur and then to the rate of activation of RecA, which is yet to be done.

Notebook – Protocol – 14. Measurement
1. Overnight culture of “main culture” was taken from the shaker, then put in rack for measurement.
2. First, picture was taken with pocket camera.
3. Then color of the medium was measured its RGB value by ColorMeter program from an android-base mobile phone. For each side, 3 pictures were shot.
4. For validation, another mobile phone with different resolution of camera was used. Also besides, ColorMeter, we also used different program for RGB measurement namely Color Detector.
5. Values of RGB were converted to luminance value to obtain only the brightness of color (http://www.scantips.com/lumin.html; accessed on Sep. 24th, 2014). The formula used is: Luminance value = (R x 0.30) + (G x 0.59) + (B x 0.11)
6. Luminance values from 3 RGB data were averaged and calculated its standard deviation.

Introducing E.co-Factory project
Scientists all over the world use Escherichia coli as the host for recombinant protein production. The system is so popular because of its rapidity, low cost and well-characterized genetics. The choice of a proper promoter is a factor highly affecting protein expression. Right now, pET lactose/IPTG induced T7 RNA polymerase dependent system, which enables high efficiency of protein production, is the most popular one. However, it has some downsides: the system is leaky, so proteins toxic for the host cell cannot be produced. Its leakiness is very hard to control once the stable and highly active T7 RNA polymerase is produced. Once the system is induced, the high heterologous protein accumulation can turn into a problem with insoluble inclusion bodies. The typical phage T7 RNA polymerase tends to introduce more mistakes than its cellular counterpart. Considering that translation in prokaryotic cells occurs on just transcribed mRNAs, slower cellular RNA polymerase can be beneficial for an accurate translation of mRNAs with stronger secondary structures, which have lower chance to form before ribosomes will cover the nascent mRNA molecule.
Our group, UAM_Poznan, aims to generate four sets of promoters induced by sugars: xylose, melibiose, arabinose and rhamnose, and give the user the possibility of introducing numerous genetic circuits into one cell, which expression can be independently controlled. We have reduced promoters' size – they are minimal but fully functional and tightly regulated. We have also introduced changes in 5’UTRs (untranslated regions), as 5’UTR regions with their secondary structures and 16S rRNA binding sites of different sequence and location regarding AUG codon are known to strongly influence the efficiency of translation.
Our latest activity focuses on trials to find out to what extent the structure of an open reading frame (ORF) can be optimized and what is the difference in translation rate of let say optimal, less optimal, and much less optimal reading frame. We build our experimental model on sfGFP and mRFP – two soluble fluorescent proteins. We compare expression rate of contrasting variants of their"

Derivations
1.Derivation of the maximal expression rate,β
Average molecular weight (Mw) of a base pair = 660g/mol [4] [5]
Average mass of a base pair = 660g/mol x 1.66x10-24 = 1.1x10-21g
Volume of an E.coli cell = 1µm3 [6] = 1x10-15L
∴Mass concentration =
∴Molar concentration of 1 base pair in the volume of E.coli =
= 1.66x10-6 mM
BioBrick assembly plasmid pSB1C3 is a high copy number plasmid (100-300 copies per cell) [7]
assume 200 copies per cell
∴ concentration of the gene per cell = N x 200 x 1.66x10-6mM, where N = number of base pairs
∴ concentration of the gene phaZ1 (N = 1245) [8] in the volume of an E.coli cell is = 0.41mM
Transcription rate in E.coli= 80bp/s [9] = 80 x 1.66x10-6mM/s = 80 x 1.66x10-6 x 60mM/min = 7.97x10-3mM/min
∴ Rate of mRNA_phaZ1 production under the control of pBAD = 7.97x10-3 ÷ 0.41 = 0.019/min
2.Protein production rate of phaZ1, k2
Average molecular weight(Mw) of an amino acid(aa)= 110g/mol [10] [11]
Average mass of an amino acid = 110g/mol x 1.66x10-24=1.83x10-22g/L
∴Mass concentration of one aa in the volume of an E.coli =
= 1.83x10-6g/L
∴Molar concentration of one aa =

Introduction
The project aims at studying how bacterial DNA organization can influence gene expression. In order to answer this question, we decided to create a new tool based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in order to bring closer two DNA regions separated in space. This new tool is expected to assess the effect of DNA structure on gene expression. We designed a Bring DNA closer tool (BDC tool) and a visualization tool.
The Escherichia coli bacterium was chosen to be our chassis for this project. Indeed, it is the best-known and a well documented bacterial model (Dorman, 2013) to answer fundamental questions such as the one that our project raises. It will be easier to make a proof of concept in E. coli and then optimize and expand the use of our tool to other species or other microorganisms. Furthermore, the use of E. coli, which is the most common chassis in iGEM, allows us to use biological parts that were constructed and optimized for this bacterium, such as promoters, RBS, terminators, or protein coding sequences.
In this part, we expose our final tool design. Our experimental strategy is available here .
Molecular tools
In order to design both our tools, we need molecular tools with specific functions: DNA recognition, DNA binding function, dimerization and fluorescence.
DNA recognition and fixation
Both tools have to recognize a specific target sequence on DNA and then bind to it. Several options were possible, such as a protein-DNA or a RNA-DNA recognition. First of all, we thought about using engineered nuclease proteins, such as zing-finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) or a RNA-guided engineered nuclease (RGEN) for their"

How to do
In our communication part, we focus on the academic exchange with other domestic and foreign iGEM teams, and collaboration on team work, like conducting the experiments to find a condition, filling in the questionnaires, and launching newsletters regarding to iGEM topics.
In the long run, we have communicated with over 25 iGEM teams, including all Taiwan's teams and those from China, India, Switzerland, Britain, and America. Some academic exchanges are arranged by ourselves; others are bumped into under the circumstance of Asia-Pacific Conference and other conference. While we were at conference, we had oral presentation and poster exhibition.
As for collaboration workshop, we helped Imperial 2016 iGEM team from British with the searching for optimal growth conditions for microbial monocultures to provide an effective start-point for designing co-cultures; and in our project, there is a part for In vitro test that is coincidently co-culturing of Leishmania and dendritic cells, so we are glad to do this. Another one is called Virginia Survey Collaboration Badge. We offered our opinions to Virginia's 2016 iGEM team on the survey and they send back us a badge as a token of thanking for help.
Results
Most of the teams we interacted with are in fact not juggling at medical division of iGEM project. So here comes an unfortunate situation. In the beginning, other teams seemed that they may not shortly get the point about our project because it is a relatively hard science, immunology. They have even scarcely heard Leishmania before. In addition, they can't catch the unique advantages of Leishmania as a potential adjuvant immediately. So we correspondingly adjust our presentation to make it a better-understood order and try to employ alternative ways to explain the immunologic background, making it much clearer. We even have an intention of acting at the end of our lecture in the hope of that audiences can go through our summary in a special, interesting way. And as for collaboration, the more frequent we posted articles and photos on Facebook, the more we are invited by other teams for collaboration. So we are dynamic at interacting with other iGEM teams.

Cooperation
To verify our work, we find Tianjin team, which have cooperation relationship with us. We verified a part of their work in return. The initial device they designed is BBa_K1020004. During the cooperation,We noticed that the bacteria with this device had a slow growth rate. We thought this was because the leakage of this promoter (J23100) was too strong, for alkR was constitutively expressed and RFP had a high expression level even in the absence of alkanes, the inducible compounds. We assumed that the over-expression of alkR caused negative influence on the growth of cells. To reduce the expression level of the constitutively expressed alkR, eliminating the influence, we designed a modified device BBa_K1020005, and replace J23100 with J23103. It turned out that RFP showed almost no expression without alkanes. If we add C8 as inducible compounds, the red color can be observed and the rate of cell growth is largely increased.

We put each of the genes under the control of the inducible lacl promoter ( R0011 ) which has a low leakiness and is easily inducible with IPTG. This strong, frequently used promotor is well-characterised in the iGEM registry and is reported to be well functioning. We also added the extensively documented weak ribosome binding site ( B0032 ) with a strength of 33.96 % compared to B0034 to diminish the formation of inclusion bodies and a double  terminator ( B0015 ). Furthermore, a His-tag was added to the C-terminus of each subunit to simplify the identification and purification process.
Additionally we also constructed a vector ( final construct ) which included all six subunits under the control of the above-mentioned promoter and an RBS upstream of each subunit resulting in a polycistronic mRNA after transcription. Compared to the natural cluster of M. capsulatus our final construct does not include the naturally occurring transposases and hypothetical proteins. However, the arrangement order of the subunits is the same as in the host organism.
Next, we tested expression of the different subunits in E. coli strain XL1-Blue MRF’ by Western Blot analysis using anti-His antibodies for detection. We separated the soluble and insoluble fractions and analyzed them separately. However, expression could only be shown in two cases, of which MMOC had mostly been produced solubly whereas MMOX had been produced in inclusion bodies (Figure 3).

Protein Purification - Dialysis
Finally the dxCas9 protein is dialysed and concentrated. 3mL of sample (Heparin chromatography elution fraction 5-10 of dxCas9 protein) were dialysed according to the purification protocol with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 1mM beta-Mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). After dialysis, the sample of dxCas9 protein was stored at -20℃, according to the purification protocol.
In order to analyse the concentrated dxCas9 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Final protein: 8% SDS PAGE of dxCas9 (expected size 158.3kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane 2 final dxCas9 post dialysis.
Note the dxCas9 is only one band on the 8% PAGE. The purification will be continued however, we will look deeper into this observation. What causes this double band? Is there degradation, or some other interaction with the dxcas9? Also what happened during the final dialysis step to remove the double band? Trace amounts of contaminating background is observed, however dxCas9 is significantly more in quantity and the background was tolerated for functionality testing. The final concentration of the solution was determined according to the BCA protocol on our wiki and resulted in a concentration of 0.46mg/mL or 2.88µM. The

Using the summary below, it was decided to use the centrifugal centrifuge followed by a self-cleaning filter for the removal of all the solid particles and sterilisation of the liquid throug filtration.
Week 20: September 11-15
This week we ran the PHB produced by the synthesis group and PHB standards from Sigma Aldrich on the HPLC. Following the protocol in (Karr, Waters, Emerich, 1983), we digested the PHB in 1 ml concentrated sulphuric acid at 90 degrees Celsius. We decided to run the digest for 3 hours because the PHB standards from Sigma were in large pellet form, and would probably be digested slower than the typical powder form of PHB. After the digestion was complete we cooled the samples on ice and rapidly mixed in 4 ml of 0.014N sulphuric acid. We diluted the samples by predicting the possible concentration of crotonic acid assuming an 80% conversion (Karr, Waters, Emerich, 1983) and then ran the samples on the HPLC.
Week 21: September 18-22
We also got back the results from the HPLC run we did last week. Unfortunately, while the PHB standards showed clear peaks for crotonic acid, our sample showed none. However, this could have been due to a number of reasons, including the fact that our digestion ran for too long. We found that crotonic acid was not stable for more than 60 minutes at 90 degrees Celsius (Karr, Waters, Emerich, 1983). Furthermore, our PHB was in powder form, whereas the PHB standards were in pellet form, it was quite possible that the digestion rate for our PHB was much faster. Next time, we plan to run higher concentrations of PHB and run the digest for only 30 minutes.
Week 22: September 25-29
This week we have focused on developing the safety analysis of our system. We have analysed our system and made certain adjustments to is to assure that the system is fail-safe, which means that the system's design prevents or mitigates unsafe consequences of the system's failure. That is, if and when a ""fail-safe"" system ""fails"", it is ""safe"" or at least no less"

Two Cups of Water Sign Language: They set up sign language class at Shenzhen Centre Book Store, one of the biggest book store in Shenzhen, to teach people for free. According to their person in charge, people with hearing loss account for 1/10 to 1/5 who participate in learning.
Shenzhen Ear Caring Plan: This organization provide hearing aids and Cis for child with hearing loss, aiming to let them go to school and receive education just the same as normal healthy child.
We also cooperate with Southern University of Science and Technology Volunteer (SUV), a charity group organized by students in SUSTech. They have arranged activities to help people with visual disorder and their work is very impressive. Helping with hearing-impaired people could be the next thing they plan to do.
Activities
Commonweal organizations
After collecting and analyzing our questionnaires, we found that most people lack the experience of communicating with severe hearing-impaired people. However, they showed great enthusiasm on learning more about them and caring them as possible.
We contacted some charity organizations which regularly provide lectures and information for the public. For example, Two Cups of Water Sign Language set up courses every week in Shenzhen Center Book Store for people to learn simple sign language.
We think the biggest problem of people with hearing loss is caused by communication difficult. If normal people can learn basic sign language, they can have more contact with hearing-impaired people and thus discrimination and prejudice on this population can be largely decreased. Further, it is the simplest way to make people with hearing loss feel comfortable in this society.
The questionnaire also shows many people lack basic knowledge about hearing loss. Hence, we printed booklets and also set up several public media accounts to make the public focus on things about hearing loss people including news, scientific education, welfare, etc.
In the future, we plan to join these organizations and call for more people to participate. Also, we recommended SUV to collaborate with them and create more chances for SUSTecher to help people with hearing loss.
Also, due to the considerable people who showed their interests to learn sign language during our investigation, we will propagandize sign language teaching on our social media constantly.
Company cooperation
Notably, in the questionnaire, some interviewees suggested that there could be some applications (APPs) on cellphone, functioning to simplify the communication between normal people and hearing-impaired people, and thus make people with hearing loss convenient to contact.

We were very happy to be invited to participate in this forum. Thanks for organizers. We learnt a lot from the forum.
Thursday 30/7
With the help of our senior fellow-student brothers and sisters, we studied the methods of Elisa and RNA extraction. We learned a lot in the course of experiments. But we still need to do the experiments by ourselves so that we can grasp the methods thoroughly.
Friday 31/7
Today we went to the laboratory. We succeeded in reverse transcription of RNA and kept the cDNA in refrigerator. And our cell’s growth situation was favorable.
Sunday 2/8
Today we reported our progress to our tutor in the meeting. After the meeting, we entered the cells room to continue our experiment. Cells were successfully subcultured by us.
Monday 3/8
Today, in preparation, we prepared the solution before the experiment. We used cells which were available. First of all, we extracted the RNA from cells. After running the gel electrophoresis, we detected RNA’s concentration by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. And then, we synthesized cDNA by reverse transcription. Afterwards, we detected cDNA’s concentration, and we processed the data. And then we calculated the consumption of the reagents such as water, primers and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix. We expanded the cDNA with PCR. We used the cDNA which had been expanded to run the gel electrophoresis. After all the work had been done, we cleaned up the laboratory furniture.
On the other side, the work of culturing cells was well. There were more and more cells in our cells room.
Tuesday 4/8
The result of experiment we had done yesterday was less than satisfactory. So we analyzed the reason why we failed. First of all, we found the mistake maybe caused from gene expression. Review of the literature revealed that PDE5A, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3 were expressed in kidney. The cells we used in experiment were HEK293. But we don’t know whether the genes we needed would express in HEK293 or not. So we had to consult with our tutor.

The results show the changes in optical density (λ = 600 nm) of the transformed cells. They show that the cells grew steadily.
However, when we measured the fluorescence, some values appeared negative or go down after 6-hour culturing. Thus, the Fluorescence/OD and MEFL/Particle differed from the theoretical values.
CFU
We diluted both positive and negative controls so that their OD600 became 0.1. Then, we prepared dilution series of them and spread 8.0*10³, 8.0*10⁴, 8.0*10⁵ to the agar medium, counted the number of colonies after 18 hours of cultivation. 
Discussion about CFU
We counted the CFU (Colony Forming Unit) and the following figures show the number of colony on each plate. Then, we calculated the CFU / mL in the starting sample when the optical density (λ = 600 nm) is 0.1.

Abstract
BioBrick-A-Bot: Lego Robot for Automated BioBrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot
Commercial Liquid Handling Systems are extremely expensive, and are typically beyond the reach of the average molecular biologist interested in performing high throughput methods.  To address this problem, we design and implement a liquid handling system built from commonly accessible Legos. Our goal is the automation of BioBrick assembly on a platform that can itself be easily replicated and we demonstrate a proof-of-principle for this system by transferring colored dye solutions on a 96-well plate. We introduce a new concept called LegoRoboBrick.  The liquid handling system is build from 3 new LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. The modular design of LegoRoboBricks allows easy extension of new laboratory functionalities in the future.
Project Goals
Low Cost – Robot cost significantly lower than $10,000, the price of a commercial liquid handling robot. (Actual cost of BioBrick-a-Bot prototype: ~$700)
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible.
Hardware Design that is easily replicable by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM teams.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#safety-d_-_-_TEXT.html," between the cutting sites of E and X, and S and P respectively. Since this area is a spacing area, it might be a good spot to insert the nucleotide combination we want. Difficulties in this might cause disturbance. Another idea was to expand the restriction sites E-X and S-P, but we are uncertain whether this might disturb the functionality of the part.
Size and design
Placing the watermark after the restriction sites, it should be relatively small, as to not interfere with the functionality of the part into which it is inserted. We propose that the watermark should be 12 nucleotides, divided in two groups of six which will allow for 16.777.216 combinations of A, C, G and T in total.
The watermark must not contain any restriction-enzymes or stop codons. If the watermark accidentally contained a restriction-enzyme or a stop codon, the watermark would interfere with the function of the part into which it is inserted, and would likely render the part useless. This severely restricts the number of combinations we can use. Ideally we would have liked to use more nucleotides, as we would have been able to generate more combinations. But the watermark should be as small as possible as not to interfere with the functions (i.e. cause a frame shift) of the part and not make the design of primers unduly complicated. We could make relatively long watermarks to satisfy our need for a very large number of possible combinations, but it would make the design of the necessary primers extremely complicated, and would go against our goal of making the insertion of watermarks as small and easy a procedure as possible. We believe that the best compromise between the amount of combinations and the ease of insertion would be at around 12 nucleotides.
License
Every team and lab/company which works with synthetic biology will be assigned a specific “license plate”, unique to them and being their ‘ID’ on parts-registry. An extension to parts registry’s search function should then be added. If its database contains information on each “license”, one could easily find information on a foreign organism, in case they found it in the wild (that is, anywhere else than the lab), and had it sequenced afterwards. Upon entering the parts-registry, one should then be able to enter the license and gain access to information on the parts that the team / lab / company has created. Anyone should be able to enter the license code into the parts-registry and gain access to all information on the creating team, the parts created by the team, and of course some contact information, in order"

Ann Zahle Andersen
I am a post.doc at the microbiology group of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at SDU. I have a past in systems biology and mathematical modeling, but am currently researching in the field of food microbiology.
I was introduced to the iGEM team in May and immediately saw great potential. Therefore I am truly honored to be an instructor on their project and look forward to lots of fun and good science over the summer.
Martin Hanczyc
This is my second year participating as an advisor for the SDU iGEM team.  I am very pleased to see growing interest in the students who seek to educate themselves in this new field of synthetic biology.  And their initiative in pursuing high-risk projects warms my heart.  I am so pleased with the degree of success they have achieved due to their hard work, creativity and relentless determination.  I think I have learned more from their example then they have learned from me.    As an associate professor at SDU, I am primarily interested in developing laboratory models of complex systems that have life like properties.  This is done through my participation in the research center called FLinT (fundamental living technology).  Currently my research lies in physics and chemistry, but my interests are based in biology and evolution.

Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark.  I am interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli cause disease. In my group, we aim to identify bacterial virulence factors and further characterize the molecular cross-talk taking place at the host-pathogen interface during infection. In this framework the C. elegans model organism is used extensively for both genetic and proteomic analyses of bacterial infection.  As a supporter throughout the summer I have become truly impressed by the SDU iGEM team enthusiasm and genuine interest in science. They really make things"

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#TSS_-_-_TEXT.html," | qPCR using specific primer pairs to relatively quantify recombined sites. Original attB/P site with specific primer pairs A and B is shown in Fig.4 c. Pair A used to detect original site, while pair B used to detect recombined site. qPCR test is conducted on each sample using both types of primer pairs, obtaining CtA and CtB. By assuming the amplification efficiency as 2, recombined attL/R sites rate can be calculated from CtA and CtB. For Bxb1 and TG1, the experiments were done with previous orthogonality plasmid which have all 5 attB/P sites. Error bars are shown(n=4; n=8 for Bxb1). Experiments were set up in E. coli TOP10 strain with transcriptional factors cultured at 37℃.
All of the integrase are able to catalyze the recombination reaction in our system. Among 5 integrases, phiBT1 shows the best feature of staying low and steady recombined attL/R rate before induction and reaching high rate after induced. phiBT1 is good enough for building sequential memory structures and being a basic memory device. Although phiC31 achieves low-rate recombination, but the induction can make an obvious difference. As a result, it is enough for us to use phiC31 as a memory device. Other integrases are difficult to control by inducing due to high leakage or other reasons. However, some integrases such as Bxb1 show good performance in other teams' system, so we think the result may be affected by the system we designed(two plasmid system) in this experiment.
Validation of the sequential memory structures
Overview
The key part of our project is the sequential memory structures, making validating this part the most important work. Unluckily, we are still working on this. In Fig.8, we show the plasmid we are working on.

Phthalate Biosensor
BPA Biosensor
BPA Biosensor
The Nuclear Fusion project currently has two similar directions that it may turn but both involve a plasmid construct very generously donated to our iGEM team from David W. Wood, Department of Chemical Engineering at Princeton University. Research in their lab has constructed a biosensor containing just the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor (ER). The ER is very similar to the PPAR and other hormone receptors. Previous attempts at isolating the LBD failed due to the specific folding pattern of this region required to maintain similar binding characteristics to natural ER. The folding pattern was kept by inserting the LBD into a minimal splicing intein domain. This construct was also made more soluble by addition of a maltose-binding tag. The ER was fused with a thymidylate synthase enzyme (TS) that remains deactivated until homodimerization of the ER after binding ligand. The cells are grown on thymine-free plates allowing for recognition of strength and function of ER ligands.
Our plan for this project is to work on the sensitivity of the biosensor in hopes of using this for water prescreens, similar to the Smart Fold Reporter project. The sensitivity will be focused for BPA which has a very different conformation than the natural agonist of the ER system. This difference causes BPA to bind weakly but still disturbs normal ER function. One idea is to replace the ER LBD from Wood’s biosensor with the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) LBD. The ERR is similar to ER and binds many of the same ligands and has a tendency to bind to the estrogen response element (ERE) in the human body. The one benefit of ERR for our project is that it binds BPA very strongly. Another direction that this project could take would be to analyze the LBD of ER and perform directed evolution to increase BPA sensitivity. During directed evolution, certain regions of the ER LBD would be targeted for random mutagenesis providing a library of mutants in the trillions. The mutant library would be induced with BPA and the best growing colony would be selected, tested, and mutated for further sensitivity.

Outreach
We decided early on that we wanted to engage as much as possible with the society and especially with our high school students and children. The youth are the upcoming in the field of science as well as the ones that will be most affected by the antibiotic resistance and plastic pollution. We believe that the more awareness of these problems the better - the same goes for general knowledge of synthetic biology and GMO’s.
We have raised awareness of iGEM, synthetic biology, bioethics and research ethics. The forms of engagement range from participating in official events at our university to a theme day both in the laboratory and in the classroom at high schools.
Research day
Every year in April the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) arranges a whole day filled with workshops, lectures and talks. This year the department of biochemistry and Molecular Biology had a big workshop area with the theme “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” : the probiotic bacteria, the pathogenic bacteria and the multiresistant bacteria. With our focus on antibiotic resistance we fitted right in. We spend the entire day discussing, explaining and teaching - we had so much fun and learned a lot both about how the concept of synthetic biology is perceived in the society, but also how we should communicate it.
High School talks
We have talked several times before an audience composed of high school students.
BioOL
Our first attempt was the Danish participants for the International Biology Olympiad . They were the perfect audience, asking a lot of critical questions, which made us think twice about how we made our presentation. We altered to make it less focused on what iGEM is and more foused on the community aspect and the problem of antibiotic resistance.
KOLD College and Odense Tekniske Gymnasium
We also had the pleasure of presenting our project and a talk about bioethics for two technical high schools in Odense: Odense Technical High School (OTG) and KOLD College . At KOLD College we had an entire theme day where we helped the students in the laboratory and entertained them in between with details of our project. This included the preliminary presentation, which we will bring to Boston and theory"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KimberlyChang_-_-_TEXT.html," explained these issues to her. She didn’t have any major problems with what we have right now, though she did tell Nicole that because she wants to overhaul the code and fix the tilt animation, she should overhaul the code first, otherwise she would end up doing the work twice.
July 11: Today I worked on more graphics for the Sifteo cubes. I finished up the tilt, shake and ice cube graphics and started on some of the alerts. Nicole, meanwhile, was able to get the Cube images in order so that the animations would play correctly.
July 12: I realized that the animations for the alerts we need will depend on what the final form of the cubes looks like. Since we are planning on housing the cubes in custom casing, I realized that if I started working on the animations now, without knowing what the cubes’ final forms would be, I could end up with a lot of extra work later to change the animations. I talked to Wendy about this and she suggested that I start working on the redesign of the iGEM wiki. I met with Consuelo, and she went through the current iGEM wiki, saying that the 2012 page should be distinguished from the 2011 one, so that people would know that Wellesley was no longer in a team with BU this year. She wanted the font and color scheme changed. If the site was going to be completely overhauled, Consuelo said that she wanted the site to be all on one page, and that we would use JQuery to skip to different sections of the page. She then pointed me to the site onepagelove.com, a showcase of different one-page websites. I spent a while looking at some of the pages on the site and came up with a few concepts of what the redesign could look like. Consuelo late said that she’d like me to come in tomorrow with a rough design of the website.
July 13: I finished up some rough designs for the website and continued researching JQuery. I did some tutorials on W3School and made some simple code that toggled and hid a paragraph of text when you click on an image.
Week of July 16
July 16: Today I talked to Consuelo about the designs for our iGEM website. She told me that I didn’t have to worry about the coding so much because that would be a lab effort, but she added that I should work on the color scheme and the any text that’s needed for the final design.

Alternative versions of the bacterial two-hybrid system
Another form of two hybrid screening is the bacterial two hybrid system made in E.coli. The system can be used to examine both DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Much like the yeast two hybrid system, the bacterial two hybrid system revolves around the interaction between two proteins, which lead to the activation of a reporter-gene like the lacZ-reporter gene. One protein consist of a DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to another domain called interaction domain 1 (ID1). The second protein consists of a part of the E.coli RNA polymerase fused to a  domain, interaction domain 2 (ID2). For the activation of lacZ expression to occur there must be an interaction between ID1 and ID2 and the DBD must bind to a DNA binding site (DBS) near the lacZ-gene promoter. The interaction between ID1 and ID2 recruit the RNA polymerase to the lacZ-promoter initiating transcription. Reference: SIMON L. DOVE, J. KEITH JOUNG* & ANN HOCHSCHILD.

Abstract
Cancer is one of the three major killers that threatened mankind since the 21st century. The reason is that it is not taken seriously at the beginning of cancer until it is detected in the middle and late stages, resulting in a very low cure rate. Therefore, early detection becomes a decisive factor to improve the cure rate of cancer. In this project, we use alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)as an example, using the factor that AFP can specifically bind to the aptamer, to achieve a signal conversion that using a small molecule (lysine) to replace AFP content in serum, just like equivalent substitutions in mathematics, to achieve the early detection of liver cancer. This system can be extended to all of the disease detection, which use protein as biomarkers.
Introduction
Technical significance：
AFP is a major fetal plasma protein. Serum AFP is always low expressed in healthy adults, but often high expressed in nearly 75% HCC patients with more than 500 ng/ml.AFP is a liver cancer associated protein and has long been utilized as a serum tumor biomarker of disease progression.
Figure 1 ：The Structure Model of AFP
Clinical significance：
Monitoring the level of molecular markers of disease contributes to the early diagnosis of disease, the monitoring of treatment and the prognosis of the disease, which is also a great significance for clinic. However, the molecular markers concentration in our body is very low, making it difficult to analysis and detect directly.
The conventional method is ELISA and other antibody-based techniques to enrich low-abundance molecular markers. ELISA which is based on ""antigen-antibody reaction"" of the detection method is a little bit expensive. Time and temperature are having a greater impact for its detection.
The purpose of this project is to establish a detection platform suitable for most molecular markers. The platform is low cost, simple to operate and has strong anti - interference ability.

This project uses the AP273 with the highest binding to AFP and the complementary chain paired with the aptamer. Aptamer is an oligonucleotide sequence or short polypeptide obtained by in vitro screening. Aptamer, as an alternative to the antibody, can bind to the corresponding ligand with high affinity and strong specificity. Its low price, easy to screen synthesis, the nature of stability and other advantages are widely"

Conclusions
The bio-computing method we have come up with is a brand-new way to solve the SPP problem effectively. Based on the standardization principals and abstraction strategies of synthetic biology, the results also validated synthetic biology as a valuable approach to biological engineering. In the discussion concerning its augmentability, the potential value and superiority of solving NPC problems can be observed when combining metabolism pathway modification engineering.

When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.
Add 1 volume Binding Buffer (XP2).
Incubate at 60°C for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Vortex or shake the tube every 2-3 minutes.
Important: Monitor the pH of the Gel/Binding Buffer mixture after the gel has completely dissolved. DNA yields will significantly decrease when the pH > 8.0. If the color of the mixture becomes orange or red, add 5 µL 5M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to bring the pH down. After this adjustment, the color of the Gel/Binding Buffer mixture should be light yellow.

Es gibt dabei jeweils ein Antigen für die Blutgruppe A und ein Antigen für die Blutgruppe B; Erythrozyten der Blutgruppe AB tragen dementsprechend beide Antigene auf ihrer Oberfläche. Rote Blutkörperchen der Blutgruppe O haben dagegen keinen der beiden Antigene. Ein Mensch bildet immer Antikörper gegen die jeweils nicht im eigenen Blut vertretenen Antigene, entsprechend haben Menschen mit Blutgruppe A Antikörper gegen Blutgruppe B und anders herum. Menschen mit Blutgruppe AB bilden folglich keinen der Antikörper und Menschen mit Blutgruppe O bilden beide. Kommt beispielsweise von Antikörpern gereinigtes Blut der Blutgruppe B bei einer Transfusion zu einem Menschen mit Blutgruppe A in Kontakt, werden die Antikörper des Transfusionsempfängers die empfangenen Blutgruppe B Erythrozyten angreifen und verklumpen. Bei einer Bluttransfusion muss als Folge davon auf die Kompatibilität des Empfänger-Immunsystems (Recipient) mit dem Spenderblut (Donor) geachtet werden:
Wie anhand obiger Tabelle ersichtlich ist, ist Blutgruppe O aufgrund des Nichtvorhandenseins von Antigenen auf der Oberfläche der Erythrozyten die universelle Spenderblutgruppe - Blutgruppe O ist mit jedem Empfänger-Immunsystem kompatibel, vor allem wenn gleichzeitig kein Rhesusfaktor-Antigen vorhanden ist. Aufgrund dieser Eigenschaft als universelle Spenderblutgruppe kommt Blutkonserven der Blutgruppe O Rh- eine besondere Bedeutung in der Notfallmedizin zu, da diese Konserven an jeden unbekannten Patienten ohne Komplikationen transfusioniert werden können.

As the top competition in the field of synthetic biology, the iGEM competition represents the vision and efforts of the new force in the field of scientific research. Our team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, built in 2008, participates in iGEM competition for the tenth year in 2018. In the past ten years, the team has been focusing on the issues of basic science, medicine, and sociology from a scientific perspective, which has provided possibilities for people's better life in a synthetic biology. We make a significant progress in thinking about synthetic biology, science, and society. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the development of synthetic biology and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, we organized a science exhibition on the topic of synthetic biology to promote the development of the discipline and provide the public with opportunities to understand science and participate in science.
The exhibition of synthetic biology was held at No. 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, and was held in the East Exhibition Area of the main library of Shanghai Jiaotong University Library. The exhibition period was 2018.08.20-2018.09.10. The 20-day exhibition is divided into two parts: “Into Synthetic Biology” and “Ten Years of History, Synthetic Brilliance”. The first part, ""Into Synthetic Biology"", introduces the public to the origins of synthetic biology, subject ideas, development processes, typical technologies, important achievements, and prospects for the future of synthetic biology. Through the informative texts, lively illustrations, and easy-to-understand explanations, the public is presented to all aspects of this emerging discipline, establishing the original impression of the new direction in the development of the current life sciences for the public, and making the public has a new understanding that the science can bring happiness to human beings It also provides a new perspective for the public to more rationally deal with the various effects brought about by the development of science and technology. The second part, ""Ten Years of History, Synthetic Brilliance"", reviewed our ten-year team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai's building concept, the course of the competition, and the projects of each year, which further expands the influence of iGEM in the public and also shows iGEMer's spirit of exploration, rigorous scientific attitude, innovative research philosophy and broad social feelings to the public.
The exhibition achieved very good response. In the 20 days, our exhibition attracted a large number of people to visit. In the guest book on the exhibition"

According to our simulation result, produced by a constitutive                                           promoter, Bax is fully expressed after 80 minuutes and it’s highest                                           molecule number is 380.
BI-1 is induced by TFs which is induced by galactose, we can                                           describe it as following:
Simulation
In different Galactose concentrations, the system will express                                           different concentrations of BI-1. We use MATLAB GUI to simulate                                           the process.
Figure 10 : Simulation result
You can adjust the Galactose concentration and observe the                                           change of BI-1’s concentration. If BI-1’s concentration is higher                                           than Bax which simulated before, the yeast will survive. From                                           the simulation result, we know if galactose’s concentration is                                           lower than 0.02g/ml, the yeast will die.
