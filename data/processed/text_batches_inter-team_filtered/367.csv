iGEM focuses on science, but also encompasses community outreach, communication, representation and last but not least, fun in the lab. All this is often communicated best with visual impressions. Several team wikis feature great photos, but some of them are hard to find. Therefore, we thought it would be best to bundle them and highlight the best ones to maximize impact. This is why we started an iGEM photo-contest: The Cuckoo Clock Competition. As the name implies, the first prize is an original Cuckoo Clock typical for the gorgeous Black Forest surrounding Freiburg. All teams are cordially invited to participate! Please send your pictures of choice representing your team, project, spirit or fun in the lab along with a short description to our e-mail address:     igem.freiburg.2010@googlemail.com
Your pictures will be uploaded to the competition webpage as soon as we get them. In addition, we will send you a participation badge for your team wiki. A judging committee consisting of members from three different iGEM teams will vote for the winner picture.  The team with the best picture will receive our amazing Cuckoo Clock in Boston at the socializing event on Sunday. So put your stressful projects aside for a few minutes and take the fun part!
Looking forward to meeting you in Boston.
Cheers,

Matthijs Tadema
MSc Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
I am passionate about studying the molecular processes that together make up all life. Recently I have gained a new passion in the form of molecular dynamics, and i have contributed a lot to the project in this field. I believe the tangible nature of molecular dynamics simulations speak to the imagination and really make understanding of molecular processes intuitive.
Benno Diekmann
MSc Pharmacy
I joined iGEM to make more experience in science and because it’s awesome. I find the multidisciplinary approach and the fact that we have to make the plans and find the funding for our research ourselves to be very appealing and a great learning experience.
Bram Wiggers
MSc Artificial Intelligence
This is the first year of my Master Artificial Intelligence, a study that really challenges me. This year we will put more focus on the new technical possibilities that AI can bring to bioengineering.
Noa Leijdesdorff
BSc Biomedical Engineering
Being part of the iGem team has allowed me to combine my love for innovation with working in an interdisciplinary group of ambitious people all working towards the same awesome goal: taking one giant step towards a more sustainable bio-based economy.
Matthijs Pals
BSc Artificial Intelligence & BSc Biomedical Engineering
I joined iGEM hoping to be able to apply this combined knowledge in the programming and modelling tasks. Besides that I’m also doing some work on the outreach part since I am somewhat able with Photoshop, even though I still feel more comfortable with a non-digital brush.
Phillip Yesley
BSc Chemistry
Hey there, I’m Phillip ! I joined  IGEM because it sounded like a lot of fun and I was interested in learning more about Biotechnology.  My biggest contribution to our project was my work on the Mathematical Modelling. I also assisted with lab work, by helping complete the interlab project and other dirty tasks. Furthermore, I tried my hand at a multitude of other small challenges an iGEM project sets. Cold-calling Midwestern Styrene producers for sponsorship stands out the most. I’m currently finishing my Bachelor in chemistry and love to read in my spare time.
Jan Marten Wielenga

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#HP#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," by ourselves independently. We focused on ear caring and called on public awareness on hearing loss.
We gave out our booklets ""Shape and Sound"" in SUSTech. We called on ear caring and public awareness on hearing loss.
Approaching the Public
We designed a questionnaire on the internet (link: sojump ) and investigated about whether people know about iGEM, and their experiences related to hearing-impaired people. We collected about 500 answers and did data analysis shown as below.
Question 1: Have you ever communicated with hearing impaired people in your daily life?
Despite the large amount of hearing-impaired people shown in the statistical data, fewer people have communicated with people with hearing loss. The communication difficulties may make them never have chance to come into contact with normal people.
Question 2: Do you know how to use sign language to communicate with people?
We found that very few people can use sign language to communicate, even simplest words. The reason could be the lack of attention to hearing-impaired people, or the lack of sign language spreading itself. Whatever, popularize sign language is impending.
Question 3: Do you find it difficult to communicate with people with hearing difficulties?
For those who have communicated with hearing-impaired people, about 80% feel it difficult. Undoubtedly, this is the truth. To eliminate this trouble, on one hand, sign language should be popularized. On the other hand, hearing aids and cochlear implants and clinical therapies need to be improved and pervaded.
Question 4: If sign language classes is added in general education as optional courses, would you like to learn some simple sign language?
More than half of the people expressed their interests into sign language learning. Actually, most people hold their kind heart to treat people with inconvenience.
Question 5: Do you know iGEM? (before answering this questionnaire)
Actually, because our questionnaire was spread to the public, half of people investigated have not heard about iGEM before. We have the necessity to make more people know synthetic biology and know iGEM, for these really change our world.
Consultation
To obtain more information about the life of people with hearing impairment, we consulted specialists who work in various areas, as well as some relevant local charity or official associations. From the dimension of Policy, Law, Medication, Philanthropy and Research, we consulted lawyers and judges, doctors, professors and managers of several charity organizations. At the same time, we introduced our project and received suggestions to promote our project.

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," are trying to conduct high impact science from a nation with peripheral status (Tardy 2006).
Other effects of the language barrier can be seen in international scientific collaborations. It is well established that the growing importance of international scientific collaborations requires not only common knowledge and understanding of the scientific terminology, but also clear communication. Using a common language is the intuitive way to achieve this and English has been filling that role (Hwang 2012). Again, non-native speakers are at a disadvantage, Babcock and Du-Babcok (2001) explain that “in communication encounters, low proficiency second-language speakers contribute fewer ideas than do fluent second-language speakers or first-language speakers”. Interestingly a study conducted by Ylvanez and Shrum in 2009 showed that a reason behind the collaboration between Philippine and Japanese scientists and engineers was their similar, low levels of English competency (Ylvanez & Shrum 2009), reflecting perhaps a method of compromise so the voices of both sides can be heard equally.
Study Methods
Language data was collected as follows: We looked into all the teams that participated in iGEM over the years (iGEM 2004 – 2014) and looked into the country. If the country has only one official language, that is considered the language of the team. For countries with more than one official languages, we looked into the specific language of the institution, as well as the location of the institution within the country (for example, in India and Canada, different languages are spoken in geographical regions). In order to get a better insight in the finalists of previous years, we contacted students of this year’s team from the same university and, when possible, members of the finalist team. That gave us a good insight into the teaching methods of their university, attitude to iGEM and how that reflects on the result of the competition. QS rankings was our university ranking system of choice, because it put a lot of gravity in Academic reputation of the institutions and citations per faculty, while it did not ignore the universities’ diversity, by looking into the international student ratio and the international staff ratio (QS 2014).
For data on judges The iGEM organization publishes the names of the participating judges from the year 2009 up to 2013. Between 2011 and 2013, when the regional jamborees occurred, there is a record of judges that were part of the regionals, as well as the championships. Our first assumption was that all judges speak English. We then took each name and tried to match it to an individual and via online CVs, LinkedIn"

NCTU_Formosa,2017,Team:NCTU Formosa#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"iang Chen invited the gifted students from TCFSH who decided to learn about biology to our lab. NCTU_Formosa then gave them a series of training, the SOP of                 our wet lab protocol, which includes:
- Cultivation of E. Coli
- Miniprep
- Digestion
- Ligation
- Transformation
- PCR
- Gel Electrophoresis
Figure 1: The photo of the students from TCFSH taking a course
     These are basic experimental skills for people who study biology and so as every iGEMers. Especially for the digestion part, while it is one of the most important parts for iGEMers, we also taught them about the concept of biobrick assembly, the design of EXSP, different kinds of parts of biobrick… and so on.
     And in this summer, we were glad to know that some TCFSH students decided to participate iGEM, new iGEMers were born. There are more things that a new team need to know, more knowledge to learn. NCTU_Formosa members taught                 them more about :
- Useful databases, such as NCBI, Uniport
- Useful tools for protein, such as BLAST, COBALT, CD search
- Biology experiment design and debug
- Writing Biobricks for synthesis (in sequences)
Figure 2: The photo of  the students discussing about tools for protein
     We hope they could get more information in a short time and see the power of bioinformatics, it’s also a concept of our project. Some of our members spent days with these high school students discussing their ideas and helped them to design experiments to realize their ideas. Later, they finally came out with their own biobrick sequences.
     Through practicing and discussion, they completed many experiments on their own, including purification of plasmids, digestion with restriction enzyme, and conducting gel electrophoresis. They even came up with more outstanding thoughts about the project they’ve schematized this year. We are looking forward to the great shine of the team in Boston this year and get valuable experiences

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Week1_-_-_TEXT.html," also spoke to representatives from Bioline, Qiagen, Fisher Science and Star Labs about the products they sold which we would likely require later on in the project; a few representatives even spoke about possible sponsorships and working with the iGEM team more closely, and we were able to leave with a few business cards giving us a few avenues to pursue.
Day 2 (10/07/12)
Today was a day largely involving meetings and planning ahead of the start of the project the following day. We met in the morning to discuss the project and we confirmed that we would be going into the lab the next day to transform E. coli with some earmarked BioBricks. Richard Bowater and Richard Kelwick told us that they had been able to synthesise a hybrid bacterial and mammalian, nitric oxide-sensitive promoter using PyeaR and NS2E9 elements in two orientations which would be the starting point of our BioBrick. We then looked at BioBricks produced by past teams to decide which BioBricks would be relevant to our project and therefore we would be transforming into the chassis; we decided on using the nitric oxide sensor developed by our advisors, and two BioBricks associated with bioluminescence.
We also looked at deadlines for iGEM and began to draft our project outline for the deadline later that week. Richard Bowater also informed us of the COSHH forms we would be signing ahead of the lab work the next day and uploaded them to our Google Drive account so we could read over them and ensure our first day of lab work was completed with a high degree of safety. We then looked at the finances and began to discuss our trip to Amsterdam as well as organising the purchase of a Promega card for the university's Promega vending machine. The rest of the afternoon was then spent discussing our film, logo and future human practices events; we also found out that our radio interview would be in just 2 days!
In the afternoon we sat in on a talk from a representative from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) on funding for research and how changes are being made to grants. We learnt that the BBSRC wanted their grant applicants to consider the 'impact' of their research (both in a scientific and economical sense) as part of their applications for funding; following this talk we too will be looking at what impact our research may make as part of our work on the ethics and future applications of our work.

Problem
Hyperuricemia refers to the abnormal high level of uric acid in the blood. The most frequently affected area is the joint, which can cause acute gout arthritis, chronic gout arthritis and joint deformity. However, joint injury is only the tip of the iceberg of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia can also damage the kidney, causing abnormal renal function, kidney stones, renal colic and other chronic kidney diseases. Hyperuricemia not only damages the joints and kidneys, but also is closely related to metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and fatty liver.

Used 3 µL in a 50 µL dilution (49+1) of 1 ul of 55 ng/µL concentration of plasmids
1.82 V for 5.00 ms according to the electroporator
Team ZF
Checking on Pos Con 77, OZs, and Zif 268 plates
Unfortunately, nothing grew on our plates from yesterday. Our time constants from the electroporation were rather low (~3.8), so 50 ul may not be enough to see growth. We decided to spin down the cells, resuspend them in 50 ul of LB, and re-plated this solution. We also re-did the transformation using ChemComp cells, and made 100 ul plates. Both sets of plates were left overnight at 37*.
Designing the reporter strain
Instead of placing the GFP reporter on a separate plasmid, we decided to insert it on our expression plasmid, immediately after our zinc fingers, and before the transcription terminator. We placed a ribosome binding site (Shine Dalgarno sequence: AGGAGGTT before the GFP. We will only add the GFP to Zif 268 (whole) because if we can show through GFP that the selection system works for Zif 268, we can assume it also works for the other zinc fingers. This is easier and more cost effective than ordering 12 different primers for each of our plasmids.
We will construct the reporter strain by performing a PCR to get the plasmid in linear form. We will also perform a second PCR to get out GFP and add homology regions to our Zif 268 plasmid, as well as adding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The primers for these PCRs were ordered today. We'll then assemble these pieces to construct a whole plasmid, and transform our bacteria.
PCR with Practice Plate
We performed a PCR to amplify our F1s from the practice plate. We used our primers for CB bottom (primer index: 66 and 67) for the 18 targets and our primers for the controls (primer index: 72 and 73) for the 6 controls. We had an annealing temperature of 52 degrees and an extension time of 15 seconds.

We got products for all of the oligos at our expected product size of 131 bp.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  We transformed these ligations with electrocompetent and chemicompetent E. coli cells, and this time we got four colonies on the electrocompetent E.coli plate for the BioBrick plasmid of P450scc! The other plates which were our transformed chemicompetent E. coli, and our electrocompetent E. coli with 3BH ligation failed. Since we had four colonies that contained our P450scc plasmid we index plated them, inoculated them into liquid media and miniprepped out the plasmid. To confirm if the E. coli actually had our P450scc Biobrick, we performed a colony PCR, and a restriction digest. Both the colony PCR and restriction digest had inconclusive results, and we were not able to tell if the plasmid was actually our P450scc BioBrick.
Using newly procured T4 DNA ligase and buffer to prevent any implications, since the buffer has a limited, low amount of freeze-thaw cycles. Then we chose colonies from the plates which were isolated and ran a yeast transformation for TEF1, but found that overgrowth had occurred and the results were no longer fit to continue with.
To ensure fluorescence, we recognized that since the S. cerevisiae strain contains the mStrawberry and yCitrene fluorescent proteins, we figured out a way to grow it in a liquid culture to log phase. We would then centrifuge the cells and place the pellet in new YPD with galactose to induce the GAL1 promoter. Then we would let it grow for two to four hours and follow up by testing the fluorescence levels of mStrawberry to yCitrene for the Tsynth8, Tsynth30, and TEF1 in S. cerevisiae.
We then restreaked colonies from the overgrown Tsynth8 and Tsynth30 plates from isolated colonies. Then we transformed the TEF1 plates again into Y. lipolytica because the overgrown plates contained zero isolated colonies without signs of contamination. We used 3 uL of the plasmid from the miniprep procedure and transformed Y. lipolytica and 100 uL of it and plated on leucine deficient plates; the plates were left in incubation for two days.
We clean and concentrated the PCR products and quantified them with a nanodrop with good results. We then prepared the samples for Sanger sequencing and sent them out to Sequetech. In the meantime of waiting for results, we made more liquid stocks of"

The aim of these roundtables was to make everyone learn more about Synthetic Biology straight from professionals, along with knowing more about what they could do once the iGEM is over, how they can transform their project into a professional activity. This was also for us the occasion to host professional in an international-class event: we took that in consideration and organized a special VIP cocktail area where we were able to meet them after the roundtables.
We also decided to ask all the teams to come with a poster, and to be able to present their project to everyone. This would be very useful as a training fort the Boston Jamboree, and would allow every European team to meet and discover each other’s projects.
Our team is also really grateful to the laboratories INSERM …., that give us the material we needed  to arrange our paillasse.
Thanks to the IONIS Education group, we were able to find the perfect place where to host our event. We also managed to get a discount on a local hotel and provide a cheap housing for every team who wanted one. This way, we would be able to host as much teams as possible, in the same place ! After sending our invitations, we got a confirmation from 30 teams scattered all around Europe, coming from 11 different countries.
We also wanted this event to be fun for all iGEMers, along with an opportunity for them to discover Paris and the French culture. For this reason, visits and activities in Paris were planned for the second day. We also managed to get a partnership with Paul, allowing everyone to discover French breads and pastries.
The whole event was really amazing all along, whether when we were preparing it (announcing it and receiving messages from people all across Europe was a blast), or when we were living it: we finally got to see all of the teams we have been in contact with, and meeting everyone in such an atmosphere was very exciting !
We also had the occasion to communicate with teams, through communication tools like Twitter and Facebook, and also through a dedicated app the iGEM IONIS team developed: this « companion app » was the perfect road book  a map of the event, a schedule with every major event planned, and even a selection of nearby restaurants and places to eat.
The whole event turned out very well and we received tons of positive feedbacks, which really comforts us in our idea of making it a periodic event. We created a common association, called iGEM ESOC (European Symposium Organisation Committee), and are"

NKU_China,2017,Team:NKU China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," by the earth’s crust energy. And then there is secondary oil recovery, in which crude oil is driven by efforts provided by other things such as waterpower. One of the most commonly used methods is to drill water into the oil reservoir through the injection well to push the oil to the easiest and shortest path. Then with automatically erupting or oil extractor, crude oil finally reaches the ground. But there is a problem in the long run of using method. There is a tendency that liquids flow along the pathway with least resistance. Water mainly flows through existing and dilating channels, which stops brushing the oil hidden in the soil, so the remaining oil will be hard to exploit. So on the base of this, there is tertiary oil recovery, which is enhanced water injection technique by means of physical, chemical and biological ways for higher oil recovery efficiency.
In tertiary oil recovery, there are two common techniques. First, block. After injecting the bacterial culture, bacteria preferentially flow through high osmosis zones and some finally settled down in the pores, where bacteria begin to grow. Then at an appropriate time we add inducer to lead the expression of bacterial metabolites, which contribute to form embolism. With the existence of embolism in water path, when we inject water once again, it flows to the low osmotic zone, which makes it rather easy to wash off crude oil in newly formed water passage, consequently enhance the oil production. Besides, emulsification is a process to help the oil be released from the pores, in which emulsifiers emulsify incompatible oil and water to form relatively stable emulsions. Due to the presence of surfactants, non-polar hydrophobic droplets become charged colloidal particles, which increase surface area and surface energy. Because of the polarity and surface energy, the charged oil droplets adsorb the reverse or polar water molecules in the water to form colloidal double layer, which prevents the collision between oil droplets, and makes the oil droplets stably exist in water for a long time. Obviously, this is beneficial for the oil in the pores to be washed out easily.
2. Our Choice
We choose MEOR—Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery. So what is MEOR? It is one tertiary oil recovery method that uses the interaction between microbes and their metabolites and crude oil reservoir to enhance the oil recovery efficiency. As is known to us, MEOR is an effective oil recovery technique with simple construction and low cost. It is expected to become one of the main techniques for stabilizing oil and water and improving oil recovery in the later period of oil"

After these samples was sent to sequencing, only BBa_C0012 and BBa_C0040 with vitamin B12 was correct. BBa_J23108 wasn’t ligate with mRFP-P0440. Next, I removed the first RBS part from mRFP-P0412 and mRFP-P0440 by using PCR and did gel purification to purified these two parts (92.6ng/ μL, 106.2 ng/ μL). Then I tried to ligate each hybrid promoter with mRFP-P0412 and mRFP-P0440 without RBS. And transformed these ligation product and cultured them overnight. Last, I tried to ligate ChiA part with secretion tag and transformed it, but the length of the final products were still same as the previous results.
Week 12 (7th -13th September, 2016)
Firstly, I picked up colony from the hybrid promoter with new mRFP-P0412 and mRFP-P0440 plates and checked inserted parts by PCR(Fig.15),  only P1, P2 P3 plus mRFP part were correct, P1 and P4 with mRFP-P0440 failed. Then I sent the PCR products to sequence and the results were correct except for P3 with mRFP-P0440. Then I tried to amplify ChiA with tag and got three bands that was over 2000 bp. I sent them to sequence, but the results are still not correct. Next, I transformed BBa_J23106 and BBa_K516032 from the 2016 kits, after cultured them overnight, I purified plasmid (76.8 ng/μL, 59.6 ng/μL), then I digested them and ligate BBa_K516032 with BBa_J23106 and riboswitch Bs-yxjA part and Bs-xpt part. After transformation of these ligation products, I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR. But the results were not correct at the first time. Next, I tried to ligate BBa_J23114 and BBa_B0034 again, but the results were still not good. Then, I amplified mRFP with terminator by using PCR and digested them with XbaI and PstI.

For future improvements of this mathematical modeling, we could add the glucose uptake and glucose participation in metabolism in order to fix this problem.

OUR MINDSET
The start of every venture begins with research. Before we began, we only had general knowledge of  hydroponics, and a limited understanding of oxidative stress damage and benefits. These topics, however, are fundamental to how Oxyponics works and how it will be applied. We knew we needed to understand the intricacies of the problem, the industry we were trying to break into, the needs and wants of the end users, the science behind the design, the environmental impact of our system, and the communities that would be affected by advances in hydroponics.
We set out on a mission to interact with, learn from, and integrate feedback from scientists in the field, existing businesses, our end users, and community leaders. We implemented the principles of design thinking to: first, identify the problem to be solved; second, go to the users to find how to solve the problem in the best way; and third, get user feedback on what we developed.
We developed our project using the expertise and personal accounts of the individuals we spoke to, from the beginning stages of conceptualization to the end creation of our project.
We simultaneously conducted interviews best organized into five categories, seen in the tabs below. Interviews in each category were conducted with interwoven timelines that spanned the development of our project. This method let us organically gain insights about a large range of aspects relevant to OxyPonics, and led us to see how far-reaching our project was, even beyond just improving plant growth. We gained a sense of how our Oxyponics would fit into the larger industry and how our biocircuit could have further applications. The learnings from all of our research and interviews were put together like puzzle pieces to make informed decisions regarding product development and to envision product impacts.
Throughout the process of bringing a product to reality with truly integrated human practices, we spoke to over 45 contacts:
5 oxidative stress researchers,
6 plant biologists,
30 hydroponic crop growers,
4 hydroponic supplies vendors,
2 community leaders.

Outreach in Practice
CommunityBricks and AlumniGEM
At SB5.0, the Cornell, Brown-Stanford, Arizona State, University of Panama, and UTP Panama iGEM teams gathered iGEMers together to discuss two initiatives:  a global outreach/ human practices collaboration and the formation of the iGEM Alumni Association.
Since SB5.0, many iGEM teams have come together to create CommunityBricks , a resource of outreach and human practices activities for future iGEM teams to use and add to.  We envision that this resource--soon to be a part of iGEM.org--will help iGEM teams promote synthetic biology to the global community.
Additionally, ASU has been collaborating with iGEM HQ and other iGEM teams to create iGEM's alumni association!  We all assisted Brown-Stanford iGEM in creating a fabulous networking tool, the AlumniGEM forums , which contains alumni profiles and discussion platforms.  And check out the beginnings of the AlumniGEM website , a collaboration between iGEM teams and iGEM HQ to keep alumni connected to iGEM and synthetic biology.
Here is what ASU iGEM has done specifically to make these ideas into reality:
Helped Initiate the outreach/human practices collaboration at SB5.0
Along with Cornell and Brown-Stanford, created a collaboration invitation letter--inviting teams to contribute to CommunityBricks and the AlumniGEM forums--and distributed it to all 176 iGEM teams
Created an uploaded a Synthetic biology curriculum, Exploring Synthetic Biology , tailored towards high school students along with an introductory presentation for iGEM teams to use.
Added multimedia links and other resources to the CommunityBricks website.

As the function of kidney is gradually damaged, it can no longer eliminate the deleterious substances from our body. With urea and creatinine surging, a person could eventually end up in renal failure. From above, we can get a conclusion that diabetes is surely a thorny chronic disease that we should be cautious of.
Taiwan has the reputation of “the kingdom of Hem dialysis”. Yes, this is apparently not a thing we should be proud of. A huge sum of money is spent on this problem every year. But, you probably don’t know that a huge ratio of these cases are caused by neither drug abuse nor consuming too much salty food. Instead, diabetes is what may leads to kidney diseases. So, we invited Dr. Wu from the division of nephrology to tell us about the negative effects of diabetes. 
 In the interview, he mentioned that due to hyperglycemia, HHNK and DKA, which may cause headache, nausea, or even drive people into coma, is often found in people with diabetes. Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause the filtration in the glomerular to accelerate, which leads to its hypertrophy. As the function of kidney is gradually damaged, it can no longer eliminate the deleterious substances from our body.

After we had a discussion with Dr. Wu, we changed our aim from controlling diabetes to losing weight. Since weight losing is nothing more than controlling the diet and exercising for most people, we soon contacted with a fitness coach and paid a visit to his workshop, so as to learn the relation between them and our project.
While we are conversing with the coach, we had a heart full of doubt: Where’s the dumbbells or treadmills we usually see in a gym? After we consult the coach, he told us that the main point of “fitness” is not focusing on building bulky muscles but living a healthier life. We were confused by the time we heard this statement, thinking that"

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#iGEM Bilingualism_-_-_TEXT.html,"发明者，已经确定这种雪糕对消费者来说百分之百安全。
The glowing frozen dessert made us wonder about other instances of luminescence out there. Green fluorescent proteins used in studies aren't just the stuff of mad scientist dreams: it earned the inventor glowing praise and a Nobel Prize in 2008.  这种冷光蛋白也不仅仅只是用于制作酷炫雪糕。绿色荧光蛋白应用于科研邻域早就不是痴人说梦，荧光蛋白的发现者和改造者赢得了2008年的诺贝尔奖。
Now fluorescent proteins have been already widely used in many scientific research fields, especially in biology. In iGEM, fluorescent proteins are usually used as reporters. What are reporters? The answer is that in synthetic biology, they are often used as a mechanism to display information. For example, fluorescent proteins cause a cell to fluoresce when excited with light of a particular wavelength. What’s more, the iGEM team of Tokyo Tech once used fluorescent proteins to create a pen whose ink is the different genetically engineered bacteria. The bacteria can express different fluorescent proteins so that people can use it to draw many colorful paintings.
如今，荧光蛋白已经广泛用于科学研究的各个领域，尤其是生物学领域。在iGEM中，荧光蛋白常常用作报告指示器（reporter）。什么是reporter？在合成生物学中，reporter就是可以直观显示信息的一种机制。例如，在特定波长的光的激发下，荧光蛋白就会使其所在细胞发出荧光，从而能起到定位指示的作用。除此之外，东京工业大学的iGEM队伍曾经利用不同的荧光蛋白，将其基因导入工程细菌中，从而设计并制造出了一支细"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

To increase our chances we decided to improve upon this part which was created in 2014 by the ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team. The first thing we did to improve this part was to remove two illegal sites to make it compatible with all iGEM RFC standards. Secondly, we found out that Aprotinin contains three disulphide bonds, which make correct folding in the cytoplasm difficult. To overcome this problem we decided to add a periplasmic localization peptide to K1456006, which allows for cotranslational translocation into the periplasm, where disulphide bonds are more easily formed.

By introduction of crtZ gene to the crtEBIY plasmid (we call this construct “single plasmid construct”, ""crtZ-crtEBIY"".), new spot appered on TLC plate (Fig.2-1-6 spot III). The spot shows lower Rf value than that derived from crtEBIY (Fig.2-1-6 spot II).  The Rf values of spots derived from crtEBIY and crtZ-crtEBIY corresponded to reported values of β-caroten and Zeaxanthin, respectively. [2] Thus we could characterize zeaxanthin production activity of crtZ. In addition, caracterization of the part crtZ is the first work in iGEM.
In order to maximize zeaxanthin production, we designed some combinations of construct. We thought of another type of zeaxanthin synthetic construct where “crtZ” (BBa_I742158) and “crtEBIY” (BBa_K274210) were separated on different plasmids. (we call this type of constructs “double plasmids construct.”)
After all, We made five combinations shown in table<1>, including BBa_K395701 , BBa_K395702 and BBa_K395704 .
Constructs containing pBad/araC promoter on high-copy vector show the best production and double plasmids construct shows as much production as single plasmid construct under same promoter combination. Construct with pBad/araC promoter shows better production than that with plac promoter. Construct that crtEBIY on high-copy vector and crtZ on low-copy vector shows as much expression as construct that crtEBIY on low-copy vector and crtZ on high-copy vector.（Actually, 3 showed a little more production than 5.）
For TLC, We selected the best three samples including the sample derived from single plasmid construct .
In the consequence of TLC, we could confirm that these three samples were zeaxanthin.

Another possible reason as to the apprehension on receiving phage therapy could be again due to not fully understanding what phage therapy entails since the workshops were only run from an hour to 100 minutes. In the future, perhaps this is something which could be developed further and incorporate into the teaching national curriculum. For this reason (and the responses we received from the discussion groups), we created a phage therapy leaflet that will be given to those receiving the treatment.
We asked the students to rank the top 3 situations in which genetically modified organisms can be used, if at all. Across all 3 schools, the most popular choice was to make medicinal products followed by reducing environmental contaminants or purifying water from contaminants. This is a possible reflection of school curriculum (because the answers between all 3 schools were similar) or personal interest. When speaking to the students, some were interesting in going into a  healthcare related degree at university or human-based biology. However, this doesn’t detract from the fact that the students were environmentally conscious.
Lastly, we asked the students what words they associated with synthetic biology and the words ‘engineering’, ‘DNA’, ‘biology’, ‘synthetic’ and ‘modification’ or ‘modifying’ were the most used. The purpose of the word clouds was to see what emotions they associated with synthetic biology, be it positive or negative emotions. From the most popular words used, the students did not seem to feel strongly either way about synthetic biology and rather opted for more neutral words. Some students used the words ‘innovative’, ‘technical’ or ‘cool’ but they also found it a bit ‘complicated’ or ‘confusing’.

Data analysis gives the following results:
Fig. 3 verifies our hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between plaque sizes and phage particle size. This further confirms our method of selection (using different concentrations of agar) in our creation of mutant T4 and T7 phage library.
Next Step
To further model phage plaque sizes we will
test whether or not our mutant phage confirm to the same plaque size - phage particle size relationship.
start modeling experiments in which one of the other experimental factors (temperature, bacterial concentration, agar concentration, incubation time) act as the independent variable.

During our summer doing iGEM we had several workshops designed to hone our presentation skills, catch everyone up on the details of Synthetic biology, and encourage us to think outside the box to consider the far-reaching implications of project, especially for pigments.
Preparing the Presentation
October 2009: The team gathers at the house of Jim Haseloff to give a preliminary run of our presentation. We then have a brainstorming session with James King on artistic uses of our pigment producing bacteria.
Colour Futures Workshop
August 2009: In the Colours Future workshop (organised by Daisy Ginsburg and James King from the Royal College of Art) we concentrated on our various pigments, considering how the ability to exploit pigments from the natural world--not just from bacteria, but from plants and animals--might affect the world we live in. What if pigments are used as reporters for applications beyond bacterial biosensors? What if we harnessed natural pigments and used them to artificially colour the world, even ourselves? What ramifications might these leaps and bounds have?

Part of 2 week course - Dragon's Den Challenge
Mid-July 2009 - At the end of the 2 week intro course, particpants tried their hand at designing a real world application for a synthetic biology project, then tried to market it to a panel of judges reluctant to give out money. The idea is based on a TV show by the BBC if you are not familiar with it.
Our 2 week crash course in Synthetic Biology
Beginning of July 2009 - The 7 iGEM team members and other students from the Royal College of Art, London School of Economics, and Cambridge gather at the Haseloff Lab, Cambridge for a 2 week introduction to Synthetic Biology and iGEM.

In a microcentrifuge tube, set up the seamless cloning and assembly reaction. It is CRUTIAL that you add the GeneArt 2x Enzyme Mix as the LAST COMPONENT.
Quickly thaw the GeneArt 2x Enzyme Mix on ice and pipette up and down to mix thoroughly. Add (x+y) ul of thawed enzyme. Mix to each reaction. Immediately return GeneArt 2x Enzyme Mix to -80°C Freezer.
Mix the reaction components completely by pipetting up and down SLOWLY 3 times and then gently tap the side of the tubed 3-5 times to mix.
If needed, briefly centrifge (< 500rpm for < 5sec) to collect reaction components to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube.
Incubate the reaction mix at room temperature for 15-30 min. Do not incubate longer than 30 min!
After incubation is complete, plate the reaction mix on ice for 2-5 min before proceeding to transformation step. Do not let the samples stay on ice for more than 5 min before transformation.
Transformation:
Use 3ul of the seamless cloning and assembly reaction to transform NEB5α cells. Do not use electrocompetent cells.

learnsynbio
Our main outreach initiative is a series of Synthetic Biology learning modules which we call LearnSynBio.org. After the success of our 2015 educational outreach, we wanted to switch gears and target our outreach efforts             to a demographic which has not received as much attention for educational outreach.
Most outreach seemed targeted either to young children, with the hopes of  introducing them to science in general,          or to the general population, with the hopes of sparking a discussion about the ethical concerns and societal          implications of synthetic biology. But we found comparatively little that reached out to high school students          who are on the cusp of deciding potential career paths in a way that introduced them to synthetic biology as an          actual scientific field. These students seemed like an ideal audience for our outreach efforts.
Since many of the core concepts within synthetic biology are fairly simple to understand with only limited background          knowledge, we set out to create educational materials targeted explicitly towards these high school students in order          to introduce them to the field of synthetic biology as a potential, and perhaps exciting, career option.
LearnSynBio consists of four modules of instructional videos and supplemental materials (worksheets) which are meant          to introduce high school students with basic biology and math background to the ideas in Synthetic Biology. LearnSynBio          is organized into four modules: an Introduction to Basic Biology Concepts, an Introduction to Experimental Techniques          used in Synthetic Biology, an Introduction to Genetic Circuit Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and a module on the          Ethics and Implications of Synthetic Biology.
In order to develop our materials effectively, we spoke with our former high school biology teachers to ask them what          features they would like to see present in LearnSynBio in order to best facilitate its incorporation into the classroom.          They emphasized the relatively short, discrete nature of the videos (preferring several videos in a module to one long          video), and really emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of LearnSynBio.
for a PDF of more examples of learnsynbio exercises, click here.
Because LearnSynBio is hosted on an independent domain, it is easily accessible anywhere by anyone and can easily          be maintained and updated with feedback from teachers who use it. This allows our outreach efforts to continue even          in places and times where we cannot be physically present!
Finally, we are taking measures to get"

“Standardized information storage is a good idea. But more data are needed.”
(We try hard to include more data in the database.)
“Crowdsourcing is a fashionable concept, and it might have an impact. Do you think of using crowdsourcing to do some data analysis in CORE?”
(Good idea!)
“CORE Design. The plas
mid is beautiful.”
Inspirations
As a student on biostatistics, Zhao tends to focus on how data are managed and organized. Biological data are growing in quantity and in quality. CORE provides tools that can help navigate data and information in Registry, say, looking for the sequence of a part, or find the relevant information on that part. CORE Bank and Co-development, collectively called the “Synbio Hub”, is a standardized repositories of genetic design. This Hub provides a new method to organize the genetic design of iGEM teams and synthetic biologists alike.

Model 4 Details: Basic Stochastic Analysis
Stochastic Analysis
Mathematica provides a built-in process for stochastic analysis. We try to model our percent function (from Model 3), which calculates the ratio of current GSR versus final equilibrium GSR. Our percent function is:                                               $$P(t)=1-1.027*e^{-0.1717t}$$                                             where t is in days.
Our stochastic model is based off the following differential equation, written in differential form:                                                  $$dC_R=dP + \sigma \frac{dP}{dt} dw(t)$$                                                  where $C_R$ is the concentration ratio of current to final at equilibrium (like $P$, ranges from 0 to 1), $P$ is the percent function, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of delivery, and $w(t)$ approximates the stochastic Wiener stochastic process.
The standard deviation is found from the square root of the variance divided by the equilibrium to get a number between 0 and 1, multiplied by a factor related to the frequency. The greater the frequency, the less GSR there is to every dose of eyedrop, so the standard deviation would decrease, and vice versa.
For full details, please see the research paper: Hanson, F.B. (2007).Applied Stochastic Processes and Control for Jump-Diffusions: Modeling, Analysis and Computation. Chicago, IL:The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
Insights into Manufacturing & Clinical Use
Using the details from Models 1-4, we offer the following suggestions for manufacturing our eyedrops, as well as prescribing them to patients.
Frequent doses of low concentration eyedrops are more stable than occasional doses of high concentration eyedrops. (Model 3)
Cataract severity is extremely sensitive to the amount of GSR concentration maintained. If this value falls below 43.5 uM even by a little, as shown in Model 2, cataracts may develop. (Model 2)
When manufacturing, there should be a necessary upward adjustment, because even with daily eyedrops, some simulated trials resulted in less than 90% of GSR delivered. (Model 4)
Cataract prevention is only fully effective after around 28 days of using the prevention eyedrop. (Model 3) During that time, further cataract damage may take place. The suggested order of treatment should be: start with GSR eyed"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," important in biotechnology industry as it takes a long time and to develop a novel product or technology and, also, the cost of that development is extremely high. Thus, a patent prevents competitors from using the patented materials or methods for commercial reasons.
To be patentable your invention should be novel (it cannot be previously published), useful (have a known function) and non-obvious (e.g. obviously combining previously known elements to come to your invention would not work).
The invention can be machines, processes (e. g. therapeutic or diagnostic methods) or compositions of matter (e. g. artificial proteins or nucleic acids, transgenic organisms). However, you cannot patent a product of nature (naturally occurring genes, proteins or other materials), scientific processes or theorems.
2. The first thing you should consider is whether you really need a patent. That is because patents can be very expensive to write, submit, maintain and enforce it - up to hundreds thousand of dollars. Another aspect is that some technologies are not worth to be patented because as they can be “outgrown” quickly, become obsolete or could be used confidentially as a trade secret (for example, software).
However, a patent is a strong selling point for many investors, as they can later be used for licensing and collecting royalties by allowing other companies to use your invention.
We would strongly advise the future iGEM teams to contact their university IP Management Office. Most universities have established procedures and assistants to help you with filing a patent application and explore other opportunities for your invention commercialization.
Our university’s IP Office, together with our sponsors Thermo Fisher Scientific helped us a lot by defining the patent structure and clarifying specifications and claims of our invention.
3. If you have decided that you really do need a patent, you should then invest a lot of time in searching patents, scientific articles or conference abstracts that may have already described the thing you are trying to patent.
The patent process is expensive and you don’t want spend a lot of time and money for filing an application when there is a previous invention that could prevent your patent or make it extremely narrow.
Also, there always is a possibility that there was already a patent submitted that covers your patent, but did not receive commercial success. If this patent is expired, you can freely use the technology, but, on the other hand, there will be no ways to prevent others to do so as well.
By the way, it is worth to invest the time into the patent searches for a completely different reason as well - they can be a valuable source of knowledge on how to structure the claims and"

PCD:
We examined OD of normal E.coli and E.coli with exogenous HSP, DnaK. The result showed that HSP expressed in relatively cool condition did have apparent negative affection on the growth of E.coli. But as the time passed, the OD were relatively close. We thought that HSP worked and helped to folded incorrect proteins, then the growth of cell were contributed.
Oscillating circuit:
We joined R0011-B0034-C0040-B0015-R0040-P0451 and R0051-B0034-C0012-B0015 together. Then all the parts of oscillating circuit device have been fitted together.

Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#log_-_-_TEXT.html," as we all entered into the exam period and our attentions turned away. We emerged from the exams intact, ready to devote our time to iGEM. We did the research, read the papers, and prepared for the next meeting that would herald the official start of our project.
Week 1 (26th May – 1st June)
Wednesday 28th
The team assembled in the Waddington building, ready to pit our five ideas against each other. Some had not survived the research process (the glowsticks), some did not seem to constitute a full project (the switch), and the others were not without their problems either. No clear consensus emerged, and team stuck around until late at night, trying to make them work.
Thursday 29th
Both L-glucose and dye manufacture were more or less ruled out on this day, which left us with no actual project to speak of. This was widely considered an undesirable state of affairs, and great efforts were gone to in the search for something new. Another late night, another intensive search through the track lists – still no success.
Friday 30th
Two fresh ideas came out of this day’s efforts. One – synthetic honey – went pretty much nowhere since bacteria would just be killed by honey, but the other seemed to have more life to it. This was metabolic wiring, and arose from a recent paper on the subject. This occupied most of the day.
Saturday 31st
Work continued into metabolic wiring, and a second project idea arose – could simple biological logic gates enable bacteria to play a game of Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma against each other? The two ideas were developed in parallel, and it seemed we were getting somewhere at last.
Sunday 1st
The two project ideas continued their development, with diagrams and schematics being produced. Population control was looked at as a possible use for the metabolic wiring.
Week 2 (2nd June – 8th June)
Monday 2nd
We presented the two ideas to one of the supervisors, Jon Marles-Wright, and it was agreed to combine the two into one project – develop metabolic wiring and BioBrick it, and use IPD as a showcase for how it can be used. More detailed research also began.
Tuesday 3rd – Friday 6th
Much more intensive research could now be done, now that the idea was ‘official.’ Actual genes and pathways were found which could be implemented, and circuit diagrams for different IPD strategies were devised.

March, 5 - 11, 2012
The whole team met for the first time after the vacations of February. We discussed our scheduling and divided ourselves in two groups: Cyanolux and Bactomythril. The leaders of each group were elected: Carla (Cyanolux) and Claudia (Bactomithril).
Cyanolux: Wetlab: Simon, Seba / Drylab: Carla, Tamara, Isaac  Bactomithril: Wetlab: Ulises, Bryon / Drylab: Claudia, Emilia, Max
Carla and Max were chosen to maintain the wiki updated.
Bernardo and Rolando are going to collaborate with both groups.
Also, we scheduled meetings of the whole team every Friday or Tuesday (depending on the availability of the majority of the team), and meetings with the whole team and our advisor, Professor Rodrigo Gutierrez, every other Thursday. Likewise, each group should have their own meetings.
Finally, we decided to work based on delivery dates. Each member should compromise to complete a task in specific time intervals.
March, 12 - 18, 2012
We registered our team in iGEM. Now we are officially part of iGEM 2012! Also we began to learn how to use our wiki. Our Bactomithril project is still in its initial stage, so we began to read as many papers about recombinant spider silk and protein modeling as we could.
Some of the most relevant papers we found are
- Xia et al. 2010 - “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”
- Widmaier et al. - 2009 - “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”
We learnt about interesting protein modeling and simulation software (e.g. Rosetta, Foldit), and some protein visualization software  (PyMOL, VMD, Chimera)
Additionally, we began to send emails requesting genetic sequences from spider silk to scientists from other countries. According to what we know, in Chile nobody works with natural or recombinant spider silk proteins or its genetic sequences. So that this is a real challenge to us.

We found out that the DNA 2.0 chromoproteins we received did not express color when grown up from the stock and only grew when IPTG was added. This means that our chromoproteins did not initially express color and was the wrong sequence so that is why our Gibsoned product did not express color when getting grown up in liquid culture. We have another set of DNA 2.0 chromoproteins in lab the have been shown to grow up in liquid culture and express color so we will be using those for the next phase since they are correct.

Looked at sequencing data from yesterday for the AE blue iGEM chromoprotein, CBD, and GFP.

For the AE blue chromoprotein it looks like the sequence is what we expected which means for the future we need to redesign primers and see if we can get the PCR and gel extraction to produce product

The CBD is the expected sequence and we are going to determine which CBD to use after we get sequencing back from CBD2 we sent in today

1.  Chen did the overlap PCR and construct FB-2X-PP7 (approximately 630 bp). It seems correct in the agarose gel electrophoresis. (1000 marker on the left and 5000 marker on the right)
2.  Yan and Chen PCR MS2 from plasmids Dr. Delebecque sent us respectively. Yan uses 57.5 Degrees Celsius as melting temperature and Chen uses 58.5 and 63.5. But the electrophoretic bands seem incorrect. (Next day we find angrily that the primer the company synthesized is wrong!)
2012/8/28 Tuesday, August 28, 2012
1.  LIU uses gel extraction to get last day Chen's MS2 and carry on overlap PCR to make FA-2X-MS2.
2.  Chen transforms FB-2X-PP7 (T vector) into Top 10.
3.  Repeated tests: Yan does the same as LIU and sets annealing temperature 59Degrees Celsius and 61Degrees Celsius.

Social Enterprise
As described in our company vision, we wish Darwin Toolbox to increase access to this technology and awareness of synthetic biology. Therefore, requiring all parties to sign non-disclosure agreements and heavily protecting our intellectual property is somewhat contradictory to this goal. Therefore, the Darwin Toolbox will be launched as an open-source, social enterprise. In addition to enabling the free-trade of information associated with this technology, it will markedly simplify all of the legal issues associated with setting up this company and substantially reduce costs. Establishing world-wide patents for equipment as complex as Darwin Toolbox would cost in excess of $40,000 – if the technology is made open-source, these funds could instead be diverted into product development.
Trademarks
In order to successfully grow the company, the name “Darwin Toolbox” would need to be trademarked in order to stop others imitating it or otherwise damaging the brand. There are currently a wide range of companies that are already registered using the “Darwin” name. However, none of these use “Darwin Toolbox”, and so no claims to this name can be made. In order to register a trademark, the product class, or classes, must first be established. Initially, Darwin Toolbox may be best described by class 9:
“Scientific, nautical, surveying, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling, checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments; apparatus and instruments for conducting, switching, transforming, accumulating, regulating or controlling electricity; apparatus for recording, transmission or reproduction of sound or images; magnetic data carriers, recording discs; compact discs, DVDs and other digital recording media; mechanisms for coin-operated apparatus; cash registers, calculating machines, data processing equipment, computers; computer software; fire-extinguishing apparatus.” Nice Classification, 10th edition, version 2014 (NCL(10-2014))
However, other classes must also be considered as the product develops, especially if reagents are also to be supplied with Darwin Toolbox branding. Classes that may be spanned include classes 1 (enzyme preparations for industrial usage), 5 (enzyme preparations for"

Environmental safety: We have evaluated the project feasibility and its relating security issue. Our kit is consist of proteins and buffer without E.coli . It will reduce the danger that E.coli would do harm to our environment.
Policy & Practice: We organized a series activities to enrich our Human Practice.
Organize the Mini-iGEM competition in Beijing Normal University: We took a month to complete this competition. As its name, the competition is for small iGEM projects designed by ten groups. They worked as iGEM’s pattern and designed a project or solve a problem using principles of synthetic biology. Then we invited some professors to score these projects and give their advice.
Interview Dr. Yingyi Wang in Pecking Union Medical College Hospital: We interviewed Dr. Yingyi Wang and communicated with him about the current usage of taxol in clinic and the recent treament methods towards cancer.
Investigation of Taxus yunnanensis: We spent several days this summer in Yunnan investigating the yew trees there. We went to some places including Yunnan Hande Biotechnology corporation which is the first producing souce of taxol in China, Yunnan Acadamy of Forestry (YAF) and Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of Science. Besides, we carried on some population survey in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming Botanical Garden.
Orienteering: We designed and organized an orienteering activity ""running of biology"" in the campus. The rules of the orienteering were designed to bring our ideas to more people.
Conference: We took part in CCiC conference as well as gave a presentation in this conference. We also improved our project during our communication in the conference.
Communication: We communicated and exchanged our ideas with Peking and FAFU-China . Through the collaboration with other teams, we all got improvement.
Gold
We have demonstrated a functional prototype of our project. We made a kit based on the experiment and the data from modeling and wet lab to detect the existence of taxol and other medicines that can inhibit the depolymerization of microtube. And we simulated the way of using our device in the laboratory.
We have characterized a previously existing BioBrick Part, which can produce plastic ( BBa_K934001 ). We add two different promoters to make the plastic production under the control of L- Arabinose and temperature. See the improvement page for more information.

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," conditions is too extreme for living cells, which may not be                         representative of physiological settings.
This critical voice also reminds us that modest cell survival is necessary, considering that                         increase the ROS content by regulator components will increase stress of cells. Therefore, to                         improve the stability and reliability of product, and make it more durable. We designed the                         tolerance module.
Tolerance Module
Yca1 encodes synthesis of metacaspase, a homologue of the mammalian caspase, and plays a                         crucial role in the regulation of yeast apoptosis. According to the literature, knock out yca1 can improve the yeast tolerance to ROS, so we just do it. As a result, engineered strain can                         work at high ROS level.
Cell-Based Electrochemical Method (2017)
Today is the age of interdisciplinary integration. Cell-based detection combined with                         traditional electrochemistry, which is a landmark in the history of antioxidants detection. The                         cell-based electrochemical method uses NaAlg/GO hydrogels and 3D culture system to place cells in electrochemical workstation and adds nanoscale electrode materials for sensing intracellular                         ROS. It has good reproducibility and stability and is simple and rapid. However, it is still                         unable to achieve high-throughput screening for antioxidants and is difficult to popularize                         because of limitation of materials and instrument.
Synthetic                     Biological                     Strategy (2018)
21th century will become the new epoch of synthetic biology. As time goes on, synthetic biology                         is emerging in more and more fields and gives unique strategies to address kinds of problem.                         The plug-and-play characteristic of synthetic biological parts are conducive to the                         popularization of product.
In addition to the product design shown above, we have some special designs.
Design-Everything                         for Detecting
Feedback                     Module
Feedback Module works based on dCas9 technology and endogenous antioxidant system of yeast. We                         transformed and made use of that system sensing intracellular ROS level and starting our                         embedded genetic circuit properly to control the ROS level by dCas9. What's the role of                         Feedback Module?
● First, intracellular ROS level increased by regulator components may fluctuate, which                             causes the detection signal unstable. Therefore, we designed the Feedback Module which can                             regulate the ROS level in a stable range. Second, our sensor roGFP2-Orp1 has detecting                             threshold for ROS. The output signal is linear within the threshold and nonlinear beyond                             the threshold. Feedback Module can control ROS level within the detection threshold.
● Last, excessive accumulation of ROS will affect the survival of engineered strain.                             Feedback"

E.coli Transformation
Electroporation method was used in order to                             transform a DNA construction. This procedure is                             commonly used for E. coli and Agrobacterium.
The electroporation cuvette was put in                                     ice 10 minutes before inserting the cells.                                     An aliquot of electrocompetent cells are                                     taken out of the -80°C freezer, and they                                     are put immediately into ice.
1-2 ul of the ligation product are                                     taken and added carefully to them.
60 ul of the mix are taken and put into an electroporation cuvette making sure that                                     there are no bubbles.
The cuvette is dried and put in the                                     electroporator, making sure that any spark                                     is done. In that case, the process does not                                     work and must be repeated. This could                                     happen when plasmid and E. coli concentration are not optimal.
The voltage for the electroporator is                                     1500V for E. coli and 1440V for Agrobacterium.
Transformed cells are resuspended in                                     300 μL of LB in the electroporation                                     cuvette. Then, they are taken and put into                                     an Eppendorf letting them grow in the                                     shaker for 2 hours at 37°C.

In order to carry out all of necessary Miniprep                         -extraction of the plasmids out of E. coli -the                         protocol of the Omega kit (Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I Spin                         Protocol) is used. The steps to do it are:

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," states can be realized. Such system is clearly beyond a counter because it can have an input corresponding to any arbitrary transition between states. This system can be applied to algorithmic system, for example, biocomputer etc. Furthermore, a more general circuit that responds to more various inputs is possible to be considered by integrating additional circuits.
For example, the change of balance between 2 substances itself can be considered as a input. Considering substances A and B, following additional circuit is possible:
pA-repressorB-GFP-activatorX-pX-repressorA
pB-repressorA-RFP-activatorY-pY-repressorB
<img src =""
"" class = ""figure"" />
<legend>Fig. 15 The Construction of Converter</legend>
Here, substances A/B activate promoter A/B. This additional circuit notably contains a toggle switch structure with delay negative feedback loops. For example, when substance A becomes dominant against substance B, the toggle switch amplifies the dominance of promoter A and the following negative feedback suppresses the dominance. Consequently, this additional circuit is expected to convert the change of the dominance to a pulse-like expression of a reporter protein. Therefore, this additional circuit can expand the range of input.
Our concept is easily applied, for instance, to drug delivery system or health care by using a counter circuit for a transition loop. Regarding certain circadian rhythms or hormones in a human as inputs and some drugs as outputs, this theme producing drugs at particular time can be good for drug delivery system or health care to tune the medicine administration with the proper timing.

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," an auxotroph and cannot transmit plasmids to other strains (it is a F- strain).
We have constructed resistance marker cassettes expressing ampicillin, hygromycin, or neomycin resistance. The antibiotics mentioned are used in public health settings to treat infections and therefore the spread of antibiotic resistance is very problematic and can have great implications on the public health. If these marker cassettes were accidentally released and a given microorganism was naturally transformed with the DNA there could be a small chance that the organism would have acquired resistance to the respective antibiotic. However, this is unlikely to happen. Should our E. coli DH5α containing a plasmid with antibiotic resistance be released into the environment, it would be unlikely for the strain to transfer the plasmid, as the strain as earlier mentioned is F-. Therefore the spread of antibiotic resistance genes poses a low safety risk. The Aspergillus nidulans strain used in this project is also an auxotroph and to survive outside the lab, it requires high concentrations of arginine, uracil, and uridine. The mammalian cells transfected with plasmids containing antibiotic resistance would not be able to survive outside the lab, because the U-2 OS cell line like many other mammalian cell lines requires very specific growth conditions.
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
We have evaluated that there would be no risks to environmental quality if our biobricks or devices were released by design or accident, because the coding sequences mainly encode fluorescent proteins. As mentioned before the strains we were working with are not able to grow outside the lab and therefore do not pose any risks to environmental quality. It is important to dispose biological waste correctly to prevent accidental release of the biological material from the laboratory. If all safety precautions are followed according to all local and federal regulations our project will not raise any safety issues. The guidelines for disposal of biological waste as defined by the Center for Microbial Biotechnology (CMB) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) was followed to prevent possible release of genetically modified organisms (GMO).
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
No, the parts we have constructed are in themselves or combined not a threat to security. The aim of our project is to develop an assembly standard that is easy and fast to use, but the assembly system can of course be misused, and thereby pose a security risk. However, this is the case for all technologies within biotechnology, and would require the knowledge and expertise of designing experiments and conducting them.

Card Game
Our aim of this subproject was to create a way to bring the idea and fundamental approaches of synthetic biology closer to people who are yet un- or misinformed. We believe that synthetic biology will affect the lives of every future generation so we feel obliged to elucidate and reach out to the broad mass of society. To achieve this, we elaborated a simple and fun way to put across a challenging  scientific subject, introducing the Plasmid Factory.
Plasmid Factory is a card game which can be played with up to 4 people. The winner is the person who is first able to create a fully working plasmid with the cards on his hands. Additionally to collecting the right parts, the player needs to fulfill the tasks on his phasecard. We chose regular sized playing cards for our game since we all love playing cards and it is easy to relate to. While playing, attendants learn about the importance of each part and that only a plasmid with all relevant parts can function and express its genes. A detailed instruction of the rules can be found here: plasmid factory rules .
The design of the parts was inspired by the work of Dueber et al. (2015)
Since our approach was to reach out to a large number of people from all over the world, we did not only print out a high circulation but also created a free PDF version, which can be downloaded here: Download guide // Download cards 1 to 40 // Download cards 41 to 80

Project Description
BIO-E: Bacterial Improvement of Ethanol
Our Motivation
Energy sources are divided into two: non-renewable and renewable. Non-renewable energy sources cannot replenish in a short time, thus are unsustainable (U.S. Energy Information Administration [eia], 2017a).
Fossil fuels; like petroleum and coal are examples to non-renewable energy resources. Governments around the world spare an iffy budget to acquire them even though they are not sustainable (Melikoğlu & Albostan, 2011; Patton, 2016; Summerton, 2016). Apart from their drastic effects on the economy and global schemes around the budget, all non-renewable energy sources, impose catastrophic effects on the environment from high greenhouse gas emissions to impairment of natural habitats (Hamilton, 1998).
Figure 1: Our representation of the economic setbacks and environmental disasters; such as oil spills and the increase in air pollutants fossil fuels’ use leads to.
Therefore, we have decided on solving this issue with the improvement in renewable energy sources and thereby decreasing fossil fuel consumption. In this path, we chose the most promising energy source, biofuels.
What are Biofuels?
Biofuels are fuels obtained from biomass, organic materials that come from plant wastes (EIA, 2017b, EIA, 2017c). One of the most important applications of biofuels is transportation since solar, wind and other alternative powers are not sufficient and cost-effective enough to produce the required amount of energy that can be used in this manner (Biofuels, n.d.).

We developed the OptoFlux model , to determine the optimal dimensions and structure of the bulb to maximise bioluminescence (160 watts). The circular structure of the LIT bulb maximizes the exposure of Cyanobacteria to sunlight. A pump was introduced to ensure the cells remain suspended and the cell culture is homogeneously distributed throughout the LIT bulb. A three-way manual valve was introduced to allow for the easy replacement of media once every 12 months. A filter will be added to the valve to allow media to be replaced without removing the cell culture.
Figure 1. Optimized design of the LIT Bulb for maximum bioluminescence. Design consists of a torus shape made out of plexiglass (4cm diameter by 95cm length). It contains a 3 way valve,  a small pump (1.8watts) and a filter (0.015cm pore size) within the valve for biocontainment when replacing the media once a year.
Biosafety and microbial containment considerations are of particular importance in the manufacturing design process of the LIT Bulb, as our product intends to coexist with the wider population as a source of public illumination.
The bulb has been designed to ensure biocontainment and prevent the interaction with our engineered microorganisms or their release into the environment.The energy strain for the production of bioluminescence by our engineered E. coli cells is so large that they would be outcompeted quickly by other microorganisms if they were to be released in the environment.

Calcium Phosphate Transfection
Title: Transfection to microglia and astrocytes via “calcium phosphate” method.
Conducted by: Sagi Angel
Date: 3-7.6.18
Aim: In this experiment we have tried to use the calcium phosphate protocol in     order to transfect microglia astrocytes and HEK as control in GFP gene. The     use of HEK cells as control, is due to its ability to be transfected     relatively easily by the various techniques, including calcium phosphate     method.
Importance: This experiment was carried out in parallel with experiments using     different methods of transfection (different reagents and electroporation)     in order to find an efficient way of inserting our plasmids into astrocytes     and microglia for the continuation of the project.

Theoretical background:
Transfection of DNA into cells via calcium phosphate is a simple,     efficient and inexpensive method is to transfect eukaryotic cells via     calcium phosphate co-precipitation with DNA (Graham and van der Eb, 1973).     The insoluble calcium phosphate precipitate with the attached DNA adheres     to the cell surface and is brought into the cells by endocytosis. Calcium     phosphate transfection has been optimized and widely used with many     adherent and non-adherent cell lines (Jordan et al., 199"

Postcards
As we all know iGEM is not only about experiments and lab work but also about bringing the topic “synthetic biology” closer to the public. In order to do so the previous iGEM teams of the Heinrich Heine University of Düsseldorf created a postcard exchange project to promote synthetic biology in public using self-designed postcards. Each year a bunch of iGEM teams decided to join which is why the campaign was a huge success with a lot of beautiful and funny postcards as a result.
Of course we wanted to continue this tradition.
How does this postcard exchange work? Every participating team has to design a postcard which shows an image related to synthetic biology or their topic on the front and a small informational text on the back.
Postcard criteria:
Image related to your project or (synthetic) biology in general on the front
Small informational text on the back
Standard postcard format (A6; 14.8 cm x 10.5 cm)
We reached a lot of iGEM teams by showing off postcards from the previous years on Instagram and other social media accounts and were also the first ones to post on the Collaboration page of iGEM 2018.  A lot of iGEM teams responded who wanted to channel their inner creativity and design their own postcard about their project or synthetic biology in general. We had 37 participating teams in total.  In addition to that we also collaborated with iGEM TU Delft who introduced our postcard project on their Eurasian meetup in Shenzhen, China. A lot of iG"
BJRS_China,2018,Team:BJRS China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," explanation could be that the long bacteria is more mature than the small one. In the small bacteria, the fluorescent protein was just generated but not transported to the surface yet while there is already enough time for the long bacteria to do the surface display part. The same phenome was also showed by INP surface display system(fig.1B).
Figure 4 The dotted distribution pattern of surface displayed mEos around the bacteria were more obvious in long and big bacteria.
Arrows: long bacteria for example; asterisk: small bacteria for example.
Another interesting phenome was that some mEos loaded by autotransporter showed the departing tendency from the outer membrane of bacteria(fig.5). Allowing for the secretion function of autotransporter, we thought that the departing-like fluorescent protein may be excreted by the autotransporter, suggesting that the system may be not very stable. However, back to our project, as long as the VHb gathered around the bacteria, it could collect oxygen to increase the local oxygen concentration then to benefit the growth of bacteria. Thus, the autotransporter could be applied to our project.
Figure 5 Some autotransporter carried mEos showed the departing tendency from the outer membrane of bacteria(as the arrows indicated).
Test for OxygenMAX system
We constructed intracellular expressing VHb vectors under the control of two promoters with different strength(J23104 and J23110), and the surface displaying VHb via INP vector under the control of J23104 promoter(fig.6). We transforms the three constructs to E.coli(DH5α) and measured their growth curve.
Figure 6 Construction of INP-VHb and intracellular expressing VHb vectors.
Firstly we compared the growth curve of intracellular expressing VHb bacteria and empty vector transformed bacteria to see if the VHb works(fig.7). From the result we can see that both the two VHb expressed bacteria grew better than the wildtype bacteria, mainly presented on the maximal bio-mass at platform, suggesting that the VHb successfully worked on improving the growth of bacteria.
Figure 7 Growth curve of intracellular expressing VHb bacteria under different promoter.
Comparing the growth curve of the two VHb expressed bacteria we can see that the J23104 drived expressing of VHb can improve the growth of bacteria in a higher level.Allowing for that the expressing strength of J23104 is about twice stronger than J23110(characterized by iGEM2006_Berkeley), this result suggested that the more VHb expressed, the greater bacteria biomass would be gain at the platform,"

Bacterial Transformation
We utilized the common ""TSS"" transformation protocol:
Briefly, 1X TSS solution was prepared by mixing 0.5g of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 with 250uL of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), 150uL of 1M MgCl2, and 4.5mL of sterile LB. This mixture was dissolved, and then filter sterilized (stored at 4C for future use).
Approximately mid-log bacteria were pelleted by centrifuging 15 mins at 3500 rpm in the cold (4C). The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended with TSS at 1/10 their original volume.
Then 2-4ul of DNA was added to 100uL of cells, the cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes, heat shocked for 30 seconds at 42C, and placed back on ice for 2 minutes. 600uL of sterile LB was added and the cells recovered for 60 mins at 37C. 100ul of the mixture was spread onto LB plates with the appropriate selective antibiotics.
For some of our constructs, we expected the cells to be light sensitive - if exposed to too much light, they may express a toxin which would prevent growth of the transformed cells. Thus, when performing these transformations, we carried out the experiments in the dark!

Other publications by Sylvain Martel
Vesicles
Tom gave a presentation developing the idea of communication and self-assembly using vesicles .
18th June 2009
The shortlist was down to 7 projects and 3 of those made it to the next round as voted by the present audience. These are as follows (project title, (votes received)):
Magnetic Bacteria (10)
Bacterial Vesicles (6)
Non-Invasive Reporting/Switches & Sensors (6)
Genome Updates & version control (5)
Host/Parasite Symbiosis (3)
Bacterial Computation
RNA Editing
Thus the top three were chosen to review the literature further and assess the possibility of carrying each out in 3 months.
11th June 2009
Kick off meeting. Narrowed down ideas from ~15 to 7. See Team:BCCS-Bristol/Brainstorming .
2nd June 2009
Presentation of initial ideas at MCB2009.
