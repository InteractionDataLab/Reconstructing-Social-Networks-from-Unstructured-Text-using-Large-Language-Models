Figure 14 shows that glmM insert DNA and glmS insert DNA are no longer in possession of their illegal restriction sites after QC-PCR.
As has2 and UDP-glcDH were already cloned into the PSMF2.1 plasmid and both genes contained illegal EcoRⅠ restriction sites the QC PCRs to substitute these illegal restriction sites were performed in the pSMF2.1 plasmid. Afterwards the changed has2 and UDP-glcDH gene sequences were amplified by PCR and legal restriction sites for cloning into pSB1C3 were added to the termini of both genes. Next step was the ligation of the restricted pSB1C3 plasmid (2070 bp) with amplified and digested genes. Controls of ligation reactions are not shown. After transformation of the ligation products into competent E. coli cells and selection on ampicillin agar plates, the plasmid DNA of resulting transformants was checked by control digestion. Figure 15 shows the result for one representative E. coli transformant of each ligation.
Figure 15: Control digestion of plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli transformed with pSB1C3-has2 and pSB1C3-UDP-glcDH after Quick Change PCR. Digestion was carried out with EcoRⅠ and PstⅠ. Only two fragments are visible for each digestion representing the has2 insert DNA at 1693 bp / UDP-glcDH at 1382 bp and the restricted pSB1C3 plasmid at 2070 bp. No illegal restriction sites within the has2 respectively the UDP-glcDH gene anymore.

Investigator: Jeff
Aim of the experiment: pGADT7 and pGBKT7 are plasmids containing the transcriptional activation domain or the DNA binding domain of the transcription activator Gal4. pGADT7 contains the transcriptional activation domain of gal4; we want to clone the the first 100 residues of Pif3 (BBa_K365000) into this plasmid. As a result we have a fusion contruct of Gal4 and Pif3, which is nescassary for the light-switchable promoter system. pGBKT7 is for backup, if the ordered biobricks are not working.
Operational sequence:
E. coli XL1-Blue are transformed with pGADT7 and pGBKT7 seperately after standard protocol of our lab.

TMMU-China,2017,Team:TMMU-China#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," biology, we designed some letter cards. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attentions by showing its fun, following the idea of combining science and art.In the 2016 sports meeting in our university, our team organized a vivid propogation for synthetic biology to students, teachers and many doctors in our subordinary hospitals. We sent letter cards to them and encouraged them to synthesize their own works of art. Delightful, many people were willing to join us to make up a sentence with letter cards. To our suprise, there were two little girls showing great interest in it. With their imagination, they gave us much courage and inspiration.
We are inspired by the term 'Bio-brick'. Assuming that every letter card is a 'Bio-brick', we synthesize the letter cards into a sentence like constructing a plasmid from several 'Bio-bricks'. With limited letters, we can create unlimited sentences just like with limited 'Bio-bricks', we can create unlimited plasmids and realize unlimited kinds of functions. Constructing itself is funny and thought-provoking. And in the process of constructing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, these letter cards will be the carrier of the idea of synthetic biology and our wish to realize all the possibilities with 'Bio-bricks'.
Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
Nowadays many Chinese don't know what is transgenic technology, and some rumors from the Internet convince them that transgenosis is extremely harmful to human. As many Chinese don't have an objective understanding about transgenic technology, we think it's our duty to publicize correct concepts about it. It's also a good chance to popularize the definition of synthetic biology and gather resource from West China. Coming up with this idea when communicating with SCU_WestChina that hold a scientific exhibition, iGEM team SCU_WestChina contacted other teams involving SCU-China and UESTC_China to make an exhibition together about transgenic technology. We aimed to make the visitors understand what is transgenic technology and get some advice about our project from the visitors.
Eventually, SCU_WestChina got in touch with Chengdu Library successfully. Chengdu Library is a leading city center library in west China, receiving 1,010 million readers in 2016. After several conferences with other three teams, we chose ""genetic modification and health"" as the theme of the exhibition. And then we discussed the content of this exhibition and designed the posters together. The exhibition was composed of four parts: disease treatment, biopharmaceuticals, disease detection, and"

As you can see on the graph, the culture media with buffer in them has low pH variation. We have processed the membrane collected after 10 days of fermentation and the table below is the data we have collected.
As the statistics show, when pH=5.75～5.25 ,the yield of BC the most optimal.Meanwhile, when pH=5.25 and 4.75, the yield of BC are higher than the control group by 11% and 7%.
Therefore, we hope we can maintain the pH at 5 in the environment during G.xylinus fermentation.
Transformation  of E.coli
Due to the production of acidic substances like glucuronic acid during G.xylinus fermentation, the accumulation of acidic compounds lead to the decrease in pH. In order to maintain the optimal pH for producing bacterial cellulose, a mechanism to produce alkali substances is required. We choose model strain E.coli considering its benefits such as having a clear genetic background, easy technical operation and short culture time. Therefore,we plan to modify E.coli to have the ability to respond to the variation of pH and enable it to produce alkali substances when the environment is acidic enough. Hence, the alkali substances produced can maintain the optimal pH for G.xylinus to produce BC.
First, we need to find a switch with the function of sensing the pH level in the environment and respond accordingly. Luckily, we have identified a proton type of promoter P-asr located on the activator protein binding domain. When pH is around 5, it can activate RNA polymerase to combine with template DNA precisely resulting in the expression of downstream sequence. The pH for the activation of P-asr is very close to the optimal  pH for producing BC. Therefore, we decide to use P-asr as our switch.
After that, we have identified a gene GlsA with the function of producing alkali substances via the expression of glutaminase. This enzyme can catalyse the conversion of  glutamine and water to glutamate and ammonia. The ammonia will combine with H+ to increase the pH in the environment.
We have verified its capability of producing alkali in DH5α
Based on what we have acessed, we know that GlsA is activated when the pH is below 6. The graph above also demonstrates that the pH variation in the culture media of E.coli also fluctuate around 6.
We add the gene of P-asr before"

2017 iGEM Asia Pacific Conference
Previous Next
We all know that iGEM is not a competition, but a chance to meet others who are also passionate about the synthetic biology and want to use it to change the world. We are really happy to have a chance to join the 2017 IGEM ASIA PACIFIC CONFERENCE and           meet with teams from China, Japan and even from America.
WAHT IS 2017 iGEM Asia Pacific ConferenceE?
iGEM Asia Pacific Conference is a meet up for iGEM teams from Asia and Pacific that take turn host by team from Taiwan. Every year, there will be more than one hundred people participated. This year is hosted by National Chiao Tung University.
The Process
The date of the conference is originally from July 30th to August 4th, however, a strong typhoon struck Taiwan, so the conference postpone to July 31st. It is a pity that the conference has to be shortened due to the unexpectedly weather, we still manage           to fulfill our every day. Since there is only six of our members participated in this conference, we want to share our members that couldn’t come and the public who care us about what are we doing in the conference. To do so, we post diary with           a photo on our Facebook fan page everyday, trying to stay connect with others. They are written with exciting and a heart that want to share what we have learned and experienced. You can join the journey with us as you see the content below.
Day 1
Although the conference was started with one day delay because of two typhoons, we finally met up with all the iGEM teams today. In this conference, iGEM NCKU is led by Professor Wu, there are five members attending the conference, including two wet team           members, two dry team members and one HP member.
We are all ready to establish a good dialogue with every other team! HAVE FUN!

Redid transformations of PpelA and the Anderson promoter+T7 polymerase. We sent the Anderson promoter, pC13CO, pC13CL, and pC13BA to sequencing. Gel electroporation for pC13I showed that it was good, but nothing for pC13J. We were surprised to know that rbs + crtE (pC13J) already exists in iGEM! We continued with protoplasting Cochliobolus in the Turgeon Lab, and we ran a Gibson assembly of homology regions in G. lucidum.

We prepped pC13BX and pC13BA for BioBrick submission and got sequencing back. pC13BA was correct, and pC13CO and pC13CL were incorrect. We redid the Gibson for pC13CL and transformed it. We redid pC13CO digestions, ligation, and transformations. We transformed the redone lox Gibson from yesterday. We streaked out CYM plates with Aspergillus Niger, ran the Gibson assembly for PgpdA in pC13F, and transformed. We also digested pC13BR with SpeI and PstI and digested pC13AT with Xba and PstI, ran a gel of digestions to verify lengths, and column purified the inserts from digestion. We did an electroporation with pC13J and it was successful! We ran a gel for pAK13CR for confirmation and then we did a PCR clean up. We digested pAK13CR with EcoRI-HF and PstI, pC13I with XbaI and PstI, and then we ligated rbs + crtB (from pAK13CR) into pSB1C3, crtE (from pC13I) into pSB1C3. We prepared pC13BJ pC13BK pC13BL pC13BM and pC13BR for Biobrick submission. It seems our Gibson assemblies from yesterday were left in the water bath all night, so we reran them (pC13BK + pC13BM + pC13CD, pC13BQ, or pC13Y) before we transformed and plated the new assembled plasmids. We made a culture of pC13CG from glycerol stock. We ran a gel of the PCRs of pC"

Synthetic laccases and DNA aptamers for thylakoid tethering in photo-bioelectrochemical cells
Video not supported
Project Abstract
As we all know fossil fuels are running out and we need to find alternative and green energy sources. We have found a solution! The solution lies in combining the thylakoid membrane of plants` chlorophyll to a graphene plate (a superconductive carbon plate). When sunlight shines on the thylakoid membrane free electrons are generated and these electrons can be harvested to generate electricity. The key is to bind the thylakoid membrane to the graphene plate (this becomes the anode). In order to bind the thylakoid membrane we have engineered the sequence of short DNA pieces, called aptamers. One end of the aptamer binds specifically to the electron producing protein in the thylakoid membrane and the other side to the graphene plate. When electrons are then produced by the thylakoid membrane, they travel through the aptamer and to the graphene plate. Laccases is attached to the cathode which acts as an electron acceptor. This creates a potential difference and so are electricity generated by plants!

I had known about iGEM in high school, but was unfortunately unable to join so when I heard about the opportunity again in post-secondary, I was intrigued. Besides being the typical undergrad student lacking time for most activities, I enjoy coaching/playing volleyball, baking, traveling, and attempting to be musically inclined.
Rhys Hakstol
I am a graduate of the U of L, and will be starting a Master’s Degree in Biochemistry in 2015. This is my first year with iGEM, so I’m looking forward to learning lots at this year’s competition.

With what spare time I have left I am advising our iGEM or taste-testing some fine strong Scottish beverages.
Supervisor: Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Count the number of colonies on that plate (choose a dilution in which all three co-cultures can be counted)
Divide the number of colonies by the dilution factor to get the number of CFUs
Divide that value by the fraction of mLs plated to get CFUs/mL
Compare the CFUs of the inhibitor with the positive and negative control to determine if the inhibitor properly inhibits the target strain

Aggregation assay (07/13/16)
We ran aggregation assays with the strains listed in Table 1 as a qualitative test to see if CDI systems were being properly expressed.
Considerations for replicating this experiment:
leave pellet undisturbed for entire 2 hour period to avoid re-suspension

t=2hr
ATCC 13048

**expected aggregation**
EPI100 w/ EC869
Table 1: Preliminary aggregation assay results: ATCC 13048, X90 w/ EC93 and EPI100 w/ EC869 strains all obtained from the Hayes lab in UCSB. DH5-alpha w/ pSK33 and DH5-alpha w/ EC93 created in Kosuri lab by UCLA iGEM team. EPI100 w/ EC869 and DH5-alpha w EC93 displayed observable autoaggregation after t = 2h. No aggregation was expected in  DH5-alpha w/ pSK33 since it does not have a CDI system. We were uncertain as to whether or not ATCC 13048 would auto-aggregate or not as it has not been previously established, thus the lack of auto-aggregation does not necessarily indicate lack of CDI expression. X90 w/ EC93 did not auto-aggregate, suggesting there may be an issue expressing the CDI system.
Competition assay (07/29/16)
Due to the lack of auto-aggregation seen in EC93 during the auto-aggregation assay on 07/13/16, we conducted a competition assay to test for inhibitory activity in X90 w/ EC93 using EPI100 w/ EC869 as a CDI+ positive control and DH5-alpha w/ ampR as a CDI- negative"

BIOTEC_Dresden,2009,Team:BIOTEC Dresden#Scratch_-_-_TEXT.html," will inform us about the date and time later.
QIAGEN is willing to give us some kits.. so once we have designed our experiments.. we  can contact them in this regard.
Priyanka/Tomek were supposed to contact someone regarding the silver binding sequence..
30th June  Ttoday we discussed about the possibilities of altering our project.
Prof Schwille suggested that we use lipid droplets instead of GUVs, also Ilaria spoke to  senthil and got some info from him about microdroplets, we could discuss this futher.
Prof Stewart was at the meeting for a while, and he discussed possibilities of using site  specific recombinases, so he suggested 2 options which are interesting but can’t be  done in vitro, so can’t be combined with the droplets. so we have to change our project completely.. But he also said that we could do them in 4-6 weeks, taking into account our inexpertise  �� we could still say.. 8-10 weeks.. Which is reasonable..
we can talk about these projects and also about improvising these projects in our next  meeting..
the 3 important points to focus on are    1. making a new part    2. making it compatible with the biobribks.    3. characterize it well.
7th july
   today we spoke with Senthil Arumugam, a PhD student of the Schwille lab who is working  on microfluidics. We talked about the feasibility to use microdroplets for the iGEM  project and he was really confident that we could easily achieve our goal using  microdroplets. In other words, if we are able to make our genetic circuit work in a  cell-free transcription-translation system, then there would be no problem at all in  putting everything in a microdroplet.    Moreover he offered us his support in teaching to interested students how to produce  and handle microdroplets. He told me that the training will take a couple of days and you  will be quite confident in using this system in no more than a week.
other technical informations:
- Definition: microdroplets are small water droplets, separated from each other by a  continuous oil phase, within a microfluidic channel. Surfactants can be used to stabilize  the microdroplets and avoid their fusion. - The microdroplets' stability depends on the use of surfacts or lipis, anyways they last  some hours. - The dimension range of the droplets vary"

Our suggestions – make partnerships with legal private big companies to support inspection by providing boats and small hydroplanes for the task force. Rearing people inside traditional communities to work as inspectors and give them means to inform authorities by fast satellite communication. Regulate it as environmental crime for individuals and not only for big corporations.
4) Lack of adequate technologies – mercury amalgamation is a primitive and cheap way of harvesting gold.
Our suggestions – government through Ministry of Science and Technology should give priority to short term and long term researches in this subject, launching a national challenge to science community in order to solve the problem, including using Synthetic Biology. On the other hand we have already at universities and research institutes validated technologies to treat contaminated waters. These should be an alternative supported by the mining industry through fiscal incentives.
In counterpart of this fruitful debate, SDS gave us support to do our iGEM work and kept in contact since then with the UFAM-Brazil team, both helping each other to make the subject more visible to the media and therefore to the Amazonian community.
Our work join the efforts in bio-detection and biorremediation of Mercury used in illegal and legal gold mining and it is our pilot attempt to tackle the issue with SynBio. It’s our way to save and watch our Amazonian rivers, synonymous of life for all us.
The following resolutions 2012 (which are under discussion) on the regulation of mining practices and use of mercury:
Resolution CEMAAM n° 11 of May 9th 2012
Resolution CEMAAM n° 14 of Oct 18th 2012

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," gold. In Figure 3b,  we ran more assays on the subpart P(golTS)+LacZ alpha to confirm the function of golS. It is obvious that the promoter alone can't respond to the gold (Kruskal-Wallis X^2= 4.68, df = 6, p-value > 0.5).
E. coli strain DH5 alpha were transformed with the device or one of the subparts. They were streaked on the LB agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol and Xgal. If LacZ alpha is expressed, the enzyme will degrade the substrate Xgal and turn colonies blue. In Figure 4, the colonies appear blue apart from those on the DH5 alpha+golS plate. This supports our hypothesis that P(golTS) is the minimal unit for the expression of LacZ alpha.
Gold scavenging peptides (BBa_K1127000-3)
We created four variants of the fusion between MIDAS-2 and A3. We also include the N-terminal pelB tag for secretion to the periplasm and IM9 for higher stability. Note that the tag should be removed during transportation process and potentially our peptides should be released to the extracellular space.  IM9 tag is relatively small (~9.5 kDa) and should not interfere with mineralization mediated by the peptides.
For peptide activity testing , we cloned the peptides under the constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100). Characterization using Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer (NanoSight LM10 ®). The device allows us to visualize, measure and characterize any type of nanoparticles and any  size down to 10nm.  The technology is based on optical properties as well as Brownian motion of the particles.  Please visit http://www.nanosight.com/ for more information.
We obtained a series of recordings and several analytical reports of the particles within samples from the overnight cultures of E. coli strain DH5 alpha transformed with the hybrids. Unfortunately, the results can't provide evidence for gold bio-mineralization because changes were subtle and not significant compared to the controls (untransformed E. coli). Please visit out Protocols section for more detail.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

About Us
In keeping with BYU's tradition of excellence, our team will represent BYU and all it stands for at the iGEM competitions at Stanford and MIT. This is now the second year that the Cougars will be competing at the iGEM competition. After making it to the World Championship Jamboree last year, the BYU iGEM team has high expectations for the this year's team.
About iGEM and Synthetic Biology
As a relatively young field of science, Synthetic Biology is proving to be of considerable interest.  Due to the nearly limitless diversification of life on earth, these organisms present a powerful framework for engineering complex chemical and biological processes.  Synthetic Biology takes advantage of the processes already extant within living things while seeking to use, biological, chemical and engineering principles to develop new processes to solve pressing issues.
Some of the early achievements in Synthetic Biology are the engineering of E. coli to fluoresce different colors when exposed to UV light and bacterial production of human insulin.  Since then, researches in labs the world over have been laboring extensively to generate organisms capable of detecting soil composition for agriculture, discovering and producing better pharmaceuticals and even generating energy.  The ever-expanding potential of Synthetic Biology provides researchers the ability to work to solve real-world issues.
In 2003, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) formed a class whose directive was to allow students to design their own biological systems.  The following year, MIT expanded the course into an intercollegiate competition now known as the International Genetically Engineered Machine or iGEM.
One of the issues currently facing Synthetic Biology is the lack of standard parts in the synthesis of novel pathways.  The iGEM competition seeks to rectify this problem by developing a databank of standard parts.  These parts consist of genetic sequences that have proven useful in other Synthetic Biology projects.  By developing such a databank, much of the gene identification and isolation in a project may be eliminated, thus speeding along the completion of a project
Over the years, this competition has grown substantially in participation and"

Background
What is Flux Analysis?
Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) uses linear programming of metabolic networks to convert each metabolite into a mathematical coefficient.  These coefficients can be connected to each other by changes associated with each enzymatic step of the pathway.  FBA can then apply a mathematical method to examine how metabolites relate to each other in the network and allows the user to make generalized predictions for the growth of the organism,  metabolite levels, and product output inside the cell. Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) is an extension of FBA that determines the range of reactions that result in an optimal flux through the metabolic network.  Unlike FBA, this allows the user to not only determine the most optimized network for increasing cell growth, but also other parameters like product output.
What are the constraints in the FVA model?
As illustrated in Figure 1, metabolic networks can be encoded as stoichiometric matrices, in which each row represents a specific metabolite and each column represents a biochemical reaction. The entries in each column represent the stoichiometric coefficients of the metabolites in the reaction. Metabolites that are consumed or produced have a negative or positive, respectively.
Figure 1: Flux Balance Analysis.  FBA uses metabolic network (left) and simulates the connections in the network as a linear algebra matrix (right).  Each metabolite is listed vertically in the table and each reaction is listed horizontally.  Based on the metabolites involved in each reaction, the state of the system is affected by each metabolite change.
Why use FVA as opposed to FBA?
Biological systems often contain redundancies that contribute to their robustness. However, FBA only returns a single flux distribution that corresponds to maximal bacterial growth under the given growth conditions, even if other optimal parameters may exist. FVA is capable of examining these redundancies by calculating the full range of numerical values for each reaction flux in a network. Thus, FVA can be employed to study the entire range of achievable cellular functions, as well as the redundancy in optimal phenotypes.  FVA can also examine different ranges of bacterial growth vs. product output which is valuable in assessing validity of models in the wet-lab.

Escherichia coli DH5α and JM109 strain have been used in the Toxin-Antitoxin (T-A) system subproject. As a growing medium in Lysogeny broth (LB medium) was used. Tetracycline, Ampicillin, Streptomycin and Kanamaycin were used as selection criteria for the transformations at a working concentration of 10, 50, 50 and 100 μg/mL,respectively. The antibiotics were applied either on LB agar plates, for transformation purposes, or liquid LB, to grow the cells. All cultures were grown overnight at 37°C. Cell competence for transformation purposes was achieved by making electro competent cells and by using commercially competent E. coli DH5a  from New England Biolabs. Gene JET Plasmid MiniPrep kit was used to purify all the plasmids of interest after overnight growth.

NAME NAME
Product Description
'Sporal Up Ready' is a fungal pesticide that will keep your fruit and vegetables safe from insect attack.
The user can cultivate the fungus to attack specific parasites. All you have to do is catch some of the undesirable critters you want the system to target. Now treat the fungi cells with a special substrate which makes the genetic variation of the mushroom very flexible, and add the parasite to the contamination component of ""Sporal Up Ready"". The fungus then changes its genetic property to specialize its liking to that specific parasite. After 20 days or more one of the parasites will be successfully infected by the fungus and will die a pain-free death as a result of a fungal growth in its head. This provides you with a special fungus for further spore production. One such fungus is enough to protect hundreds of fruits and vegetables and give you a better garden, naturally!
This revolutionary new product combines only the best moss abilities: crush resistance, fast growth, moisture absorption and disinfection. 'kokoromo' is a reliable partner for every occasion in your home, be it as an indicator for fungi, as a dryer for wet walls or a cleaner to reduce allergic illnesses.
In addition, the dying parasitic insects will decompose in your garden, providing a fertile dung and helping your plants to grow stronger.
Technical Description
We engineered a complex parasite recognition genepool we introduced into fungi. Bringing the fungi in contact with any parasites leads to recombination of certain genes in that pool and thereby to evolution of parasite recognition systems directly inside the fungi. Thereby, a specialized detection and defense from any parasite, even very unusual parasites, is enabled.

Dr. Lilian Hong
Dr. Lilian Hong is a post-doctoral student in Dr. Roeder’s research group at Cornell University. Dr. Hong was referred to us by Dr. Roeder when we asked to follow-up on the specific hydroponic set-ups the group had set-up when they saw the negative effects of oxidative stress on plant development. We have asked Dr. Hong for insight on how to set up a system ourselves. The set-up they used was a gel box with foam stabilizing blocks for arabidopsis as a model organism. Ultimately, we decided our system would be better suited for larger plants such as leafy greens. However, the visit was still valuable as we learned about what needs to be monitored in a hydroponic system, such as pH and nutrient levels. Dr. Hong also provided us with a sample nutrient solution mix for a hydroponic system. This information was important since the environment which both plants and E. coli are exposed to in a hydroponic system is critical to the successful operation of the Oxyponics.

Dr. Paula Turkon
Since it had been several weeks since we last spoke to Dr. Paula Turkon, we decided to follow-up equipped with our designs and models to get feedback from someone who was a potential end user. We showed her the three-dimensional CAD models and animation of the rails on which the fluorescent light sensor would be attached to detect ROS levels. She responded positively and said they could easily be installed in a hydroponic system as we intended. With us we bought a 3D printed prototype of the the crop planter that would hold the bacteria-containing dialysis tubing near a plant’s roots for ROS detection. Dr. Turkon provided us valuable feedback about making the planter cup’s rings slightly smaller and having more supports incorporated to have more stability with growing seedlings. She thought the cups was nonetheless novel and could replace current planters used in hydroponics. Thus, OyxPonics overall could be incorporated easily into existing hydroponic farms.
Additionally, Dr. Turkon welcomed us to her facility and we were able to observe first hand what hydroponic setups look like and how we could develop our own. With her advice, we decided to obtain greenhouse space to try our hydroponic system and learned about some of the variables, such as light exposure and nutrients, that would make the biggest"

These regions were enclosing a neomycin resistance cassette carrying its own promoter, RBS and terminator (the exact position of these are unknown to us). Besides the neomycin resistance cassette, the mutS homologous regions were enclosing an expression cassette for a recombinase. Two different recombinases, GP35 and beta, were used resulting in two plasmids. The content of the expression cassette is shown in the following table.

Beta Protein
The sequence was obtained from GenBank (Id: KT232076.1), since this sequence is from an E. coli phage the sequence was codon optimized for B. subtilis 168 avoiding the restriction sites suggested by the iGEM REF10 standards. A TAA stop codon was added at the end  of the CDS.
 
GP35
As in Sun2015 this sequence was obtained from the genome of the Bacillus phage SPP1 (NCBI: NC_004166.2)[3]. The CDS for “gene 35” is from basepair 32175 to basepair 33038 in the genome of SPP1. The only alteration done to this CDS was that the native TAG stop codon was changed to two TAA stop codons because of iGEM preferences.
FOr each of the two recombinases a DNA sequence containing promoter, RBS, CDS and terminator flacked by homologous regions to amyE integration plasmids pDG268neo for B. subtilis was designed.

My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a few years ago that the modeling methods used in this research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the third time I am involved as one of the facilitators for a U of C iGEM team. The idea of applying engineering methods to biology just keeps getting more fascinating to me the more I learn about it. This year, I am particularly excited about the fact that we have built a team with students from three faculties joining forces to address a problem of great relevance to our local economy.

The purpose of our project is to modify the tertiary sewage treatment process in a way that eliminates the inefficiencies created by the dynamic between aerobic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria.
Examining the Current Nitrification-Denitrification Processes
Sewage Treatment systems employ processes designed around bacteria that occupy specific niches to treat human wastewater. The Biological Nutrient Removal stage, a part of the tertiary sewage wastewater treatment, in wastewater treatment uses bacteria capable of nitrification and denitrification to remove dissolved nitrogen from secondary effluent sewage. The process of denitrification has been found in both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, and major steps of the denitrification pathway have been elucidated in multiple strains (Potter; Brons; Costa; Gavira; Hasegawa; Moreno-Vivián) . Denitrification is the progressive anaerobic reduction of nitrates to nitrites to nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and eventually nitrogen gas (Peng et al 2006). Nitrification involves the oxidation of ammonia into hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine into nitrites (Arp et al 2002). Our primary goal was to bring the capabilities of nitrification and denitrification into a single cell.
Figure 1: Illustration of Nitrification and Denitrification: The formulaic depiction of how ammonia is oxidized to nitrites and how nitrites are reduced into nitrogen gas. Figure from Peng et al (2006).
Chassis Selection
Our search for organisms that possess the ability to nitrify and denitrify aerobically came up with three species of interest: Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Nitrosomonas europaea. Among these organisms are the genes for comprehensive denitrification from ammonia and nitrates to nitrogen gas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well characterized facultative anaerobe that can reduce nitrates and nitrites during anaerobic respiration. There are BioBricks made using genes from P. aeruginosa and it has been used in multiple iGEM projects  (SCU_China; DTU-Denmark; BYU_Provo; NYMU-Taipei)."

This analytical method can be used for separation and identification of proteins according to their electrophoretic mobility. The mobility is a function of length of the molecular weight. Proteins that have identical charge per unit mass due to binding of SDS results in an equal electrophoretic mobility.
Pouring the polyacrylamide gel
Make a master mix for the stacking and separating gel without adding  ammonium persulfate and TEMED.
Aliquote 6,5 mL for each separating and 2,5 mL for each stacking gel.
Add ammonium persulfate and  TEMED to each separating gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into the gel casting form. Leave about 2 centimeters below the bottom of the comb for the stacking gel.
Layer isopropanol on top of the gel.
Leave the separating gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize.
Remove isopropanol and wait until the surface is dry.
Add ammonium persulfate and TEMED to each stacking gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into your gel casting form.
Insert comb without getting bubbles stuck underneath
Leave the gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize.
For storage
Remove sealing and store the gel wrapped in moistened paper towel at 4°C.
Preparing the sample
Mix your protein mixture 4:1 with Laemmli-buffer (30 mL protein solution + 10 mL Laemmli-buffer)
Heat for 5 minutes at 95 °C.
Running the gel
Remove sealing, put the polymerized gel into gel box and pour SDS running buffer into the negative and positive electrode chamber.
Remove comp without destroying the gel pocket.
Pipet the sample into the gel pockets, adjusting the volume according to the amount of protein in your sample. Make sure to include a lane with molecular weight standards (PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder™ (Fa. Fermentas)) to determinate the molecular weight of the sample.
Connect the power lead and run the stacking gel with 10 mA until the blue dye front enters the separating gel.
Raise amperage up to 20 mA for running the separating gel.
When the distance of the lowest molecular weight standard lane to the gel end is down to 0.5 cm stop the electrophoresis by turning off the power supply.

LB Agar Plates
Reagents and Materials
LB agar
Plates
Protocol
Weigh 35g of LB-Agar powder mix per litre of media desired. One litre makes 40-50 plates. Ensure that that the mixture volume does not exceed half of the volume of the flask/contained used, as it will boil over in the autoclave.
Dissolve LB-Agar, using water from one of the wall mounted Nanopure filters. Add a stir bar and use a magnetic stirrer to facilitate mixing.
Cover the flask with aluminum foil, and secure the foil with autoclave tape. The foil should be somewhat loose (to avoid building pressure in the flask while sterilizing and blowing the foil off), but not so loose that lots of liquid can escape.
Put the flask in a plastic autoclave tray, load into the autoclave, and sterilize using the 20 minute liquid program.
Once the autoclave finishes venting (which can take twice as long as the sterilization proper), check that the foil covering is still in place. If it is not, the media is contaminated! Unload using the insulated oven gloves.
Allow the media to cool until it can be handled without the oven mits. The cold room can be used to speed this up. Alternatively, if a large batch of media is prepared flasks may be kept hot in the prep lab water bath, to avoid all of them cooling at once. Agar polymerization cannot be reversed once it starts, but media can be kept from solidifying by keeping it hot.
Once media is cool, add other desired ingredients. Use the magnetic stir"

MODELING
We attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
Overview
Our project hopes to judge whether a man has esophagus cancer or the tendency of having it (set as y∈{0,1}, 0 stands for not having it or no tendency and 1 otherwise) through the expression level of a few kinds of miRNA (set as x∈Rn, n denotes the kinds of the miRNA being selected) in human saliva. This problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems, which is 1) what kind of mathematical relationship does the expression level of these certain kinds of miRNA satisfies so that we can make the prediction of whether or not having the cancer and 2) how to construct a biological circuit to express this kind of mathematical relationship and the conclusion of the judgment.
Sub-problem 1 can be summarized as a pattern recognition problem. We can use some statistical learning (supervised learning) methods to obtain the pattern of the way that the concentrations of these kinds of miRNAs are combined, concretely, a set of parameters that the classifier possesses, to make prediction of whether or not having cancer.
If sub-problem 1 is an applied mathematical problem, then sub-problem 2 is more related to biology, because a biological system is needed to physically realize the mathematical model obtained from sub-problem 1. We can analyze this problem from a systematic view. The input of this system is the concentrations of n kinds of miRNA, which is quite trivial. And how to use a biological system to express “ill or not”? The common method is to use some chemical to be the signal molecule, and our project follows the same routine. So the output of the system is the expression level of a certain kind of chemical (such as GFP).
If sub-problem 1 uses combinatory logic to characterize the relationship between y and x, first the thresholds should be set. Secondly, gene circuits needs to be designed to characterize the relationship of “AND” “OR” “NOT”. Usually this can be realized through the combination of different kinds of promoter or repressor"

Starter culture creation
Looked at plates streaked from [ tubes Tokyo gBlock 3/4/5 ]
Each plate had a good amount of isolated colonies, well streaked.
Observation of the streaked colonies under gel box UV yielded several colonies with high fluorescence, enough to verify proper insert presence.
Colony morphology was also identical, which indicates lack of satellite colonies.
Picked an individual colony and in separate tubes prepared starter and inoculated 10mL LB supplemented with 1x Amp.  Placed in 37 deg shaking at 1600.  Will check cell growth at 0900 tomorrow ]
Zymo Mix N' Go Competency tested
Yesterday's 50mL culture of BL21(DE3) streaked from Mark Arbing and starter cultures made were grown to OD600 of 1.2 -- way above the 0.4-0.6 range recommend by Zymogen.
Competency was conducted regardless, resuspending cell pellets in competency buffer wafter wash buffering the cells from each culture.
David aliquotted the resulting DH5alpha and BL21(DE3) cells into 50uL samples, and froze in -80.

Achievements
Over the short few months of our iGem project, we managed to achieve a great deal both in and out of the lab. In the lab we created our own BioBricks, formed a new part collection and were also able to optimise previous teams BioBricks.  Outside the lab we were successful in contacting politicians at home and abroad, created software to model our system and collaborated with other teams.  Below is a colour coded guide of what we have achieved based on the iGem medal criteria
Created a BioBrick encoding the electron carrier protein cytochrome b562. Validated using a diagnostic digest.
Produced a BioBrick containing the sequences for Sup35NM linked to the csgA signal sequence designed to target the Sec and curli protein export pathways. Once in the extracellular space Sup35NM will self-assemble into amyloid fibres.
The part has been validated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Congo red plate assay. This can be used by teams in the future to attach a functional protein domain onto Sup35-NM and form functional amyloid.
Our Envirowire BioBrick has been produced with the csgA signal sequence, Sup35NM, and cytochrome b562, forming a fusion protein. We have validated that our fusion protein is exported and forms amyloid nano-wire using AFM and Congo red plate assay. Conductivity tests have also been carried out.
We participated in an open event at our university, where we explained the concept of our project with alumni and members of the public in order to increase awareness of synthetic biology and its potential use to solve various problems.
We created a model which simulates Brownian motion for a self-assembling biological structure.
We created interactive software which demonstrates the model of the system.
Valencia 2010 iGEM team produced a BioBrick encoding the Sup35NM protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Part:BBa_K401001). We submitted an improved Sup35NM BioBrick with an optimised sequence producing a part with improved compatiblity with the iGEM submission standards.
We have created a new amyloid"

Handling and disposal
We must caution that no data are available addressing the  toxicity of the EnzChek® cellulase substrate. Treat the reagent  with the same safety precautions as all other chemicals with unknown toxicity,  and dispose of the dye in accordance with local regulations.
Protocol
During all steps, protect the EnzChek® cellulase substrate and any working solution(s) from light as much as possible.
1. Equilibrate the assay components to room temperature. Remove the EnzChek® cellulase substrate from storage and equilibrate to room temperature.
2. Prepare appropriate digestion buffers. We recommend using 100 mM sodium acetate for acidic cellulases. The substrate has optimal activity at pH 5.0. For 200 assays, 40 mL of digestion buffer will be sufficient: 20 mL for substrate preparation and enzyme titration and 20 mL for intermediate dilutions. Any unused digestion buffer should be stored at 2–6˚C and used only as long as it remains free of microbial growth.
3. Make a working solution of the EnzChek cellulase substrate. Dissolve the contents of one vial of cellulase substrate in 1.86 mL of 50% DMSO. Dilute the substrate 5 fold by transferring the entire contents of the vial to a disposable plastic container and adding 7.44 mL of digestion buffer (Molecular Probes scientists use 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0) or other suitable cellulase buffer; see Protocol Details. This amount of substrate is  enough to perform ~186 assays (50 µL per well in a 96-well microplate). For short-term storage (days), unused substrate solution may be placed at ≤–20ºC protected from light. Long-term storage is not recommended.
4. Prepare enzyme standard and sample dilutions. The Assay is optimized for 100μL. The protocol recommends making the dilutions in volumes of a least 500μL and to then transfer the 100μL into the well. Perform dilutions of the test enzyme and the standard enzyme in digestion buffer. Ensure that a sufficient volume of each dilution is prepared  so that each well contains 50 µL (account for duplicates or triplicates when making dilution series if they are to be used). Consult Table 1 for detection limits and ranges.

Nanotubes
Just as people, bacteria need to communicate with others. For this goal there are many paths, and one of the most recent discoveries are Nanotubes that bridge neighboring cells, providing a network for exchange of cellular molecules within, and between species. Ben-Yehuda et al discovered these nanotubes in 2011. They show an extraordinary form of communication between Bacillus subtilis. Our team was astonished because of the implications. In the article they described that GFP and calcein, two molecules which cannot leave the cytoplasm, can be transferred to neighboring cells in B. subtilis. This means bacterium can share cytoplasm. The complex network of cells sharing cytoplasm that can be created was our main motivation to create Bacillus booleanus.
Little is still known about nanotubes, and that's what makes them a very interesting subject of study. We are not the first iGEM team interested in working with them. In 2011 the Paris_Bettencourt team worked with nanotubes, their goal being to characterize them
To accomplish our goal of communicate our logic gates, we contacted Ben Yehuda group, and Paris Bettencourt iGEM 2011 team , to obtain protocols and work experience.

22/6: PCR of pIDT-OBP2A using primers designed for the removal of the signal peptide
Aim of Experiment: To perform a PCR of the purified pIDT-OBP2A plasmid using a set of primers that have been designed to remove the signaling peptide at the start of the OBP2A gene, whilst leaving the rest of the gene intact.
Protocols Used: PCR
Results: N/A
Next Steps: If the PCR is successful, then the next step will be to gel extract OBP2A from a  the  gel corresponding to the size of the OBP2A gene fragment.
23/6: Gel extraction of OBP2A from the PCR performed on the 22/6
Aim of experiment: To perform a gel extraction of OBP2A from a PCR reaction that was performed on the 22/6. Once gel extraction has been performed a subsequent gel will be done to determine if the gel extraction had been successful.
Protocols Used: Gel Extraction
Results: Figure 1 Figure 2
Next Steps: To perform a restriction of OBP2A in preparation for ligation.
24/6:  Restriction, ligation and transformation of OBP2A into pSB1C3
Aim of experiment: To perform a restriction, ligation and subsequently a transformation of  of the gel extracted OBP2A into the JM110 E.coli strain.
Protocols Used: Restriction Digest : Ligation : Transformation
Results: N/A
Next Steps: If the transformation is successful and positive colonies form then these colonies will then be grown overnight in preparation for plasmid purification.
25/6: Re-ligation and transformation of OBP2A into pSB1C3
Aim of experiment: The transformation performed on the 24/6 failed and as a result OBP2A will now be re-ligated into the biobrick vector pSB1C3 and subsequently transformed into the JM110 E.coli strain.
Protocols Used: Ligation: Transformation
Results: Figure 3
Next Steps:If the transformation is successful and positive colonies form then these colonies will then be grown overnight in preparation for plasmid purification.

We found why the sequencing failed last time. First of all Tim gave wrong primers secondly my stupidity I added both primers in same sample misinterpreting what Tim meant for two separate same larger DNA samples. So today I sent samples again for sequencing. Today I mainly concentrated on planning how to do the fluorescence experiment.

He was involved in every step of the project, helping to train the team in data acquisition and analysis as well as project planning and troubleshooting.
Kara Helmke is the team advisor and coordinator and has helped with planning and execution of this project. She helped the team on a day-to-day basis in training, designing experiments, interpreting results, troubleshooting, and coordinating all of the individual efforts into a team result.
Wendell Lim is the faculty advisor for the 2014 UCSF-UCB iGEM team and was involved in the conception of this year’s project, based on prior work (Youk and Lim 2014). His lab is the host for the team and he has graciously supported them with time, materials, and guidance.
The amazing group of iGEM mentors (Kevin Hartman, Jonathan Asfaha, Anusuya Ramasubramanian, Zairan Lu, Michael Broeker, Alain Bonny, Ben Heineike, PJ Buske) provided training and support to the team all summer. Many were instructors in the iGEM Bootcamp at the beginning of the summer, providing much of the valuable background and training for the execution of the project. They attended countless group meetings, helping the team not only troubleshoot the project but also hone and practice scientific communication skills. Their support also made the Human Practices event at the Exploratorium possible.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," understand the important role that instructors, advisors, and PIs can play - both in ensuring the work is safe and secure but also in building a culture of responsible research and engineering. More broadly, the iGEM communities capture this though our shared values. We work to translate this into effective action. For example, iGEM continues to be at the forefront of building better ways to identify and manage risks, including dual use concerns. After iGEM also provides a powerful platform by which members of iGEM communities can continue to work on these important issues as their careers progress. For example, in December 2017 five members of our community participated in and briefed the annual meeting of the Biological Weapons Convention, at the United Nations Office at Geneva.""
Spreading Awareness – A long-term Mission
All these steps to bring the Dual Use and Research of Concern topics closer to scientists were just the beginning of something that we definitely want to continue after iGEM. We would also be pleased if following teams pick up on our activities and further spread and develop them!
iGEM - A Role Model for the (Scientific) Community
iGEM has the potential of being a role model for not only the scientific community: With its international reach and huge community, iGEM can be a trailblazer for education. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the competition, it has great potential to mediate between society and science. Within the framework of the iGEM community we hope to promote a sense of responsibility in dealing with DURC problems but in particular to teach and practice science communication in the area of DURC to generate public trust in the future.
Open Source: Because it is Everybody’s Business
As we put a huge focus on free accessible science, we published and will publish our project and future results on Research Gate – with the goal of reaching as many people as possible.
Here you can get to the Research Gate page of our project!
A Promising Outlook: Our DURC Homepage - A Place for Future Work
The end of this year’s iGEM competition and the Wiki Freeze are by no means the end of our initiative - but rather a springboard for future activities. For this reason, we have created a website that will continue to provide information about our plans in the future.
Click here to view our website!
Public Engagement: Let’s introduce Science to the Public
We put a lot effort into being a mediator between science and public and the other way around. As we have set a great focus on science communication, we used many possibilities to introduce science to a broad public.

√ 2. Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We interacted with five other iGEM teams in a variety of activities! Our key contributions to the research of other teams are as follows.
(1) In collaboration with TMMU_China, we helped them build “Protein Calculator” ,  a web app to predict the experiment result based on their modeling method. The web app cut enormous workload for them so that they could focus on their web-lab experiments.
(2) In collaboration with UESTC-China, we helped them build a tool for analyzing a large amount of experimental data, saving them from the hassle of statistical analysis work.
Please see the Collaborations page for more details.
√ 3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams's exemplary work).
(1) We developed an edutainment video game, Bio2048, for young children to learn biological hierarch concepts.
(2) We gave a popular science lecture to students from Puyang Middle School to promote their interests in the science behind DNA information storage technology and synthetic biology in general.
(3) We organized an open-lab day event for primary school students. Seventeen families attend the event to discuss the DNA information storage technology and other aspects of synthetic biology.
(4) On the 60th anniversary of our university, we presented a poster on our project to hundreds of students, alumni and guests.
(5) We carried out street interviews, poster presentations, Sina microblog and other activities to promote the public’s awareness on synthetic biology.
Please see the Human Practices page for more details.

Building concentration gradient
The concentration gradient of the root’s exudate can be regarded as stable in the soil. Exudate concentration decreases as the distance from the root surface increases. (Fig. 9.)
Fig. 9 Sketch of the expected process of chemotaxis. Root exudate’s concentration gradient are shown in different colors. Green points are imaginary E.coli
running up the gradient towards the root.
The concentration value of points is calculated from [8]. Despite limited study directly discussing the spatial distribution patterns of peanut’s root exudates, we can still describe, as [8] proposed for maize and wheat, the spatial distribution of succinate as Y = A * X-B (Fig.11), where Y represents the concentration of succinate at the distance X from the peanut root surface, when X >= 1mm.
Fig. 10 Concentration gradient of maize and wheat proposed in [8]. Y-axis is the
percentage of C14 activity, reflecting the concentration.
As the relationship is applicable only when x >= 1 mm. We estimate the percentage decrease linearly from 0 to 1 mm, and the Y value is 70% at x = 1 mm. Thus, the function of the concentration C on the distance to the root surface x is
C = 100 - 0.3 * x   if   x < 100   and
C = 70 * x^(-1.2)   if   x > 100.         (3)
Using k-d tree to store points
K-dimension tree[7] is a smart and widely-used data structure to store information of points in k-dimension space. It is very fast, typically requiring O(logN) time, to find the nearest point with a given position. Here we implement k-d tree to construct all 10,000 points.
We derive the concentration at the bacterium’s vincinity from the formula (3) described above.

Makerere_University,2018,Team:Makerere University#team_-_-_TEXT.html," Makerere team was an opportunity for me to contribute towards the championing of a technology that I believe holds the answer to many currrent problems, some whose solutions were never possible before. Think about the phrase ""plastic eating bacteria"" for example. It will change a lot in our country Uganda where plastic use is really frankly unregulated compared to many neighbouring contrives. It was the right project for this country. Synthetic biology is for me therefore a technology that is essential to the enhancement of life in the 21st century.
Through IGEM I have learned the complexities of developing an idea: how it needs commitment, focus, and cooperation with as many as can give a hand. You can never know who will actually come through for you so you can'tknow afford to write off someone at first sight. With this experience I can only look forward to many more projects in future both in the team and after Igem. Thank you IGEM, it was a worthwhile.

PASantiago_Chile,2017,Team:PASantiago Chile#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," cell is usually infected, producing viral particles that are released into the medium, once the host bacterium is lysed (breaks the cell membrane), killing it in the process. With the activation of RecA and the transcription of the Cro, LuxR and LuxI genes, the activation of the second plasmid with the LuxR / HSL promoter will be done, which will allow the color to be transcribed in the same way as the purple color, And the lemon-smelling gene. This will be the warning sign for our specialist.
The operation of the circuit is inspired by the work already done by the group of IGEM 2011, Penn States, which, similarly detect the harmful radiation rates, but unlike ours, RecA detects damage, prevents repair and connects To a reporter to know where the damaged DNA is. (States, 2011)
Why does the RecA protein serve us?
RecA is a multifunctional protein, which is essential for different biological processes. Coordinated regulation of unrelated gene expression in response to damaged DNA, also known as SOS response, is what matters for this project. The regulatory role of RecA works with an SOS operon of approximately 20 unrelated genes inducible by overexposure to DNA damaging agents. The encoded enzymes that induce these genes work to cut out the damaged DNA and facilitate the repair of possible damage occurring in DNA recombination.
Expression of SOS genes is controlled by the repressor LexA that represses its response, binds to the group of inducible SOS genes and limits its transcription. After the event with high radiation rates has occurred, the co-protease activity of RecA is activated, due to the generation of a DNA of only one strand, either by the action of the nucleases or because the replication fork is Stagnant This single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binds to RecA in the presence of ATP, promoting the formation of a nucleoprotein that separates the LexA repressor and induces the SOS genes, including the same RecA. Genes that weakly bond to LexA are the first to be fully expressed. If the damage persists or is very high, the concentration of the RecA protein increases, and other operons are affected by being bound to LexA. Normally, RecA is repressed at a basal level of 1000 molecules per cell. Once the LexA repressor is removed, it is rapidly increased by 20 times the amount of the protein (10 molecules per second), peaking at one hour from the occurrence of the damage event.

Testing PC reporter system
We invented a new protocol for testing our PC reporter system (Figure 17).
Figure 17. Flow chart for testing PC reporter system. Since one dCas9 fusion protein would form a complex with a pair of sgRNAs simultaneously, which will decrease the complementation of Nluc and Cluc, we incubated two split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes separately at 25°C for 10 min. After adding target DNA into the mixture of two complexes and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, they simultaneously bind to two adjacent half-sites on target DNA, bringing Nluc and Cluc into close proximity, thus leading to recovery of its enzymatic activity. Then transfer the mixture to 96-well plates before adding Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) and promoptly measure the luminescence in Microplate Reader (Thermo Scientific).
High-throughput array detection assay
Based on the results we acquired, single-site target detection presents relatively high specificity and sensitivity. However, taking strain mutations, sample differences and other environmental factors in clinical practices into consideration, we set an array (Figure 18) to detect multiple target sites (markers) of MTB to make our PC reporter quantitatively reliable.
Figure 18. The 96-well plate layout in array detection assay. 9 fragments (F1-F9) screened out by SSPD from MTB genome were set in each line, and 8 MTB markers (M1-M8) in each fragment were respectively set in each sample pool. In total 8*9=72 markers were detected in one single assay. For each fragment, P9 meant a negative control with a mismatch sgRNA pair added. Two separated assays were carried out using MTB and a control strain (E. coli) as experimental subjects respectively

Be conscious of what we talked about here, we hope that all iGEM members will develop judicious research ethics and achieve eloquent projects.
Laboratory Biosafety Guideline
In this section, we will talk about the fundamental guideline which WHO provides.This guideline shows researchers unique set of safety equipment, facility, and practices to conduct safe and sure experiments.
Biohazard Containment and Safety
The relative hazards of infective microorganisms are grouped by risk group (WHO Risk Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4).
Laboratory biosafety manual Third edition says as follows:
Risk Group 1 (no or low individual and community risk)
A microorganism that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.
Risk Group 2 (moderate individual risk, low community risk)
A pathogen that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of infection is limited.
Risk Group 3 (high individual risk, low community risk)
A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available.
Risk Group 4 (high individual and community risk)
A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.
Laboratory facilities are designated as basic ? Biosafety Level 1, basic ? Biosafety Level 2, containment ? Biosafety Level 3, and maximum containment ? Biosafety Level 4. Biosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups.
Risk groups relate biosafety levels but do not “equate” to the biosafety level of laboratories designed to work with organisms in each risk group.
High risk groups require more rarefied composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures. We mainly talk about BSL1 and BSL2 because it is uncommon for undergraduate students to handle the facilities above BSL 3.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"The far1 of △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 is knocked out successfully, and these strains will still keep growing under the effects acted by α factor and Zone of inhibition will not be shown either.
Fig.3 inhibition zone of △far1+△sst2 and △sst2+△far1+△ste2 under different concentrations of α factor.
Conclusion： Knock out the gene sst2 can eliminate the inhibition of the signal so that the strain △sst2 can amplify the signal when cultured with α factor. From the results above, the strain △far1+△sst2 didn’t stay at the phase G1, because the gene far1 knockout eliminates the growth arrest. Gene ste2 knockout makes the strain don’t response to the α factor.
Growth curve
Research the impacts acted by the various concentrations of α factor to the growth tendency of these strains in the liquid medium.
The research of the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the growth of Cen.PK2-1C, △sst2 of CEN.PK2-1C.
Plan and method
The growth tendency of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains were determined by the initial concentrations of α factor from 0µM to15 µM. We planned to cultivate every engineered strain with these concentrations of α factor and obtain the value of OD600 of these strains at wavelengths of 600nm during cultivation measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometer which was calibrated by the YPD solution without strains.
Results and discussion
(1) With the concentration of α factor increasing, the growth of CEN.PK2-1C was inhibited more obviously.
Fig.4 growth curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
(2)the growth curve of △sst2 is lower than CEN.PK2-1C. It was strongly inhibited by α factor.
Fig.5 growth curve of △sst2 under different concentrations of α factor.
Conclusion：From the results above, we could see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain would be inhibited by α factor. With the increase of the concentrations of the α factor, the inhibitory effect to the growth of the strains enhanced. Obviously, knocking out the gene sst2 makes the strain respond to α factor more sensitively.

Besides, this measurement could be also analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis for validation. The TECAN measurement of the SREBP responsive promoters, LDL receptor and HMG CoA synthase promoter, show a significant induction. This should also be validated by microscopy and flow cytometry. Unfortunately, the appropriate induction conditions for the other natural promoters could not be established in the remaining time.
Methods
The different natural promoter inserts (see table 1) were integrated in the pSMB_MEASURE . For this purpose, the promoters of the ordered plasmids/genomic DNA were amplified by PCR and primers with BBb standard. These PCR products were digested by restriction enzymes and purified. The purified inserts were ligated into the pSMB_MEASURE plasmid and transformed into DH5alpha bacterial cells. After mini-preparation, the plasmids were sequenced, which revealed the right sequences. The natural promoters were transfected in different cell lines and induced with appropriate substances, which is presented in table 1. The analysis was made by flow cytometry or TECAN measurement. More details about the method are found in the Notebook .

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," as a field, is that there is no dominating strain of normative ethics. The arguments are both deontological in nature as well as utilitarian. When an argument is deontological it focuses on duties. Deon comes from the ancient Greek word for duty or obligation. Simply put: There are some things that one just has to do and things one never does. In deontology there is a principle called Universalizability Principle which states, that for an action to be morally acceptable the maxim which the action is based on has to be universalizable NIELSEN, C. F. 2014. Deontologi In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. .
An example of a deontological argument would be “it is wrong to play God”, that falls under the category with religious arguments. Some group those arguments with teleological-, religious - and nature arguments KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The utilitarian arguments are focused on the consequences of our actions. The consequences are all that matters when it comes to the decision of whether something is morally just. The consequences which utilitarianism focuses on are utility and it’s often the most positive arguments in bioethics. The arguments are simple in outline: if the action that is discussed produces, or results in, more utility then one is morally obliged to apply or accept that action HOLTUG, N. 2014. Konsekventialisme. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. .
Sometimes the arguments are based on virtue ethics. Where deontology and utilitarianism are based on rules independent of individuals, meaning that the rules apply no matter what, virtue ethics are based on the individuals. The perfect virtuous person is what determines the morally just action. In natural science virtues like integrity, curiosity and intelligence are often highly praised and the idea behind virtue ethics are that the virtuous person’s actions are the morally praiseworthy actions CHRISTENSEN, A.-M.

Cellobiose Phosphorylase Makes E. coli Able to Grow on Cellobiose
The first growth experiments that were conducted included aeration of the bacteria at 200 rpm. In these experiments shown in Figure 23, we do not observe any major differences in growth between the strains containing the cep94A gene, the bglX gene and the control.
Figure 23. Growth experiment with the aeration at 200 rpm. On the x-axis time in hours and OD600 on a logarithmic y-axis with standard deviation. All the experiments were conducted at once in the same water bath at 37°C and the data shown is an average of technical triplicates. Measurements were performed on E. coli MG1655 with inserted cep94A encoding cellobiose phosphorylase on pSB1C3 backbone, bglX encoding beta-glucosidase and a negative control with LacI promoter+RBS. All the strains were growing on cellobiose+casamino acids referred as Cellobiose and just casamino acids referred as none. The Lacl promoters were induced with IPTG.
The cultures were left at 37°C overnight without aeration. Increased growth was measured on the spectrophotometer at OD600 in the flasks with E. coli expressing the cep94A gene, indicating that cep94A coding cellobiose phosphorylase gives E. coli the ability to live on cellobiose. To be certain that it was the cep94A that ensured E. coli was living on cellobiose and not a contamination, we conducted a test with only a control (LacI and RBS) and cep94A, with measurements at 48 and 72 hours. This experiment revealed that cultures containing the cep94A are able to grow without aerating to an OD600 around 0.9, as shown in Figure 24. The control living only on casamino acid only grew to an OD600 around 0.2 and did not change between the two measurements.

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

Plan for Test #1:  To test the activity of our activators and repressors, we would grow out an overnight culture of yeast cells that have successfully  been transformed with both a synthetic transcription factor and its respective reporter.  Thee cultures would have an amount of galactose and methionine that will remain the same for all subsequent tests.  We would then count the cells in these overnight cultures in the morning, dilute them, split them up into well plates with an equal number of cells in each plate in media with differing amounts of galactose or methionine (water would be added as a control and to maintain the same volume in each well).  We could also centrifuge the cells before putting them into these wells to remove traces of the previous media.  Perhaps two washes would be sufficiently rigorous to ensure that the concentration of input in the media is what we would want it to be with high confidence.  Then we would grow the cells in these wells for 4 hours or so to get them back into log phase in their respective media.  After this, we would take their fluorescence measurement using a plate reader, perhaps taking out samples at different time points during the log phase.
Realized that regarding further yeast transformations for Test #1 that we will have to wait until we insert Z0842 (LexA activable reporter) and Z0507 (Zif268-HIV repressor reporter) into pRS306 in order to actually get them into yeast cells.  Thus, we cannot run basic tests of the LexA activator or the Zif repressor until this is done.  We already have two of the activators transformed into yeast.  This leaves four more possible transformations that we can do right away:
LexA repressor + LexA repressor reporter (Z0412 + Z0418)
null repressor + LexA repressor reporter (Z0411 + Z0418)

Bringing Anita to Brazil: our team effort and reward!
In July 2015, we were honored to receive Ana Paola Sifuentes Infante, a member of iGEM Foundation, responding to our team invitation. Knowing her was an excellent opportunity to understand details of the competition.
Inviting a member of iGEM Foundation was idealized by our Instructor (Francis Nunes), aiming to enrich our discussions about Synthetic Biology and the competition itself. Our team then organized a round table debate on Synthetic Biology at the 64th     Annual Meeting of the SBPC, which took place in Sao Carlos. Brasil-USP team organized the meeting of Brazilian teams, Jamboré Brazil, the day after the round table. These two events justified and enabled the coming of Ana Sifuentes to be one of the     debaters in both events.
Receiving Ana Sifuentes brought outstanding contributions to both UFSCar and USP teams, as well as for Synthetic Biology in Brazil. At the same time, it was important that a representative of iGEM Foundation could get to know the peculiarities of Brazilian     teams.
We enjoyed every moment of her visit and showed her a little of our reality, culture, knowledge and our University facilities. Those few days with Ana Sifuentes has given us a great learning experience on the iGEM spirit. Their advice will serve to     future generations of Brazilians iGEMers. We highlight with this report the importance of visits by iGEM organizers to teams around the world, which can strengthen new perspectives for competition.
Gracias, Anita! We meet soon in Giant Jamboree!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"

Protein A
Protein A would be secreted from the bacteria, penetrating the skin and bind IgG antibodies - that in vitiligo patients bind melanocytes - so that the igG antibodies can not induce an immune response.
""It binds proteins from many of mammalian species, most notably IgGs"" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A (Find better source)
Johan: Good as IgGs are the main antibody in excess for vitiligo
“It binds with the Fc region of immunoglobulins through interaction with the heavy chain. The result of this type of interaction is that, in serum, the bacteria will bind IgG molecules in the wrong orientation (in relation to normal antibody function) on their surface which disrupts opsonization and phagocytosis.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A
Johan: The disruption is what we want (are there more disruptions to think of, other than opsonization and phagocytosis?)
Nina: Those are the most important ones, which is very good that happens in our case. Later would be if we could combine this with an IgG protease that would destroy the auto-antibody IgG.

With regards to the PetroBrick , the sequencing results were once again unsuccessful and yielded a low complementarity rate. As such, it was decided that we would contact the University of Washington, and ask them to send us the PetroBrick they composed and were working with in 2011. In addition, we also decided to produce our own biobrick identical to the PetroBrick by using the acyl-acp reductase (which we had successfully transformed and isolated previously) with aldehyde decarbonylase ( ADC ). The ADC was transformed into the E.coli,and colony PCR was done in order to determine whether successful this was successful. This was followed by mini-preparation and restriction digest before gene sequencing occurred.
Week 13 (July 23 - July 27)
The gene sequencing results for the aldehyde decarbonylase ADC ) were unsuccessful. It was presumed that this occurred because the mini-preparation procedure being used may potentially be leading to a high contamination rate. As such, a colony PCR was done with a new colony for ADC , followed my mini-preparation using a different procedure, and then a restriction digest. The sequencing results now yielded a high complementarity rate and were considered successful. We then proceeded with making the biobrick consisting of the acyl-acp reductase ( AAR ) being ligated with aldehyde decarbonylase ( ADC ). Upon successfully forming this biobrick (ideally the same as a functional PetroBrick ), we will be able to test for hydrocarbon production using the general production media protocol. The University of Washington also responded, and said that they will be able to send us their functional PetroBrick that was being used in 2011.  With regards to culturing Nocardia, a “brain and heart infusion (BHI)” broth was used to inoculate the Nocardia in an attempt to get growth. Six pairs of mutagenic primers were also composed for carboxylic acid reductase (CAR), which is found in the Nocardia, as well as primers for the OleT enzyme.
