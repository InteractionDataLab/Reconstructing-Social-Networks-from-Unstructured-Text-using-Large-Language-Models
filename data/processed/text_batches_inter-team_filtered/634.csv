Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#challenges_-_-_TEXT.html," the DNA is based on the synthesis of modified DNA, which is by now available from almost all DNA synthesis companies. The big challenges arise when it comes to the retention and preservation of these unnatural bases. Since the cell detects them as “foreign”, ergo as mutations, a system has to be put in place to prevent the correction of these bases. Furthermore, the chemical stability of the unnatural base pairs has to be considered. The acceptance of the unnatural bases also poses big challenges, since the entire transcription and translation machineries have to be adapted to accept the unnatural base pairs. This can be achieved by directed evolution of the ribosomes and the tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
Technical Challenges
Given that most bioinformatic tools are designed to work with only four-letter DNA and the 20 canonical amino acids, expanding the genetic code leads to certain challenges in using these tools. Tools such as BLAST are not designed to work with an expanded base and amino acid repertoire. Therefore, these tools need to be adapted to be used with unnatural base pairs. Other problems that have to be considered are the limited possibilities for sequencing unnatural base pairs, a limited range of compatible polymerases and a restricted set of cloning methods. Sequencing of the unnatural base pairs can be achieved using Oxford Nanopore Technology´s sequencing technology. Since Oxford Nanopore Sequencing does not require additional sequencing chemistry, this technology is predestined to be used for the sequencing of unnatural base pairs. An even simpler solution to this problem is our Mutational Analysis Xplorer (M.A.X) , an enzyme based system to analyze if an unnatural base pair is present in a specified sequence or if it is mutated to a natural base. The limited set of cloning methods results mainly from the low fidelity of most polymerases regarding the incorporation of unnatural base pairs. Therefore, if possible, PCR free cloning methods should be used."

Both ligations were transformed in NEB10β E.coli cells and checked with restriction digests prior to sequencing.  2 Liters of media were also prepared to make more AMP and CMR plates.
AGP/INV:
Procedure: Gibson assembly was reattempted to construct KNR+petBD+INV (Attempts 4 and 5). Taking the advice from University of Cambridge, phusion polymerase was added last to the reactions, and reactions were verified on 0.7% agarose gel at 13.8V per cm. The electrophoresis data indicated that both Gibson assembly attempts were unsuccesful (No bands observed). In response to the consecutive failed Gibson assembly attempts, Sequence and Ligation Independent Cloning Technique (SLIC) was used to assemble the KNR+petBD+INV operon. This technique involves incubating the individual parts (KNR, petBD, and INV) with T4 DNA polymerase prior to the addition of Taq DNA ligase and nucleotides in order to chew back the overlapping sequence prior to assembling the construct. The SLIC product was PCR amplified using the AGP_KNR forward and INV_AGP reverse primers and an initial annealing temperature of 60 degrees C. The SLIC product was verified on 0.7% agarose gel at 13.8 V per cm.
Results: The electrophoresis data indicated that the SLIC assembly attempt was unsuccessful (No bands observed). Thus, the KNR+petBD+INV operon has yet to be assembled.

We reran the experiment from week 12, in which we looked at the effect of glucose and ammonium chloride concentrations on Iq cells grown in BG-11.  This time we set the pH of all media to 6.7 with 0.1 M NaOH and cultured our samples in triplicate.  The results confirmed what we had found in week 12.  With the addition of glucose, the cultures grew to an OD at 600 nm of more than 60% greater than our standard curve.

Introduction
This year our Human Practice efforts were divided into 4 different                     categories, each of them affecting our project and ourselves in a different                     way. We focused on:
taking into serious consideration ethical issues regarding our                             project
reaching out to field experts
interacting with people from the industry in order to investigate                             various possibilities and options for our project
communicating science, synthetic biology and our project across                             people of different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds
Bioethics
One of top priorities during our project’s design and execution was that                     our project would not raise any ethical concerns. So, we visited the                     Hellenic National Bioethics Commission, where we discussed with Dr Vidalis.                     After a presentation of our project and its possible applications, we                     discussed about the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and the ethical                     issues that may arise during the process of integrating this new scientific                     field in statutory legislation. Dr Vidalis, evaluated our project and concluded that it doesn’t directly raise any bioethical questions nor does                     it pose any threat to individuals, society and the environment, but drew                     our attention on the rules that should be followed in possible                     applications. We agreed that many aspects of synthetic biology still need                     regulation, as products of biological and technological advancements must                     be utilised in a safe and risk avoiding way. Therefore, the existence of a                     universal, well-established legislation, is necessary for an emerging field                     like synthetic biology.
Academia
As we work upon a foundational advance project, providing a genetic toolbox                     that allows for increased control of gene expression, researchers will be                     the first to utilize it. Therefore, their feedback would prove of great                     importance to our project’s design and usage.
For that reason, we contacted numerous field experts, informing them about                     our project. In addition, we created a synthetic biology survey that                     investigates:
problems in research
our project’s usefulness
ethical issues that may arise
lab safety
Survey Results
From the survey result it can be deduced that, apart from funding, lack of                     reproducibility and interlaboratory variations stand as significant                     obstacles in research. On another note, researchers use plasmids with                     different copy numbers for different purposes, which shows that control                     over the expression level of the gene of interest can be useful.

Survey on Open Research and Synthetic Biology
The main goal of our human practice was to introduce synthetic biology to as many people as we could, regardless of their major. We introduced our program ""Gil"", along with its application in the scientific research. Prior to the seminar, we carried out a survey aiming to understand people's level of knowledge. In order to obtain a reliable data, our sample for the survey varied from people with no prior knowledge of synthetic biology to those majoring in it. The survey included some information regarding one's background knowledge on synthetic biology, the appliances of the program Gil, and especially ""open network"" and ""open data"". We focused on the topic of open research because we utilized a lot of various open source to develop the software, and we believe that open research is the core value of synthetic biology and computing.
Prior to the survey, our team wanted not only the data collected from the survey but an opportunity for people to know about Synthetic biology and our project. Therefore, the survey contained questions of background knowledge on Open data and synthetic biology while still using vocabulary and definitions easy enough for people with no prior knowledge on this field to understand.
We conducted the research for seven days and obtained 183 answers. Also, the survey was written in two languages: Korean and English.
From the survey targeted at the general public, we got some interesting results. The 60% of the people did not know what synthetic biology or open data was, but they did say that not only synthetic biology but science field would benefit from their connections with open data. Most people thought that it would widen the understanding and also bring about a more effective way of our data searching.
The response from the IGEM members, who already had plenty of knowledge of Synthetic biology and its connections with networking, was not so different. 58% of them responded that they have had research experience on redesigning cell metabolic pathways, and agreed to the term that our project will help to find efficient pathway regulations. Moreover, they responded that such projects like ""Gil"" will reinforce collaboration among scientists dedicated to the field by allowing by the ubiquitous sharing of information.
With the survey results underlying, we started to introduce synthetic biology, the competition IGEM and our project 'Gil' to the people. As texts could limit the transfer of knowledge aimed at the general public, we tried to involve interactive activities in order to efficiently pass on the knowledge about synthetic biology's usefulness. For the professionals, we focused on introducing the purpose of our project in future synthetic biology research in depth.

Overview
While we reached the fact that both NOR and nosZ react at much faster rate than NiR which is crucial to the substrate channeling system, we cannot guarantee that no biotoxin (NO and N2O, the intermediate product of reaction pathway) will escape during the reaction pathway if we simply expressed the separately using different RBS.
To give a better view of the issue, we compared the pros and cons of different ways to create this substrate channeling system.
Separately express target enzymes using different RBS
Pros
1
easy to construct
2
use the RBS of different efficiency to regulate the expression
Cons
1
Enzymes can be far apart in space, resulting in bad efficiency
2
possible leakage of bio toxins
Fusion Protein
Pros
1
The product of previous enzyme will directly go to active site of next enzyme
2
Enzymes are physically fixed next to each other, kinetics of the fusion protein is easy to predict
Cons
1
difficult to construct
2
difficult to select the correct linker
3
not possible to regulate the ratio of expression of three enzymes
Scaffold method
Pros
1
possible to regulate expression ratio
2
fixed physical positions for enzymes
Cons
1
most difficult to construct
However, in our situation, the difference between Scaffolding and Fusion Protein is quite small: since NiR's reaction rate is already a limiting factor in the pathway, there is no need to regulate the expression ratio between our target enzymes. So we settled down with fusion protein.
Background
There are currently four methods of fusion protein assembly:

iGEM Team Aachen
The collaboration with the iGEM team Aachen started at the German team meetup in Marburg. It was a perfect match as their problem of solubility of non-canonical amino acids is based exclusively on the chemical nature of the amino acids. So we conducted a literature club and discussed some important general aspects regarding solubility. The solubility of their amino acids could be simulated for aqueous systems. The results lead to a change in the solvent from water to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). In the end, we were happy to help them getting back on track with their project.
Figure 1: Solubility of tyrosine modified with a light cleavable protecting group.
iGEM Team Munich
As we were also testing fluorescent proteins on their function as photosensitizers we tried a broad variety of them, which we could not produce on our own. Hence, iGEM Team Munich helped us with highly purified eGFP modified with a Histidin-Tag. We demonstrated a slight impact on the performance of the solar cells built with titanium dioxide cells. However, this impact may lie within our standard deviation. For ZnO no enhancement could be observed. Thus, we tested the fluorescent protein as co-photosensitizer for closing absorption gaps yielding better results.
Figure 2: Basic idea of co-sensitized solar cell. Fluorescent protein provides an emission maximum at the absorption maximum of the dye (red star). The excited dye can transfer its electron to the ZnO layer.

The lower left part of the map is warmer. In this region, ${k_{on}}$ is high and ${k_{off}}$ is low, which means that two peptides are prone to associate. This is the very district where the state of split EBFP2 with intein lies in.
The higher right part, on the contrary, is chilling to the bones. Here, ${k_{on}}$ is low and ${k_{off}}$ is high, which means that the two parts tend to disassociate. The state of spilt EBFP2 without intein falls into this region.
If we compare the two figures in parallel, we can see that the values in the “titration” map is lower than those in the “dimer” map. This is in accordance with our experimental data. Wet lab work shows that with a constitutively-expressed part, channel capacity is lower. The model match and explain the phenomenon.
To sum up, mathematical modeling reveals the impacts of thermodynamic constants on the gene regulatory circuit’s ability to convey information.

Using CV Technology to Quantitative Forecasting
Hypothetically, you use the test paper we design and you can see three lines (Which means there are three kinds of mi-RNA have been found in your body fluid). Don’t worry, it doesn’t necessarily mean you got the cancer. Because the amount of those three mi-RNA has to satisfy this equation：
So, we have to turn the GFP brightness information into the possibility of patient being afflicted with cancer. And we use the CV technology to help us achieve that goal.
For example, we now have the photo of the test paper(The color of test paper itself might be light yellow due to the ambient light or the paper quality).
We use Matlab to read this file and we can get an array of the RGB value of this image.Then,we can use this function to calculate the Brightness of each pixel:Y=0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
Then we have to normalize these data to eliminate the effect of the ambient light.We pick an pixel in the “white” area and calculate its brightness/255, set this as constant C, and use it to multiply every pixel’s brightness.
After that, we will get a new array of the normalized brightness information. We can use the relative position to pick 10 pixel in each line, and calculate the mean value of each line’s brightness. We"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKU#project#surface_-_-_TEXT.html," PPK1 into MCP
It had been demonstrated that signal sequences at the N-terminus of MCP associated enzymes are capable of causing their compartmentalization inside shells. For Eut MCP, the sequence of 19 amino acids at the N-terminus of EutC has been showed to serve as this function, localizing the signal fused protein into the MCP. In order to localize the PPK1 to the inside of our recombinant Eut BMCs, we will construct a PPK1 fused with this N-terminal targeting sequence and co-transformed in E.coli alongside the Eut SMNLK expression cassette.
The nucleotide sequence of the signal peptide is
ATGGATCAAAAACAGATTGAAGAAATTGTACGTAGCGTGATGGCGTCAATGGGACAG.
And its corresponsing 19 amino acid is
MDQKQIEEIVRSVMASMGQ.
By localizing only PPK1 into the MCP, the engineered MCP is expected to form a sink for phosphate in the system which after normal metabolic uptake by the bacteria. As phosphate is converted into ATP, this small molecule can easily passing through the pores of the MCP surface and enter the MCP. The ATP entered to the MCP can be utilized by PPK1 and converted into polyP. As polyP is too large to pass out of the pores of the MCP, it accumulates in the microcompartments, generating irreversibility in the process, and preventing phosphate returning to the system/ environment.
Surface Tagging of MCP
MCP is a promising platform for metabolic engineering, considering its magnificent features of concentrating desired enzymes and controlling substrate transfer. We utilize this properties to accomplish our goal – enhancing the PolyP synthesis and accumulation.
Yet being a bioreactor as it always has been, we start thinking if this protein cage can be exploited as a different tools, for example, a delivery vesicle?
There are some protein cages, including viral capsids, ferritins and heat shock proteins being investigated as nanocontainers for biomedical applications. Through genetic and chemical engineering, they can be potentially developed into therapeutic and imaging delivery systems.
One important feature for delivery vesicle is specific targeting, e.g. cell specific targeting for tumour cells. If exterior surface of the MCP can be genetically incorporated with designed targeting sequence, it might become a new candidates as a delivery vesicle.
We look through the solved structure of all five shell protein monomers: EutS, EutM, EutN, EutL and EutK. Luckily, we find EutS mon"

What are BioBricks?
“BioBrick standard biological parts are DNA sequences of defined structure and function; they share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells such as E. coli to construct new biological systems.
BioBrick parts represent an effort to introduce the engineering principles of abstraction and standardization into synthetic biology. The trademarked words BioBrick and BioBricks are correctly used as adjectives (not nouns) and refer to a specific ""brand"" of open source genetic parts as defined via an open technical standards setting process that is led by the BioBricks Foundation.”
BioBricks on Wikipedia
What is the Registry of Standard Biological Parts?
“The Registry is a continuously growing  collection of genetic parts that can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems. Founded in 2003 at MIT, the Registry is part of the Synthetic Biology community's efforts to make biology easier to engineer. It provides a resource of available genetic parts to iGEM teams and academic labs”

AL: I sent in sequencing for biobrick sequence verification - needed to have reverse sequencing for S1 and S2.
Also resequenced SN and full construct C minipreps, just to make sure the tubes were what we labeled them as. Full construct C tube doesn't match with the Collagen with Crosslinking domain geneious file. It probably isn't what we want. SN had 100% pairwise alignment so its OK.
Ran PCR reactions to linearize constructs. The miniprep construct 1's (S1//C1) were linearized with linearization primers previously designed at the beginning of the summer. The miniprep constructs 2's and 3's were linearized with VF2 and VR primers.

These PCR's will be used for Golden Gate Assembly to make FULL COLLAGEN CONSTRUCTS. Full construct C, the miniprep we currently have, is not right so we have to redo that. Full construct S does not exist yet, so thats why we're running GG.

After inducing, harvesting and washing the cells 1 ml was taken from each culture to be loaded into the gel. The cells were lysed using lysozyme and boiled for 3 minutes at 100°C loading 10 µl into the gel (Figure 7).

TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Project#Thaumatin_-_-_TEXT.html," 2011 ] and the possibility that the pre-sequence is necessary for the correct procession [ Ide et al., 2007 ]. A similar construct was used by the Kyoto University (Ide et al., submitted) in Pichia pastoris with a pPIC6α expression vector and achieved a high yield (especially with the preprothaumatin I gene and without the α-factor secretion signal).
The molecular and physiological effects of thaumatin
The sweet taste receptor is a heterodimeric receptor composed of T1R2 (also TAS1R2) and T1R3 (also TAS1R3) subunits. The large amino-terminal domains (NTD) of the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits have shown to be responsible for the primary ligand binding [ Maîtrepierre et al., 2012 ]. In addition these receptors have a heptahelical transmembrane domain. T1R receptors belong to the family of class C G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which in this case means that, through ligand binding, an elevation of cAMP concentration in the taste buds is induced  [ Ide et al., 2009 , Ozeck et al., 2004 ]. As a result a decrease in the intracellular cAMP accumulation is measured. Released calcium (Ca2+) seems to be another independent second messenger within the transduction of the taste response (downstream of taste receptors) [ Trubey et al., 2006 ].
However, not only sucralose or other sugars can bind with the NTDs of the sweet taste receptor, but also thaumatin [ Ide et al., 2009 ]. It seems to have a longer lasting and stronger effect than sucralose.
Theoretical consideration: How much thaumatin is needed in foodstuff?
The molecular weight of sucrose is 342,30 g/mol, respectively 22194,13 g/mol for thaumatin. This means that although the relative sweetness of thaumatin is 2000 to 10000 times the sweetness of sucrose on a molar basis, it's only ~30 to 150 times the sweetness when measured in mass.
Thus you need to put 0,07 to 0,35 g of thaumatin into 100 ml generic soft drink to create an equal level of sweetness.

Week 9 (07/16 – 07/22)
The characterization obviously continues. I make changes in the protocol to find the optimal method; I try, for instance, to grow directly in MOPS A (i.e. glycerol) overnight as Keasling does. After a few tries I find that the original approach (growing overnight in LB and then changing the medium before induction) works best for me (my cells).
The sequencing results for araCpBad-M256I CysE (which, again, I’m gonna call 1035 from now on) arrived, and confirm one colony with an high confidence (I sent 3, but something went wrong with the primers so we only have half of the sequencing, I send those two back).
I can now transform 1035 in NEB10b and characterize it too. This is the version that should work best on the statues, thanks to its mutation.
And this is the time when the Tragedy, as we call it, occurs. In a moment of confusion with lots to do, I see Guzz is transforming. I give him my cells and miniprep of the 1035 confirmed colony. And what Cristina feared most happened: Guzz was transforming ligations. When we transform ligations we transform all the product, so we put cells in the ligation eppie. He does that with my (only) miniprep of 1035 confirmed colony. Which means that I have none of it now. Please note I’m not blaming Guzz for this, my part was my responsibility: my part, my mistake.
I decide to transform it and hope the cells will survive from the DNA excess and let me miniprep my plasmid back. I am now to transform another colony in NEB10b, I choose one of the two that was half sequenced and look promising.      In the shadow of all this, a change in the conditions of the Gibson’s PCR (2°C higher for the annealing step and a 30s longer initial denaturation) proves successful .

Expression and Degradation of Red Fluorescence Protein variants in Δ ssrA cells
Our project was to create a kill-switch that will allow bacteria to survive under one set of conditions (darkness) but not another (light). In order to prevent premature cell death, we included an ssrA degradation tag to our kill-switch toxin protein, MazF. Interestingly, this may lead to a positive feedback effect: if enough MazF is produced, it will cleave mRNAs and create a lot of stalled ribosomes - this in turn results in a lot of other ssrA tagged proteins in the cell. Since the cell has a finite supply of proteases that recognize the MazF tag, the increase in ssrA tagged proteins should create a queuing effect at the protease, and indirectly stabilize MazF.
We wanted to test this idea, but to do so by testing the opposite scenario: in a cell that lacks tmRNA and any endogenous ssrA tagged proteins, would MazF-ssrA be degraded faster? As a stand in for MazF in this experiment, we used RFP - either untagged, or tagged with different variants of the ssrA tag. The normal ssrA tag, ANDENYALAA, is effectively recognized by proteases such as ClpXP and Lon. In constructs such as K1399012, it is represented by the last three amino acid letters (RFP-LAA); other constructs we tested, such as K1399010 (RFP-AAV), K1399011 (RFP-LVA), or K1399013 (RFP-DAS) have versions of the tag that are less efficiently recognized. We hoped that expression of these constructs in a cell that lacks tmRNA would lead them to be recognized better than they normally are. For example, bacteria with the RFP-DAS construct normally accumulate enough RFP to appear red on a LB plate - would growth in a ΔssrA cell diminish the amount of RFP to an extent that could be visualized on a plate?
The image on the left shows a petri dish with LB Miller agar, chloramphenicol, and 1mM IPTG with various strains - different variants of RFP in strains that have (left) or lack (right) tmRNA. The labels refer to the different"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Gel Slice and PCR Product Preparation
A. Dissolving the Gel Slice
1. Following electrophoresis, excise DNA band from gel and place gel slice in a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.
2. Add 10μl Membrane Binding Solution per 10mg of gel slice. Vortex and incubate at 50–65°C (we used 95°C as the agar didn't melt at 60°C) until gel slice is completely dissolved.
B. Processing PCR Amplifications
1. Add an equal volume of Membrane Binding Solution to the PCR amplification.
Binding of DNA
1. Insert SV Minicolumn into Collection Tube.
2. Transfer dissolved gel mixture or prepared PCR product to the Minicolumn assembly. Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
3. Centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard flowthrough and reinsert Minicolumn into Collection Tube.
Washing
4. Add 700μl Membrane Wash Solution (ethanol added). Centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard flowthrough and reinsert Minicolumn into Collection Tube.
5. Repeat Step 4 with 500μl Membrane Wash Solution. Centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 5 minutes.
6. Empty the Collection Tube and recentrifuge the column assembly for 1 minute with the microcentrifuge lid open (or off) to allow evaporation of any residual ethanol.
Elution
7. Carefully transfer Minicolumn to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.

When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template, via property, attribute, style, class binding, or interpolation, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values.
About UI
​ In order to match our frontend framework perfectly, we choose Ng-zorro, which is written in TypeScript with complete defined types as our UI framework. The high-quality components and style of Ng-zorro help us complete our design quickly and provides a better experience.                         ​ As a design system for enterprise-class products, Ng-zorro reduces the cost of redundant production through modular solutions based on deterministic and natural design values. With its simple and efficient design concept, NG-zorro allows designers to focus on better User experience.                         ​ Unlike Bootstrap’s 12 grid system, Ng-zorro use 24 grids system, so our web page has more detailed detail processing. Referring to Bootstrap responsive design, Ng-zorro has richer responsive choices to adapt to screens of different sizes.
About Editor
​ Drag and drop function Plugin Sortable is applied to Editor. Sortable is a minimalistic instrument for sorting elements within a list or between lists. Its library doesn’t depend on jQuery or other libraries; it uses native HTML5 Drag and Drop API, and works on both desktop and touch devices. It works on both desktop and touch devices well.

Getting London teams ready for iGEM
Click here to learn more about our joint organised London iGEM Bootcamp
This June University College London , Birkbeck and London Biohackspace attended a jointly organised iGEM boot camp featuring BioBrick making in the lab, presentations from key iGEM team advisors as well as Skype talks with iGEM Headquarters representatives, DIY spectrophotometers, wiki design and extra lab skills.
The DIY track group assembled a functional spectrophotometer at the London Biohackspace using 3D printed components, while the Software track group learnt          the basic progrsmming required in developing the iGEM wiki and submitting BioBricks to the registry. Finally, the extra lab group received insights into          the most efficient cutting edge cloning technologies relevant to iGEM work.

Will people be able to diagnose themselves in the future? According to the QS movement, a key contemporary trend emerging in big data science [1], they can. The QS movement involves integrating technology in people’s lives, aiming to gather information about themselves and learn from this.
Quantified Self: Self-knowledge through self-tracking with technology
As Mantis is highly modular and easy to use, it could be used as a novel tool to measure your own condition in many ways. We followed several lectures of experts in the QS field and collaborated with students of Nutrition and Health Science within Wageningen University & Research to explore the possibilities and needs. We attended evening lectures on the subject by prof. dr. Wijnand IJsselsteijn and PhD Student Marjolein Lanzing from TU Eindhoven. We learned that for our device to be used as QS tool, it should be:
Robust and reliable
Available and suitable for a wide diversity of users
Connected to health care services
We educated Nutrition and Health Science students of Wageningen University & Research that were attending the specialization course ‘Quantified Self: Monitoring Dietary Behaviour’ on our project. After a visit and interview they made some suggestions on how Mantis can be improved to fulfill the QS requirements:
Mantis can be connected to GPS or internet for large scale data collection (Big Data)
Mantis can be extended to measure several things simultaneously
Read more about how we implemented this in our design!
They presented our case and their suggestions to their fellow students via a poster presentation.

Lesson Plans
Genetic Memory Computer Lab (30 minutes)
Aims
Understand how the genetic toggle switch works as an example of a synthetic biology system
Interpret a model of the circuit for the toggle switch built in iBioSim
Understand the importance of modelling in the context of the design test build cycle
Resources
Computer with the free software iBioSim and toggle switch model
Activities
Before starting the simulation explain the toggle switch mechanism (Figure​ ​1​) to students e.g. A toggle switch is a circuit that allows switching of 2 stable states, much like turning on and off a computer. The switch is on when cells produce green fluorescent protein output, and is flipped between states by adding different on and off chemicals. The green fluorescence output is maintained even after the on and off chemicals are removed creating genetic memory.
Figure​ ​1:​ DNA circuit for genetic toggle switch
Run the model in stochastic and deterministic modes, and vary the GFP degradation rate and promoter strength to alter GFP output (Figures 2a – d).
Figure​ ​2:​ Expected graphs a) Deterministic simulation b) Stochastic simulation c) Decreased GFP degradation rate d) Increased promoter strength
Ask students the following questions:
Look at the graph a, can you see identify when the system is on and off? What happens when you add more on chemical when the system is on?
Peaks. No change.
Compare the deterministic and stochastic models in graphs a and b? Which is better?
The deterministic model is a simplification to ignore output fluctuations due to random collisions of molecules in the cell. The deterministic model is easier to identify trends but the stochastic is more realistic of the noise in a cell.
How could you modify the circuit to get greater output (greater fluorescence)?
Increase promoter strength or decrease degradation rate of GFP modelled by graphs c and d.
Which of these introduces the most time lag?
Decreasing degradation rate.

Quantification of mRNA expression levels by RT-q-PCR
The characterization of our transfected mammalian cells showed that the two receptors containing an avidin variant are correctly expressed and translocated to the cell membrane. The biotin-presenting receptor containing the biotin-acceptor peptide, though, showed a very low fluorescence signal. As the success of the genomic integration was validated via PCR, the conclusion was made that a problem must have occurred downstream of the integration. Two likely possibilities came to mind - either a problem on the level of mRNA stability, or a problem on the level of protein folding and/or stability. In order to understand where the source of this problem was, we took a closer look at the expression levels of the different receptors by analyzing mRNA levels in comparison to each other and to the housekeeping gene (HKG) GAPDH.
For a better comparibility, we used the same amount of cells for each receptor and not only reviewed cells with stably integrated but also cells with the episomal stable receptor constucts. After extraction of the total mRNA from the cells, the quality and integrity was measured by a Bioanalyzer device. After making sure that all samples showed an RNA integrity number (RIN) above 9, indicating purity of the total mRNA, the total mRNA was converted to cDNA by a reverse transcriptase, which in a further step was then used in quantitative PCR to quantify the amount of a specific mRNA produced by the cells. For this reason two primer pairs were designed. One of them was designed to bind the exact same region in all of the three different receptor mRNAs, amplifying the same part of the receptor, thus allowing comparison. In addition, a second pair was designed to bind only to the biotin-presenting receptor, amplifying a part that is unique to it. Via this method, we wanted to observe if only one part of the mRNA is unstable or if the general mRNA level of this receptor is decreased.
For the evaluation of the raw data we used the"

Our Story
It all started with the returning of Boris Kirov to Bulgaria. Since he already has been advising the team Evry 2012 in France, he decided to create the first Bulgarian iGEM team. In the beginning of February 2016 he introduced some of his university students to the main concept of Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition. Among them was Mario Markov – the team leader. Motivated by the idea for the first Bulgarian team, taking part in the iGEM competition, they started to search for other members. They introduced iGEM to the universities and the moment for Natalie Atanasova, Evgeniya Mihaylova, Dimitar Cholakov, Petar Antov, Dzheny Pavlova, Krasiyan Nedelchev and Nikolay Krumov to join the team came. Once after the team was formed, the difficulties started to come. The biggest ones were finding a laboratory, all the money for the registration and spreading the idea for Synthetic Biology. Moving through all the media, interviews, thinking for a project idea and more members, they announced to the universities and team’s page for it.
Right after that Nikolay Gadev, Desislava Popova, Ilka Tsvetkova and Gergana Tzankova joined the team. There were a lot of people and companies, ready to help. After discussing a lot of amazing project ideas, including ‘’communicating’’ with bacteria, rocket fuel production and plastic eating protists  the big one came. It was the perfect opportunity for a prоjеct concerning one of the most valuable bacteria in yoghurt – Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus. We got familiar with a big problem during the lyophilization process of this microorganism – the fact that many cells die in the process. So we decided that We should try to solve it. However, lab work and research were not the only tasks that We had in front of us. We had to find money to support our project. We started selling T-shirts with our logo to gain money for the finals. There were"

After the first generation of software tool completed
In order to improve our software part, we had an enjoyed talk with Mr. Wu about the communication mode between team's hardware and software, especially practicability of software design. Mr. Wu fully affirmed its innovation and praised team's consciousness of social responsibility. Also he gave us his own opinions on our project. As for APP part, he gave some professional advices and technical guidance, like how to accelerate our convolution neural network recognition speed with collected increasing number of images cases, and how to link block them up between chain technology public health service database to serve the public better. It's key point for us to develop and improve our software that we want to combine specific functions with advanced tool like AI. In addition, as an outstanding entrepreneur, Mr. Wu gave us a lot of advice, from his early experience, on product promotion and profit model.
During the characterization stage:
After the final generation product of Fang
As we imaged, we want to apply our hardware among grass-root medical center in the future. So we visited Health Service Center of Datong Street to learn about the development of tumor markers detection work in primary hospitals from President Zhan. We found that primary hospitals were mostly able to carry out screening on only one kind of basic tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein (AFP). If people want to carry out more systematic and specific tumor screening, they had to be referred to higher-level hospitals. What's more, due to the implementation effect of Chinese medical security system and Xiamen's health policy, the screening of tumor markers at the grassroots-level health center could save about 50% of the cost compared with the large hospitals, which is beneficial for people to have cancer detection on regular. It also met our vision about the social role of our hardware. Therefore, to sum up, president Zhan affirmed the future prospects of our instruments, believing it would solve problems such as ""difficult access to medical services"" in real life, to better provide more convenient medical and health services.
Before we design the Business Plan
In order to learn about startup and operate a company in medical field, we visited Mr. Su. He shared with us his experience of setting-up a new company, and rendered us prepared for drawing up business plans.

Most likely, the concentration of defensin in the samples used were too low to show the desired activity on the test. The same samples were used for the biofilm assay, which gave more precise and reliable data regarding the activity of defensin.
Adding Sortase and His tags to the expression construct
When attaching a His-tag and a Sortase A recognition motif (LPETGG) sequence (i.e. linker tag sequence, LT) on the 3’ end of the defensin sequence, the whole pSB1C3-T7-Def plasmid is amplified using Phusion polymerase, DefR as the reverse primer (with BamHI overhang) and SuffixF as the forward primer. The now linearized amplified plasmid with added BamHI restriction site is then double digested with BamHI and PstI and finally ligated in one step to create the pSB1C3-T7-Def-BamHI-LT construct.
Assembly, First attempt [❌]
The overhang PCR amplification of the entire plasmid was unsuccessful. There many unspecific bands at smaller sizes on the gel after electrophoresis, indicated a too low annealing temperature.
Further attempts would be performed at higher annealing temperatures. Also, by adding DMSO, any suspicions regarding difficulties in denaturing the template plasmid, will be eliminated.
Assembly, Second Attempt [✔️]
By increasing the annealing temperature and adding DMSO, the overhang PCR amplification resulted in a clear band at the expected size of 2273 bp with only a few extremely faint unspecifc bands (see Figure 9, well 7). These were neglected and the sample was used for digestion with subsequent ligation with the linker-tag (LT) sequence. The restriction sites of both the linearized plasmid (amplification product) and the LT sequence were located on the very ends of the DNA strands. Thus, no gel electrophoresis was performed to analyse the digestion product since the size of the digested construct would be impossible to compare with the undigested for drawing any conclusions on whether the digestion was successful or not. The digestion product of the two sequences were instead PCR purified and directly ligated.

The Idea
When one observes moths behavior, they apparently move with erratic flight paths. This is possibly to avoid predators. This random flight is modified by the presence of sex pheromones. Since these are pheromones released by females in order to attract an individual of the opposite sex, it makes sense that males respond to gradients of sex pheromone concentration, being attracted towards the source. As soon as a flying male randomly enters into a conical pheromone-effective sphere of sex pheromone released by a virgin female, the male begins to seek the female following a zigzag way. The male approaches the female, and finally copulates with her [1].
Approximation
In Sexy Plant we approximate the resulting moth movement as a vectorial combination of a gradient vector and a random vector. The magnitude of the gradient vector depends on the change in the pheromone concentration level between points separated by a differential stretch in space. More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope of the graph in that direction. The random vector is constrained in this ‘moth response’ model by a fixed angle upper bound, assuming that the turning movement is relatively continuous.  For example, one can asume that the moth cannot turn 180 degrees from one time instant to the next.
Our synthetic plants are supposed to release enough sexual pheromone so as to be able to saturate moth perception. In this sense the resulting moth vector movement will depend ultimately on the pherom"

We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has two chains, A-B-C and D-E-F. A, B, C bind with D, E, F, respectively. The products are A and C. First we mix chains and trees. Chain A-B-C will not appear in the mixture. Since node B does not appear in mixed chains, tree with nodes B and E will be removed in the trim process. Because part C and F, A and D, are both bound to nodes, the final product should contain A and B both after split processing.
In the example above, there is only one product finally though two product templates are defined in database. What compartment does the product locate in if the two product templates locate in different compartments? A reasonable solution is to halve the quantities of the product and add it into both compartments. Another problem is that the corresponding reverse reaction would never be found because it fails to match two templates to only one species. The source of the two problems is essentially the same: how to describe intra-molecular reactions in framework of MoDeL language definitions. At present, it is not supported. However, supporting intra-molecular reactions is one of our future plans to refine our MoDeL language.

Fluid model
I Introduction
    The system we designed involves many kinds of relationships between populations and individuals. To help us understand these relationships better, we designed models to describe how the amount of E.coli and substance change with time.
    Concretely, to consider population interactions in a fluid environment, we designed a fluid model based on ODE. The system we considered here has no substance exchange except for some gas, which is, however, not considered in our model.
    What's more, we can use this model to help us design our experiment. (See more details at Improved gene circuit and Regulation of killing ability )
    Furthermore, we found that it will be much easier to consider the effects of some factors (Like the initial number of each populations) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---Fluid E.coli War based on our fluid model to satisfy our needs. What's more, the game can also help us realize educational purpose of our project and make public know more about synthetic biology! ( Exhibition at National Museum )
    Our game is made on the structure of html5. The small video below is Fluid E.coli War.
    See more details on Fluid E.coli War .

Data Sheet App
The 2012 BostonU team began working on a standardized data sheet to document and present relevant information and data for Parts.
This year, we decided to expand upon last year’s data sheet by collaborating with the Purdue Biomakers iGEM Team .  Purdue contacted many iGEM teams around the world and asked them for their input on the content to include on the data sheet.  After talking with the Purdue team and our computational mentors, Jenhan Tao and Evan Appleton, we decided upon what data to include in the app and designed the format of the data sheet based on last year’s prototype and the results from Purdue’s surveys. We determined two types of data sheets - one for Basic Parts and the other for Composite Parts - and below shows our vision for the final products.
Basic Part Data Sheet
Composite Part Data Sheet
We plan to make a web-based application that will allow the user to input information about their part, experimental methods, and results, including images and hyperlinks.  The web app will compile all of that data and results into an HTML file for the data sheet.
Here is a demo of our datasheet app:

Failed to load tracking. JS is probably not enabled
Background
Controlling the movement of our E. coli was essential for tracking down the pathogen. We chose to do so by controlling the expression of cheZ, a gene in the chemotactic pathway of E. coli. Without it, E. coli is immotile.
System design
A construct with an RBS, a promoter and cheZ was created and inserted into a cheZ-knockout strain to see if motility could be restored. In a later stage, cheZ was to be coupled with our Sensing system.
Result
We used a swarm plate assay to assess if motility had been restored. Motility was successfully restored in multiple strains. Extent of swarming seemed to vary with promoter strength.

Movement and Chemotaxis
Chemotaxis is the cells system for directed movement which allows the cell to move towards nutrition sources as well as away from toxic substances. The chemotactic system is a complex chain of phosphorylation reactions. At the end of the chain is the flagellum-binding protein CheY. The phosphorylated CheY (CheY-p) binds the flagella and causes the cell to tumble in place, essentially remaining imm"

Overview
To develop a multi STI-sensor based on aptamers, we first needed to study the necessary biomolecules for the scaffold of the device, and then the interactions between the biomarkers and the nucleic acid sequences. To overcome the lack of time and resources, required to make RMN or X-ray studies, we used Structural Bioinformatics.
Prediction of 3D structure of the proteins  allowed us to enhance the Cellulose Binding power of our constructs (RFP_CBD, Streptavidin_CipA…) and to properly display the His-Tag to purify the Hepatitis B biomarker HBsAg. Moreover, the aptamer structure modeling, coupled to the modelisation of the aptamers/target interactions allowed us to select the best aptamer to bind to HBsAg.
Homology modeling of chimeric proteins with Cellulose Binding Domain
As we wanted to know the 3D structure of our chimeric proteins (RFP_CBDs, Streptavidin_CBDs and Streptavidin_CipA), we used homology modeling. To do so, we needed appropriate templates for each domain (RFP, Streptavidin, CBDs or CipA). These templates were obtained by a PSI-BLAST against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the NCBI server. The selection was based on the identity, alignment, e-values, sequence coverage and resolution of the structure. For the RFP domain we chose 2H5Q[1], Streptavidin 4BX6[2] and for the various CBDs 4JO5[3] and 1NBC[4].
Then we used the software Rosetta[5], and the webservers I-TASSER[6] and RaptorX[7]. We obtained a total of"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," can reside for a certain period of their lifecycle in a cell in a vacuole so they are quite inaccessible to the action of the antibiotic.
    This is why you treat a chlamydial infections with antibiotics you will usually see a drop in infectivity for quite some time and in the short term the antibiotic seems to work, but what it does is just preventing the replication for a while and then, as the antibiotic can be administered for a long time, so when the time is over the chlamydia are still there, because they can survive intracellularly or in other forms so they can recover after the antibiotic is gone. So you will see a resurgence and a repeated infection can occur or at least the level of chlamydia load can be the same after the treatment. This is why in some cases you have to use antibiotics for treatment, to save the patient, but as a rule it will not eradicate the pathogen, it will still be there.
Daniel C.:
On the way here we read an abstract of your paper about chlamydia in poultry. Can you elaborate? What are the risks?
Prof. Sachse:
For poultry one can say that the prevalence of chlamydia is generally high in the poultry flocks and you can't get rid of them using antibiotics, as I just said. But again given the current practises of poultry productions and hygienic standards that are better than 100 years ago, there are not so many acute outbreaks anymore. It's just a case of the bacteria being there and being a constant threat for zoonotic transmission, because in birds there will usually be Chlamydia psittaci which is a health risk for human workers in the flocks. Additionally the presence of chlamydia is an economic factor because of the lowering of the performance due to subclinical infections, this is the same as with other animals. There is still another novel discovery from the last few years that needs to be mentioned.
    Until three years ago people thought that Chlamydia psittaci was the only pathogen present in birds and poultry, but now we know that there are at least three different chlamydiae like Chlamydia psittaci and Chlamydia gallinacea which is mainly in poultry and Chlamydia avium which is present in parrots and pigeons. So the spectrum of the pathogens is more complex that it was thought previously.
Daniel C.:
Going back to human pathogenity. In the beginning we were saying, not a lot of people know [about] chlamydia"

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," was not compatible with e-coli and was therefore inserted in yeast. One chance to built one complete organism for degradation, transport and metabolism is that all groups switch to yeast. Like described earlier synthetic built bacteria are not able to survive in nature. If they should, they need pathogenic factors and a new receptor for the output transfer of synthesized amino acids. In the next stage possible application areas are discussed which might be realistic in the nearer future.
b) Technical area of application
b1) Utilization in a defecator
Concepts of how to apply the produced bacteria in defecators are currently researched together with students of environmental sciences at the Technical University.  The purification of drinking water concentrates on removing biological degradation products. Many chemical substances such as PET, drugs or hormones cannot be absorbed by most defecators and are found in rivers or even drinking water (Esperanza (2006)).  As outlined in discourse part 2, these substances can be harmful to health and interfere the fragile endocrine system of humans and animals.  The group in Darmstadt is working on the decomposition of PET while other groups who attend iGEM this year generate micro-organisms to degrade hormones, like the group from Bielefeld. The idea is to construct a defecator that uses different synthetically produced bacteria to filter the harmful substances from the water and thus reduce the burden of man and nature.  At the current level of the project you would construct the bacterium so it can absorb Terephtalat and process it to Catechol which would be excreted by a transporter. The fission of PET would be possible by prefixing a tank in which PET would be segregated by a Cutinase. The use of Hiq Cutinase, which has its optimum at 80° Celsius, would be more efficient. No new organism is needed at this point, the cleaned up enzyme will do.  The water containing the dissolved components would be carried to another tank containing the bacteria, after being cooled down to 40° Celsius. An outdoor basin would not be practical because of the fragility of the bacteria, which does not survive variation of temperature. The discarded Catechol would crystallize and could easily be skimmed. Catechol is toxic, so only water free of Catechol may be recycled to the water circuit.
b2) Valorization of waste
Items made of PET can be recycled if they are properly disposed. But in every recycling process, the quality of the PET decreases. After several processes, it can only be used for example for clothes."
TEC-Costa_Rica,2016,Team:TEC-Costa Rica#Project#System#Signaling_-_-_TEXT.html," interaction between the split inteins. According to Chen et al. (2013) flexible linkers are usually used to provide a degree of movement and thus allow a better interaction between the linked peptide sequences. This linker has already been used in iGEM to fuse proteins and is part of the repository.
Design
We designed the insertions as gBlocks. Both of them are flanked with BbsI recognition sequences that generate an overhang complementary to the insertion spots in the dCas9. Also, the insertions contain the sequences around the hotspots that the dCas9 lacks.
The first insertion consists on an Ssp DnaB C-intein flanked by a 2x (GGGS) linker, the sequences were obtained from the following Bio-Bricks: BBa_K1362251 and BBa_K1486003. The second insertion contains two 2x (GGS) that flank a Ssp DnaB N-intein followed by a N-Terminal split TEV, a Histag, a Npu DnaE N-intein and another Ssp DnaB N-intein. The sequences were based on the undermentioned Bio-Bricks: Bba_ K1486003, Bba_ K1362408, BBa_K1159101, BBa_K844000 and BBa_K1362400.
Also, we designed two BioBricks to test the cleavage activity of the split inteins we used in the insertions. The first Biobrick consists of a histag followed by a red fluorescent protein (RFP), an Ssp DnaB N-intein and a double terminator. The sequences were obtained from the following BioBricks: BBa_K844000, BBa_E1010, and BBa_B0010. This first BioBrick we designed was then assembled with an IPTG inducible promoter (Bba_R0010) and a RBS Elowitz.
The second BioBrick contains the complementary Ssp DnaB C-intein with a histag and a double terminator. For this design we used the following BioBricks from the iGEM repository: BBa_K1362251, BBa_K844000 and BBa_B0010. We assembled this BioBrick with an Anderson Promoter J23100 and a RBS Elowitz. Both assembled complete devices were also registered as BioBricks.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," an amber stop codon (TAG) in place of the reactive Lys 31 residue (Lys31X) in SpyCatcher fused to Intimin'. For this construct to work, amberless E. coli cells also have to express pyrrolysyl tRNA (pyIT/tRNAPylCUA) (BBa_K1223014) and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (BBa_K1223013) and the UAA, Ne-methyl-L-lysine, must be supplemented in the media (see Figure 2). The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase catalyses the acylation of the suppressor tRNACUA with the UAA. During translation, the UAG amber codon in the mRNA is recognized by the acylated tRNACUA and the UAA will be added to the growing polypeptide chain. The orthogonality of this system has shown to work in both E. coli and mammalian cells [5,6].
Figure 7: Photocaging mechanism in E. coli cells. Amberless cells must be transformed with plasmids encoding tRNA-Pyl, Pyrrolysyl-tRNA Synthetase and the target protein with an amber codon at the position where the photocaged lysine residue (Ne-methyl-L-lysine) is to be introduced. Figure adapted from Mitra N. (2013).
Experimental design
Amberless E. coli cells harbouring plasmids for the expression of pyIT (BBa_K2332003), pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (BBa_K1223013) and the photocaged intimin’-SpyCatcher (BBa_K2332015) would have either been mixed with cells constitutively expressing Intimin’-SpyTag (BBa_K2332050) or mixed with WT cells (control) or not mixed and exposed to UV light (365nm) for 25min-1hr or not exposed and then passed through a particle sizer with a range of aperture sizes (0.4µm - 40µm) to compare aggregate sizes.
As secondary experiments and for visual purposes we would have also incubated cells expressing Intimin’-SpyTag with purified photocaged GFP-SpyCatcher, photocaged Intimin’-SpyCatcher with purified GFP-SpyTag and Intimin-GFP-SpyTag with photocaged Intimin-SpyCatcher cell lines pre and post photo-lysis (365nm) for 25min-1"

This need for pure food naturally originated partly from several years of unsatisfactory food and health concerns JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. , and partly from a political fiction: The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset & Dunlap,; 1906 1906. .  The readers became aware of unsanitary practices in the American food industry. Sinclair was considered a whistleblower, having exposed the practices of the food industry. After the act of 1906, we can observe a rise in concerns over the purity of food, which in turn lead to a focus on maintaining a certain standard in foods. Over time, this concern became the driving force behind the development of pesticides, and to a certain extent, GMO. With the introduction of these solutions to food purity, a new and opposite response could quickly be observed in the public. With pesticides and GMO, the public quickly grew concerned that food would be unnatural, and thus we can observe what is known as a reverse halo effect Konnikova M. The Psychology of Distrusting G.M.O.s. THE NEW YORKER. 2013. .  A reverse halo effect is defined by the unconscious creation of a negative assumption based on a positive evaluation. In this case, the positive evaluation, would be the ensured purity and health benefits of GMO foods, where the negative assumption would be the concerns for unnaturalness.
So we detect a tendency in the public to follow a reverse halo effect, which is most often associated with GMO foods. The problem we face today, is the continuation of this reverse halo effect, where the public would receive any GMO device negatively, simply by association to the word GMO. So how do we change this dynamic between GMO and the public?
The conclusion we reached was that in order to change a tendency in public opinion, it was important to educate the coming generations on the possibilities of GMO. Another important aspect seemed to be a general perception of GMO as an unnatural element that would harm both humans and nature alike. As such, we wanted to illustrate how GMO could be used, not to harm nature, but to help lead it towards a more sustainable future. So, we set out to teach children of all ages about GMO in general, as well as about our own"
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#testtest_-_-_TEXT.html," the bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.
DspB ( BBa_K1659200 ) is an enzyme produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a species of bacteria found in the human oral cavity that grows almost exclusively in the form of biofilms. Structural analysis of Dispersin B showed that the enzyme only works specifically against the β-1,6-glycosidic linkages found in poly-N-acetylglucosamine, which is a polysaccharide structural element found in the biofilms of E. coli but not in P. aeruginosa. An additional enzyme would need to be used to target the polysaccharide component of P. aeruginosa biofilms.
Micrococcal DNase ( BBa_K1659300 ) is an endo-exonuclease that non-specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of single- and double-stranded DNA under basic conditions and in the presence of Ca2+ ions, and is known to be able to speed up DNA hydrolysis by up to 1016 times [ 17 ]. We are using DNase to break down the extracellular DNA component of biofilms.
Killing the Bacteria
Although antibiotic resistance is not absolute, it does pose a very big threat to the effective treatment of many infections. The insensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics can also be attributed to increasing antibiotic resistance. As described above, antibiotics also have many side effects that reduce patient quality of life and decrease the likelihood of completing a course of antibiotics. With all of this in mind, our solution does not only break down the biofilm, but also kills the bacteria embedded within so as to provide an alternative to antibiotics.
Art-175
Art-175 ( BBa_K1659000 ) derive their name from “artificial endolysins”. Endolysins are bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases that pass through the cytoplasmic membrane, degrading the peptidoglycan layer and inducing the lysis of the infected cell.

MccS ( BBa_K1659100 ) is a type of microcin, a subclass of antibacterial proteins known as bacteriocins.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
Dr. Trushar Patel
I joined the Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute at the University of Lethbridge as an Assistant Professor in 2016 and the iGEM Lethbridge team in 2017. My laboratory is focusing on understanding the recognition events between viral nucleic acids and host proteins that results in up-regulation of viral replication. I am very excited to be a part of an iGEM team and learn more about advances in synthetic biology and apply synthetic biology approaches, in combination with biochemical and biophysical techniques to achieve our goals.

Note: surprisingly no over night growth of the cultures was observed in M9 minimal medium containing glucose. This a larger volume of inoculate (in LB) was used for a second stab at over night growth in M9.
Plasmid purification of overnight cultures carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 in pSB1A3 was performed using the Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid isolation kit yielding sufficient plasmid DNA. These BioBricks can in future be placed under control of a low to medium copy number plasmid for comparison with high copy-number plasmid expression.

If it is on the list, you have to follow the steps to prevent diffusions that are prescribed and start using GMMs. Then, you have to report using situations and you will get inspections and orders. If the GMM is not on the GILSP list, you have to fill in a diffusion prevention measures sheet and send it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Once those measures are approved, you will follow the same steps above.

It is forbidden to commercialise GMOs, the only way to establish a business with them is to export seeds. This is only allowed once an environmental impact study regulated by the National Service of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) has been undertaken.
Indonesia
The certificate issued from the 4 ministries mentioned above after being assessed by The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety as proof that the GMMs have fulfilled the main requirements for biosafety which include Environmental Safety, Food Safety, and Feed Safety. To fulfill the Environmental Safety, the GMMs need to have clear information regarding the description and objective of use, the detected phenotypic and genotypic changes, the taxonomical identity, the physiology and reproduction, the inserted gene origin, the genetic engineering method adopted, the molecular characteristic, the product of gene expression, and the method to destruct the GMMs when any disruptions happen. To fulfill the Food and Feed Safety, the GMMs need to have clear information regarding the genetic engineering method adopted, the nutritional (includes the protein, carbohydrate, fat, amino acid, fatty acid, minerals, and vitamins) content of the GMMs have to be substantially similar with the non-GMMs, the content of any toxic substance and allergens have to be substantially similar with the non-GMMs, the protein product expressed by the gene need to be non-allergenic.
Korea
For the usage of the GMOs, an individual has to submit the examination application form for Biosafety, with 4000 dollars of examination fee, to the Ministry that is in charge of the usage. Which means, if you are willing to use the GMOs related to agriculture, it is the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs that you have to submit the application to. The examination of the GMO is done in two different aspects. One is the human body risks and the other is the environmental risks. The Ministry of Korea Centers for Disease Control and prevention proceeds the former test, and Three institutes, including The Ministry of Environment, Rural Development Administration, and National Fisheries Research & Development Institute proceeds the"

m(i)= μ1+N(0,σ1);
n(i)= μ2+N(0,σ2);
μ1 and μ2 are the average ability of generating 30C6HSL and 3012CHSL, and normal distribution-- N(0,σ)--describes the fluctuations of AHL generating rate in individual cell. We then expanded our equations from 2 cells to a population of cells. Each cell share a mutual environment in which we assume that AHL in environment is proportionally distributed.
The figures indicate that our system can oscillate synchronically being able to tolerate differences at certain range among a population of cells.
We also tested whether the oscillation is dependent on initial distribution of AHL by changing the initial amount drastically by letting them follow uniform distribution. That is:
Initial(i)= U(0,20);
Based on this distribution restraining the initial AHL concentration in each cell, we simulated out a figure as follows.
The results demonstratively give evidence proving that our system can start to oscillate synchronically given variant initial starting status.

Measurement
Wavelength scan reading for the iron standard. The most highly concentrated reading is in the front and the lowest in the back. For each concentration in the standard, the highest peak corresponds to the wavelength at which iron absorbs the most light.
Standard curve reading for iron. After the wavelength with the highest absorbance across the board is determined, the number is used to again measure each concentration in the standard to produce an equation for which to apply the soil sample readings.
Soil sample iron concentrations. The absorbance of each sample is read by the spectrophotometer and a concentration is determined by the standard curve equation for iron.
Standard preparation
Run chemical past health and safety board, if approved, calculate molar ratio of ion in solution. Determine the proper chemical stand-in for the ionic compound in question. Ideally this is a chemical which has only one of the compounds per molecule (example: if chloride ion is being tested, prefer NaCl over CaCl2 as the standard material.)
Wavelength sweep
An absorption spectrum reading is performed to determine the wavelength that matches each nutrient’s standard gradient. Using MetaSpec Pro’s UV/VIS spectrophotometer and software, the wavelength profile of each standard is measured from 780nm to 380nm and analyzed in Excel to determine their sensitivity to a particular wavelength. In the “Wavelength Scan” feature, parameters are set as follows:
Concentration units – ppm
Display mode – Absorbance
Start wavelength – 780
End wavelength – 380
Wavelength Interval(nm) – 1.0
Scan times – 21
The machine is then zeroed with the nutrient standard cuvette labeled “0”. The wavelength scan is performed for each cuvette in the nutrient’s standard by first wiping down the cuvette, shaking or vortexing it, then placing it into the spectrophotometer and immediately hitting “start”. After the readings for all 21 of the cuvettes in each standard are measured, the data are then exported into excel. The sum is taken of the absorbance for each wavelength then sorted from largest to smallest. The wavelength corresponding to the greatest absorbance sum is then selected to be"

Education
Popularization of Synthetic Biology
On September 19, 2018, the iGEM team of Central South University launched a bio-science project at the Excellence Bocai Primary School.
This is a school cooperation project, which was carried out by the team of Central South University and the team of Ocean University of China. We used the biology handbook prepared by Ocean University of China to give students an interesting biology lesson. In the class,students showed a strong interest in biology. At the same time, it can be noted that the comics about biology drawn by Ocean University of China are very attractive to students. Chaoyang and Xiao Jiayu answered the questions raised by the students and let everyone know about biology. This is a very socially significant event.
Through this activity, we let primary school students who have never understood biology learn more about biology.As we all know, interest is cultivated in childhood. Moreover, primary school students are at an early age, and at this age they have a strong curiosity and a strong interest in everything. Therefore, if we use such popular science activities and appropriate textbooks, such as textbooks prepared by Ocean University of China, we can cultivate children's interest in biology. Now, in China, there are many people who are afraid of these words such as genetic modification, synthetic biology. Because they believe that genetically modified foods endanger their health, those foods are not safe. They are afraid that synthetic biology will harm our lives. The reason they are afraid of genetically modified foods is that they don't understand what synthetic biology is. So we think that in the form of a science class, we let children have a correct understanding of synthetic biology and let them share their knowledge to their parents. We believe that doing so will eliminate people's fear of synthetic biology and let them know that synthetic biology is good for our lives. As college students, we believe that we have an obligation to promote this knowledge.
Apart from what I mentioned before,through our social activities, we have found a good way for children to understand biological knowledge that is difficult to understand.The reason why few people teach primary school students about genetics is that knowledge about gene is difficult for primary school students to understand and makes them bored.We found that if we use cartoon characters, children will not be bored. And the manual organizes each biological process into an interesting story that"

14th, Jul
Today, the summer semester ends and the biological experiment comes. As we are green-hands in the field of biology, everyone feels very disturbed. Doctor Chen encourages us to cheer up and teaches us how to transform. After one and a half hour, we finally get it. We successfully finish the transformation of B0034!
15th, Jul
Today, we continue to do cell transformation. We get our medium of B0034 from incubator. Unfortunately, we find that there is nothing in the medium. I am very sad, but our captain encourages us to try again. We manage to do it with the rest B0034 in the kit. After one hour, the assignment today is completed. We wish that our effort wouldn't be in vain.
16th, Jul
The transformation of B0034 proves to be a success. Everyone here is excited and ready to finish the transformation of C0079, B0015, R0079, J23116 and J37034.At the same time, we contact Doctor Chen and tell him the exciting news. He congratulates us and promise to teach us the procedure of shaking bacteria.
17th, Jul
Today, we learn how to pick the right colonies that we need and the protocol of shaking bacteria. After some practice, we learn the point of this step, and quickly finish our work (including B0034, C0079, B0015, R0079, J23116 and J37034) today.
18th, Jul
Doctor Chen teaches us the protocol of plasmid extraction. Compared with the experiments we have done before, plasmid extraction is really a big problem. To finish plasmid extraction, there are eleven steps that we have to do. The work takes us more than one and a half hours. With the help of Doctor Chen, we finally finish the extraction of B0034,C0079,B0015,R0079,J23116 and J37034.

MCL1: Cockroaches have powerful immune system. If there is no effective response, our chassis won't be recognized and killed by host hemocytes. The MCL1 gene from Metarhizium Robertsii can encode collagen-like protein, which binds and masks β-1,3-glucan (an antigen that can be recognized by hemocytes), thus Metarhizium anisopliae can escape the immune response of cockroaches[4].
How to ensure safety?
We designed a suicide switch for our system. It consists of tryptophan attenuator and MazF.Tryptophan attenuator will be switched on in high trp concentration,while it will be switched off on the contrary . MazF is a kind of toxic protein。 To make it expressed in our chassis,we added a Kozak sequence （In eukaryotic cells, efficient transcription initiation is dependent on a sequence called kozak surrounding the initiation codon ATG. Equivalent to the SD sequence in prokaryotes.）in  front of these two parts. We create a high  Tryptophan concentration environment while we are culturing the fungus, and average concentration of Trp inside cockroach hemolymph is about 0.15%[5]. In those environment, the Tryptophan attenuator forms a hairpin structure that stop transcription ahead of MazF, so that fungus can keep alive. If the fungus live in the low tryptophan environment , the suicide switch will be turned on and the MazF starts to express,which leads to death of fungus.

2. Expression of CysDes
We inoculate 2 mL overnight culture to 200 mL LB media (1mM cysteine, 30mM glucose and 10mM HEPES are included) and cultivate for 2h at 37 ˚C. When OD600 reaches 0.4-0.6, add AHL to final concentration of 250nM. After 3h cultivation, collect the bacteria by centrifugation. Then extract the raw enzyme of CysDes by ultrasonication. We run SDS-PAGE of samples of raw enzyme, cell content obtained by 100 ˚C heating and wild type (shown in Figure 2). The protein CysDes is about 46kDa, we can find obvious bands at the about position of 45kDa which are unique to lanes of cell contents after induction and raw enzyme compared with the wild type. Although there are proteins of similar molecular weight in wild type, darker bands in experiment group meaning a high amount of proteins could prove the existence of high amount of CysDes. From the result of SDS-PAGE, we could confirm the expression of CysDes.

3. Growth curve of E.coli(BL21) under different concentration of Cd2+
In our project, we added Cd2+, which is toxic to bacteria, to our media to generate CdS nanoparticles under the catalysis of our engineered E.coli. Considering that CysDes catalyzes the reduction of cysteine and Cd2+ is transformed to CdS precipitation to some extent, the existence of CysDes can strengthen the resistance to Cd2+. But the substrate of CysDes, cysteine, is a kind of necessary amino acids for bacterial growth. So additional cysteine may affect the metabolic pathway which may lead to the depression of bacteria's growth.
To figure out the impact of different concentration of Cd2+ and CysDes on the growth ofE.coli and determine the appropriate concentration of Cd2+ for growth, we measure OD600 as a data for bacteria concentration at various conditions and time respectively. Then we draw the scatter graph and fit the growth curve with smooth line to show the tendency of growth (shown in Figure 3).

Gene Constructions of Pantide—PCR
To ensure the genes are cloned into E. coli BL21 Rosetta-gami strain, we did electrophoresis of PCR products for checking insert gene’s length after amplification with PCR. Each of the BioBrick construction includes the conservative promoter, RBS, linker, and His-tag. Here are the theoretical length of seven BioBricks we construct.(Table 1)
After amplification with PCR, the PCE products of Hv1a, Sf1a, and OAIP have a length of around 500bp； and Hv1a-Lectin, Sf1a-Lectin, and OAIP-Lectin has a length of 750bp~1000bp； and Hv1a-Lectin with GS linker has a length of 893bp. (Figure 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 1g)
