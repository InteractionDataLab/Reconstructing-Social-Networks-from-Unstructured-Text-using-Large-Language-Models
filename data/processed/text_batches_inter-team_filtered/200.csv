Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". When this bacteriocin is secreted the immunity protein dissociates from the complex leaving the cytotoxic domain active resulting in the pore forming activity of this bacteriocin returning and having effect on the target cells. The pore forming activity of this bacteriocin results in the depolarisation of the bacterial inner membrane resulting in the collapse of the proton motive force.
Structure of colicin Ia: The three domains of colicin Ia, the cytotoxic domain: blue, the Translocation domain: red, Channel forming domain: green.
It is also ribosomally synthesised and is present in the cytoplasm when this process is complete. When this protein is present in the cytoplasm of the host cell, it always exists in a high affinity complex with its immunity protein, (this interaction has been observed to be in the femtomolar range, which makes this one of the associations observed in protein complexes). The function of this is to prevent the DNase activity of this colicin effecting the host cell.  This method of translocation occurs by the Tol system of membrane proteins as this belongs to group A. The receptor on target cells that this colicin usually makes use of in order to gain entry is the same receptor used by vitamin B12, BtuB. It is thought that when the colicin binds this receptor a change in conformation occurs resulting in the dissociation of the immunity-colicin complex.
Structure of E9: The three domains of colicin E9, the cytotoxic domain: blue, the Translocation domain: red, Channel forming domain: green.
This protein achieves its aim of killing target cells through its DNase activity. This comes from the 15kDa C-terminal domain where the DNA hydrolysis occurs. This colicin also has the ability to form ion channels in target cells lipid bilayers, similar to a pore forming colicin, however these channels do not result in death. It is believed that these ion channels have a function in allowing the DNase C-terminal domain to translocate across the membrane in order to kill the target. The operon encoding this colicin contains a lysis gene as the last gene of the operon. The function of the cxl gene is to produce a lysis protein in order to release the colicin into the extracellular medium in order to carry out its function. The lysis protein is always produced at the same time as the colicin however, in lower amounts than the colicin.

Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Recell®. This is an innovative new product made from recycled toilet paper which consists of over 90% cellulose. KNN asked us whether there is a possibility to create styrene from their product. In this manner, we can really use waste streams to create StyGreen! The company develops biomass-derived chemicals and is looking for new innovative and sustainable ways of production. GMO technology fits this profile. KNN provided us with a sample of their product for our experiments and they are very interested in our results.

NRK: Martin van Dord (24th July 2018)
NRK is the Dutch Federation of plastic and rubber converters, with 20 different sub associations and 400 member companies. We talked to Martin van Dord , innovation consultant at NRK and Topsector Chemie . According to the NRK facts and figures (2017) circa 2000 kilotonnes of plastics were used in 2017, of which circa 20 kilotonnes (1%) were bioplastics. The main problem associated with the use of bioplastics is the price, which can be up to twice as high as that of virgin plastics. In order to contribute to the goals of the Paris Agreement, the objective is to lift the market share of bioplastics to 15% in 2030. Mr. van Dord thought our project was very interesting, since we came up with a new way to produce bioplastics. However, he was wondering why we would focus so much on styrene. Why not create a new bioplastic with even better qualities? He also stated that the business case should be a part in the project in order to get a better insight in the potential of genetically manufactured or engineered bioplastics and the scale of economic feasible production facilities. NRK also published an article about us on their website
Only 1% of the plastic usage consists of bioplastics
Bioclear Earth: Jeroen Tideman (27th July 2018)
We have been in touch with employees of Bioclear Earth , who gave us great suggestions on the financial aspects of our project. Because pure cellulose is more expensive than glucose, we needed to find a cellulose-rich waste stream which we could use in our process. They came up with the idea to use recycled toilet paper, which can not be used for other purposes due to its public perception. Subsequently, they explained to us how the market for enzymes works and also connected us with various people in the market. Additionally, they told us about various parties"

Prof. Hashimoto is a project assistant professor from Institute of                                         Molecular Medicine. After the discussion with him, we found out the feasibility                                         of expressing CA in E. coli. Therefore, we decided to clone the CA gene                                         into                                         the E .coli.

Our secondary PI, Prof. Hashimoto Masayuki is a                                                 project assistant professor from Institute of Molecular Medicine.
The host organism in our project is E. coli.                                                 Prof.                                                 Hashimoto is                                                 familiar with the genetic manipulation of E. coli, therefore we                                                 introduced our idea to him. One of his research is about the effect of                                                 carbonic anhydrase (CA) to the growth of E. coli. Since we                                                 wanted to                                                 introduce heterologous CA into the E. coli, he suggested us to                                                 consider                                                 whether it will compete with the native CA of E. coli, which                                                 might                                                 affect the function of the heterologous CA. Also, Professor Hashimoto                                                 introduced the concept of homologous recombination to us as we had the                                                 idea to insert our construction into E. coli chromosome.                                                 However, we                                                 were suggested not to do the homologous recombination due to the                                                 limited time we had.
After the discussion, we started to review journals                                                 and found out the                                                 feasibility of expressing both native and non-native CA in E. coli.                                                 We                                                 found out that there were research which expressed heterologous CA                                                 successfully. Therefore we decided to clone the CA gene into the E                                                 .coli.

In this case, the level of conservation was much lower than observed at protein level. Moreover, a logo was obtained for this nucleotide sequence range (figure 9.B), whose sequence was also translated. In this logo (as in the logo obtained for the organisms with Tn7 family transposon) the first two positions at each codon were conserved, showing a strong variation at the ‘wobble’ position. This result was expected because it corresponds to a codifying sequence. When comparing this last logo sequence with the logo sequence obtained for the sequences of organisms with the Tn7 system (figure 10) it is surprisingly the high level of similarity founded.

To help iGEM teams and developers to build, characterize and use their own exciting devices, here we provide not only the app itself, but also the complete code as Open Source:
Download Serial Client App and Sources
The application is implemented in a minimal MVVN pattern to permit efficient expansion with additional features. At the same time, the app only depends on two external libraries:
Dynamic Data Display ( license ) for live plotting of data
TCD.Controls for multiple controls and internal functionality
If you're a developer and want to modify/adapt the software to your own purpose, here you can see a dependency graph of the overall app architecture:
Overview dependency graph of the Serial Client architechture
In addition to the typical MVVM components (ViewModel, Converter, App, MainWindow), a Serial class is central to the architechture, receiving data from serial ports and forwarding it as SensorData to the ViewModel.
Essential to the MVVM pattern is the ViewModel that is shown in the following detailed dependency graph:
Detailed dependency graph of the Serial Client architechture
The ViewModel consists of public properties and RelayCommands that are required for DataBinding in the MainWindow. The methods within the ViewModel can be grouped in the categories Export, Visualization and Data Accumulation.
If you have questions on the Serial Client, please contact Michael .

Simulating Signal Analysis & Transfer Using E.coli
Our project is focusing on using the simple prokaryotes to imitate the nerve system which exists in the advanced animals widely. As we all known, the nerve system of advanced animals like human consists of 3 major parts: the receptive neurons, the central neurons, and the effector cells.
Correspondingly, we separate bacteria into 3 different communities to execute different functions and we name these 3 communities as Receptor, Transmitter, and Effector.
In details, we replace the neurotransmitter by AHL family and in the meanwhile, we construct the multiple promoter to simulate the procedure of signal receiving and processing.
In addition, for the sake of achieving the signal transmitting and analyzing, we isolate a new cell quorum sensing system—the PPYs signal pathway from photorhabdus luminescence. The mechanism of this PPYs signal pathway is similar to the AHLs pathway. The PPYs protein could catalyze the generation of ppys, a kind of small molecule which is similar to the AHL and HSL.
And then, ppys could combine with PluR protein to activate the Pppy promoter.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," genetically modified organism, particularly those used as medications. Discussions with clinicians and researchers, as well as some of the questions raised by patients and public we spoke to, encouraged us to make safety a key focus of our integrated human practices. Taking on the advice of professionals, we developed different designs of a kill switch and modeled the safety risks associated with our design.
Detailed information about our work centred around each of the four themes can be found on the respective pages of our wiki.
Overview of Integrated Human Practices
Our philosophy regarding human practices was to ensure a reciprocal relationship between our team and society, ensuring that we remain open to feedback from the public, patients and professionals. Our human practices work involved the education of the wider public about our project ideas and the broader applications of synthetic biology, as well as discussions and interviews to understand society’s opinions of our project. We acted upon the feedback we received, meaning that our project continually evolved in light of the public’s input. An important focus of our work was to ensure that ‘society’ encompassed the broadest range of individuals, so we engaged with clinicians, researchers, professionals involved in the legal and business side of drug development, patients, students and the lay public.
In this manner, our vision and plans for human practices were altered throughout the course of the project. The timeline below summarises our work for human practices and demonstrates how engaging with different individuals prompted us to take alternative pathways in the project, both in terms of human practices and the design of our therapeutic.
Timeline of Integrated Human Practices Work
First Survey
When we were first coming up with a project we involved the public by reaching out from our social media with a survey. We assessed the general awareness of genetic engineering and asked which real-world issue they believed should be the focus of our project.
The overwhelming majority of survey participants picked therapeutics as an area of priority, this influenced the development of our project into a therapeutic based idea from our initial ideas.
Patient Consultation
After deciding on which issue we should work on we came across autoimmune diseases and believed current treatments are not sufficient. To ensure this was the case we consulted patients and clinicians and asked specific problems that result from the disease and current treatments
Patient Interviews
Engaging with patients - the end-users of our product - was important for understanding the unmet patient needs that we are aiming to rectify. This gave us an insight into what features will be important in the design of the product, although it became apparent that it would be beneficial to conduct one-to-one patient interviews to gain a greater understanding of the specific impact of the disease on patients’ quality of life.

Overall - a success!
Cafe Scientifique
In early September, the team were the invited guest speakers for that month's Cafe Scientifique in Leeds. Dan and Paul prepared a 30 minute presentation about Synthetic Biology, iGEM and our project, while Oleg came along to support and answer questions. As an added safety net (or perhaps just to make sure we did things right) Professor Meldrum , Dr. Turnbull and Dr. Deacon were also in attendance, alongside 40 or so science-savvy members of the general public.
Needless to say, we did a fantastic job - don't believe us? Good thing we recorded it all. The Presentation can be viewed at our Youtube Page here and the Q&A can be viewed here.
Apologies to those wishing to view the videos on the wiki, but at over half an hour each, the file sizes are a little too large to be uploaded! Sorry! We hope you take a look anyway, if only for some of Dan's cheesy jokes.
ASMbly
The week after Cafe Scientifique, Dan and Paul gave a presentation to a group of individuals interested in setting up a DIY synthetic biology group. The presentation gave them a background into synthetic biology and our iGEM project, Paul talked through some examples and potential applications to inspire them to come up with their own project. After which Paul gave a demonstration on how to turn a digital webcam into a microscope, this is the start of setting up a home made DIY synthetic biology laboratory. It was a really great session and the start of links between the synthetic Biology researchers at the University and the wider synthetic biology community within Leeds!

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Project overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"-TetRDBD acts as an light inducible transcription repressor – at dark state, UVR8 dimer brings TetRDBD at close proximity to bind Ptet, whereas UVR8 monomerization upon UV-B light releases UVR8-TetRDBD from DNA, thus inducing transcription of the downstream genes (Fig. 3).
Figure 3: UVR8-TetRDBD working mechanism: in dark state UVR8-TetRDBD is a dimer and represses Ptet, while under exposure of UV-B light UVR8-TetRDBD releases DNA and allows transcription of a downstream genes.
Our models suggest that such system would efficiently induce production of PABA at the right time scale, giving broad possibilities for such novel UV-B switch. Also, our data shows that repression of Ptet is indeed restored for TetRDBD. Nevertheless, in order not to fully rely on newly introduced plant protein to E.coli, a second approach of indirect UV sensing was also investigated.
Figure 4: NOR gates: Boolean NOR gate representation (upper) and genomic NOR gate - promoter regulated by two repressors (bottom)
Indirect UV detection: decoding of sun light from its light spectrum
Each light source has its characteristic light emission spectrum e.g. sun contains high red and blue light content compared to artificial light sources, such as tungsten light bulb have just high red and a very small fraction of blue light. Thus, we design a biological circuit which can distinguish between four different light conditions: i) high red-high blue; ii) high red-low blue; iii) low red-high blue and iv) low red-low blue (Fig. 5). Such circuit consists of three hybrid promoters each acting as a NOR gate for two different transcriptional repressors i.e. transcription from such promoter is activated just when both repressors are absent.
We developed a novel photoinduction model to select for a suitable light receptors for the system inputs: LovTAP (blue light receptor) and Cph8 (Red light receptor). Later analysis of the circuit network revealed several kinetic parameters constrains upon which hybrid promoters were chosen and synthesized. Further testing of the promoters showed that as predicted, they act as a NOR gate, giving high potential of building a first full working light regulated biological decoder circuit in cells.

Through the survey, we realize that a majority of people have noticed recent severe plastics pollution and are not satisfied with extant disposal methods. They look forward to a better way to control the ‘white pollution’. Besides, in terms of technology of ‘white pollution’ control, most people have knew something about biological plastics degradation and think highly of it. They hope that scientists will do further research. From the survey we also notice the public consciousness of ‘white pollution’ and how urgent and necessary we should fix this problem"

Ons idee heeft eenzelfde basis maar met een interactieve rol van mensen, het idee is om dan een echt spel hiervan te maken en commandos te geven aan de kolonie bacteriën. Zo zou je bijvoorbeeld kunnen besluiten dat de bacterie kolonie zich meer moet richten op delen, of misschien dat ze zich meer moeten richten op het synthetiseren van een bepaalde aanval proteïn om de bacterie van de tegenstander weg te jagen. Op deze manier wordt het meer entertainment dan een leuk wiskundig ideetje en is het dus echt een game of life. De informatie voor de commandos kunnen dan doorgestuurd worden dmv prikkels gecodeert als een chemische stof, antilichamen, licht van een bepaalde freuquentie, etc...

This is also our hope that more and more people can learn something about transgenic products via this competition and have a better understanding of genetic engineering. After all, we, as iGEMers, should not only do experiments in laboratory, but also help synthetic biology understood by the public.
BioBang
It’s a great honor for me to introduce our attractive “byproduct”——Bio Bang. We designed these special card for these high school students who were the top ten on our scoring list. These sets of cards——we called them Bio Bang——were inspired by War Within Three Kingdoms, which are very popular in China，just like Bang！ in America. It consists of abundant role-relationship and mutual promotion and restraint between every cards. The Bio Bang is themed with synthetic biology, including genetic engineering experiments, biological materials and equipment. We’ve also assimilate knowledge of biosafety into these set of cards in order to popularize knowledge of biosafety in lab, public and environment. This kind of propaganda tool is very useful to make different knowledge about genetic engineering and biology get across to high school students. Some examples of them are shown as follows:
We’ve dreamed about perfecting the rules and designing and sold it out to raise money for our project. But it didn’t come true owing to our tight schedule. However, we decided to make a English version Bio Bang as presents for other iGEMers. Just wait for us coming!
Surveys
Surveys on The Popularization of Synthetic Biology and iGEM  in high school students of Fujian Province
Our team conducted a synthetic biology survey before our lecture entitled ""Contemporary introduction to synthetic biology"". We wanted to compare how much they knew about synthetic biology and iGEM before the lecture with what they learn from our presentation in order to assess our work. We’ve prepared 300 questionnaires and hand out 227 of them. Among these drew-back questionnaires, 180 of them are valid. We put 11 questions on the questionnaire as below.

Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018,Team:Sorbonne U Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," because of its high production costs. Indeed, the cost of production will highly increase because of the energy to bring to the photobioreactor, the extraction and the collection of sugar.
Thus, the amount of sugar expected by the use of marine surfaces could be sufficient to meet the needs of synthetic biology development but would not enable a profitable production
Yield improvement
In order to improve the yield of trehalose production, we thought about directed evolution. It aims to identify beneficial mutations on a gene or on a biosynthetic pathway. It is a major tool for synthetic biology in eukaryotes. This relies on in vitro generation of diversity. However, since C. reinhardtii can not replicate plasmids, this tool would be limited in this microalgae. Also, C. reinhardtii has a significantly lower speed of replication than the classical chassis of SynBio (Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These particularities make the in vitro generation of a large-sized library of mutants by the classical ""error-prone PCR"" used in directed evolution, more complicated.
This is why we have been interested in the team BOKU-Vienna 2017 project . To make in vivo evolution in yeast and bacteria, they proposed another solution, a model of retrotransposon. As there is no tool to make directed evolution in Chlamydomonas yet, we worked on adapting this strategy to this organism.
Since directed evolution is an important part in the development of a powerful synthetic biology chassis, we met professionals to get expertise on the subject.
The main returns we had were that it was by itself an expensive and complex subject to work on and develop. As the needs of such chassis in the industrial environment for sustainable development were clearly explained by the experts, it seemed more relevant to focus on our directed evolution tool instead of the sugar production itself.
GMOs, environment and legislation
Finally, an important part of our discussions focused on the legislation about GMOs in offshore platforms. The current legislation compels us to use a confined environment. Very interesting alternative systems for the photobioreactor design such as biocontainment measures were discussed with all the experts we met.
From the low added value of the genetically modified microalgae for the production of sugar, we knew how to use the compiled knowledge for a better valuation of our project through our retrotransposon. Indeed, our meetings with professionals brought out the interest of our retrotransposon development for fundamental research and for production of various molecules of interest in biotechnology.
In this case, the engineered microalgae would"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

8. Agarose Gel DNA Extraction
1. Agarose gel is prepared using TAE buffer or TBE buffer, then agarose gel electrophoresis is performed on the target DNA.
2. Cut the agarose gel containing the target DNA under the UV lamp and suck the liquid on the gel surface with a paper towel. At this point, we should pay attention to the removal of the gel which does not contain the target DNA, minimize the gel volume and increase the DNA recovery rate. When glue blocks exceed 300 mg, use more than one Column Recycling, otherwise seriously affecting the yield. Note: when cutting, please be careful not to expose the DNA to UV light for a long time to prevent DNA damage.
3. Shredding the gel block. When the adhesive block is chopped up, the dissolution time of the block in the operation step 6 can be accelerated, and the DNA recovery rate can be improved.
4. Weighing the weight of the glue block and calculating the volume of the glue block. When calculating the volume of the block, 1mg=1μL is used to calculate.
5. Buffer GM are added into the gel block, and the amount of solution Buffer GM.
6. After mixing evenly at room temperature 15-25 degrees C dissolve glue block (glue concentration is more difficult to dissolve and can be heated at 37 C). At this point should be interrupted oscillation mixing, so that the block fully dissolved (about 5~10 minutes). Note: the block must be fully dissolved, otherwise it will seriously affect the recovery rate of DNA. High concentration gel can prolong the time appropriately.
7. When the gel is completely dissolved, observe the solution color, if the solution color changed from yellow to orange or pink, add 3 M sodium acetate solution to the rubber block solution (pH5.2) 10μL, mixed solution to restore yellow. When the DNA fragment is less than 400bp, the isopropanol with a final concentration of 20% should be added to the solution.
8. Place the Spin Column in the reagent kit on the Collection Tube.
9. Transfer the solution of the operation step 7 to the Spin Column with 12000 rpm centrifugation for 1 minutes, filtrate rejection. Note: if the filtrate is added to the Spin Column to be centrifuged once, it can be improved DNA recovery rate.
10. Add 700μL Buffer WB to Spin Column at room temperature 12000 rpm"

Sugarfilm
Background
As a naturally formed immobilizing structure of bacteria, biofilm outstands in many ways such as the ability to withstand considerable degree of environmental fluctuation, the possibility for more efficient cell-cell communication as well as cooperation, and the stratified structure which may function greatly in phase-related synthetic processing. With this understanding and beyond, 2011 ZJU-China iGEM team tried to explore more about the potential of biofilm in applications.
Introduction
  Cellulose utilization for renewable bio-material production (especially bio-fuel production) has been a heated research interest for quite a long time. Due to the structural complexity and poor permeability of cellulose, a big obstacle for enzymatic break-down process, progress in promoting the utilization efficiency is slow.
  Considering this problem with the advantage of biofilm as a reactor system, we believe the employment of biofilm and its stratified feature would help to surmount such obstacle.
  Firstly, Sugarfilm, a three-layer biofilm-based expression system, is designed to directly attach to the surface of substrate (for instance, a sheet of cellulose debris). In this way, the distance between our “degradation engine” (E.coli cells) and the targeted substrate would be reduced greatly, laying the foundation of a more efficient system.
  Two main cellulases involved in the first step of degradation, Cex (Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase, <a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K118022 "">BBa_K118022</a> , iGEM08_Edinburgh) together with CenA (Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase A, <a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K118023 "">BBa_K118023</a> , iGEM08_Edinburgh) will be expressed in the bottom layer of biofilm (as described in the “Design”  part below in detail). Therefore, the secreted enzymes would get in touch with the substrate instantly.
  In the next step, the preliminary products cellubiose from the first layer would diffuse to the middle layer of Sugarfilm due to concentration gradient. Beta-glucosidase BglX (from Cytophaga h"

All the LMWP-linked proteins successfully penetrated the stratum corneum and accumulated primarily in the epidermis (Figure 2), whereas the control proteins without LMWP linkage remained on the surface of the skin."" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p.2725
Nina: This experiment is good in the way that it shows that big protein shuch as BSA (66 kDa) and OVA (45 kDa)fused with CPP can pass via skin.
“Since small basic proteins like protamines are precipitated by SDS, as an assay method we used acidic gels in which basic proteins migrate not only according to their size but also according to their charge. Thus, although small basic proteins can be identified in acidic gels, size calibration of these proteins is not accurate. Identification of specific proteins can be made by using deletion or other mutants to eliminate or change the nature of these proteins.” - An E. coli Gene Coding for a Protamine-Like Protein
Nina: I found this article since I wanted to know more about bacteria expressing protamines and their practical studies. So maybe think about using acidic gels when characterizing protamines, such as in our CPP.
“[...] that can code for a small basic protein directs the synthesis of such a protein in vitro. (We now define the P-protein coding region as the tpr locus for “tRNA followed by protamine-like protein.“) Mutants that lack part of the DNA region coding for the protein fail to direct its synthesis” - An E. coli Gene Coding for a Protamine-Like Protein
“In the first protocol, penetratin is synthesized with an additional N-terminalactivated cysteine, protected by a nitropyridinium group to prevent peptide homodimerization. The cargo is probably released freely in the cytoplasm as a result of disulfide bond breakage in the reductive cytoplasmic milieu. In the second method, the cargo and the vector are chemically synthesized in continuity. In this case, no coupling reaction is necessary.” - Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides p 12 Ülo
Nina: This citation and the following three is interesting since they are focused on CPP. We should read the book in order to get a greater understanding about the CPPs.
It is interesting to know that the cargo can be release in a reductive cytoplasmic environment, thus the disulfides bonds will be reduced.

At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Policies_-_-_TEXT.html,", we aim for OxyPonics to eventually be used in full scale hydroponic systems. This means we must guarantee our end products follow more the FDA regulations for growing crops. The FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule has established minimum standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of fruits and vegetables grown for human consumption. Of particular relevance to our project, the FDA maintains that the E. Coli levels in our system must be below detectable levels, or less than 126 CFU (Colony Forming Units) per 100 mL of agricultural water [6]. Our containment system - placing the bacteria in dialysis tubing - should prevent the levels of E. Coli from rising to levels deemed unsafe by the FDA. For additional safety, we will also ensure that all crops produced with aid from Oxyponics are sanitized after being in close proximity with the genetically modified E. coli contained in the dialysis tubing. Further still, E. coli used in our system are non-pathogenic, which means their potential danger is greatly minimized and theoretically should not be considered a threat to humans.
Overall, we believe that the FDA, EPA, and USDA have a clear need to design more versatile policies to truly assess the legal implications of OxyPonics.
PUBLIC ETHICS
To understand the intersections between our project and society, we consulted the work of Dr. Greg Kaebnick of the Hastings Institute. Founded in 1969, the Hastings Institute was the world’s first bioethics research think tank and has the mission to assess the ethics of health and biotechnology and their impact on communities and public policy. In his assessment of synthetic biology, he discussed the intrinsic characteristics of synthetic biology. According to Dr. Kaebnick, the prospect of creating synthetic organisms may go against what we believe is natural, but it is hard, or even impossible, to draw a line between what is natural and what is not [7]. A strain of yeast that produces an antimalarial may not be “natural”, but is it ethically wrong to use it to save lives? Dr. Kaebnick’s report was especially valuable to us because it raised questions about the role of government and policy about biotechnology moving forward. We had to ask ourselves and our legislators about the implications of our definition of “natural” being altered and the role of government as it relates to what is natural.
In terms of policy making, Dr. Kaebnick’s work allowed us to think about synthetic biology as a broad enabling technologically with many applications, rather than a technology for a particular"

AK Jaeschke (Gabriele Nuebel, Dr. Murat Suenbuel)
At the very beginning of the development of our project the iGEM Team talked to Gabriele Nübel and  Dr. Murat Sünbül, both members of the group of professor Jäschke. Professor Jäschke is dean of the  faculty for biosciences and his research is focused on RNA research.
We talked about our idea to use aptamers for the detection of small molecules by aptamers. Murat  was particularly interested in the software we developed to predict aptamers. He would use it to  predict aptamers for his research on aptamers. We learned from the meeting that aptamers are of  great interest and that if we are able to establish the software and verify it there will be a whole  aptamer community that would be interested in using it.
Dr. Damjana Keastelic
As the Team started to plan and design the rape drug detection system we talked to Dr. Damiana  Kastelic from DKFZ who used to teach forensics in Cambridge. She encouraged us to pursue our idea  though she suggested to focus on the read out. She told us that for forensics it is extremely  important to have an extremely robust assay as it may decide about people’s fate. Furthermore her  advice to us was to use may model substances to test our system. She said it would be interesting to  see if a food you buy is not polluted with for example antibiotics.

Testing Construct
This testing construct was used to test the inducible promoters using flourescent proteins as output reporters.
Key to genetic circuit diagrams
Explanation of Timeline
Carbon Source Concentration:
Glucose
The primary carbon source is glucose, as this is preferentially used by the cell.
Secondary carbon source
This is used by the cell after glucose in the media is depleted.
By carefully balancing the initial concentrations of these carbon sources, The E.ncapsulator will begin Encapsulation (Module 2) only once protein production is at sufficiently high levels.
Cell Density:
Cell density corresponds to total cell number.
RFP / OD:
RFP is a red coloured flourescent protein that is commonly used as a reporter. The gene coding for this protein is part of the same operon as the protein of interest. As the protein of interest is produced in Module 1, RFP is coexpressed alongside. The RFP must be normalised against optical density (shown above), as the cell density is increasing throughout.
GFP / OD :
GFP is a green coloured flourescent protein that is also commonly used as a reporter. The coding gene is under control of the same promoter as the genes for Module 2. This means that GFP expression is tied into encapsulation. The GFP again must be normalised against optical density (shown above) to account for the increase in cell density.

Background
Using plasmids as vectors to introduce foreign genes into engineered bacteria is the most common approach in genetic engineering. But plasmids in microbiology are unstable, which is major due to distribution instability and structural instability:
(1) Structural instability: Generally, foreign genes are not necessary for engineered bacteria, which means whether the foreign genes are functional, the host can still survive, so the unfavorable mutations would gradually accumulate leading to strain degeneration. Meanwhile, plasmids in bacteria could be in many forms. Some  can be integrated into genomes of the host by homologous recombinases.
(2) Distribution instability: there is usually no mechanism to guarantee the average distribution of plasmids during division, so the genes in exogenous  plasmids do not have genetic stability.
The degradation of engineered bacteria is essentially caused by growth rate. Degraded strains have more growth advantages than the non-degraded ones because of the additional metabolic burden taken by plasmids or the toxic substance expressed by foreign genes.Therefore the more copies of the plasmids or the higher expression of the toxic protein, bacteria grow slower. On the contrary, the bacteria with low copy number, no plasmid or whose plasmids loss functiongrow faster than that of non-degraded strains. Eventually, in the whole population of bacteria, degradation strains accumulate more and more, and functional strains less and less.
Fig.1 Degradation of engineered bacteria
Currently, the conventional method is to add a resistant gene expresses independently into the plasmids. Bacteria with low or no copies of plasmids will be killed or suppressed when antibiotics were added into the culture, while strains with high copies retained. This method is widely used in the laboratory. However, there are some disadvantages:

Combined Expression
Summary
Following the construction of the BioBricks K15853110 , K1585311 , K1585312 and their confirmed single expression, we aimed to build an operon that combines all three genes. We opted for an inducible expression to avoid that the constitutive expression of three relatively big proteins hinders cell growth. Therefore, we used plasmids containing the IPTG-inducible T7 promoter (Heidelberg pSBXXX collection) in E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3).
First, glgA and glgB were subcloned into pSB1A3 by BioBrick Assembly forming a 3986 bp long translational unit. This construct was later subcloned into two more plasmid backbones: pSB1C3 to provide it to the iGEM registry and pSB1C30 to characterize the complementary function of these enzymes without the overexpression of GlgC and the associated surplus of ADP-glucose.
In the next step, glgC and glgAB were fused in pSB1C3 via Gibson Assembly and CPEC. We decided to put glgC at the first position within the reading frame. The amount of ADP-glucose created by GlgC determines the activity of the following two enzymes and can therefore be considered the bottleneck of glycogen synthesis. We obtained glgCAB with a point mutation in the sequence of glgB, changing one alanine to a similiarly aliphatic aminoacid, valine. We tried to correct the substition via QuikChange and new Gibson Assembly/CPEC. Despite multiple attempts, we always received the same point mutation again. When we analysed the tertiary structure of GlgB, we assessed that the mutation was not positioned in the active site and should therefore not impede its function a lot. Due to time reasons we decided to proceed with the mutated construct which was subsequently cloned into pSB1A30 in order to confirm gene expression by SDS-PAGE .
All enzymes were detected on SDS gels with E. coli Bl21 Gold (DE3) wild type as negative control. Both polycistronic constructs"

Making Ultracompetent Cells
Transformation can be a major roadblock in assembling DNA constructs.  Ligations can be hard to transform, especially with large inserts.  DNA blotted on paper from the registry tends to be even harder.  We have had a great experience with the following protocol from Inoue, getting near lawns of transformants from ligations:
Based on the OpenWetWare page: http://openwetware.org/wiki/Preparing_chemically_competent_cells_(Inoue)
Makes about 25mL, or enough for nearly 500 50 uL transformations
Materials
Plate of cells streaked for single colonies.  We used DH5alpha.
SOB
Ice
TB buffer
DMSO (99.9%)
Liquid nitrogen
Glassware & equipment
(3)1 liter Erlenmeyer flasks (no detergent residue- we rinsed well with pure water, then autoclaved 2/3 full of pure water, emptying just before use
(1) 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask
250 mL centrifuge bottles, autoclaved
Refrigerated centrifuge
Preparation
Day 1
Pour LB plates (no antibiotic)
In the afternoon, streak a plate of DH5alpha from frozen stock.  (We usually just use a sterile 200 ul pipette tip, scrape some frozen cells off the top, melt them in a pool near an edge of the plate, return the still-frozen stock to the -80C freezer, and streak back and forth across the surface.)
Incubate plate inverted at 37C overnight (14-20 hours)

It's the final week! The iGEM 'wiki-freeze' is also closely approaching - when we can no longer make ammendments to it (to aid its being judged). There's therefore a lot of hurried tapping-away at his keyboard from our wiki maestro Haydn.
The team are now down to four people; there are reports of tumbleweeds in the further corners of the lab.
Tuesday
Reflectin is a protein taken from a eukaryote , so it's no surprise that it doesn't work as it does in squid when we express it in E. coli (a prokaryote ). Out of curiosity the team are expressing it in (eukaryotic) onion cells, with the aid of a 'gene gun' - we'll literally fire little bits of DNA into the cells. Cool? Yup.
Wednesday
Despite the team's efforts to keep our wiki updated throughout the summer, with the week of the wiki freeze here there's some scrambling to document everything in time. With every other team in the same position around this time each year, the iGEM servers usually refuse to work with all the traffic; cue much grinding of teeth.
Thursday
The Department has been reorganising their library all summer, and to the sadness of every scientist to chance upon it, a large skip has been filled up outside with magnificent old tomes, going wet and curling up in the rain. The library itself is a"

Safety in iGEM
Please visit the main Safety page to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an ""induced lethality"" or ""kill-switch"" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?"

Their speaking skills were excellent, making the debate very fun to follow. They used a lot of pictures to try and come back to thinks they knew (for e.g: nuclear energy, women), which made the debate easy to follow for none experts on the subject. We got a majority of positive feedback. The few negative comments were got concerned the deepth and number of the arguments. Experienced debators are used to hear A LOT of arguments in each debate, with mechanims explained in depth. This was not the case in this debate, but we never had expected such a thing. The subject was really too difficult for that. And even syntehtic biologists like us would not be able to talk about all these issues in depts, because they are still many things we don't understand or just don't know yet.
The public was very diverse: composed of hight school students, Licence, Master, PhD students from all backgrounds, lawyers, biologists and high school teachers. We also had 4 special guests: 2 students from the iGEM 2012 UCL team and 2 students from the iGEM 2012 Grenoble team. We were very please that the public was so numerous (a little more then 70 people!). We were also very happy with the debate that happend with the public. It was very rich, and we think that more exchanges between scientists and none scientists such as this one should happen.
Conclusion
The debate was a success as it met all the objectives we had set.
To raise awarness about synthetic biology in the population.
This was achieved through: the facebook event page (We invited as much people as possible from our fb contact. Even if people did not come to the debate, most probably read the desciption, and so they read a bit about syntehtic biology); the debators finding out about synthgetic biology and releasing genetically modified bacteria in the wild, all the people they might have contacted, all the friends they invited to the debate and talked to about the debate, their facebook friends(I can tell most of the advertized this debate on their facebook profile), the public that attended the debate and the people they might discuss the debate with afterwards.
That students who previously knew nothing about synthetc biology have a passionate debate on releasing genetically modified bacteria in the wild.
This is exactly what happend. The video and feedbacks can testify.
To see how students who previously knew nothing about synthetc biology react to such a motion: where they will"

Currently there are several ways to obtain new varieties. Firstly, after screening and identification, introduce new varieties from other countries and find out what can be used for production and directly popularize it. Secondly, cross breeding by artificial hybridization conserves beneficial traits in hybrids, the main methods of which are relative hybridization, interspecific hybridization, far source hybridization and so on. Thirdly, radiation breeding uses physical methods to induce mutation. Fourth, natural variability selective breeding and natural seeds seedling breeding.
Current Situations on Potato Breeding
The world's major cultivated types of potatoes are tetraploid species and the heredity is complex. As the choice of genotypes can only rely on the selection of phenotypes, the efficiency of choice is poor.
Common breeding methods are pedigree act and backcross methods, yet these methods have difficulty in making breakthroughs. Other methods include wild type hybridization, which is a method transferring diploid wild type into tetraploid; this method provided resources and expanded the potato gene pool, but its drawbacks are difficulties in hybridization and infertility. Somatic cell hybridization is an effective way to solve hybrid incompatibility.
Another method available nowadays is genetic engineering, which helps transfer genes that benefit survival—for instance resistance genes—into the potato varieties we have. Isozymes can be used to evaluate and identify different varieties of potatoes.

Nagahama,2016,Team:Nagahama#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html,". FPP: farnesyl diphosphate.
To increase farnesol production, we improved farnesol synthetic process by adding three genes to E.coli from the last year.  1, The gene that increases the intermediate product of farnesol synthesis. As 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), a key gene for farnesol synthesis, is also used for another compound synthesis, we added a new DXP synthase to increase the intermediate product. 2, The dephosphorylation enzyme gene  Last year, a synthesis of farnesol relied on endogenous dephosphorylation enzyme of E. coli, and this could be a bottleneck for farnesol production. This year, we introduced an additional endogenous phosphatase gene (YbjG, PgpB) in E. coli to increase the production of farnesol. 3, A gene to improve resistance against farnesol.  As farnesol is an antibacterial fragrance, it is toxic to E.coli itself. So, we introduced the endogenous activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, marA to improve resistance against farnesol．
Also, to improve the feasibility of Flavorator in the real situation, we thought that it is important to produce farnesol by non-recombinant E.coli. Therefore we attempted to increase production of farnesol using CRISPER / Cas9 system. E. coli has their pathway to produce the farnesol. However, the gdhA gene, which is not lethal to E.coli, produce a byproduct from farnesol synthetic pathway and decrease the production of farnesol. We tried to knockout gdhA with CRISPER-CAS9.
Fig.2 Pathway of our design  We tried to knockout gdhA, gene did not relate to falnesol synthesis, with CRISPER-CAS9 and be accumulate intermediate metabolite. DXP: 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate.

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics to solve this problem. While working towards the goal of creating a reprogramed smart bacteria (nicknamed the worm buster) to detect and report the presence of the small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has made our vision about the worm buster more realistic, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decisions whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].
Figure 1: Small Strongyles.
Symptoms
Current Methods of Detection
Resistance Development
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life"

“Get up so early. You must have a good rest last night, right? Let me show you around my planet today, OK? Believe me, the scenery here is wonderful and special!”
“Uh, fine. You look different today, you know.” This was all because Summer dressed her clothes of flame angel. It was a bit dreamlike.
“Yeah, you figure it out. I have a nickname, Flame Angel.” Summer began to pose as if she could play magic. We had to admit that her inventions were good use until now. But whether she could save the universe, that remained to be seen.
The little prince was also a bit exciting, influenced by Summer.
At that time, Little Dot, Mr Careless, Lily and Wind flied to them. They were all installed with wings, which Summer made yesterday. They already prepared well for outside. With the engine firefly starting, minutes later they got to the Garden of Eden. The whole farm presented a state of radiation. In the middle of it grew an old tree, who may have one hundred years old. Each quadrant area planted with different plants. The little prince standing in a sea of flowers, against the wind, closing his eyes and breathing the fragrance, was really very carefree. At noon, they climbed to the big tree and enjoyed a delicious lunch. Summer had her own theory about meals.
“Do you know why I just have one meal a day? There are lots of reasons that can back up my theory. First, the key point about meals is to get energy. Second, preparing three meals a day is a waste of time. Third, eating too much does no good but gaining weight. ”
The little prince listened sincerely. Maybe there were many benefits in Summer’s theory, we human still have our three meals a day. You choose it, because it is pleasure for you at that moment. Otherwise, you’ll get to the opposite. Anyway, they have a world which belongs to them.
When they were ready to fly home, a wind blew, bringing a rain of yellow powder.
“Summer, look!” Mr Careless cried.
Summer knitted her brows. She had never met a scene like this. Subconsciously, she felt worried. Without a word, she went out of the firefly and collected some powders by a handkerchief. When they arrived home, Summer went to her lab alone. The four small lives behaved in their old manners. There left the little prince alone. He walked to his bedroom quietly. This was a busy and happy day. It had been a long"

Primer Working Stock
This protocol is based on the instructions for primer resuspension given by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).
Centrifuge the tube containing the primer for 3−5 seconds (>3,000 x g) to pellet the material to the bottom of the tube.
Dissolve the DNA material in sterile MilliQ according to the supplier IDT. This creates a 100µM stock solution.
Heat the primer stock solution to 65 °C for 20 minutes.
Centrifuge the primer stock solution at maximum speed (~17,000 x g) for 2 minutes.
Prepare a 10X diluted work solution (10µM) by dilution with sterile MilliQ.
Store both Stock and Work solutions at -20 °C.

All work was performed within a sterile field created by a bunsen burner flame.
Cell Culture
Inoculate a single colony from an agar plate containing transformed cells in a 10 mL starter culture with appropriate antibiotic selection marker.
Let the seed culture grow overnight at 37 °C with 180 rpm rotation.
Measure the OD600 to confirm growth (an OD600 of around 2 is to be expected).
Prepare 1L of media with the required antibiotics.
Inoculate the media with 10 mL of the seed culture (1:100 ratio).
Let the culture grow until an OD600 of 0.5.

Linkoping_Sweden,2018,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," hosted a campus tour for secondary school students. The tour aimed at inspiring young students to pursue a higher education, to show what you can do during and after your studies. As this fitted well with our goal to reach out with our project we got to be a part of this tour. We held a short introduction to the field of synthetic biology and our project, focusing on the diversity of the field.
The Summer Week - Sommarveckan
Another way for us to reach out to the public and to inspire people to become more interested in Synthetic Biology was to participate in an event called ""Sommarveckan"". Sommarveckan is an annual event organised by Linköping University. During this event, secondary school students get to come to the university for a couple of days to try out scientific experiments and learn about the mechanisms connected to the experiments they perform.    Leading up to the event we planned an experiment themed ""Discovering chemistry"".  This resulted in a lab where 150 students got to extract DNA from a kiwi fruit. After the experiments, we talked about what one does with the DNA after it has been extracted. Based on what the students had done in the lab, we then supervised a discussion on Synthetic Biology and showed what we were doing in our project.
TEDx Norrköping
TED-events are incredibly popular and it is a great way of spreading a message worldwide. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. According to us in LiU iGEM, this was a way to both inform and engage the public. When we got invited we could not possibly say no. The TEDx-event was free for everyone and it will also be available online soon for anyone to watch. By consistently promoting the event on social media such as Facebook and Instagram we wanted to reach as many as possible. This also led to great results in the matter of number of people attending the event. About 70 people were in the audience during the actual event and a video will be uploaded to TEDx:s official YouTube channel that has almost 11,600,000 subscribers and with that, hopefully, reach many more.
The video will soon be available on TEDx:s YouTube-channel:
TEDx official YouTube-page .
By doing a TEDx-talk we wanted to reach further and involve more people. We wanted to engage people in Linkoping and Sweden, as well as people from all around the world. Our best possible way of doing so was through TEDx, because through TEDx, anyone and everyone could get engaged and involved."

C0051: Xba in buffer 4, Pst in buffer 3, Xba + Pst
E1010: Xba in buffer 4, Pst in buffer 3, Xba + Pst
Result of enzyme test is that…
Pst is not cutting well!!  On diagnostic gel, there was smearing every time Pst was used to cut.  Thus, an order for new Pst has been placed.
There are still some issues with the C0051 part  of the initiator, however, in the words of Jennifer Lau, “I have no explanation for what’s going on.  Enzymes are cutting, but now I run into a new problem.  I’m getting three bands in the upper region of the gel.  Not even my entire plasmid is that big.""
1) Bad gel?  Nope, my gel was smooth and had no bubbles in it
2) C0051 had bands larger than the entire plasmid length itself!
Hypothesis: the new C0051 colonies that I streaked are contaminated in some way, shape, or form.
Will see how new minipreps work out today (from original colonies)
Will do multi-digestions of C0051 (6 of them)
All were cut with same enzymes, but only 1 had bands in the correct places
Cultured this C0051 (called C0051 #2 because only the one in well #2 had successful bands)
Afterward using the new Pst, digestions have been going quite smoothly: RBS-E1010, C0051, F1610, I12006.  In the words of Keegan Owsley, “Just extracted these bad boys.  Seriously, best bands ever.  Except I12006.  You were all smeary.  But whatever. I forgive you.”
This led to the successful ligation of RBS-E1010-F1610 and RBS-C0051 (finally!)  (RBS-E1010 had been successfully ligated earlier in the week.)

With the lowest concentration of total proteins with abaecin OD600 decreases in 16.08% and with the highest one it decreases in 17.16%.
S. pyogenes (figure 2b) was treated with the same concentrations as B. subtilis. At 21 h, both concentrations of abaecin produced a decrease in OD600 compared to the untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) control. With the lowest concentration of total proteins with abaecin OD600 decreases in 3.77% and with the highest one it decreases in 14.39%.
Figure 7. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for abaecin. a) B. subtilis challenged with low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with abaecin and total proteins of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3). b) S. pyogenes challenged with low (LC) and high (HC) concentrations of total proteins of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with abaecin and total proteins of untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3).
With the development of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, it was observed that there was partial inhibition by both total protein extracts. It is probable that some proteins of E. coli BL21 (DE3) are toxic for B. subtilis and S. pyogenes, which allowed their inhibition. However, the protein extracts of the bacteria transformed with the composite for the expression of abaecin showed greater inhibition, supporting the premise that the peptides are present and their activity is as expected. B. subtilis was found to be more susceptible to total protein extract with abaecin than S. pyogenes at the end of 21 h. However, both bacteria were inhibited in a certain percentage by this extract compared to the negative control of the total protein extract of the non-transformed bacteria.
Successes & Failures
The iGEM experience taught us a lot of unique things, and as we had significant achievements, we went through many unexpected obstacles. Throughout the year we faced many challenges for finally reaching our goal; we believe that the effort was worthwhile.

However, we don’t know whether 0.1nM is the bottom limit of detection. We speculated that with multiple PC reporters recognizing more sites on one target, enhanced bioluminescence signal could be observed. In that way we could get a relatively high signal at a lower concentration of target DNA. The results confirmed our speculation (Figure 9).
Figure 9. Bioluminescence intensity with multiple PC reporters. One, three, and five PC reporters were, respectively, subjected to the measurement using PCR product of 0.01nM.
After validating the specificity and sensitivity of PC reporter system. We were eager to apply it to detect the real MTB genome. Fortunately, we got the absolutely safe MTB genomic DNA from Prof. LIU Cuihua (Chinese Academy of Sciences).
First, we used the most popular commercial TB NAD toolkit (TB-LAMP) to amplify MTB genome and found out that there was a large yield of non-specific product after amplification (Figure 10a,b), which could be mistakenly considered as a positive result if using the conventional diagnosis method. However, our PC reporter system can easily distinguish the true from the false (Figure 10c).
Figure 10. (a) Gel electrophoresis of amplification product of LAMP using MTB genome or control genome (E.coli). (b) Amount of amplified nucleic acid measured using the method provided in TB-LAMP toolkit. (c) Bioluminescence intensity generated by PC reporter, which is able to distinguish the true PCR product from the false.
Then we set out to test whether our PC reporter could be applied to the clinical cases where patients might be in an early stage of TB thus the copies of MTB in their pathological samples could not be that many. The key factor is to figure out the minimum copy numbers of MTB genome in crude sample that can be detected by PC reporter when combined with PCR. We performed a series of dilution on the MTB genome before PCR amplification and found that, when the PCR products are subjected to the measurement, our PC reporter can easily reach the detection limit of only 1 genome copy per tube, which is sensitive enough for real TB diagnosis (Figure 11).

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html,"23106, and BBa_J23119 were characterised for expression strength using a GusA assay in C. difficile. The four novel registry parts were characterised alongside the existing registry promoters in a GFP assay in E. coli as well as in a GusA assay in C. difficile. The most remarkable conclusion from the E. coli GFP assay of these promoters is that both of the suspected strong C. difficile promoter PCsp_fdx and Pcac_thl were stronger than any of the three existing registry promoters we assayed; with Pcac_thl producing around three times the concentration of fluorescein (0.3235µM) as the positive control used in the InterLab studies (0.0958µM).
As part of our collaborative studies, we invited two other iGEM teams (Imperial College London and University of Warwick) to characterise our composite parts using their equipment and calibration curves, and the observed reproducibility between laboratories further validated our observations. Furthermore this part has now been characterised in a Gram-negative and a Gram-positive non-model organism. When tested in the Gram-positive organism it was driving expression of gusA.
Our main objective in characterising these promoters was to find a suitable pair of strong promoters to use in our subsequent dCas9 or asRNA projects. For this the GusA assay within C. difficile was most relevant since this is the chassis in which these constructs would be acting. The C. difficile GusA assay clearly showed that none of the three existing registry promoters from E. coli had any detectable activity in C. difficile. By far the strongest promoter we were able to measure was PCsp_fdx which was around 7.5 times stronger than the next strongest promoter we found (PCdi_TcdA). We were unable to clone the strongest promoter from the E. coli GFP assay PCac_thl into a GusA reporter plasmid. This is likely because of the toxicity of the gusA gene in E. coli and since we know that  PCac_thl is the strongest of our promoters in E. coli it is unsurprising that this was the most problematic plasmid to clone. As a result we did not measure the strength of PCac_thl in C. difficile, but due to its measured strength in C. difficile as well as its widespread use for overexpression studies in Clostridia we decided to select it alongside PCsp_fdx as a promoter to use in the next stage of our project.

Creative Workshop
We set up a creative workshop with the hope of generating ideas about the name of the project, the mascot and designs for the logo. In an attempt to translate science into art, a brainstorming session took place to think of all the possible words and themes related to the project. We talked about the wet lab work and how could this be incorporated with the team's mission to find a suitable ""image"".
 
WELLCOME TRUST VISIT
A visit to the Wellcome Trust was arranged after a suggestion that Giulia made. It was a great opportunity to see the exhibition and at the end of the day, several points were made. The ideas generated at the workshop were presented to the meeting with the artists with the aim of developing a final project name and logo. It was a very interesting day out where we ventured through the numerous galleries available and it truly did inspire us. We even had a chance to catch the Cambridge project E.Chromi from last year.
 
Today we went head to head in our weekly thursday meetings. It was a long 3 hour meeting where we discussed amongst the usual updates and progress, the future vision of our project or more importantly our concept. Where could we see our project a decade down the line? We discussed its effects on the biopharmaceutical industry in detail, and how we hope that once this proof of principle is shown to actually work, it can potentially be implemented in similar processes. The BP oil slick was fresh in our minds still and that inspired Arif to suggest the potential to use our circuit to help"
NAU-CHINA,2018,Team:NAU-CHINA#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," introduced a recombinase into the system. The recombinase is capable of flipping the 5' end to the 3' end of the target sequence containing recombinase-specific sites, thereby being able to turn it on and off and realizing the zero-one switch precisely.
Signal output
Finally, we achieved equal outputs by using promoters[2]> which have different strength and recombinases[3]> which have different effects. Because Since the promoter is located at downstream of TetO and upstream of recombinase, the function is self-evident (click here to see more).
System Reset
When the external signal disappears or falls below the threshold, our mosfet has a reset function, which is to restore the initial state. This function is achieved by a protein called recombination directionality factor (RDF).
The relationship between electronic Mosfet and our MOSFET
From another perspective, the original Mosfet, when loaded into a circuit, can do the same thing as our MOSFET:
1) Constantly detect a voltage signal.
2) Process that voltage signal (change the resistance).
3) Output the corresponding current.
4) Immediately restore the original state after the externally-modified voltage is restored.
But the principles to achieve these are completely different between electronic and molecular-genetic contexts, so the extension must be combined with the actual context.

Plates show only two colonies, one each from ""slow"" GFP and ""slow insertion time"" GFP. These colonies sampled, grown in cultures.
Wednesday, June 18, 2014
Digested the HMF pathway with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. All PCR's of the third genome overlap containing dCas9 failed, and we realized we must complete the first plasmid by inserting dCas9 and use that as a template instead of the original dCas9 plasmid. This points the failure of the ligation to either the dCas9 PCR's or the ligase buffer has expired. We made new aliquots of fresh ligase buffer to test whether this was the case. We have run out of ClaI and cannot digest dCas9 until this arrives. Our strategy now is to Gibson assembly the Lambda Red Recombinase system and dCas9, then PCR Rescue and ligate into plasmid 1 using XhoI/SalI-HF and XbaI to mitigate the lack of ClaI.
Plasmid prep on cultures from colonies that grew after transformation. New hypothesis develope: perhaps the higher expression GFPs killed the cells due to their extremely rapid translation elongation, leaving only the less efficiently translated GFP carrying cells to live. Online check using website Genscript and their free gene analysis tool shows that the common GFP scores a perfect 1.0 and the rare GFP a perfect 0.0 on their scale (from 0 being not optimized at all to 1 being perfectly optimized). This reveals that the algorithm used by Genscript corresponds directly to the codon usage profile for E.coli over the entire genome.
Thursday, June 19, 2014
Conducted 2-part Gibson CBA to assemble the Lambda Red Recombinase system and the dCas9 system.
Many more RBS library calculations run, some using a method where the Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence is mutated, but not the rest of the initial condition. Hopefully this will speed up the calculations and finally yield some high TIR libraries that evenly span the range we are looking for. Another overnight culture of slow GFP/slow insertion time GFP cells innoculated.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#MAK_-_-_TEXT.html,"omolar of anti-miRNA. We chose this temperature as it is the optimum for E. coli derived enzymes.
Using NUPACK, we checked our switches had no base pairing in the ribosome binding site in both the off and on state and minimal secondary structure around the start codon in the on state. We also modelled the bound state, ensuring the structure around the RBS and start codon was correct in both the off and on state.
Having demonstrated that our design would work, we minimized the |∆GRBS-Linker|  via site directed mutagenesis (varying the sequence at specific sites). Making the |∆GRBS-Linker| as close to zero as possible maximizes the toehold switch output. This is discussed in more depth along with the other important parameters for toehold switch design on the design page .
However, NUPACK struggled to predict the specificity of the second series of switches as they had multi-step reactions. Additionally, we found that NUPACK was unable to match experimental data for molecular beacon specificity in our new form of riboregulators. Despite this, NUPACK  was suitable for accurately designing our first series of switches due to their simpler and more predictable nature.

Media Release Material
Water Soluble Materials
Aquasol uses a mixture of sodium carboxy cellulose and wooden pulp to create the water soluble material
Aquasol specifically designs their packaging to biodegrade over time or with the introduction of water at any various temperature
Monosol is another company which specializes in the use of water soluble packaging and dispersible materials. The water soluble film is made from PVOH (Poly Vinyl Alcohol)
Like Aquasol, the material is water soluble at all temperatures. At higher temperatures, the material is more soluble. That is why they suggest moderate temperatures of 10-20 degrees celsius with relative humidity of 30-60%
With the material being quickly degraded, water soluble materials are not the best materials to use for the media release. The material however does not harm the environment as the bacteria naturally found in wastewater can break it down into harmless components
As well, there are no specifics about their material as you have to customize it to your needs

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi. We simplify this process as the graph shows below.
As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Components_-_-_TEXT.html," the fabrication of these devices ranges from one to two hours for milling, depending on the complexity of the design, and another hour for assembly.
Since these microfluidic devices are made from polycarbonate and PDMS, both of which are affordable and widely available, and require only a desktop CNC mill to fabricate, scientists are able to rapidly prototype low-cost microfluidic chips without sinking time and money into conventional manufacturing methods.
TERRA Adapter
The TERRA Adapter serves to increase the number of and types of microfluidic chips that are compatible with our system. This makes the system more user-friendly, as scientists then don’t need to design a chip that both suits the experiment and is capable of selecting for the proper output to be dispensed.
The TERRA Adapter is a scalable, predesigned chip capable of selectively dispensing the output of the microfluidic chip into the intended lab vessel. For droplet based experiments, for every output, the TERRA Adapter has two valves and a set of four pressure regulator. For continuous flow experiments, there are two valves for every output and an extra output that serves as a flush mechanism for cleaning the nozzle between outputs.

TERRA Adapter
To ensure TERRA is low-cost and accessible to synthetic biologists, we have designed a hardware system consisting primarily of 3D-printed parts and inexpensive components. All of the CAD and STL files are available to the public through GitHub.
XY-Translational Stage
In order to dispense the output of microfluidic chips into specific locations, we decided to incorporate a low-cost, DIY XY-translational stage. The XY-stage enables translational motion along the X and Y axes, allowing the system to move a vessel, such as a 96-well plate, to a predetermined location.
The XY-stage consists of 3D-printed supports, stepper motors, timing belts, pulleys, bearings, and stainless steel rods. The stepper motors are connected to a timing belt and pulley system, which converts the rotational motion of the motor shaft to translational motion of the timing belt. The timing belts are then attached to supports that travel linearly along steel rods using ball bearings.  This enables the main support for a 96-well plate to move in both the X- and Y-direction.
