UCSC,2016,Team:UCSC#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,"ol yield. To account for this, we aimed to engineer a method that yielded minimal production of our enzymes during exponential growth yet strong upregulation during stationary phase.
Schematic representation of engineered erythritol production in B. subtilis. Erythritol is produced with the introduction of 2 genes, encoding an erythrose 4-phosphatase (TM1254), and an erythrose reductase (GLD1), respectively.
Promoter:
Genes are generally regulated with the use of transcriptional promoters. For the engineering of our gene insert, an endogenous B. subtilis promoter Pylb, was chosen as it was shown to be highly efficient in the stationary growth phase. Many promoters are identified for B. subtilis, but most would not work with our design. One of the strongest known constitutive promoters to date, Pveg, controls transcription of the veg gene, a gene thought to play an important role during the outgrowth of spores. We attempted cloning in the non-sporulating strain, B. subtilis 3NA; but 3NA proved not transformation efficient enough for our engineering and we therefore used the wildtype PY79 strain. We did not want lack of sporulation to negatively impact production of erythritol, and so opted not to use the Pveg promoter. A strong inducible promoter, PxylA, induced expression in the simultaneous presence of xylose and absence of glucose. Because almond hulls were known to contribute a non-negligible percentage of glucose, this promoter was removed as an option. It was thought that constitutively strong promoter activity, such as that of P43, during the vegetative stage would prevent necessary cell growth. “Compared with P43 (a commonly used constitutive promoter), promoter Pylb could express two reporter genes (egfp and mApple), and the expression levels of EGFP and RFP were 7.8- and 11.3-fold higher than that of P43, respectively.” Because Pylb is the most active in the stationary phase, it was used in our gene insert to produce the erythritol metabolic pathway.
Picking the Bacterial Chassis:
Certain characteristics that were considered important to the success of the project were analyzed such as doubling time, transformation efficiency, shuttle vectors compatible with E. coli, or if the organism already contained erythritol producing genes. We also took note that the microbe was GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) designated by the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) since"
Nanjing-China,2018,Team:Nanjing-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the production process as well,  such as the contamination of cadmium sulfide, semiconductor materials attached  to the surface of Escherichia coli, whether cadmium sulfide would affect  the physiological activity of Escherichia coli or not, how to convert  nitrogen fixation inside engineered bacteria into mass production of nitrogenous  fertilizer and so on. We carefully collected these problems above.
Improvement of our project
When  we came back, we seriously considered these practical problems in experimental  design and continuously improved experimental method.
Firstly,  toxicity test was conducted to determine the maximum amount of Cd2+  that is agreeable for E. coli growth.
For  further information about this experiment, please check it out on our  protocol and result page.
Moreover,  in order to apply our nitrogen fixation system to practical use, maybe into  mass production in the future, we also came up with an idea of designing a device  for the growth of engineered strain. Our integrated human practices  strategy helped us to look at how we could make our device as user-friendly as  possible.
Interactions with microbial researchers
At  the beginning, we designed a device consisting of 3 modules: incubation,  illumination, control, which is suitable for engineered strain to grow and  participate in reaction under adjustable light conditions.
Our  interactions with microbial researchers shaped our final design and made it  possible for practical application. When xenon modulator tube is illuminating,  it would heat the air inside incubator, thus making the environment unfavorable  for our engineered strain.
To  solve this problem, we were advised to place a reflux condenser to cool the  xenon modulator tube, keeping the most suitable temperature.
For further information about this device, please  check it out on our  hardware page.

Cooper_Union,2015,Team:Cooper Union#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,".  The methodology was based on a paper by Rogers et al. at Johns Hopkins [3].  After the reaction is complete, the DNA should be bonded to the glass by a disulfide bond.  To test that our glass slides had DNA on them, we would use ethidium bromide since it is known to attach to DNA strands.
In parallel with the glass slides, our team designed three mutated TdT sequences based on a paper by Repasky et al.[4]   In order to characterize these forms of TdT, we would have to ligate them into a high copy expression vector and then transform them into a cell line optimized for expression.  Protein purification of these cells would then follow.  Finally, we would have to test this protein by treating oligonucleotides with the TdT and running them on a polyacrylamide gel.  This would reveal whether or not the TdT can add base pairs to the free three prime end of a DNA molecule.
The intein based TdT system was the last biological component of our project.  It is a useful addition if the synthesizer utilizes heat-labile nucleotides.  Ideally, the final system will utilize U.V.-labile nucleotides which would make this system superfluous.  Despite this, we still worked on this angle of the project since U.V.-labile nucleotides can be very expensive.  In order to circularize TdT, we would have to design a linker sequence between the N and C termini of the protein.  We decided to use the software developed by the 2014 Heidelberg team to design an optimized sequence of amino acids to link the N-terminus of TdT to its C-terminus.  Their program yielded an amino acid sequence that would circularize the TdT protein.  Using this sequence and Heidelberg’s intein system, we designed g-block DNA sequences that would allow for the synthesis and purification of various forms of heat stable TdT.

Km           = Michaelis constant ( = 9 x 10^-6 M for this reaction)
Through the use of diffusion-limiting beads, [DCM] is kept constant at 0.02M. This is significantly larger than our Michaelis constant, so this equation can be simplified by using the following assumptions:
Multiplying this by our population function, the total rate of DCM degradation is given as:
Turning this into a more recognisable value (a volume) gives the total rate of DCM degradation as:
Where:
When all of these calculations were modelled in Matlab with the input conditions shown above, the total volume of DCM that we would predict the native bacteria DM4 to degrade in 24 hours is shown by the red line below. This is before you account for the possible toxicity of the pH drop. This is taken into account in the sections below.

Calculating the pH change
The degradation of DCM by DcmA produces hydrochloric acid (HCl) according to the reaction below: ￼
There is a resulting pH change because of the accumulation of HCl. Because we are dealing with an organic system which cannot tolerate pH<6, we must track the anticipated HCl production and resulting pH change. The following relationships were used:
NHCL     = molecules of HCl
NDCM    = molecules of DCM

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.

I obtained a doctoral degree in Cell and Developmental Biology from Rutgers University, New Jersey. After I got my degree, I returned to my home country Panama, for a two-year postdoct at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) , using molecular tools to infer relationship among domesticated and wild squashes. In 2000, I accepted a position at STRI as Manager of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Evolution. Recently, I was appointed Associate Director for Science Administration at STRI. I got involved with iGEM when I was invited by SENACYT to participate as one of the instructors for the Panama team. It has been a wonderful experience to have the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with a group of very bright and enthusiastic Panamanian students that have embrace the challenge of representing Panama in the iGEM contest.

Philipp Boeing
I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and the application and commercialisation of scientific concepts. I am excited to be involved with Darwin's toolbox as it is a chance to expand the use of synthetic biology into new areas and gives me an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to bringing a technology to market.

Overview
    As we mentioned in our background, there is a number of microorganism in our daily life which could cause disease infection and give off stink. In this project our team aims to popularize our PLA and 2-PE to inhibit the harmful bacteria and make the environment more pleasant. After visiting the Environmental Protection Bureau for our human practice (Details can be found on our Human Practices page.), we thought the condition in garbage can is much more complicated than we imagine. So we temporarily focus on the microbe pollution in our laboratory, which may be polluted by abandoned pipettetips, waste of medium, diverse biological reagent and so on. And the stink released by the garbage gives us intuitive feelings and bothered us.    Therefore we try to relieve this problem using PLA and 2-PE produced by the engineered E.coli.     TnaA-/-deletion strain is chosen as our engineered bacteria, which is odorless. By using this strain, we can avoid the smell of E.coli itself and keep the smell pleasant.
Garbage lid
    Irregular experimental operation is common but serious somehow, which could cause infection of disease. The pointed part of used pipettetips and different biological reagent are breeding grounds for bacteria. As the laboratory is the place where we spent most time a day, the improperly processed garbage should be taken into consideration.
    We designed our engineered bacteria in a special container: a garbage lid, PLA and 2-PE will be released to inhibit the growth in the experimental garbage and release roselike aroma at the same time.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," our designed strategy for MTS.
The whole test process can be divided into three steps.
Step 1:
Activate the Gal1 promoter. After that, the expression of HO gene in the SynⅩ-dUra-416 can be initiated.
Step 2:
Cultivate two groups of yeasts together. (one is SynⅩ-dUra-416, the other is normal BY4741MATa) If the MTS has been accomplished (SynⅩ-dUra-416 can become MATα), the two groups of haploids can mate with each other and become diploids.
Step 3:
Test the results of mating by PCR method. We designed the primers for both MATa locus and MATα locus. The amplification of both MATa locus and MATα locus indicates that the yeasts have turned into diploids, the MTS has been achieved in other words.
BACKGROUND
Mating switch of yeasts
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-celled organism with three types, called a, α, and a/α. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three cell types differ from each other in their DNA content at the MAT locus which specifies the cell types. In nature, the two haploid cell types (a and α) of budding yeast are able to interconvert in a reversible manner by DNA-rearrangement with a DSB at the MAT locus, and this process is called mating-type switch.
The DSB at MAT locus is caused by HO endonuclease (a kind of site-specific endonuclease expressed by HO gene). DSBs in chromosomes can be repaired either by homologous recombination (HR) or by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). In S.C haploids, the DSB caused by HO endonuclease mostly repaired by HR with HML(α) and HMR(a) as donors. If the donor is HML(α), the mating-type will become α, and vice versa. In this way, a haploid budding yeast is able to achieve mating-type switch.

Le vecteur cellulaire , intégrant uniquement le plasmide thérapeutique, n’est en aucun cas réplicatif et  ne possède donc aucune pathogénicité envers la population bactérienne commensale.
Les séquences Cos sont composées de trois sites spécifiques : CosN, CosB et CosQ.
CosN correspond au site de coupure du concatémère d’ADN de la terminase (une enzyme produite lors de la phase lytique) qui va alors générer les extrémités cohésives de l’ADN mature (les séquences Cos ) et initier l’encapsidation du génome (CosB étant le site de fixation de la terminase). CosQ est en revanche  nécessaire en tant que séquence d'arrêt de l’encapsidation, elle agit en concordance  avec  les sites CosN et I2 (une séquence située entre cosN et cosB).
Il a également été démontré que l’initiation de la coupure au niveau de CosN est aidée par l’IHF, l’Intégration Host Factor, lors du processus d’encapsidation. Ce dernier provoque une courbure de l’ADN en se fixant au niveau de I1 (une sous-séquence de CosB) permettant à gpNu1 (la sous-unité de la terminase ne portant pas l’activité d’endonucléase) de se fixer sur les sites R(1,2,3) de cosB. Cette fixation déclenche l’activité d’endonucléase de la sous-unité gpA de la terminase libérant un monomère génomique prêt à être encapsidé.
En résumé, la terminase se fixe sur une séquence Cos du concatémère d’ADN et provoque une coupure qui libère l’extrémité gauche du génome à encapsider. C’est la liaison du complexe enzyme-DNA à une procapside vide qui initie le processus d’encapsidation.
Ayant retiré les séquences Cos du génome phagique, il n’est jamais encapsidé. Se"

For most synthetic biology workers, it is difficult for them to conduct effective communication on experimental content, so we established a synthetic biology community based on search engine and report editor. In this community, bio workers can use this to record their experimental process and comment on other scholar's reports, thereby reducing the blindness of the research.
In The Future
As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve our existed functions and provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in the future.
Improvements
It is super easy to accomplish your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.
We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.
It is great significant to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.
The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.  The society is still growing. That is why chatting and communication could be considered as an important facility in our society.
New Features
Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or plugin.  In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like Quora where biologists can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners who share interest in a certain area.  If there is a matching hardware port, it could complete the experiment automatically according to the given steps and protocols. We could match the steps or protocols to the manipulator's operating instructions accurately. For this, we hope BioHub can help achieve experiment automation."

Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair did another PCR on the CaMV promoter due to it being unsuccessful the previous day and then ran another gel. This time the results of the gel looked much more promising. After this initial step Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair performed another double restriction digest on the promoter and chloramphenicol plasmid. This was then followed by a DNA ligation. Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair also did a transformation with the wil type luciferase Biobrick. Ben Jevans and Gurdeep on this day went on to perform a miniprep of their cultures containing the site-directed mutagenesis product of the Ble gene. The isolated product was then ran on the gel which showed differing results depending on the medium the plasmid was extracted from. A nanodrop was done to check the DNA concentration of both samples that were tested. Ben and Gurdeep then did a PCR on the Ble gene from two different mediums; after this they ran the product of the PCR on a gel and unfortunately questionable results were obtained. Mario and Mark conducted a census of all the Biobricks that had been used and where they had been placed so lab work was kept in order.
Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair checked their plates which showed that he transformation they had done the previous day had been successful. They then went on to do a restriction double digest to isolate the luciferase Biobrick gene from the plasmid and then conducted a PCR on it. Next Abbie, Ben Hardy and Alistair did another transformation in E.coli with the luciferin regenerating enzyme and left it to incubate to be ready for the next day."

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," but time (64,3%) and space (44,6%) constraints are both two obstacles for its development.
GMOs techniques are not fully accepted (58,2%) due to the lack of general and demonstrated information about this issue.
The first and second conclusions made from the survey have led to a change in focus for the overall task. The results of the survey also appears to contradict itself. The solution in this project was approached through the development of transgenic plants. However, the survey indicates a societal prejudice towards GMOs and transgenic plants. It is important to address the controversy surrounding GMOs by first looking at legal framework.
LEGAL FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS
EUROPEAN AND SPANISH REGULATION
In order to identify the legal matters to be considered in the application of ChatterPlant, the European and Spanish legal framework relevant to the device were carefully studied. To ensure the legal regulations were accurately interpreted, Javier Company, a lawyer at UPV assisted us in legislative explanations
INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
To gain a general idea as to how the legal regulations of other countries affect ChatterPlant, it was useful to seek help from other iGem teams. Paris IONIS, Dusseldorf and Rice iGEM teams answered three questions providing insight into transgenic regulation in their respective countries.
LEGAL FRAMEWORK EVALUATION SUMMARY
Following items recap the main points of our legal framework analysis:
A strong legal framework is established in Europe to ensure the development of GMOs in safe conditions.
Each European nation has the authority to evaluate and decide the environmental risk of a particular genetically modified organism.
There is a legal black hole in the GMO’s application because there is no regulation on cultivating GMOs in private, non-governmental properties in Europe
Thanks to the input collected from iGEM groups worldwide, it can been seen that the regulations on transgenic plants in European countries are much stricter those of the United States.
The information gathered from meetings, interviews and surveys ultimately identifies the main concepts for creating a viable SynBio solution to sustainable agriculture based on plant communication.
CHATTERPLANT EVOLUTION
Our social analysis conclusions strengthens ChatterPlant’s ideas in terms of its objectives, delineating characteristics an open access agriculture must offer. Interviews with stakeholders provided background to redefine the working lines in different aspects, as will be explained subsequently in more detail.
CHATTERPLANT SYNBIO EVOLUTION
Greenhouse interviews brought to light the need to implement a non-invasive abiotic and biotic stress detection system, capable of detecting stress before the development of visual phenotypic damages. Interviewees emphasized that the apparatus developed should be"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:

Collaborations
The University of Warwick
We sent the University of Warwick water samples from our local river- the River Trent. These samples were then tested in their fluorometer and they return the data to our team. This was a very meaningful collaboration, as it gave their team a wider range of results to analyse in their attempts to improve water safety using their flurometer. By having a wider range of data, the team were able to have more confidence in their device and final conclusions. This data can be accessed via this link .
Team BioMarvel- Korea
Our team offered our grammar checking services, as native English speakers to Team BioMarvel for their wiki. We collaborated intensely over the summer months, reviewing their team’s drafts and sending redrafts of their wiki submissions. We edited their drafts over and over until the grammar was perfect! This was an incredibly meaningful collaboration, as it ensured their team had an outstanding wiki, with accurate grammar. This ensured that regardless of English not being their first language, their efforts in iGEM could still be fully recognised and understood with a grammatically correct wiki.
The University of Warwick and Imperial College London
We sent 8 samples of our promoters, including a negative control, with the same 3 day protocol we followed for our GFP assay. Please find a link to the protocol below.
The data we acquired through this collaboration emphasises the importance of the standardised approach that iGEM promotes through their inter lab study, as both teams used the same standardised method as us and all achieved similar results. This increases our confidence in our data, and reassures us of our decision to use PCac_thl in our constructs.

They also helped us at the very beginning to pay the team registration fee. For the quick help with some kit’s and primers we are more than thankful for “Linea libera” with Sigitas Burinskas in front of it, and Lina Piešinienė, who helped with primers from “Nanodiagnostika”.
Not only huge companies can help you with the fundraising – the greatest and the warmest person we met is Alina Bezuglova and her teammate Aurelija Degulytė. Our first meeting would have been impossible without a help from Vytautas Bivainis and Vytautas Kalinauskas. Some insights were shared by Rūta Kruliauskaitė, who did a probably the most succeeded  crowdfunding campaign for her studies at New York City.
Public outreach support
The great project manager at the Enterprise Lithuania – Raminta Kaleinikaitė and a trainee Sonata Brokevičiūtė, who also helped us with the presentation skills. How to rule the world of society and make us a well-known project? Please seek for an advice at “OMConsulting” and our the best advisor Milda Gaulienė and for the first business card we got – thank you Orijana Mašalė (the owner of ""OMConsulting""). All the publications and all the requests for financial support would have been less successful without your help. After the sneaky preview of presentations we could join a huge events at our friends “LITEXPO” place and in the pleasure of that we can collaborate with the “Baltic Innovative Technology Institute” (Tomas Žalandauskas). Also, the press of Vilnius University was much more than friendly to us, so thank you, Agnė Grinevičiūtė. Interested topics were presented by PhD. Aleksandr Osipenko, PhD. Robertas Galinis and dr. Giedrius Gasiūnas to our team and our guests from danish SDU team.
Design support
To paint the face of our team, after all the team members opinions and some designs by Danielius, we are thankful for the greatest camera-man Evaldas Valaitis (and all the editing work), PhD. Linas Tamošaitis, for our painter Monika Jasnauskaitė for an illustration for innovation fair and photographer Paulius Mielinis for taking"

OVERVIEW PROBLEM SOLVING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
TEAM
Overview
Our policy & pratice forcus on 3 main goals
1.Introduce another application way of research; business
2. Introduce synbio to people who are at the far point from science related fields
3. Attracted people into our activity, iGEM competition
As for the first goal, we've done a research on Intellectual Property. Most iGEMers especially those who have participated in the track,             Information Processing, tend to minimize the importance of Intellectual Property and Patents. We believe that a proper education in Intellectual Property   will produce a positive effect on the researchers.             Our job was a first step into introducing Intellectual Property and  patents to the iGEMers so they can have better understanding of their work.
For the second and third goals we presented to public outside competition about Synbio. While working as communicators, we learned how others think   about our field and how we can spread our activity.
Problem Solving
Motivation
We, UT-Tokyo encountered a unforeseen problem during processing our project: patents. Googling for it, we've noticed that we have little knowledge on   Intellectual Property and Patents.             Seen around the world, some teams in overseas have established their company on the basis of their iGEM project, but there's no teams like that in Japan.   Why does this happen? Does the situation narrow potential             of our projects? In addition, our survey shows knowledge about Intellectual Property and Patent have highly-demand than ever. On the other hand, students   including us, don't know how to gain such information.
Therefore, we conducted interviews over a broad population. Experts, professors, researchers, students and other professionals were part of our research   target.             The results of our observations are presented in the following paragraphs, along with our conclusions regarding the topic.
Solution
From the researches and interviews above, we reached to the conclusion: in patenting, there is clear difference in pros and cons, even in opinions of   people.             The problem is not straightforward. We can't say patenting is always good, or bad, thus, we put summary of all the pros and cons at the bottom part of   Problem Solving.
Intellectual Property and SynBio
What is Intellectual Property? Before"
MIT,2013,Team:MIT#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," of exosomes when they are added to an in vivo system, like a mouse model, or and in vitro system, like a plate of cultured cells. Because exosomes are so small, detectability is difficult to accomplish and is an issue we hope to focus on in the future.
By considering human practices we have identified a potential collaborator and gained an understanding of the needs of our target market.
International Education
In January of this year, we ran a student-run laboratory course at MIT for 2 weeks over IAP http://stellar.mit.edu/S/project/synbio-iap2011/.  IAP is a special 4 week term in January, over which students can take classes and participate in a wide variety of classes. The curriculum we teach is half seminar and half in a biology lab, exposing neophyte researchers to the origins of synthetic biology and current best practices. We include lectures on iGEM, the parts registry, the use of abstraction, and how theory and experiments can be complementary. These lectures are followed with an intensive lab setting where teams of students utilize BioBricks to build 2 plasmids, forming an inducible bioluminescent circuit. This year, we doubled enrollment by co-teaching the class with a dozen students at the Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Santiago, Chile. We streamed our lectures to South America and additionally dispatched three MIT iGEM students to Santiago to run the lab sections. This international engagement will be fully realized for the 2014 competition year when UAI will host their own iGEM team for the first time – one that we will assist as well as have applied for funds to allow an exchange program for the two teams. In July of this year, the professor and lead instructor from Chile that will be forming the new team came to Boston to shadow the iGEM team for several days to learn and develop good habits of team management.
Safety and Risk Assessment
In addition to our international involvement, we also pursued several projects locally in the Boston area. The first was hosting Kenneth Oye http://web.mit.edu/polisci/people/faculty/kenneth-oye.html for an hour long seminar to the team on a discussion on the implications of our project ideas. During the course of our conversation with Professor Oye, we first went through several case studies in biological research before turning our attention in working to analyze our own project for risk, safety, legal, or ethical concerns.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," the splicing reaction at position 168/169 compared to the flexible assembly by the mere proximity of the split halves. However the reconstitution of mRFP was clearly visible on the Western Blot (Figure 6). Instead, splicing of sfGFP seems to have failed. This can be attributed to the missing extein residues, which we omitted in order to avoid a large amino acid scar in front of the chromophore region. The reconstitution of mRFP is also visible in the samples that include both LOV- mutants and were irradiated by light, but not in the samples that were kept in darkness. However the right control, a LOV-mutant that is kept in the dark for 4 hours is missing. Therefore this experiment needs to be repeated – and we definitely will do so after Wiki freeze! Altogether the regulation of proteins by light is state of the art and a very important tool in molecular biology.

Multi Cells Oscillation Simulation
We notice that a single oscillator cell would not excrete enough propionate to lower blood pressure - we need a group of them. Standing on the basis that a single cell would generate periodical signal, we wanted to know if a group of these cells would oscillate as well. So we built a computer model to simulate this situation.
Methods
1.Establish behaviors of cells according to life circle of E.coli;
2.Investigate reasonable parameters set from previous researches;
3.Use Q-Q plot to find the correspodent time intervals in experiment data and simulation data; comparing them after normalization using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Background
Life cycle of E.coli is approximately 60 minutes. They would take 40 minutes preparing for cell fission and during that time  they will express proteins, which in our case is mRFP. Then they would start to divide themselves and cease to express protein in a 20 minutes interval. In terms of death of cells, according to logistic model of cell population, death rate is linear to population itself. Based on this, we set that a certain amount of cells, which is proportion to squares of population, would be killed due to limited food. Those cells are picked randomly.
In terms of population of cells, we take real-life situation in to consideration. For safety( Frequently Asked Question ), we planned to wrap our engineered cells into microencapsulation to avoid direct contact with human intestine. Such drug deliver system is called OCDDS . Bacteria concentration in microencapsulation can reach $10^{10}cfu/mL$ and diameter of microencapsulation can reach 433 67μm. For convenience, we assumed that each monocolony originated from a single bacteria. Based on that, the number of bacteria are approximately 81713~208333. We set the population to 100,000.
Moreover, we assumed that the quantity of AraC are linear with plasmid copies. Given a specific environment, the number of initial plasmid copies are a constant. The replication of plasmids can be thought to be completed instantly (within 0.05min). When cells started to divide, the plasmids are allocated into"

UW iGEM OUTREACH PROJECTS 2011-12
Our Mission: Raise awareness on issues concerning synthetic biology to make informed, fact-based opinions.
Introduction
This year’s UW iGEM’s Outreach sub-team has learnt a lot from its experiences. We were met with a few hurdles with regards to planning and implementing the myriad of events we had hoped to have to engage our community.  Though with every step there was much to be learnt and we have decided to discuss all the great events we did have planned and are in the process of planning. Along with that we thought it would be a great resource to create a guide that discussed various different types of outreach events you can hold and what hurdles you could potentially face (as we did) in terms of implementation.
Successes Despite the barriers that we faced, we still had numerous successes. We were still able to develop Community Bricks for most of our programs so other Outreach members can implement them as well. The Community Bricks we were able to post include:
1. Grade 11 Synthetic Biology Workshop Program with Interactive Activities
2. DIY, At Home Gel Electrophoresis
3. Basic Lab Training Workshops
4. Communications Plan Template and Example for Your Large-Scale Outreach Programs
5. Tips and Tricks to Have a Successful Outreach Event
As well as…
Educational Video Podcast featuring the iGEM Outreach Lead Ekta Bibra on Synthetic Biology for Virtual Researcher On Call (organization providing educational resources to students and teachers through online web conferences or podcasts in Ontario, Canada). This material will be openly available for students and teachers to view and learn from across the province. This will be available for you to view at the regionals this year!
As well, we are working on a core social media campaign in which we amplify awareness with minimal costs, gain a larger audience base to ease overall promotion and easily apply Outreach’s over-arching goal of raising awareness"

However, we gived up them as there were problems in generation counting and expression system in yeast used to making bread. Then, our instructor suggested us to look over more projects in privious years and get inspired. We did that in our spare time, exchanged information, and brainstormed new ideas together.
May
After several rounds of discussion, we decided our topic shall be bonding circular mRNA with ribothermometer. The former is based on the mechanism of T4 intron system, and the later takes the advantage of the temperature dependent-second structure of the RNA. Several experiment protocols were settled with the preliminary experimental design. According to the preliminary experimental planning, the gene sequence was compiled.
Later in May, we also held an iGEM public speech in our university, both professors and students were involved, to get a better understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM.

This year, he went back to his homeland Indonesia, where he has become a Dean of Technobiology Faculty ofSumbawa University of Technology and started an iGEM team with the 1st year students at his new university. About a few weeks ago, our instructor Prof. Sode visited their team and made his stay a very present time. Prof. Sode came bakc to Japan telling us how impressive Sumbawagen's laboratory work has been, however, he also told us that they were having problems uploading data on their wiki. It did not take us a long time to decide on helping them, so we immediately took contact with their team to start the cooperation.

Silk fibers from yesterday were soaked overnight in their respective coagulation baths (isopropanol and ethanol)
Today, we placed the fibers in ddH2O to rinse them
Took some samples onto microscope slides in order to image
Left the rest of the fibers on weigh boats to dry off
The silk is incredibly difficult to handle. We absolutely need a mechanical draw in order to handle the fibers better in the future!
Fibers were extremely brittle.
Overview of these fibers
15% w/v silk dope
Spun into 70% v/v ethanol or isopropanol
Used a 1 mL syringe attached to 0.0005 inch inner diameter PEEK tubing
extruded at a nominal rate of 6 uL/min on the syringe pump
After spinning, left in coagulation bath overnight
Then bathed in water
Then taken out and left to dry
Overall, it seems so far that ethanol is better than isopropanol as a coagulation bath. However, until we incorporate a mechanical post-spin draw, we can't say for sure.
Images of Silk spun into isopropanol
4x magnification
10x magnification
20x magnification
40x magnification
Those appear to be cracks
20x magnification
Notice the split: we were probably imaging multiple fibers, instead of one. This shows how difficult it is to handle individual fibers while they're still wet!
40x magnification
This is the edge of the fiber where we broke it.
Images of silk spun into ethanol

Notice how compared to the isopropanol spun fiber, the morphology is much more smooth and uniform for the ethanol fiber. I wonder how these would look under electron microscopy?

SAFETY
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada.
Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work, students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire: long pants, closed-toed shoes, and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge are equipped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eyewash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment, management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.
The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by ""Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.""
The potential harm of our system is the escape of our system into the purified water after wastewater treatment and tailings ponds, which could disrupt the ecosystem once the water is released back into the river.
Although our system could potentially escape into the environment if it is integrated into wastewater treatment, it is unlikely. This is because we would ensure UV disinfection. UV disinfection causes damage to genetic material, causing microbial inactivity, as the organisms cannot replicate. Even in the case that our organism escapes, it would be unlikely that it would cause detriment to the environment because we engineered them"

Stimulated Plastic Enzymolysis
Background
Since completely synthetic plastic materials came out in 1900s, it was used more and more extensively due to its cheapness and durability. Nowadays, plastics has covered our lives in many areas. However, it is slow to degrade, which has led to serious plastic pollution.
Plastic reduction efforts have occurred in some areas in attempts to reduce plastic consumption and pollution and promote plastic recycling. Scientists have come up with many methods in order to solve white pollution, such as landfill, incineration and chemical decomposition. It is a good idea to degrade plastics by enzymes. Compared with the traditional physical and chemical methods, it costs lower power and is more environmental. However, biological method has much lower degradation efficiency. Therefore, improving the efficiency of biological plastic degradation has no time to delay.
Plastic degradation is not only of vital importance for solving environmental pollution. For example, enzymatic recycling of PET basically would break down the polymer into its building blocks ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TA), which have a high value and can be reused in chemical synthesis, including the production of PET. This would avoid current limitations in plastic recycling, which requires pure plastic fractions or has to fight with enrichment of contaminants [1]. At the same time, it provides a new method for plastic surface modification, making it possible for applying finishing compounds and coloring agents.
Figure 9. The reaction of plastic degradation
Among all kinds of plastics, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plays a major role. It is the most commonly used synthetic fiber (25 million tonnes produced annually worldwide) and is forecasted to account for almost 50% of all fiber materials in 2008[2]. PET hydrolysis can be achieved by enzymes from distinct classes, such as esterases, lipases, and cutinases, the latter thereby yielding the most promising results [3]. Hence, we choose three kinds of cutinases for our project – FsC (Fusarium solani cutinase), LC (leaf-branch compost cutinase) and Thc_Cut1 (Thermobifida cellulosilytica cutinase). Especially, FsC was used and by TU_Darmstadt in 2012 iGEM, and LC by UC_Davis in 2012 iGEM.
Our Goal
1. Stimulate PET hydrolysis by FsC, LC and Thc_Cut1 with addition of four kinds of Janus"

SYNTHETISCHE BIOLOGIE
Synthetische Biologie ist im Grunde die Fusion von Biologie und Ingenieurswesen und kann grob als das Design und die Konstruktion von neuen biologischen Einheiten wie z.B. Enzymen, genetischen Kreisläufen und Zellen oder die Neugestaltung von bereits existierenden biologischen Systemen definiert werden.  Das Ziel dieser sich relativ neu und schnell entwickelnden Wissenschaft ist es, neue biologische Systeme und Funktionen zu entwickeln und zu konstruieren, denen man sonst in der Natur nicht begegnet.
Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen wenden Wissenschaftler hauptsächlich folgende zwei sog. Tools(Werkzeuge) an: Bei dem ersten Tool handelt es sich um einen lebenden Organismus(z.B. Mikroorganismen wie Bakterien, Hefen oder sogar Säugerzellen), der später die neu synthetisierte DNA-Element, was lediglich ein Gen eines ganz anderen Organismus sein kann, aufnehmen und somit als ein ,,Gestell’’ dienen soll.
Als zweites werden sog. BioBricks benötigt. Dies sind fertige DNA-Bausteine mit vollständig definierter Struktur und Funktion, die bereit sind untereinander vereint und anschlieβend in lebende Organismen wie z.B. E.Coli übertragen zu werden.
ANWENDUNGSBEREICHE
Der Begriff ,,Synthetische Biologie’’ umfasst eine breite Neudefinition und Expansion der Biotechnologie. Das Ziel dieser neuen Disziplin ist es gentechnisch modifizierte biologische Systeme zu entwerfen und zu bauen, Informationen zu verarbeiten, chemische Stoffe zu manipulieren, innovative Materiale und Stoffe oder sogar Energie zu produzieren, Nährstoffe anzuschaffen und die Gesundheit der Menschheit und unser Umwelt"
NEFU_China,2014,Team:NEFU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," employ a variety of mechanisms to rid the cell of these potentially lethal  toxins have evolved employ. In most cases, the expression of such resistance  systems is controlled at the level of transcription by metal sensor proteins  that sense specific metal ions via their direct coordination [1]. The most famous  resistance system is smtB-OP-smtA device which defends metal ions including Zn2+,  Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+[2-4].
Briefly, the protein SmtB which has four potential  metal binding sites as known as α3, α3N, α5 and α5C [4] generally function as a  repressor in the absence of metal ions and become activators upon metal  binding, by driving a metal-induced DNA conformational switch that converts a  sub-optimal promoter (OP-promoter) into a potent one, then activate the  expression of smtA. And different from Zn2+ resistance mechanisms,  Cd2+ binds SmtB at the site α3N [5].
In previous reports, the smtB-OP-smtA element which located in Staphylococcus may also functions as a metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+) responsive repressor in E. coli [6-8].
In our project, we wanted to use pigments as reporters in our designed genetic construction which can be recognizable by the naked eyes. According to the previous work, we have chosen an identified pigment in the Registry: the biobrick of amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ) was used as reporter gene in our metal detection device. After exchanging the biobrick part with SmtA in smtB-OP-smtA device, the pigment gene was under control of metal-induced promoter (smtB-OP).

To end our presentation, we invited them to attend to our grill for raising funds so we could be able to start with our wet lab.
Meeting with Beekeepers
“Feedback between researcher and producer is very important because, this way, we can collaborate more effectively, ensuring a two-way communication.”
These were the words beekeepers from our community told us when we presented them our first bee project proposal in one of their monthly meetings. Here was when we started looking for external support and found great results. We found out that these meetings take place every first Saturday of the month in Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, Mexico, where beekeepers discuss and plan activities in benefit of bees.
We looked and spoke to the president of the Beekeepers Society in Cuauhtémoc looking for his approval and feedback about the project. He was very gentle and invited us
to one of their beekeeper’s meetings for us to get closer with the community directly related to bees.
We attended this meeting on May 5th of 2018 where 32 beekeepers gave us a space to present them our project proposal.
“Almost no beekeeper is related to science, they said, they only buy products against bee pathogens that they hear are great for their beehives.”
Thanks to this, we strongly believe that the knowledge we have acquired along these months working with synthetic biology doesn't deserve to stay with us in the lab. For this reason, more people need to know that science has improved, creating innovative and less risking solutions to agricultural issues and biodiversity in general. Thanks to this comment we decided to work hard for Education and Public Engagement, we wanted to get to people’s hearts so they could create their own point of view for these situations.
Was here when we explained to them what synthetic biology involved and how we were working with it to aid the beekeeping field.
We could identify one of their greatest fears in the beekeeping business, but the question is, fear of what? Simple, they are afraid that their honey is rejected by European countries when they export it due to the use of GMOs since they are an essential Mexican honey buyer.
Here we could learn and detect one of the most important problems in beekeeping and got more convinced that proposing a scientific solution to this problems could help them broaden their horizons. We needed to make sure that they understood how synthetic biology worked without needing to leave GMOs in the resulting honey, which we"
British_Columbia,2017,Team:British Columbia#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," combination of the PAM site is 5’ - NGG - 3’. In any DNA sequence, S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 can only bind and cut locations with a PAM site. For example, CRISPR/Cas9 with a guide sequence of ATGCTTACGTAGCTCCATGT could could bind to a DNA fragment with the sequence ATGCTTACGTAGCTCCATGTNGG (where N is any nucleotide), but could not bind to a sequence ATGCTTACGTAGCTCCATGTNCG due to the absence of a PAM site; the PAM is essential to DNA cleavage with CRISPR/Cas9.
But what about a CRISPR/Cas9 complex with a guide that didn’t match the 20 nucleotide sequence, but has a PAM site? According to Farasat and Salis (2016), the binding efficiency for CRISPR/Cas9 is determined by the Gibbs free energy released by complementary nucleotide binding and the energy spent uncoiling the DNA complex. The likelihood that the CRISPR/Cas9 complex binds to a DNA fragment is reduced due to each mismatched sequence between the sgRNA and the guide strand. Mismatches closer to the PAM site reduce the likelihood of binding more than matches further away from the PAM site. This effect is likely caused by the mechanism of sgRNA binding, theorized to bind to the strand like a zipper starting from the PAM site.
To calculate the total Gibbs free energy release (∆G) for a given protospacer, the following equation is used:
∆GPAM
This is the free energy released from binding of Cas9 to the PAM site. It is calculated by using preset experimental values for the free energy release when Cas9 binds to various iterations of NGG, such as AGG or CGG.
∆Gprotospacer
This is the free energy released from binding of the protospacer to the complementary DNA  sequence. In principle, mismatched bases between the sgRNA and the DNA strand will reduce the free energy release, making binding between the guide and the target less favorable. In addition, mismatches impact adjacent nucleotide pairings, so energy loss data for mismatched nucleotides must be considered in pairs (Figure 1). The energy lost due to a mismatch must be multiplied by a distance factor; mismatches closer to the PAM cause relatively greater changes in free energy, while mismatches further from the PAM site had less effect overall on the energy"

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#HumanPractices2_-_-_TEXT.html," our 80 minute presentation focuses on an activity called Central Dogma Relay.The goal of this activity was to get kids moving and understand how DNA codes for proteins. They were given a coding sequence (white) the complementary strand codons (blue) the mRNA codons (green) and the amino acid (orange). We reversed engineered sequences of DNA so that the amino acid strand would spell things like ""Penn State"" and ""Science"". We received a lot of positive feedback and were offered the opportunity to present again in the fall as part of ScienceU's STEM showcase.
This experience builds on the reputation set up by Penn State's iGEM teams in previous years as a very knowledgeable and accessible group that is committed to educating others. It can be continued by future iGEM teams, and was so popular this year that it could easily be expanded to include more students in future years. We believe that through this type of community involvement, especially with the energy and creativity level that is typical of iGEM teams, a strong foundation will be created that the next generation of engineers will spring off of.
The foundation that we built on.
Engineering a Metabolic Pathway: ROUND 2
As the second part of our presentation, we talked about how we designed our project and the different aspects that are important when you are thinking about a plasmid. This was a little more technical, but the kids caught on very quickly and every group was able to construct their own plasmid. I think that this reinforces the idea that this is a quick activity that teachers can take to the classroom and use to teach their students about genetic engineering. This type of repeat-ability is what gives our outreach a stronger impact. Much like a part in the registry, we took a concept for community involvement that has been used by previous iGEM teams, improved it, repeated it, and set the stage for it to be even better next year.

Introduction
One person, many communities
Within our iGEM team we have individuals belonging to the biology community, the physics community and the computer science community. In this context we use community to refer to a community of interest - a group of likeminded individuals operating within the same field of knowlege. We are all members of the St Andrews community, some of us are also members of the London community, the Edinburgh community and the Aberdeenshire community. Here we describe a community of place, a group of people living in close proximity and sharing the same enviroment. These two seperate notions of community both share very similar underpinnings. In any context of community the common denomonator is groups of people. Traditionally all communites were bound by some form of geographical limitations.  For instance for the longest time eastern and western mathematics developed within seperate communies, however both communities devleoped convergent ideas. Today, largely thanks to mass communication, we live in global communities, as a part of the iGEM community our team has ties with people all around the world.
This page represents our work in attempting to understand how the iGEM and synthetic biology community works and opearates and draws comparisons with earlier models of community. Our findings are presented in the following essay:

Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project is considered the father of Free Software however he does not believe that at the current stage of development that Free Software principles can be applied to synthetic biology. In an interview with reddit.com Mr Stallman claimed that realistically we are decades off being able to full comprehend the base genetic code behind both humans and bacteria and as such until we reach that point we will be unable to generate a Free Software like community around synthetic biology. The reason for this Stallman suggests is that genetic code is akin to"

Chitin Deacetylases NodB and COD
Chitosan is a polymeric product of deacetylated chitin, which exists in a wide variety of patterns differing in their degree of deacetylation. Our goal is to design chitosan oligomers with a specific pattern of deacetylation. It can then be used for the production of our hydrogels.
We implemented chitin deacetylases originating from the organisms Sinorhizobium meliloti (NodB) and Vibrio cholerae (COD) into our E. coli cells. These enzymes deacetylate chitin individually. NodB targets the first position of the non-reducing end, while COD works similarly on the second unit. By implementing an orthogonal expression system to regulate the patterns, designer chitosan could be adjusted to the respective task. This would allow the expression of each enzyme separately, creating a defined deacetylation pattern.
What are Chitin Deacetylases?
Chitin deacetylases (CDA) mostly occur in marine bacteria, few in insects, and several in fungi  [1] .
In fungi, for example, CDAs are involved in cell wall formation, sporulation, and catabolism of chitin oligosaccharides. Many plant fungal pathogens secrete CDAs during plant infection. Plants only detect fungal infections by registering chitin. Fungi “turn invisible” by deacetylating chitin into chitosan and thus, outwit the plant defence system  [2] .
The CDAs generate chitosan oligomers from chitin by deacetylating the N-acetylglucosamine units of the substrate  [3] . During deacetylation, acetic acid is cleaved off from a glucosamine unit. Some CDAs may even deacetylate chitosan, creating a double deacetylated oligomer  [2] .
Chitin deacetylases belong to the carbohydrate esterase family 4. All family members, including NodB protein and chitin deacetylases, share the same primary structure called “NodB homology domain” or “polysaccharide deacetyl"

June 2013
Week 1 (10-16 June)
During this week litterature searches about biological logic gates and protocols were performed.
We also began to plan the lab work for the following weeks. We started to take an inventory of necessary biobricks already available in plates supplied by the MIT and to mail former iGEM teams to receive the others.
Project complet scheme elaboration with all the needeed biobricks.
Week 2 (17-23 June) We wondered about the use of another strain DH5-1, with a faster growth and so a reduction of waiting times. Reflexions were also performed about the integration strategy of our system in the bacterial host E. coli.
In parallel, we finalized the final global diagram of our system and intermediate constructions for characterizations (light sensors, carry diffusion (AHL) and general inducer (atC)). These ones have been divided up between team members to start first clonings.
New search and amplification of biobricks with rbs and terminators if possible.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,"
As we need to establish data for promoter strength in C. difficile as well as E. coli, we needed to find an alternative assay that would work for anaerobic organisms. The GFP protein requires oxygen in order to form properly and fluoresce meaning it is not suitable as a reporter gene in this context. The Β-Glucuronidase encoded by gusA functions as a very sensitive and specific reporter gene in anaerobic organisms. The seven plasmids used in the GFP assay were modified to replace the gfp gene with gusA using NdeI and SpeI. For six of the seven gusA reporter plasmids cloning was successful with sequencing of the gusA showing no mutations. However, every clone of PCac_thl –gusA exhibited mutations within gusA. This is likely because of the toxin impact of gusA on E. coli and the very high expression levels of PCac_thl as shown in the GFP assay.
The six successfully cloned gusA reporter plasmids were transformed into a conjugative strain of E. coli named Sexpress. Sexpress was then used to transfer the reporter plasmids into C. difficile where the gusA assay proceeded.
The gusA assay was performed in 96 well plates in a plate reader using a similar protocol to the interlab study, except that 16 hour cultures were used rather than 6 hour, and the cells were lysed using lysozyme and sonication. The substrate for the Β-Glucuronidase, 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (4-MUG), was added to the cell lysate immediately before the assay, and the production of the fluorescent compound 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was tracked over 30 minutes. The rate of change in absorbance over this time period was recorded by the plate reader, and the gradient of the linear portion of the curve was calculated in order to give an indication of the quantity of Β-Glucuronidase in each strain. The results of the gusA assay are shown in the graph below.
None of the three existing registry promoters (BBa_J23106, BBa_J23114, and BBa_J23119) showed any detectable level of expression. This is somewhat unsurprising given that they are native to the distantly related E. coli, though they do have a ribosome binding region from clostridia which was intended to allow them to function in C. difficile. Of the two toxin promoters native to C"

15/08/2011 - Team Amsterdam among favourites
Team Amsterdam has been pointed out as one of the teams to keep your eye on during the competition by Christian Lund, a medicine student from Denmark. He participated in last year's iGEM competition, and is now following the different teams.
Lund wrote a previous blog about the teams of Cambridge and Bielefeld , but in his latest blog he wrote solely about the Amsterdam team. He called the project very ambitious and impressive. “The project has the wow-factor; imagine E. coli growing at freezing temperatures, that’s impressive!” Although the project has already partly been done, the team has a new and exciting approach. Using the results of previous teams and elaborate those results is following the iGEM spirit. “Some guys have created bacteria that can grow at low temperatures; let’s drop the temperature another couple to degrees to freezing!” Read the full article here .
The expectations for the Amsterdam team are high and the competition is enormous, but the team is confident about the project and is looking forward to the jamboree.

Therefore the OD measurement that is usually performed when conducting the β-galactosidase assay would not be accurate enough. The protein concentration of the fungal samples were instead determined by a Bradford assay. For the Bradford assay a standard dilution series with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were made in order to determine the protein concentrations. The protein samples and BSA standards were mixed with Bradford reagent. The procedure is based on the dye, Brilliant Blue G (Sigma-Aldrich), that forms a complex with the proteins in solution. This dye-protein complex results in a shift of the absorption maximum of the dye from 465nm to 595nm, where the absorption is proportional to protein present.
For the β-galactosidase assay, a solution of o–nitrophenyl-β–D–galactoside (ONPG) was used to measure the  activity of β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase hydrolyses ONPG to o–nitrophenol at a linear rate until ONPG is completely degraded. In other words, the amount of o-nitrophenol produced is proportional to the amount of β-galactosidase present in the sample (6). This can be seen as a yellow colour that becomes more and more intense as the degradation proceeds.
Protein extracts were mixed with Z-buffer in a microtiter plate. ONPG solution was added, and OD420 was measured every minute for 20 minutes. The specific activities were calculated using the equation below.
Where:
Abs420 = the absorbance of o-nitrophenol measured.
the factor 1.7 corrects for the reaction volume.
0.0045 is the absorbance of a 1 nmol/mL o-nitrophenol solution.
[p] = the concentration of protein [mg/mL]
v = volume of culture assayed [mL]
t = the reaction time [min]
Specific activities for the three promoters were calculated according to the equation above. The specific activities of the promoters are an expression of the specific activity of β-galactosidase. All measurements in the figures are for the time: 5 minutes. The mean specific promoter activity for each sample (based on triplicates) is shown below.

Until that happens, I’m content to read a good book, knit, or do crossword puzzles to pass the time outside the lab. Best wishes!

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be going into my second of four years in the B.Sc Biochemistry program. This is my first year competing in the iGEM competition and I am extremely excited. When I am not in the lab I enjoy sleeping, eating and spending time with family/friends. Oh wait! Movies are pretty good too! Thanks for taking the time to read my bio.

Hi, my name is Makay Murray (and yes there is to letter ‘c’ in my name, but everyone thinks there should be) I’m currently collecting pre-requisites for Radiology witch I plan to take in 2013. I was invited onto iGEM by Isaac and felt that actually working with bacteria in a lab would be very enlightening to know the deeper workings of cellular activity and how to manipulate these natural processes to create something new. While at school I am also the host of a CKXU 88.3fm radio show entitled University Power Users where I talk about stuff that I think students should know but will never be taught in any classroom. When I’m not at school I’m either working at Able Dental Group as a IT tech or enjoying the wonders of technology by playing various videogames like minecraft, DayZ and Halo.

I am a third year neuroscience major with an interest in utilizing synthetic biology for medical application. Outside of my scientific interests I enjoy rock climbing, diving, playing RPGs, long walks on the beach, gazing at the stars….wait a minute…. this isn’t eHarmony. Anyway I was born in B.C, but I have lived in Ontario, Nova Scotia, California, Connecticut and The Marshall Islands throughout my life. In addition to living the peripatetic life of an academic bohemian (I am also known for having the pretension rivaling that of a Cambridge trained actor), I am also pursuing the conventional aspiration of developing the first virulent strain of bacteria that will help usher in the new zombie apocalypse (Seriously, this is like the space race among science undergrads).

uOttawa's 2015 project is based on the project from 2014. Thanks to the entire 2014 team for all the hard work.
The wet lab team consisted of Martin Hanzel, Ashna Parbhakar, Erin Nguyen, Valerie Desjardins, and Alex Ross. All members helped design and build our DNA constructs. Martin Hanzel was reponsible for collecting data by flow cytometry, and creating biobricks.
Much of our work is based on years of research by graduate students in Mads Kaern's lab. In particular, Ian Roney constructed a large library of strains that serve as a scaffold for DNA assembly and transformation. We'd like to thank all of the grad students: Ian Ronay, Hilary Phenix, Nada Elnour, and Vaibhav Gupta for their infinite wisdom and support.
Many thanks go to Mila Tepliakova, our lab technician, who helped train new members and always kept the lab stocked and tidy.
Lastly, we'd like to recognize our supervisor, Mads Kaern, who generously provides lab space and the resources we need to participate in iGEM year after year.

Fix the plate with a sodium thiosulfate so that the light sensitivity will be arrested.
The photograph produced by this technology make the light sensing possible. However, it cost much time. To photograph a portrait, the plate needs to be exposed about half an hour, so many guests had to act as petrified for a long time.
Film - Faster and  Easiler
Fig.3
Later, photographic film was invented and had been widely used for a long time before the birth of digital imaging. The film is a strip or a sheet with transparent plastic film base. One side of it contains gelatin emulsion with light-sensitive silver halide, normally silver bromide, crystals. Because film yields transparent negatives with light-dark or colors, artists need to develop the film to its opposites and finally receive the made-up articles they want. The size and amount of crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of pictures. Films are also affected by physics of silver grain activity and random grain activity by photons. Latterly, color photograph was invented by photographic engineers. The principle of the works is to build at least three layers to make the crystals sensitive to different colors. Usually, blue-sensitive layer is on the top followed with the green and red layers and at present, practically a film contains 12 with more than 20 different kinds of chemical in each layers for chromatic imaging.
Charge-coupled device (CCD) Sensor - Digitization
Fig.4
Charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor was invented in 1969 at AT&T Labs by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith who were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for physics for their invention of this imaging semiconductor circuit. The pixels in this device are represented by p-doped MOS capacitors. The CCD sensor contains a photoactive region, which is an epitaxial layer of silicon, and a transmission region made of shift register. The operation mechanism is as follow. Firstly, capture imaging pictures in photoactive region. Then the photoactive region will accumulate an electric charge proportional to the light intensity at that location. After that, the transmission region will receive the signal and dump into a charge amplifier. Later, the charge signal will be converted into voltage and at last the information will be sampled, digitized and stored.

The solvent contains the other parts and allows for the ink to be stored in liquid form as well and it will evaporate rapidly as they are volatile and will leave the resin and solvent on the substrate. If we were to ever apply our pigments to printer ink we would need to very carefully control the proportions of pigments resin and solvent as printer require a specific and controlled viscosity in order to correctly use the ink.
Proof of Concept
When we were investigating what our proof of concept should be, we talked to the business liaison at the University of Lethbridge Greg Vilk, and he proposed we do a ""simple showcase"". He explained that in order to show that our project can work as intended, we need only to prove the concept in the easiest way (for more information concerning our interview with Greg Vilk, click here ). For our proof of concept, we intend make an ink with pigments extracted from an alternate source and put them into fountain pens. We bought common supplement tablets (Lutein tablets, which contain lutein and zeaxanthin and cranberry extract tablets, which contain anthocyanin). We attempted an extraction of the pigments using either acetone or water (Figure 2). Both solvents were able to extract pigment, but they resulted in different shades and intensities of colour. (Figure 2 and 3). Guar gum was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to increase the viscosity of the ink and help it bind to surfaces. The guar gum thickened the water based inks, but precipitated in the acetone based inks (Figure 2).

Lots of examples show that human over-exploitation of the natural world, as a significant amount of debt owed to nature, will always suffer because they cannot repay the revenge of nature in the whole human history. Industrial society will do more damage to the environment with a larger scale and higher speed consuming natural resources than agricultural community.
According to the book named ""Limits to Growth"" written by DH Meadows, coal, oil, metals and other non-renewable resources will exhauste 2100 ago. Even though this estimate has some exaggerated factors, we could not pass up these resources for centuries in any case. In another side, renewable resource, such as fertile land, forests, flora and fauna, air and water, has suffered a permanent damage result from the development of industrial world. The global wildlife has been facing a major crisis.
Perspective on the current level of industrial development: In the past 10 years, papers from biotechnology and medicine are 49% of the natural sciences all over world; recently, about 40% to 50% of annual Top Ten scientific and technological achievements are in life scientific fields at home and abroad. biotechnology industry based on biotechnology and life sciences makes more progress, and has introduced new products and new patents. Biotechnology industry has become an international technological competition as well as the focus of economic competition, and it will also become a powerful weapon to help humans live in harmony with nature.

Everyone need help
Collaborations in iGEM competition is very important because it makes connection between teams and it makes us realize how is important to help each other. This year, our team tried to help several teams and some team helped us in order to success our project.
iGEM Aix-Marseille helped us to validate our model. They worked on the paper « Dynamics of plasmid transfer on surfaces » writen by Lone Simonsen. They had to search and organize the papers data to compare it to our computationnal results.
After a Skype meeting with iGEM INSA-Lyon, they helped us on our model by suggesting us a mathematical model for bacterial growth. We also hosted two of their members during their visit for a conference related to aptamers in Bordeaux.
Because we were overflowed with work, iGEM Toulouse made a graphical representation on blender to illustrate our safety model and create a 3D animation of our logo (see our pages Home and Model ).
On our part, we participated to their video project where we have explained in french some essential protocols used in synthetic biology. Click there to their videos.
For their Human Practices part, iGEM EPFL created a website to highlight the iGEM team of the 2016 edition. We had the honors to be inside their site, check out our article there .
We helped iGEM Tel-Hai by participating to their project « 65 roses Campaign » in order to bring out Cystic Fibrosis. We have to post a photo of us holding a rose in order to raise awareness amongst the general public and raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Israel.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee_-_-_TEXT.html,".
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
