After 3 hours, I pelleted the bacteria and processed them before (incubate with chloroform and nuclease, then pellet.) The purified lysates were slightly cloudy.
I poured the supernatants back into the original flasks and incubated them overnight to see if this was a possible way to produce a high-titer lysate of phage.
The purification group also centrifuged (in CsCl gradient) the T4 stock and the T4 LB mutagenesis / lysis inhibition sample.  After dialysis, they will return individual fractions to us.
7/19/13 Today I processed the flasks I had let incubate overnight beginning with just the phage supernatant.  After 24 hours, the flasks were completely turbid.  After processing, the high titer lysates were not as turbid as the previous ones, showing this is not an ideal way to grow large concentrations of phage.
I also received the pictures from the phage purification group of the cesium chloride gradient results.  The mutagenized phage stock showed a clear (but slightly denser) normal size band, a faint petite band, and no band where large phage should be.  They were separated into five fractions (two petite, two normal, and 1 large).
7/22/13 Today we discussed plans for our children's book and community outreach. We edited the pre and post test. The purification group did the dialysis on the samples.  When they are done, we will titer the five fractions.
I also typed the following procedure for the small phage group to help them in their mutagenesis.
Mutagenesis experiment: In a 250 mL flask, add 25 mL LB broth, 20 ug/mL adenine, and 1 loop of E. coli bacteria. Let incubate on shaker at 37C for ~2 hours until moderately turbid. At this point, you can pellet the bacteria and resuspend it in minimal (M9) media or leave it in the LB broth (unpelleted). At this point, add another 20 ug/mL of adenine, 20 ug/mL of uracil, 200 ug/mL of bromodeoxyuridine (mutagen), and the appropriate amount of phage (we use 1x10^9 pfu) for the bacterial concentration you have. Let incubate on shaker at 37C for 3 hours"

It reminds me that when I was in University, these questions interested me a lot: Is it real, artificial, natural? And I analyzed movies as « The Fly » or also « Jurassic Park”. Because I wondered if these dinosaurs were really natural as they where artificially produced from DNA found. I think with your project you really highlight all these issues, about the fact that synthetic biology blurs border between the living and the nonliving, the artificial and the natural, the real and the artificial.
Alexei Grinbaum : Your project is to recreate the exact copy of the “natural” lemon with bacteria. It will have the same exterior view and may have the same interior composition. Only with our simple view we cannot distinguish who is who. However, can we consider that these two lemon are the same? Yes, your project raise this question about the bounder between natural and artificial
Emmanuel Hirsch: It is very interesting to distinguish what you are doing, to say that you are participating in the education of society/social awareness by highlighting what is possible with Synthetic Biology. You intervene to say that there are new opportunities, but limited to an artistic/aesthetics aspect (odor, color, shape ...), in order to raise questions. It's a great ethical approach. This is a “limited” process that you define by yourself and that no one has forced you to do. Ethics do not impose anything because ethical reflection will always lag behind the scientific and technical progress.""

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA message, Mori.
Mori includes an invertible promoter switch. When flipped, it leads to production of M13 gene VIII and T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) from Mmod
The F+ primary receiver population receives Mori, and in the presence of a particular stimulus modifies and retransmits it.
Primary receivers carry a helper plasmid with gene VIII knockout, as well as inducible integrase expression
Upon induction of integrase, the switch on the Mori messaging phagemid flips and gene VIII expression complements the helper plasmid, allowing retransmission of Mmod.
The F+ secondary receiver population exhibits a detectable behavior (ie fluorescent protein production) upon receipt of Mmod.
T7 RNAP expression from Mmod causes expression of a fluorescent protein in secondary receivers.
Note that secondary receivers may also receive Mori, since all three populations are present in co-culture, and that primary receivers can also receive M¬mod.
Figure 1. The sender population transmits a DNA message, which is modified and retransmitted by primary receivers in the presence of a particular stimulus. The secondary receiver population exhibits a detectable behavior (eg fluorescent protein expression) when it receives the modified message.
The dynamics and potential modes of failure of this system are explored through mathematical modeling.
MODELLING
We sought to combine controlled transmission and modification of a DNA message to design a system wherein receiver cells are able to modify a DNA message by flipping an invertible promoter switch and then retransmit the modified message. The system is summarized in Figure 1 (see the Design section for more details).
Figure 2. The sender population transmits a DNA message, which is modified and retransmitted by primary receivers in the presence of a particular stimulus. The secondary receiver population exhibits a detectable behavior (eg fluorescent protein expression) when it receives the modified message.
The key output of this system is secondary receiver cells that have received a modified message and are fluorescing. This output can be evaluated in two different scenarios, where modification and retransmission are:
Induced: We want as many secondary receivers as possible carrying the modified message.
Uninduced: We want as few secondary receivers as possible carrying the modified message.
This system may be prone to several undesired outcomes (Figure 2) outlined below:
1. False negative: Since populations are co-cultured, secondary receivers can also receive the original unmodified message (M¬ori) that is transmitted by sender cells. When modification and retransmission are induced, there is a risk that secondary receivers might still be overwhelmed with Mori, preventing them"

Electroporation
To transform Lactobacillus acidophilus with the vector we created, we performed electroporation using BTX Gemini X2 Electroporation System. We followed the protocol provided by BTX but can’t get the recombinant strain yet. At this moment, we’re still try testing in different conditions and hope to achieve success in the future.
Summary
Sugar Crush seems an impossible mission to achieve. Ideally in our mind, the product will absorb glucose in the environment efficiently and compete with small intestine which evolutionarily adapt to take up glucose as much as possible. Secondly, the product will commit suicide after sucking up the glucose and leave the gut without sugar. Finally, the product will be harmless or even benefit human health.
In our project this year, we’ve completed at least and submitted 28 BioBrick basic and composite parts to iGEM community in just several months. We should celebrate by ourselves that we’ve already done the impossible work.
In all of these parts engineered by our hands, our favorite and the most exciting part is that we improved and extending the function of existing parts of glucose responsive promoter (Pcar [BBa_K861171]) and a repressor system (RBS-PhlF-T [BBa_K1725041] and PhlF repressible promoter-RBS-GFP [BBa_K1725001]). It’s useful and a proof-of -concept for our product design to demonstrate the suicide circuit is activated in the loss of glucose in the environment (Pcar-wRBS-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP-sRBS-lysis-sRBS-NucA/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230017]).
And the second is the composite parts of transporter devices (CP29-RBS-aeBlue-RBS-crr-RBS-ptsG-TT/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230027] and CP29-RBS-aeBlue-RBS-STM1128-TT/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230028]). We can’t assemble the promoter to drive the genes at first. We didn’t give up and continue trying research the paper and testing with various methods, although we’re advised to change with a regulatory promoter. It’s good news that it eventually comes out we got the recombinant DNA.

Institut Pasteur's first participation to iGEM in 2015, the PlastiCure project, was rewarded with a bronze medal. PlastiCure was a biological system designed to degrade PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) and use the degradation products to synthesize bio-active compounds.
The second participation, the Mos(kit)o project in 2016, was a great success: it was rewarded with a gold medal and 3 special prizes (Best Applied Design, Best Entrepreneurship et Best Diagnostics). The Mos(kit)o was a kit containing a mosquito trap, a diagnostic patch and a mapping tool. The diagnostic patch was biosilica-based and allowed a quick detection of viruses in mosquitoes.
For the third year in a row, the Institut Pasteur hosts a multidisciplinary team composed of Biology (UPMC), Chemistry (Chimie ParisTech), Engineering (CentraleSupélec, Ecole Polytechnique, ESPCI) but also Industrial Design (ENSCI-Les Ateliers), and Intellectual Property Law students (Faculté Jean Monnet, Paris-Saclay University). Two supervisors are also taking part in the adventure with us: Deshmukh Gopaul, Head Design for Biology Center Education Department at the Institut Pasteur, and Guillian Graves, designer in new technologies and teacher at the ENSCI – Les Ateliers. After the success of the 2015 and 2016 teams we have all the assets needed to maintain momentum.

In our STEP system, to improve the affinity of the VEGF-scFv to VEGF, we used Rosetta to help design our protein domain. However, we find that the initial version of VEGF-scFv in parts has no accepted structure in PDD (Protein Data Base). Thus, to improve the reliability of our results, we introduced a new kind of VEGF-scFv that has accepted structure in PDD to iGEM.
Figure 5. The structure of VEGF-scFv and the interface score of modified version of BBa_K2886002 compared with original version and BBa_K1694003. (a) VEGF-scFv is two outermost Ig-like domains of the antibody of VEGF joined together with a GS linker. (b) According to the interface scores which indicate the affinity of VEGF-scFv to VEGF of revised BBa_K2886002, original BBa_K2886002 and BBa_K1694003, we can draw the conclusion that revised BBa_K2886002 probably has a higher affinity to VEGF after our modification.

Over the summer, our iGEM team started corresponding with the Washington University in St. Louis team. We decided to collaborate with one another by testing both of our projects at the same time.
The WashU team is comparing the “effectiveness of several genes on the level of UV radiation tolerance in E. coli”. They are using four genes that provide UV resistance: uvsE, Dsup, phrAC and BCP. This October, they mailed us these four plasmids so we could put them into our chromosome-integrating plasmids (then transform them into yeast).
In our collaboration, we gave the WashU team advice in the building of their UV radiation machine. While we were unable to test their genes this year, we hope to continue our collaboration and further characterize their parts.

Team NUS Singapore
We recieved an invitation from NUS-Singapore to collaborate on our iGEM competition and were excited to pay them a visit.
During our visit, we learned about their project regarding the use of E. coli as a drug delivery system to target cancer cells. The surface marker used for the attachment of E. coli to cancer cells is CD44v6, an isoform of CD44 with exon v6, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed specifically in cancer cells. We thought that it would be meaningful if Team NUS could have a negative control where the cancer cell line already has the CD44v6 knock-ed out. With this cell line, they could test for the targeting specificity of the E. Coli.
With an online search we found that the CD44 gene is heavily spliced to produce different kinds of mutants. CD44v6 is the isoform that is expressing exon v6(tenth exon), which is only present in malignant cancer cell lines. To generate a negative control for Team NUS, we targeted three regions of the CD44 gene. We targeted the first two exons present in all isoforms of CD44 so that they can all be inactivated at once. For the third target site, we made a segmental deletion targeted to exon v6. The target sites were made as far as possible for the splice junctions to prevent disruption of the junction.
gRNA design to target exon v6 for segmental in-frame deletion.
After cloning of the gRNA into the SpCas9 vector that we used for project Evaluation, we then transfected the constructs into HeLa and MDA-231 cells. However, before transfection, we made a mycoplasma test and found out that the cells we obtained from Lab A were mycoplasma contaminated.

Further characterization of the BioBrick K274210 has been performed in Top10 and MG1655 E. coli. The experimental data have shown somewhat similar results for Top10 and MG1655 E. coli.  The experiment was performed as follows:
Over night (ON) cultures were grown from 4 colonies, until the following OD’s were obtained:
Top 10 - no insert                OD = 0,008 (100 x diluted)
Top 10 - with K274210 insert   OD = 0,011 (100 x diluted)
MG1655 - no insert   OD = 0,020 (100 x diluted)
Mg1655 - with K274210 insert  OD = 0,017 (100 x diluted)
ON cultures were grown in 110 ml LB media. Colonies with K274210 insert were grown in LB media containing ampicillin. All ON cultures were grown for 20 hours at 37 °C. After 16 hours, 10 ml of the ON cultures were transferred into 110 ml LB media and grown for 4 hours to reach the exponential phase, where the following OD’s were obtained"

Team Activity Tests: Today was an exciting day for us. We got samples from Team Immobilization for activity measurements. They were trying to analyze which concentration of beads is a good choice for immobilizing the laccases. The exciting part was to check all the solvents they are using for possible reaction with ABTS during measurements. Check Team Immobilization´s Labjournal and protocols for the output and further information.
Team Immobilization:
The 18h samples (see above: Monday August 6th/Team Immobilization and Tuesday August 7th/Team Immobilization) were washed with Britton-Robinson Buffer (link), then with 0.5M NaCl solution and again twice with the buffer.  The 36h samples were treated similarly as the 18h samples (see above: Tuesday August 7th/Team Immobilization). The supernatants were delivered to the “Activity Test” team to measure the activity of the non-bound laccases. Based on the results, we would be able to figure out the most convenient bead concentration and incubation period. After comparing the results, we found out that the activity of the supernatant after 36h was less than after 18h, which indicated that 36h incubation is more convenient"

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology expands, as new innovations are made, and pressing world problems are solved, the potential impact synthetic biology will have on the world becomes more evident. Although a primary goal of developers of synthetic biology should be to consider the ethical, societal, safety, environmental, and political impact of the science, we believe that interest should also be paid unto the impact that synthetic biology will have in the business world.
As a group we are most interested in the course of development of synthetic biology in industry; the goal of our project is to try and decipher the path that synthetic biology will forge as it expands in the business world.
Our attempt to answer this question has begun with a comprehensive inquiry into important factors affecting the diffusion of synthetic biology. It is our opinion that before we attempt to make any conclusive statements about the future direction of synthetic biology or the economy as a whole we must have a complete picture of the current landscape of synthetic biology and the markets it could potentially impact.
This inquiry is intended for use by multiple audiences; particularly scientists and members of business in relevant industries. As scientists it is important to understand the context in which discoveries are made, understanding where world needs lie and how discoveries will impact the world makes for better-informed scientists. Members of the business world should also strive to have an understanding of where the need and rationale for discoveries come from. Although profit is the ultimate endgame a well-informed approach helps to prevent ethical pitfalls and often greater success.
This analysis looks at both extrinsic and intrinsic factors relating to the development of synthetic biology as a whole. In particular intrinsic factors such as the development of synthetic biology in specific industries (biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and bioremediation) is examined in depth. Important extrinsic factors such as the impact of patenting and open source are also analyzed. With this information we feel we have laid the foundations for a comprehensive inquiry that will allow us to better understand what the expansion of synthetic biology in the business world will resemble.
OPEN SOURCING and Synthetic Biology
What is Open Sourcing?
What differentiates synthetic biology from biotechnology is that it offers the creation of systems or pathways that would not be found naturally in an organism. Synthetic biologists believe in a standardized system of parts similar to that of electrical engineers having standard circuits and components1. This is also similar to how LINUX modules have been combined to create different software. This contrasts the closed-parts strategy where developers use such methods as patent protection and secrecy to gain a competitive advantage over others2.  That is why the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has created the initiative for what is known as the “Registry of Standard"

Antibiotic resistance rates of all medical care providing institutions have shown steady decrease from 2007. In 2007, among 5373 Patients of government operating health centers 16.1% have shown antibiotic resistance and 5.5 % multi-drug resistance. Afterward, the ratios have been slightly decreased each year. Meanwhile antibiotic resistance of private health care institutions is much higher: 29.1% in 2007, 19.8% in 2008, 23.6% in 2009, 21.4% in 2010, and 18.4% in 2011 respectively.

Detection System in Korea
MRSA Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most severe antibiotic resistant pathogens causing hospital infection and other diseases such as purulent infection, bacteremia. The isolation ratio of MRSA is gradually increased up to 80% in the hospital, which makes a limitation for treatment of antibiotics because the isolated MRSA show resistance to methicillin as well as other antibiotics. To deal with the spread of MRSA infection, medical community as well as the government have paid acute attention on the surveillance of the infection.
Common used method for the detection of MRSA in the hospitals is Susceptibility Test. Another detection method is MecA gene by PCR, which is not commonly used in the hospitals because of the cost consideration. However mecA is  known to be more accurate than Susceptibility Testing.

In other words, phase separation is a consequence of high molecular concentration i.e. clustering of molecules. Since our system consists out of two proteins which undergo intermolecular interactions, we expect them to cluster and phase separate.

The Scaffold Protein 14-3-3
Over 15 years ago, scientists discovered the first protein scaffolds: proteins that regulate the assembly of other proteins. Scaffold proteins have numerous functions in the cell, one of which is mediating signaling transduction or other networks. [5]These scaffold proteins bind components of a signaling pathway, to help localize signaling to a specific part of the cell or to increase the efficiency of the signaling cascade.[6]
One of the many scaffold proteins is the 14-3-3 protein. It is becoming more popular to use this protein in synthetic biology. The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of proteins which are well preserved in evolution and are present in all eukaryotic cells. Many organisms contain isoforms: smaller and more simplistic eukaryotes like yeast contain only two 14-3-3 genes, however, the bigger and more complex eukaryotes can contain up to fifteen different isoforms. Mammalian cells contain seven different isoforms, namely β, ε, γ, η, σ, τ, ζ.[7]
One of the 14-3-3 proteins that is used in synthetic biology is from the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (Tobacco) plant (T14-3-3). [8] T14-3-3 proteins dimerize to form a functional scaffold and every monomer contains a bundle of nine antiparallel alfa-helices. Helices H3, H5, H7 and H9 form the “amphipathic ligand-binding groove” (see Figure 2 ), in which other proteins can bind and interact with their co-protein.[7] There are different T14-3-3 variants. The variant which will be used and mentioned as 14-3-3 is the T14-3-3cΔC. The schematic overview of this interaction can be seen in figure 3.

Our human practice work involves several questions relating to biosafety, social justice and public acceptance. Our aSTARice is actually a genetically-modified organism, so our work focuses on people's concern about GMO.
1. Self-improvement
First of all, we should make sure that we ourselves have a correct understanding on this question. For this reason, we took part in lectures about transgenic.
The first lecture was given by Kou Jianping, who is a director of the department of ""Genetically modified organisms safety management and intellectual property office"" from ""Department of Science, Technology and Education"" in MOA (Minstry of Agriculture) of China, and Lin Min, who is a director of institute of biotechnology of CAAS (Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences). In this lecture, we got to know that transgenic foods selling in market are absolutely safe, because they were tested by associated departments and labs for many years in scientific way. However, up to now, there're only a few kinds of transgenic products have gotten permission into the Chinese market. After the lecture, we communicated with these scientists about new technologies on transgenic research.
Apart from that, we've also took part in a talk given by Wu Yongning, who is the director of ""Key Laboratory of Food Safety Risk Assessment, Ministry of Health"", which belongs to China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA). In this talk, we obtained a lot of information in analysing GMO.
As we are working to create a new kind of crop, we think we should also know more about agriculture, so we joined in The Sixth Asian Conference on Precision Agriculture as voulnteers.
2. Innovative and venture talk
As most undergraduate students are having no idea about how to do a biological project, we made a talk on innovative and venture talk held in our college. We gave a speech about our two projects and ways to do biological research, such as how to get papers from some databases and how to get in touch with professors. Our talk attracted more than 300 students, most of them are impressed by our fantastic ideas.

The water has a temperature of approximately 20°C and depending on its quality is either further processed by removing iron or gets dumped directly into rivers.
To learn more about the mine drainage and how it affects the growth of E. coli we visited the mines Hanel and to take water samples of mine drainage sites which showed high concentrations of iron up to 41 mg/l and used those for our first growth experiments .
Figure 1: Team members visit experts at the coal mine in Prosper-Haniel, NRW, Germany  from left to right Christoph Geske, Levin Joe Klages and Johannes Ruhnau.
Because information about the exact mining drainage composition is not easily accessible we contacted Dr. Michael Drobniewski who is the Director of Operation of the Mine Water Management Division at the RAG. He gave us valuable information about the water composition and invited us to a personal meeting.
Figure 2: Meeting with Dr. Michael Drobniewski, director of operations of the ‘Mine Water Management Division’ in the ‘Technical and Logistics Services Division’ at the RAG AG.
In our meeting we learned that the high levels of iron in the mine drainage of up to 41 mg/l is one of the issue the engineers at RAG have to deal with. Currently the RAG uses precipitation medium and special facilities to remove iron from the mine drainage.
Equipped with this knowledge and the offer of the RAG to supply us with samples of mining drainage containing high amounts of iron and copper we decided to dive deeper into the science of iron and copper nanoparticle formation.  Our goal of developing novel materials with the added benefit of cleaning contaminated water sources found with the RAG an important partner to bring us closer to our goal of exploring mining drainage as a source for valuable metals.
Through our continuous collaboration with the RAG we got the chance to join a pump maintenance team on their round trip and we were able to take multiple water samples from two sources with especially high amounts of iron of up to 41 mg/l as was determined by internal water quality tests.

At NASA, scientists also think about the possibility to utilize bacteria for the purpose of biological remediation of metals. One of those scientists is Benjamin Lehner who works at NASA among other things on the uptake of iron from moon rock which might be used to produce electronics when a continuous base is established on the moon.

These bottles were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The overnight LB cultures were inoculated into M9 in order to minimize background fluorescence to get clearer results.
The fluorescence of the cultures was measured just after inoculation (using a green filter with the fluorimeter) and it was fairly even within the two species, averaging 1669.88 FSU for E. coli and 1235.91 FSU for C. freundii. Their fluorescence and OD was again measured after 24 hours in order to quantify RFP expression. These readings were normalized by dividing the fluorescence with the OD and the averages of the three sets were calculated.
Results
Figure 1 - Graphs showing RFP fluorescence when cells were grown in M9 with or without IPTG
In Figure 1 above, the peaks that can be seen in C. freundii at 2 and 4 μl IPTG are due very high fluorescence readings in one of the sets, which have skewed these averages somewhat. These results do, however, show that there is a significant difference in RFP expression in E. coli with and without IPTG, while no significant difference in the levels of RFP expression is observable in C. freundii. This confirms that E. coli has got a native LacI protein that represses the Lac promoter on the plasmid. C. freundii may lack a native LacI protein or C. freundii can’t regulate the E. coli Lac promoter, which results in the RFP gene being constitutively expressed in C. freundii.
Genome sequencing
The genomes of two C. freundii strains (the type strain, ATCC 8090 and another strain our lab had, called SBS 197) were sequenced in Newcastle by Dr Wendy Smith and Prof Anil Wipat with IonTorrent Sequencing. We hoped that these sequences would help elucidate the mystery of the constitutive lac promoter.
One reason the Lac promoter coupled to our BioBricks is not regulated is because its LacI binding sequence might be different from that of the native Citrobacter freundii operator sequence. To test this, we have done a sequence alignment of the region where we think the Citrobacter freundii operator region might be with the consensus operator sequence in E. coli (5'-T GGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATT-"

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-m_-_-_TEXT.html,", the question is now, whether the same is true for bacteria sticking to the surface of a narrow tube? Turner, L. et al. [ 6 ] suggest that bacteria that are completely fixed to a surface will deviate from the bundle behavior, but it is unclear what happens if the fixation is only partial or if the bacteria are surrounded by a flow.
To summarize, we have to model a very dense system of elongated objects that each give rise to an unsymmetrical flow, which depends self-consistent of the total flow and gives rise to self-organization. This is indeed not a simple task, and quite a few simplifying assumptions will have to be made. These will be the starting point of the next part.
Description of model
A flagellum creates propulsion by spinning around in a helical shape. Since the flagellum/flagellabundles take on a helical shape, the most accurate thing to do would be to model them as such, but doing this would become quite advanced for even one flagellum, not to mention an entire system. Since we are limited in both time and computer power, we will have to simplify the system a bit.
One thing we can do is to consider all the flagella of a bacterium to form one bundle, even though doing so for a bacterium stuck to a wall is questionable.
The overall result of this spinning bundle is that the flow moves in an almost straight line. This could be modelled as a pointforce on the tip of the flagellabundle pointing in the same direction as the bundle. The size of this force can be approximated by calculating the drag on a swimming bacterium. If the bacterium is considered almost spherical, the drag force can be calculated by using the formula for Stokes flow past a sphere:
where η (=8.94•10-4 Pa•s for water) is the viscosity of the fluid in which the bacterium is swimming, r (=0.4•10-6 m) is the radius of the bacterium and v (=50•10-6 m/s) is the velocity of the swimming bacterium.
The dragforce and thereby the force created by the flagellabundle of one E. coli is
The system we are trying to model consists of a lot of bacteria stuck to a wall, but the part we are interested in is the flagella and the forces they create. We therefore ignore the bodies of the bacteria, and instead consider the flagella as being stuck directly to the wall, with one end glued to the wall and the other pointing out into the fluid.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," However, the main purpose of these test was to see what we will see when multiple colours are present. These results were inconsistent and therefore inconclusive. One of the reasons for inconsistent results is possibly the amount of ambient light, as there is room for error in our current procedure. So we tried determining the colour of certain object in completely dark room. By doing so we got more accurate and consistent results. The next step in testing the sensor is to try the same colour strips in completely dark room. The Arduino code, currently processes all of the necessary calculations and outputs the RGB components.  This week we were also able to connect the colour sensor with the LCD display so that the output from the colour sensor can be displayed on the screen. It is not 100 percent consistent and the code requires certain improvements.  This week we also repeated the plate reader experiment. This time we attempted to use both E. coli and B. subtilis cultures transformed with RFP. However, the E. coli culture did not grow over night, so we used just B. subtilis culture. We expect to receive the numbers by Monday. We also had a meeting with “Transformers” sub-team to talk about what areas we can quantitatively model. We will look more in depth at the experiments they have done to determine controlled variables, dependent variables, and what calculations can be done. This week we also continued working a 3D animation to show how our device operates. The draft animation was rendered using Maya software to increase the quality. Some improvements need to be made, but the animation is a satisfactory in showing how our device looks like and operates. Next steps in regards to 3D modelling include improving existing animation and creating an animation to show the biological processes that are taken place in our device. This week we also created a schematic that outlines our device. This schematic can be used on the poster.

Week 13: July 28th - August 1st
We started this week by further testing our colour sensor with printed colour stripes. In previous colour stripes, the colours on the sides were too far apart for the sensor to see, so we had to revise and resize the stripes. We also started conducting our tests in a closed box to avoid ambient light. By eliminating ambient light we were able to get more consistent measurements.

The average difference of free energies (computed with the RBS calculator for random sequences of E. coli genes) is  $\Delta\epsilon = -20.79 kT$, which means that, in the equation: $$  \begin{equation} \frac{r_T}{r^0_T}  = \frac{Prob_B}{Prob^0_B}  = \frac { 1+\frac{R^0}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }} } { \frac {R^0}{R}+\frac{R^0}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }}} , \end{equation} $$ The term $\frac{R^0}{N_{NS}} e^{-\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{k_BT }}>>>\frac {R^0}{R}$. With this, and knowing that there is no effect on the ribosomal protein composition with temperature changes [5], we conclude that the most signifficant factor should be the elongation rate.
Therefore,  $$  \begin{equation} \frac{r_P}{r^0_P}  = \frac{1+\frac{r^0_E}{r^0_I}}{\frac{r^0_E}{r_E}+\frac{r^0_E}{r^0_I}}, \end{equation} $$ where $r_E$ ($r_I$) is the elongation (initiation) rate and the superscript denotes our reference case. In E. coli, most of the ribosomes are translating (4 active every one free) [6], thus $\frac{r^0_E}{r^0_I} \simeq\frac{1}{4}$ and  $$ \begin{equation} \frac{r_P}{r^0_P}  = \frac{\frac{5}{4}}{\frac{r^0_E}{r_E}+\frac{1}{4}}. \end{equation} $$
We discuss next the dependence of elongation rates with temperature. We use the relation of amino acid concentration with temperature [7]. Using data from [8], we know that small variations on the ternary complex does not affects the elongation rate. The slowests steps are:  1) GTP hydrolysis on ternary complex (0.01 s), 2) dipeptide bond formation (0.03s) and 3"

To check for the right parameters, pre-experiments need to be performed for an optimized propagation efficiency. You should also prepare several strains of your bacteria carrying APs with different RBS-strengths, origins of replication, and different MPs (MP1/4/6 vary the mutation rate). If you have problems with phage propagation due to no or too little starting activity, an initial drift phase without selection pressure might help. Another helpful adaption is the usage of a helper-culture. This culture should be used between every or several PREDCEL AP-iteration rounds and must provide geneIII expression, that is only coupled to phage infection. Thereby, all phages that are transferred can reproduce themselves to gain a high phage titer, that might be needed to prevent phage washout. As previous phages showing higher activity propagated faster than those showing no or low activity, they will, as a consequence, achieve higher phage titers while this helper-culture-phase. Thus, helper-culture phase should not extinguish previously achieved selection for beneficial mutations.

This “loss of function” strategy would allow us to determine which cells were successfully transformed.  After much research, we narrowed down the potential receiving loci to amyE, SacA, thrC, and lacA.   Meanwhile, we prepared more agar plates containing Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin as our initial supply was running low. Much to our relief, we later received an email from iGEM headquarters stating that our requested parts were in transit.
Week 7: June 9 - 13
This week consisted of ligations and the confirmation thereof. First, colony PCR was conducted on existing RFP transformed colonies to confirm their viability for the genetic circuit which is to be assembled the following week. Fortunately, all of the six colonies which were screened turned out to be successful. Following the confirmation of the RFP colonies, Pveg + RBS ligations were created and transformed into the competent Top 10 E. coli. stocks at hand. One out of several colonies was successful. A confirmation digest was performed on the successful colony following a plasmid mini-prep, and for reasons unknown, the results were negative.
A single successful Pveg + RBS colony was deemed insufficient for our purposes, thus a second, identical ligation was conducted on new E. coli. stock. Meanwhile, another colony PCR was performed on the first ligation, and all tested colonies were ultimately negatives. Fortunately, two of the newly ligated were determined to be successful, ensuring ample Pveg + RBS stock for future use.
We began to prepare our B. subtilis 1A976 (comK) cells for transformation, following the protocol outlined by Zhang et al. (ref). We made 1% (w/v) xylose solution in LB, as xylose induces the comK promoter to generate supercompentency in B. subtilis. We inoculated LB (containing erythromycin and lincomycin) with the B. subtilis cells and shook them overnight (37°C). The protocol suggested an incubation period of around 12 hours, but we found that optimal cell density required a slightly longer period in the incubator/shaker. We adapted the protocol to fit our needs, and decided upon a shaking period of 18 hours.
The protocol required the dilution of our liquid cell cultures with 1% xylose solution until an absorbance reading of 1.0 at A600 was achieved. We made several"

Media:Muc16_Sticker_Receptors_003.png
Our membrane proteins (also referred to as 'receptors') enable the polymerization of cells into three-dimensional cellular matrices during bioprinting. Therefore, our receptors present biotin (or biotin-binding proteins) on their surfaces, and - being co-injected with a biotinylated linker peptide into streptavidin solution - immediately 'glue' to each other by the means of synthetic biology, allowing printing of defined three-dimensional cellular structures.
The following extracellular domains were constructed and tested:
1) A biotinylated receptor containing an extracellular biotin acceptor peptide that is endogenously biotinylated by a coexpressed biotin ligase (BirA) and thus presents biotin groups at the cell surface.
The biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) is a 15 amino acid peptide sequence originating from E. coli. [1] Being biotinylated by the biotin ligase BirA at a lysine residue within the recognition sequence, it mediates the functionality of the receptor by presenting biotin, allowing the interaction of the cell surface with streptavidin in the reservoir solution.  The biotin ligase BirA is therefore encoded by the same vector as the receptor, with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allowing translation of two open reading frames (ORFs) from a single bicistronic mRNA. BirA is targeted to the ER via an Igκ signal peptide and trapped via an ER retention signal (C-terminal KDEL-sequence), allowing it to efficiently biotinylate translocating proteins possessing the recognition sequence.

These avidin derivates, by design, allow the functional fusion of the otherwise tetrameric avidin molecule with our receptor. Two different variants were used here: The so-called enhanced monomeric avidin, a single subunit avidin that is able to bind biotin as a monomer, and a ""single-chain avidin"", which resembles the naturally occuring avidin tetramer, but has the subunits being connected via polypeptide linkers."

We also did some EM work with the smallest plaque found on the T4Do stock after 7.5 min of UV exposure and the smallest plaque found on the T4 mutagenized stock after 7.5 min of UV exposure. Due to the preparation of the grids or problems with the samples, the initial results did not show full phage. Both showed a lot of capsids only. We will wait until we receive the scanned images from the film and will analyze our findings then.
Mutagenesis with UV light Specifics
UV test-1
Today we did a phage titer of 0,-3,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10,-11 We started by putting 1 ul of phage into 1ml of bacteria, we went down from there. We infected each test tube with 10 uL from each dilution level.
We also did a UV pre-test of sorts. We put 20ul of phage onto parafilm and exposed it to UV light in the hood of Dr. Breakwell’s lab. At 30 second intervals we took the 20 ul’s off and put it in a half ml of e.coli W3110. We tested every 30 seconds up to 3 minutes.
We also streaked out the W3110 bacteria from freezer stock onto an LB plate so we can use it to start future bacterial cultures.
We looked at the results for the dilution series (titer) we did on the phage stock we made from the liquid culture and found that there were 5 plaques on the 10^-8 plate.
We calculated pfus/mL by doing ( # of plaques ) / (dilution level x mLs infected with).  Our stock is between 3x10^9 and 5x10^9 pfus/mL. 180 sec = ~50 plaques 150 sec = ~102 plaques 120 sec = ~170 plaques 90 sec = ~280
Plaques/(dilution * amt infected with)
UV test-2
(45 Second intervals) We picked one plaque off of the 180 sec UV plate sample. We suspended it in 1 mL of broth, and then UV-ed 20 uL samples at 45 second intervals. The number of plaques decreased the longer the samples sat under UV light.  The samples were irradiated"

Science Slam Basel
The annual Basel “Science Slam” is an event where the scientists of Basel present topics related to science in an entertaining way in front of a non-expert audience.  The point of a “Science Slam” is to bring problems in science closer to the general public. It provides a novel and entertaining way to educate people on certain fields of science. This year, 350 people were in the audience.
We have participated in the 2016 finals, where we presented the topic of scientific misconduct and how projects like iGEM can be taken as an example of how the scientific community can reduce the incidence of scientific misconduct.

Newspaper article in Corriere Del Ticino
During the summer we collaborated with the main newspaper in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland, Corriere Del Ticino, in the preparation of an article about synthetic biology and iGEM. The two-page article is based on an interview of our team member Mattia Gollub and explains in a comprehensive way what synthetic biology is, the mission of iGEM and the idea of our project. In addition, it presents the main fields where synthetic biology is already used in practical applications. The article also includes an evaluation by the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics on synthetic biology projects. In general, we tried to explain synthetic biology in a simple way and demystify prejudices, bringing people closer to the field.
A digital version of the article (in Italian) is available here .  Author: Carlo Silini, Correiere Del Ticino, 24.09.2016

False teeth – a thing of the past
Increasing tooth loss remains a feature of old age in humans throughout the world. We will harness synthetic biology to improve the dental health of the ageing population by designing bacteria that do not cause decay but actually prevent it. These biofilm-fillings will provide a regenerative internal environment for the tooth whilst fighting off the surface bacteria that cause dental plaques.

Increasing the Efficacy of PETase
One of the factors that affects the efficiency of plastic biodegradation is the concentration of degrading enzyme near the surface of plastic. If the enzyme is allowed to diffuse in solution freely, it is less likely to interact with plastic. Degradation may accelerate if the enzyme is highly concentrated around the surface of plastic with some method. The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to have grown in a biofilm which enveloped plastic pieces. As such, we first considered maximizing production of biofilm on plastic. While researching this possibility we found that the ITB Indonesia 2017 had attempted a similar project. They developed a system that facilitated biofilm production and expressed PETase simultaneously. Their results indicated that biofilm formation actually inhibited degradation, possibly due to its matrix physically blocking the transfer of enzymes to plastic.
We therefore decided to investigate an alternative method for localizing concentration while simultaneously allowing for greater interaction of substrate with enzyme. Imperial College of London in 2014 developed parts for a cellulose binding domain (CBD). This domain was capable of being incorporated with other subunits such as GFP. They were able to demonstrate that a GFP + CBD fusion protein was capable of binding to bacterial cellulose. Equipped with this information, we decided to develop a fusion protein which incorporated PETase and CBD. We assembled this part, and its characterization is available on the registry . We have tested the functionality of both its PETase component and its cellulose binding component. The part also includes an HlyA secretion sytem, but we were unable to confirm secretion.
Our hypothesis is that we can wrap bacterial cellulose around plastic to act as a scaffold on which the PETase can easily work in close proximity to the substrate. This should, in turn, increase the degradation rate. A model of our predictions can be found on the modeling page.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," before the DNA Day, we prepared general knowledge facts about DNA, genes and so on. Those were simple but interesting                  facts such as “The human DNA is 98% identical with a chimpanzee’s.”
After everything was set, we visited the middle school students during their lunch break, asked whether the facts were true or not.                  Even though not all of the students got the questions right, they were hooked by the topic and demanded more information from us.
The video we recorded was shown to them in the next morning, before class. They were exhilarated to see both themselves and their                  friends trying to answer DNA questions. And, we were so happy to see younger minds being so interested in the DNA and the thrilling                  qualities of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XozTmx4IPS8&t=12s
Murder Mystery Game with the Middle School Students:
On the DNA Day, we went back to the middle school and set up a Murder Mystery Game.
The game was about the fictional murder of a biologist, right here in our school. The leads the students had to solve the mystery                  was in the different stations of the game and as we aimed, the students used their knowledge of DNA and performed a teamwork in order                  to get to the end.
More than the questions and facts we also set up an experiment that was based on the students’ skill to use a microscope. We taught                  them how to adjust a microscope to see the specimen.
It is important for us to see younger students learning how to use lab material because in the future they will follow our lead                  and become scientists. In doing that, we saw that students were already quite interested in using the lab equipment.
At the end of the game, the students had learned more about the DNA, genes and microscope skills. They were additionally                  send off to class by a little handmade gift in order for them to remember the DNA Day.
Introducing the concept of Ethics, DNA, and Lab safety to Primary School Students
In order to raise the awareness of primary school students, the youngest classes learning biology, we prepared a handmade                  game consisting of three stations; matching DNA strands, memory cards and which were furthermore followed by an experiment of                  extracting the DNA of strawberries.
Starting with the concept of synthetic biology first, we had a Q&A session with students. They were all amazed by how we could                  transfer genetic qualities to bacteria and asked whether we could do this with humans or not. There, we explained the ethics of                  science to students and they were all convinced about the limitations of scientists.

These ligations were then transformed into Top 10 competent E. coli cells on Ampicillin-containing agar plates.  If the transformations were successful, Amp-containing liquid cultures were made from which glycerol stocks and DNA minipreps were prepared.  Portions of the minipreps were digested with restriction enzymes from the prefix and the suffix, and the samples were run out on a gel to test for expected insert and vector lengths.  If this test was passed, the sample was submitted as a BioBrick.

Conclusions
PHB accumulation needs to be monitored.
Polyhydroxybutyrate has great potential as a renewable, biodegradable plastic.  At present, extraction methods of PHB are more costly than production methods for petrochemically-derived plastics, making higher extraction efficiency a necessity.  Using a genetic marker to identify optimal extraction time will reduce these costs by providing maximum PHB yields.
GFP could be an effective marker.
Green fluorescent protein has been shown to be an effective genetic marker since its discovery in 1968.  Since it's genetic sequence and optical properties have been well studied, the USU iGEM team felt GFP would provide acceptable indication of PHB expression.
The USU iGEM team has constructed some necessary BioBricks.
The effective use of GFP as an expression marker will depend on sufficient understanding of both the PHB promoter and PhaCAB cassette.  The USU iGEM team has made progress in both of these areas and has created three Bio"
Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," for inserting Z0842 into pRS306.  If a triple digest, we should do a single digest in compatible buffer.  If a quadruple digest, we can switch buffers using Qiagen spin columns, noting that each time we do this we will lose some DNA.
Looks like triple digest will be unlikely.  Will thus consider quadruple digest:  EcoRI has 100% activity in buffer H.  SpeI has 100% activity in buffer B.  Thus, will try to locate two enzymes that have 100% activity in either buffer, that are unique to the unwanted portion of Z0842, that will cut in a location to allow distinguishing between the strands on a gel, and that are also not present at all on pRS306.  Buffer B candidates: HaeII, NciI (cuts in 3 places on Z0842 according to constraints), XmnI.  Buffer H candidates:  none.  Best option would be NciI.  Unfortunately, all three restriction sites can be found in pRS306.  One must wonder if it is possible to run the Buffer B reaction first with EcoRI and NciI, then run it through a column to change the buffer to Buffer H and run a second restriction digest using just SpeI.  One could then run the results on a gel and ligate to pRS306.  Would this work?

Overview
Our team seeks to synthesize artificial membrane-less organelles and turn them into a multi-functional toolbox for synthetic biology based on basic phase separation principles, which is a fundamental field in condensed matter physics. Therefore, it is not really a practical application so far. Nonetheless, we certainly do not plan to be limited to the laboratory, coping with experiments and mathematical models without making a difference for society at large. At the same time, we need to learn about the demands of engineers and consumers. Thus, we conducted integrated human practice in several different ways.
Inside the iGEM community, we made statistics on the educational background and numbers of iGEMers each year in order to investigate how iGEM has been broadcasted internationally and how the field of synthetic biology has changed over the last 14 years. We noticed that the iGEM teams are becoming increasingly more diverse, which promotes the development of the iGEM community but also makes it more challenging for team members to communicate. This can also be understood as being due to more people from different disciplines, especially mathematics and physics, have devoted their work to systems and synthetic biology, which are interdisciplinary sciences needing various knowledge, while at the same time, they can feed back to enrich the individual scientific disciplines and integrated biology-based solutions for societal problems can be worked out.
We also tried to play an active part in public engagement. We communicated with people from various backgrounds at universities, in high schools, in kindergartens and on the internet. We realized that there has always been a gap between the achievements in scientific research and practical application. People from the academic world and industry often barely know each other‘s requirements. Thus, we discussed this topic in detail using fluorescence microscopy as an example.
Our human practice reinforced our team building, offering more chances for the team members to communicate and collaborate with each other. We tried to make synthetic biology accessible for as many people as possible and we expect our efforts to make a difference. Meanwhile, we’d be more glad if our work can give the synthetic biology community some inspiration. To gain a deeper understanding of biology in the 21st century, we need to integrate knowledge from various disciplines, while biology-based solutions to societal"

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," B-A can self-drive in a manner independent of the input signal for a period of time after the                     signal of input, and the metabolic flow in this cycle can be transferred to the output circuit [2].                     In particular, in our device, we want to use CRISPRa technology to achieve our goals. We will use                     dCas9 as our binder and the SoxS as our activator which had been proven to be highly                     effective in bacteria [3]. In addition, when using an amplifier based on a positive feedback loop,                     we need to strictly limit its activation until the input signal is strong enough, which is                     beneficial to suppress leakage of the device [2]. To this end, we introduce the concept of                     thresholds, which is to achieve competition between B-A and B by constitutively expressing dCas9                     with a certain intensity. In this way, the amplifier can only be effectively activated when the                     input signal is strong enough.
Figure 2. Schematic Design of the Synthetic amplifier.
For some reasons, we have not been able to do experiment in this area, but we have established a                     mathematical model to predict the performance of the amplifier.

4. Anti-Inflammatory Therapeutic Proteins
When our anti-inflammatory device is activated by an inflammatory signal, it produces a therapeutic                     output. Although therapeutic output increases the risk of infection, to some extent, our chassis                     EcN compensates for this deficiency by inhibiting pathogens. When we consider what output should be                     used, the first consideration is the epidermal growth factor used by ShanghaiTechChina_B 2016 team.

OUC-China,2014,Team:OUC-China#Project Policy Practise_-_-_TEXT.html," most teams in our country confronted with the same difficulties however. We figured out a solution to the problem.
Solution: IGEM could authorize the biotech firms, the teams submit their own specimen to the nearest authorized biotech firm. It is the biotech firms that evaluate the PARTS, then sending them to the iGEM officials. Thus, the work load of the officials will released and the difficulties of the submission of each team could be eliminated.
We sincerely hope that the iGEM officials could consider our proposal above.
Part2:
We were astonished that the stains HB101 provided by Professor Qiu we received was sent by the way of express. Consequently, we investigated the transportation situation of the biological products.
We inquired the 4 main express companies by the way of phone. The results showed that the reply varied according to each company and the standards were not explicit. Some claimed that it belonged to prohibited articles. Some required that we needed provide approval. Other claimed that we would designate a staff to decide whether it could be sent or not.
Then we found the State Post Bureau of The People's Republic of China, which is monitoring the express market. We dial the hot line, and then we received the answer that biological products belonged to the prohibited articles. Therefore, we went to the official website to figure out the relevant laws and regulations and there was no detailed classification of the biological products.
http://www.spb.gov.cn/bmfw/jxjwpml_15040/
For this case, we wrote to the State Post Bureau of The People's Republic of China and sent to the chief’s mailbox, waiting for the reply now.
The proposals are as follows:
1. Perfect the catalogue of restricted and prohibited articles. Explicitly classify the biological products which has potential hazard, relax the restrictions of the biological products which perform little or no hazards to human at the same time to make it more convenient for the communication of researchers;
2. There should be a uniform administration over the transportation of biological products, a uniform standard for transport, to eliminate the difference between each express company;
3. Open an express channel exclusively for biological products to ensure the safety.
Is it feasible to use feed as the carrier of DNA vaccines?
In the future, we hope to apply this system to social practice. We took the practice investigation to find whether the system is useable in actual production. We plan to use our project to promote and improve the design for serving human society better.

We would like to thank him for generously giving up his time to assist in this crucial stage of our project.
Special Thanks
We have to send our thanks to the following people whose contributions made a great difference to our project.
Professor Peter Arvan
Peter Arvan is from the University of Michigan. Our Winsulin sequence is strongly based on an insulin he designed in his 2009 paper Single-Chain Insulins as Receptor Agonists . He kindly gave us his blessing to work on it and assured us that he had no patent claim on it.

Week 1
6/17 We started our iGEM bootcamp by shadowing Will Bothfeld (our primary graduate student TA) during ligating, transforming and working with DNA software. In addition, we learned the fundamentals of primer design, colony PCR and gel electrophoresis. We ended by continuing research and discussing all of our projects of interest.
6/18 To start our day, we narrowed down on project ideas to CRISPR-Cas system, quick quench GFP, and non-model organisms; we then discussed their individual pros and cons. During our meeting with Professors and graduate students, we had an in depth discussion on this topic as well as laboratory logistics such as lab equipment and our summer budget. With this information and guidance, we were able add to our initial thoughts on each of our potential projects by starting corresponding flowcharts of events.
6/19 All team members finished necessary safety training modules online to partake in wet lab work. We then cleaned the lab and organized materials/equipment. Will proposed a problem to us regarding primer design that we worked on first individually and then collaboratively to compiled an answer to for later review.
6/20 After learning the basics of and observing plate reading, we compiled a series of protocols that we felt would be important to have before getting starting on DNA cloning first-hand. We also updated our lab shelves and freezer inventory thoroughly to get a sense of what we should be ordering and asking in our sponsorship emails.
Week 2
6/23 In the morning, we had a meeting with a TA, Karthik Sekar, to discuss the iGEM registry and parts along with how to use them. Following that, we had a meeting our professors and grad students in which we learned more about the project of non-model organisms. After our meeting, we made LB Mix and discussed which project to pick- non-model organisms or quenching GFP. In the end, we came to agreement to do our project on non-model organisms by having E. coli and yeast as our controls and other strains of bacteria and fungi as our non-model organisms.

3.3.3.
) and colocalization was observed by confocal microscopy (
3.3.4.
).
GvpA and GvpC were both expressed in the cytosol and colocalized.
HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding gas vesicle proteins, GvpA and GvpC. 24 h after transfection cells were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained with anti-FLAG (upper row) and anti-AU1 (lower row). Both GvpA and GvpC are located in cytosol as expected. Colocalization is presented in the overlay picture.
Cell viability was not affected by expression of gas vesicle forming proteins.
HEK293 cells were transfected with GvpA and/or GvpC. 24 h after the transfection viability of cells was                                                 measured using trypan blue.
A toxicity test was performed in order to ensure that gas vesicles were not toxic to mammalian cells.
3.3.5.
shows that the viability of cells was not altered when expressing gas vesicle forming proteins.
HEK293 cells expressing gas vesicle-forming proteins exhibited increased sensitivity to ultrasound stimulation, even in the absence of exogenous mechanosensitive channels (
3.3.6.
), which was most likely due to activation of the endogenous mechanosensitive channels in mammalian cells.
Gas protein vesicles improve the sensitivity of cells to ultrasound.

safety concerns
As a software team, our team does not produce any typical biological safety or ethnic issues. However, we still take safety into account from as many aspects as possible:
1. Safety for programmers
Most of our work is mainly done in front of computers, which is not ergonomically to programmers as working in such environment may cause much exhaust and stress. Therefore, we made a series of regulations to guarantee they are not exposed to computers constantly for too long time and recreational area is within 10 meters. What is more, every time our programmers go to web labs, we make sure that there would be safety equipment as well as accompanies for them.
2. Safety for public
We are aware what our software will bring to teenagers or youngsters, and our software is ensured that no violent or sexual scene or content is included. We also did a lot of work to estimate and reduce the possible errors or faults users may encounter in the future.
3.Safety for software
To better protect our intellectual property rights, we have consulted IPRs centre of USTC in case of future problem. We will restrict the use of our software and we will apply for a patent later.
4.Safety for campus
We are quite aware when we perform our work or lecture in campus, and no disorder or turbulence has shown during in the above activity.
5.Other safety concerns
(i) Our team made no new BioBrick parts (or devices), and no safety issues happened from this. (ii)No biosafety group or committee protested our project.
Suggestions for future development of safety in dry lab.
Although a lot of work is done to ensure the safety of programmers in dry lab, a lot of work still remains to be done. And here we present some brief ideas on how we can develop the safety for programmers.
1. In many conditions, programmers in a dry lab have to share places with experiment operators due to limited space, which may lead to underlying health problems. Therefore, we suggest that strict rules should be made to provide independent space for programmers.
2. We take it for granted that not only safety for programmers, but the safety for intellectual property should be taken into consideration. Thus we suggest that all codes and other achievement should be granted with copyrights before sharing.

Parameters that we have to consider:
Diffusing peptide must not affect the adhesive and vice versa
Skin compatibility, chemical compatibility
Tack, peel adhesion, skin adhesion and cohesive strength
Hydration of skin
Tissue swells when skin is saturated with water and its permeability increases = this would be an important factor to increase penetration
Temperature
Diffusion coefficient
Diffusion speed of molecules depend on the state of matter in the medium

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," their protection is more effective for long periods of time. Our assays reveal that LDH in combination with SAHS 33020 is still active after being stored dried for 18 days at room temperature.
Nevertheless, the activity drops in the data discussed above could also be due to other factors than just the limitations of the proteins. It should be noted that after drying the samples no additional measures to ensure the dryness of the samples were taken, as these were kept in a drawer instead of in a desiccator. Moreover, interactions with any air components should not be neglected either, as the samples were not purged with an inert gas prior to their storage.
In future experiments the long-term evolution of the Cas13a activity should be assessed for SAHS 33020 and other tardigrade-specific SAHS proteins as, in view of the long-term results for the TDPs with LDH, these proteins hold great potential in simplifying the storage, usage, and shipment of the many fragile chemicals and biological materials.
Preserving whole cells with TDPs
As described by ( Boothby et al. 2017 ), the production of tardigrade-specific proteins by heterologous organisms increases their desiccation tolerance significantly. Therefore, to the end of further characterizing our BioBricks, iGEM Wageningen UR was asked to carry out experiments with our plasmids to test the increase in bacterial desiccation tolerance by CAHS94205, CAHS106094 and SAHS33020. Furthermore, for the sake of gaining a better understanding of the proteins’ function, Wageningen performed additional experiments by washing with PBS buffer. This was a procedure that had not been done before. The results are displayed in Figure 30.

As seen in Figure 30, the number of colonies found after drying and rehydrating the bacteria (BL21(DE3)) with the TDPs is considerably larger than that for the empty vector of the same bacterial strain (1 vs. 103-104). This proves that the survival of bacteria is greatly enhanced by the presence of the three TDPs in the cells and complies with the results from Boothby et al. 2017 .

Cell Free Protein Synthesis System Optimisation: The Results
BioBricks used: BBa_K515105 (Imperial College London 2011)
Rationale and Aim
Cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems have large potential as alternative chassis for applications such biosensors or diagnostic tests. This is because generally, biosensors are needed to function outside of the laboratory environment. Whole cells, which are traditionally used as chassis, can be problematic in these scenarios due to issues with containment and release of genetically modified organisms. While CFPS systems are promising alternatives to whole cells, there are currently some drawbacks, primarily their cost and variability between batches of cell extract. To address these issues, this part of the project had the following aims: (i) develop a functional CFPS system, (ii) demonstrate the usefulness of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach towards identifying which supplements are the most"

Though white rot is very efficient at decaying the wood, the process of lignin degradation usually occurs on cells that are localized around the fungus only. Therefore, a majority of the infected wood will remain un-decayed until the fungus gradually spreads [1]. For the purposes of our project, we employed enzymes from the species Colletotrichum fioriniae PJ7 and Heterobasidion irregulare TC 32-1, specifically its genes for versatile peroxidase and manganese peroxidase respectively, though it produces an entire family of ligninases.

J4 Yeast
Background
Our initial obstacle was the inhibition of the enzyme beta-glucosidase by the products of lignin digestion. The current solution utilized by industries is to just add more enzymes to the mix; however, this requires extra expenditure. Our solution is to use a yeast strain developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of California, Berkeley. The engineered strain, called J4-a,  combines multiple processes of microbial ethanol production into one-cohesive anaerobic-biological process. The J4-a strain specifically combines the processes of fermentation of cellobiose, xylose, and acetic acid into an intercellular co-fermentation process which, not only prevents the inhibition of beta-glucosidase, but also eliminates intermediate processes and overall expenses.

We estimated 15 minutes of lab technician’s time based off the advice of Professor Lovat's research team and Dr Pregibon. The processing of miRNA takes approximately 2 hours for 8 samples. However, if this process was further automated, this cost could be significantly reduced.
The total figure is likely to be an overestimate, as the two major components, namely the PAXgene blood RNA tube and the miRNAeasy Mini Kit which make up over 70% of the total aren’t for clinical use. These products are targeted at researchers and small volume applications, and have many extra features to match - which would not be required for our sensor. Economies of scale and stripping the products down to their core functions could introduce further significant savings.
We believe our test would cost less than £15 ($20) once this is taken into account, making it extremely cost effective as it can test for several diseases simultaneously.
Large cost savings could come by testing saliva instead of blood. Looking into the financials:

Figure 1. Differences between random library preparation with transposase from ONT library preparation (left) and targeted library preparation with our fusion protein (right). The principle behind targeted library preparation is to enrich certain DNA targets before the sequencing run.
Enrichment for specific DNA sequences allows more detailed studies and processing of higher number of samples with lower data generation. To make multiplexing easier, we developed a software tool that generates specific DNA adapter sequences needed for ONT sequencing. Each sequence generated can be directly linked to the sample identification. To analyse and use this tool, please visit our improvement page .
Proof of principle
Targeted integration of DNA adapters during library preparation and sequencing with ONT MinION
We constructed, expressed and purified the fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5 . We demonstrated that this protein can integrate DNA adapters on a specific target (using a sgRNA for dxCas9) on human Erythropoyetin coding sequence (EPO cds) as substrate. To see these detailed results, please visit our Demonstration page ). After this result was obtained, we performed the integration reaction with DNA adapters that were compatible with ONT sequencing. These adapters were integrated on the specific EPO cds DNA target. The sample used for the reaction with our fusion protein contained two molecules: EPO cds (the target of fusion) and a different molecule (not targeted by the sgRNA) to assess any off-target adapter integration.
After this integration reaction, the sample was used for library preparation for ONT MinION sequencing. This protocol was started at the second step, as the targeted library preparation with our fusion protein replaced  the first reaction. After sequencing, data was aligned to both DNA molecules as reference. This experiment proved that target EPO cds was enriched for sequencing in comparison with negative control DNA that was not targeted (89 unique aligned reads against 0 unique aligned reads respectively). This result shows sample enrichment towards EPO cds plasmid.
For further proof of targeted integration, figure 2 shows the specific alignment of one of the unique reads from this experiment to reference EPO cds DNA used.

We visualized the results on 2% TAE agarose gel using 2 uL NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 MaSp2 2CA amplified using VF/R primers. The expected VF/R product is 443 bp. The expected P/E product is 170 bp.
The presence of a smear under 50 bp may indicate incomplete PCR and leftover primers. We will try 20 cycles in the future to see if better amplification can be achieved.
We excised the bands at ~450 bp for gel extraction tomorrow."

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"1366 is a stoichiometric model defining all metabolic paths (as of today) in this particular strain. We modified this model to incorporate the various enzymes that we wanted to introduce in order to produce butyrate. The following link contains the newly built XML file.
Our model aims at determining the maximum butyrate and formate quantities that our strain could produce, depending on two initial conditions: oxygen and glucose flux. We set them as follows:
Maximal oxygen entry flux: 5 mmol.gDW-1.h-1
Maximal glucose entry flux: 0.3998 mmol.gDW-1.h-1
pH: 7
It is interesting to note that FBA provides the produced and consumed metabolites in a quantitative way.
The set point for oxygen flux was chosen to simulate microaerobic conditions. The glucose flux set point was chosen according to the results of our tests with the Biosilta kit (see  “Preliminary part”).
This kit was used to ensure a stable delivery of glucose over time (constant flux) for our bacteria. The medium contains enzymes capable of catabolizing starch, thus gradually releasing glucose into the culture.
For known initial quantities of starch and enzymes, we are able to deduce the glucose release flux. Thus, we chose the appropriate enzyme concentration and polymer quantity in order to have a glucose rate of 0.4 mmol.gDW-1.h-1.
The model provides results for the metabolites flux in mmol.gDW-1.h-1 which we converted in mmol/L. To do this we chose a time period of 13 hours for the day and 7 hours for the night, since our solution will primarily be deployed during the summer. This means that butyric acid production time is estimated to be 13 hours and that formic acid production time is set to 7 hours.
Concerning biomass it is more complicated since the bacterium grows all the time. Thus in order to ensure a minimum production, biomass concentration (X) at the beginning is defined to X = 0.56 gDW.L-1.
$$ \textrm{Real unit} (mmol.L^{-1})= \textrm{Model unit} (mmol.gDW^{-1}\cdot h^{-1})\times X \times time  $$
X: 0,56 gDW.L-1
time (formic acid): 13h
time butyric acid: 7h

Minnesota,2009,Team:Minnesota#Parts Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," we had as of 16 July 2009 to each other and to the sequences of the parts that were available on the Registry . We obtained successful alignments for parts I14032, J13002 and K091101, which were regulated by IPTG, aTc and both inducers, respectively. It is interesting to note that while our samples appeared to have multiple products, that is, on the chromatogram that accompanied our sequence output, we saw multiple signals for each base pair, the sequence products not only aligned with each other, but with the sequences on the Registry. So we ordered new primers for another sequencing reaction and, based on these alignments as well as the fact that part R0011 had already been characterized and I14013 was regulated by LasR as well as aTc, we reduced our number of parts to characterize to three.
Characterization Experiments
Our list of parts to characterize was then narrowed down to:
I14032
J13002
K091101
We inserted each promoter and either the PoPS generator or GFP into the pSB3K3 plasmid backbone in Top10 cells and confirmed our ligation by agarose gel and sequencing. Then, we transformed our new plasmid into DH5αPro cells, which constitutively express TetR and LacI for characterization. Therefore, even in our inducer media of 0 ng/ml, we observed some fluorescence. The plasmid also conferred kanamycin resistance upon the cells so we plated them on LB + Kan media in order to select for our successful transformants. In order to examine Transfer Function and Stability for each promoter, we grew 1ml cultures at increasing concentrations of either IPTG or aTc and kept them at OD595=0.2. We sampled each of our cultures every hour for 9 hours, fixing the samples in 4% PFA and resuspending in PBS in preparation for flow cytometry . Flow cytometry allowed us to pick out the population of living cells and determine the amount of GFP that each cell was producing.  We utilized the software FlowJo to analyze our flow cytometry data. We were interested in the mean GFP for 100,000 cells at each timepoint and inducer concentration and were able to extract these data from the plethora of information included in the data file.
Promoter I14032: IPTG regulation
The first promoter we looked at was I14032 , which was submitted to the Registry by Princeton in 2004.
In the Experience section on the Registry, it was stated that although this promoter was classified as repress"

PART 0 Safety Q&A
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Is there a local bio-safety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local bio-safety group think about your project? If no, which specific bio-safety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through.......

Learining from other biology reaction network simulation software – Berkeley Software Team 2009, SynBioSS, TinkerCell, CellDesigner, because the realization of our game need simulation too. Thinking about the big picture of our game, the simulation, the UI, the database, the play modes. (Liao)Chen Liao promoted a way to do the simulation – every biobrick will have an input and an output. Though following discussion proved it was not a great idea, it is a good start for the simulation part of out game.
Kun Jiang
To start our project, I begin a detailed study of biology related softwares, including SynBioSS, CellDesigner and TinkerCell. Especially, TinkerCell is a open source software, so I can read it's source code to carefully research biology simulation software.  Those softwares provide me a lot of ideas, direct our development and influence our design.
Luojun Wang
Strict rules for safety have been considered and made.To start our own human practice, previous works have been investigated.
Shangyu Luo
Having made sure that our project will be about a game in synthetic biology, we begin to discuss the components of our software. Basically, we divide it into two parts: fore-end and back-end. I will work on the later one which includes simulation, database, interface, etc. Furthermore, I focus on the model and simulation of biological reactions and try to find a proper method to serve for our project.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based"
