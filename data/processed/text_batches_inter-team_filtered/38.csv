Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#testing_-_-_TEXT.html," regular and optimal usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimal use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model contributes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat [1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples are necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second worm buster targeting large strongyles could be possible in the future.
Figure 6: Large strongyles.
Symptoms
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second worm buster even larger.
Current Methods of Detection
Current Methods of Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs"

Metal Sequester
In our system, the team have used the metallothionein SmtA (which usually mops up zinc ions) and have linked it to the CotC spore coat protein - this means that, should the stochastic switch decide, any cadmium mopped up could be sequestered into spores thereby making it unavailable.

Introduction
In order to take up and keep the cadmium from the soil efficiently, we needed to think about a way to cross-link the metal ions to intra-cellular proteins which would end up for the most of it in the spore. If the heavy metal ions were not cross linked to a ""sponge protein"", it could be lethal to the cell at lower concentration and the cell could end up sporulating too early, or even bursting in the soil, releasing all the heavy metal it has taken up.
From our meeting with Prof. Nigel Robinson on the 18th of March 2009, it was evident that the best way of getting cadmium into the spore is to express a metallothionein, which would 'soak up' the cadmium, which in turn would be trapped within the protein in the spore.
Novelty in this sub-project
To increase the efficiency of our system in sequestering the heavy metal cadmium from the soil, we divised a plan to make sure that most of the metal ions that have been taken in our B.subtilis cell is then rendered bio-unavailable by incorporating it into smtA metallothionein.

SynthEthics - A Phylosophical Debate
Introduction
Emerging technologies must not forget to have a clear bioethical stand, and synthetic biology should be no different. Advances in this field may open the door to engineering living systems in a similar way we design new dishwashers, computers or spaceships, and may certainly improve our life quality. However, we are talking about the same engineering has created sophisticated weapons, tanks, and the atomic bomb: synthetic biology could be used for good or bad. Even though we may expect huge benefits from it, there are risks. One major concrete concern refers to the possibility of purposely designing pathogenic strains as a tool for bioterrorism. What was fiction a decade ago, namely the creation of a target population specific pathogen, may aid from advances in tumor specific therapies and recent improvements in DNA synthesis and become a real weapon for xenophobism. To address all these issues, different bodies, agents and organizations have started lively discussions and actions against the potential risks of synthetic biology (discussed on the internet site of the US synthetic biology. Both in the US and in the EU several forums for discussion and documents regarding Biosafety have appeared ( JCVI Synthetic Genomics - Options for Governance ; Rathenau Institut ; OpenWetWare ). In the case of the EU, some research projects have been funded to analyze the impact and safety problems of Synthetic Biology in Europe ( SYNBIOSAFE ; SYNBIOLOGY ) (Serrano, 2007). In this way, the success of synthetic biology will depend on its capacity to surpass traditional engineering, blending the best features of natural systems with artificial designs that are extensible, comprehensible, user-friendly, ethical, and most importantly implement stated specifications to fulfill user goals (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006).
Participation in the Sabana University's First Philosophy and Biosciences Workshop
As an attempt to spread the principles of synthetic biology into diverse social populations, we accepted an invitation from the Sabana University located in Chía, Colombia to the first philosophy and biosciences workshop (11, 12, and 13th of"

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," that our project can be applied and the target end users are companies focusing on fermentation industry. To get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production, we visited COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute.
The company’s manager said that plasmid instability was really a troublesome problem and affirmed our potential use in large-scale production.
What’s more, COFCO provided us with some financial help. They encouraged us                                 to polish our project and reminded                                 us of considering more about connecting our work with the realistic needs.
It’s not the end of our project
From winter camp, we firstly invited our instructor                                 to draw a map of synthetic biology and all of us shared our personal views about how we engaged ourselves into the competition and community. Younger students in our school from                                 different majors raised several questions and discussed with us.
At the brainstorming stage, team members proposed several ideas. We hold weekly meetings to discuss these ideas and assess the                                 feasibility as well as some design details. The miniature of our project was gradually formed.
Through communicating with other iGEM teams in Asia-Pacific conference                                 held by team NCKU Tainan, we shared our                                 ideas to more people and received some kind advice on how to improve our project.
During the talk with other iGEMers, many teams have the some confusion about how to start a human practice project and how to build the collaboration relationship with other teams.                                 That’s why we started the HP union and tried to gather teams which have same needs.
The visit to our end users opens a new door. We can just know the problem on                                 the paper from the literature research, while the dialogue with COFCO staff and their managers let us know how the problem we focused on will affect the fermentation production.

Introduction
In Japan, few people know about synthetic biology, so we decided to offer an opportunity to get closer to it . Following activities were not only for general public but also for high school students, who will lead the next generation of synthetic biology.
We also succeeded in introducing iGEM and synthetic biology to expert researchers as well as to young generation.We also made efforts for iGEM Japan. What we did is written in ""Activity for iGEM"".
To spread iGEM in general public
""EcoLightsOut""
We have developed an Android app. to introduce our project. This is a puzzle game which uses the counting system we created. In the project, the state of E. coli is changed by stimulus of signal molecules. In the game, players can stimulate the E. coli by touching it. E. coli are displayed in 3x3 or 5x5 grid shape. When you touch an E. coli in the game, the colors of the E. coli and four adjacent ones are changed. This behavior is analogy of diffusion of signal molecules. The goal is to turn all E. coli green.
Synthetic biology is not well-known and thought to be unfamiliar to ordinary people. To introduce synthetic biology into public, an easy entrance such as playing game is effective. We hope that players"

Prof. Chang lets us visit how his project work in An-nan                                                 campus.                                                 Prof. Chang's team has been working with CSC and CPC,                                                 Taiwan to develop innovative microalgae-based flue gas CO2 reduction                                                 and biofuels production technologies. Therefore, they shared the                                                 progress of the whole technologies coming out. From the beginning,                                                 Prof. Chang was focusing on the conversion of biomass feedstock and waste                                                 materials to energy.                                                 Large scale microalgae cultivation                                                 plants were constructed in CSC and                                                 on An-Nan campus of NCKU.
We visited Prof. Chang to discuss about our                                                 carbon capture                                                 system. We had a great time discussing and he gave us three pieces of advice. One                                                 is                                                 to define the velocity of CO2 input in which scale of CO2 we want to                                                 solve with. Another one is to confirm a commercial product like                                                 proteins which can bring us some income to balance the cost. The last                                                 one is to calculate the whole carbon balance from the source of xylose                                                 to the process of waste. We were really appreciated that we can have a                                                 short meeting with prof. Chang.

Re: domination by transgenic crops: genetic engineering can’t compete against 4 billion years of evolution; there is a reason why crops didn’t evolve to be the way we may engineer them – transgenic crops have significant weaknesses as well as strengths.
Re: importance of the environment: we wouldn’t argue we should live in caves so that dolphins can be happy – there are some sacrifices we are not willing to make, and sacrificing the potential good of genetic engineering is one we shouldn’t make.
Re: Monsanto law suit: Monsanto actually distributed the transgenic seeds they claimed spread naturally.
Re: using what we understand: if opposition is in favor of using what we understand, use genetic engineering as opposed to crop breeding, as genetic engineering is more targeted and gives greater control.
Arguments:
1. Role of the State: the role of the state is to regulate the release and not the existence of these organisms – regulate what actually does harm, not just what one is afraid of.
2. Improving the Research Environment: Research freedom attracts people willing to innovate, expanding useful areas of research, supporting economic growth and helping keep our nation globally competitive.

Refutation
Re: prevention: regulation to prevent harm is better - for example, there are preventative regulations for safe business practices.
Re: humans don’t respect the natural order: we do value respecting the natural order, and genetic engineering takes us too far from the natural order.
Re: genetic engineering gives us more control: we’ve bred animals for a long time and understand that technique much better. We are far from having a good understanding of organism engineering – even Dolly the Sheep died early.
Re: improving the research environment – safety takes priority over getting cool scientists.

To learn more, we corresponded with Dr. Silvia Turroni, a primary investigator of the study ""Temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota in people sharing a confined environment, a 520-day ground-based space simulation.""
In your opinion, what is the usefulness of a probiotic bacteria to overproduce butyrate in space/on Mars?
""I believe that probiotics overproducing butyrate can be of great use during space missions. Butyrate is indeed recognized as a microbial metabolite (resulting from microbiota fermentation of fibers – otherwise said Microbiota Accessible Carbohydrates (Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014) with a key, multifactorial role in our physiology. Acting as histone deacetylase inhibitor and/or ligand of GPCRs, it impacts on our metabolic (just think about the role in energy extraction and storage, and appetite control), immunological (with an overall anti-inflammatory activity) and neurological (with modulation of the enteric and peripheral nervous system) homeostasis.""
Would the gut microbiome of an astronaut benefit from ingesting the probiotic in necessary circumstances?
""As observed in MARS500, a 520-day ground-based space simulation (Turroni et al., 2017), butyrate producers of the gut microbiome may undergo significant fluctuations during the stay in space modules, with important repercussions on human health. In particular, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a butyrate-producing bacterial species with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties, recently proposed as next-generation probiotics) was found to be strongly reduced in relative abundance around about 1 year of confinement, when psychological and biochemical data were consistent in highlighting stressful circumstances, with negative feelings, high salivary levels of cortisol, increased immune responses, and positivity to the calprotectin test (used as a fecal marker of inflammation). In other words, the administration of probiotics overproducing butyrate may be effective in preventing/treating these conditions, helping to support/favoring the recovery of a healthy-like microbiome configuration, which is known to be instrumental to human health.""
What sort of circumstances would you deem necessary?
""As mentioned above, circumstances that imply a strong stress for astronauts, both physical and mental, could involve alterations of the gut microbiome and therefore benefit from the administration of probiotics, aimed at restoring balanced (i.e. eubiotic) microbial configurations with health-promoting effects.""
What are some important precautions?

There are 4 Petri dishes on a table between the interns and the bacteria. Inside of the dishes, there is a mixture of water and cornstarch that is semi-solid. The players have to take a loop and search for a key inside of the dishes. The key will open a box containing the DNA sequence for the restriction enzyme enigma (7). Concept: Plating cells
There is a hood between the interns and the bacteria. It is represented by a large plexiglass plate. On this hood there is the word BIOLOGY written in front of 9 empty boxes. The interns have to find papers words related to synthetic biology, and when aligning the letters SYNTHETIC (1 letter of the word for every paper) in the boxes, the bacteria can see a biobrick aligned. The papers can be found in the box opened by the Funnel to the box enigma (8). Concept: Fume hood, sterile environment
There is a tip box on the bacteria side of the room. In that tip box there are 10 cones and a grid attached with symbols on the upper part of the box. Hidden in the room are 3 papers that together tell the players which symbols they have to pick from the grid to make the biobrick. Concept: Tip, pipette, precision
There is a box containing a molecule on the interns’ side of the room. It is a chiral molecule on which is written 3 numbers reversed that can be read in a mirror. The bacteria have to find the mirror on their side of the room and give it to the interns to read the code. The code can then be used to open the box containing the Fan enigma (1). Concept: Chirality
There is a 96 well plate on the bacteria’s side of the room. That 96 well plate is filled with white vinegar, except in 6 holes that are filled with sodium hydroxide crystals. When adding red cabbage juice in each hole, the holes filled with white vinegar turn pink while the holes with the sodium hydroxide crystals turn yellow. By reading the translator grid next to the 96 well plate, the players can find the symbol to align to make a biobrick. Concept: 96 well plate, assays

Regulated Invasive Organism Targeting System
Biomolecule delivery systems are often plagued by problems such as non-specific targeting and low bioavailability. We sought to design a novel system that can sense and respond to specific stimuli present in the microenvironment of pathogenic cells. We engineered a dual-sensor bacterium that can sense increased metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered Escherichia coli to detect increased level of lactate in biological fluid, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. A biosafety kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimizing non-specific targeting.
Our proposed system has the flexibility to be engineered to detect other metabolites by changing the gene promoter and also detect different cell types by targeting other cell receptors.  In addition, the modular nature of our system also allows part of the lactate sensing mechanism to be used as diagnostic kit, especially for detecting for elevated levels of lactate in biological fluids such as blood or serum from patients with suspected case of sepsis or lactic acidosis. This method of detection can be carried out without any specialized equipment or in improvised areas.
INTRODUCING:
RIOT Sensor
RIOT Transponder
RIOT Responder-Invader
The RIOTsystem is a two-component spatial sensor for drug delivery to specific cell types. Using cancer cells as a model, we have engineered E. coli to detect specific characteristics that are present in a range of cancers.
Firstly, the RIOTsystem is designed to detect and survive only in areas of elevated lactate concentrations present in the microenvironment of certain cancer cells due to the Warburg effect. This specificity is conferred by introducing a bifunctional conjugate which consists of an anti-CD44v6 antibody linked to a hemophore, hasA (RIOT Transponder). This hemophore is responsible for triggering the has operon in the RIOTsystem (RIOT Responder) that will allow the engineered E. coli to specifically congregate at"

The Q&A portion was not captured via recording (and unfortunately so), yet it was the one of the most engaging and active portions of the entire debate. The students throughout the classroom entered passionate debate on both sides of the argument; and it was an exciting moment for everyone involved. It was during this time that a student revealed that the MIT study referenced by the Greenpeace representative has since been revoked and denounced, and the student followed by passionately expressing how he felt fear-mongering was the worst form of manipulation for our society.
This debate, with both its ups and down, reminded all of us on the team of the responsibility we all have to be vocal proponents of scientific literacy; and how fortunate all of us are to have had the educational opportunities to be on this side of the debate.
*The Greenpeace representative was recorded in 3 parts due to a technical difficulty with the recording device (a cell phone); but luckily only a few seconds at most were lost!"

Our parts collection features a small library of synthetic protein cages PC Quad 3.0 (obtained from the Yeates Lab) and O3-33 (obtained from the Baker Lab) and their various mutants. These mutants contain insertion mutations that produce a thrombin cleavage site on the exterior of the cage. In the presence of thrombin protease, these mutants are cleaved at the thrombin cleavage site, inducing disassembly of the cage and theoretically releasing an encapsulated molecule.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Teamtest_-_-_TEXT.html,", its incredible complexity juxtaposed with its elegant simplicity is just mind blowing. I see nature and its application as being as limitless as the imagination itself.
Desired Impact on the World:
I live and breathe science, ask mike, and I see myself having a long enjoyable life pondering synthetic systems in microbes, or probing the pathophysiology and treatments of human diseases.
Hobbies:
Outside from lab work and reading ""binders full of journal articles"", I enjoy watching hockey and maintaining my vegetable garden. Occasionally, I enjoy swimming and hiking.

Joel Kumlin
Major and Year:
Chemical Engineering w. Minor in Honours Mathematics
Why iGEM:
2013 - I wanted to learn some biological engineering practices as well as create some worthwhile biological models.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I joined iGEM last year to get more experience with creating models to describe real-world phenomena, this year I am hoping to transfer some skills in modeling and numerical methods to the newer members so that UBC can continue to build award winning models.
What inspires you:
There are so many unfinished. untried, non-optimized systems that can be improved on in this world. The more I learn the more inefficiencies I see.  I get inspired by people thinking of new ways to deal with these inefficiencies and get excited coming up with elegant solutions to these problems. There is so much work to do on this world, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to retire!
Desired impact on the world:
I'm interested in advancing technology, various technologies can be better understood when implementing the language of mathematics. As much as we'd like to think differently, most engineering is still done with ""opinion-based"" decision making. There are chemical and biological fields where the mathematics has not been reduced to a low enough form to become useful for most engineers - moving to ""science-based"" or ""math-based"" decision making can reduce inefficiencies that cost time, money and energy. And I would like to be a part of applying practical mathematics to real world problems.
Hobbies:
When not in labs, or staring at excited liquid crystals - I like hitting the ball long on golf courses and running down shots on the tennis court.

Peptides
Angiotensin-Losartan
The Angiotensin polypeptide causes vasoconstriction, raises blood pressure and causes the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. It is formed by the action of renin on angiotensinogen, an alpha-2-glycoprotein that is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood. Renin acts as an enzyme in response to lowered blood pressure volume in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I which is then rapidly hydrolysed to form the active compound angiotensin II. This renin-angiotensin system also regulates electrolyte balance and arterial blood pressure.  ACE (angiotensin -converting enzyme) is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by removing the two terminal amino acids. ACE inhibiting agents are used in hypertension control and for the protection of kidneys in diabetes mellitus.
Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) such as Losartan (a peptide we desired to make in this project) is a class of drugs acting on the renin –angiotensin-aldosterone system to block the action of angiotensin II on the AT1 receptors and thereby cause vasodilation (AT1 antagonist for the treatment of hypertension). Losartan is an oral drug shown to be the most effective therapeutic for treating hypertension. It is also a drug that is currently being considered as a treatment for Marfan’s syndrome. AT1 receptors are found in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and heart. The RMIT IGEM team intend to anneal a short peptide-encoding primer into a bacterial backbone plasmid to produce Losartan for a fraction of the price needed currently to produce the drug commercially. The peptide sequence we intend on using is  composed of N terminal-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Val/IIe –His-Pro-Phe-C terminal.
Arginine Vasopressin
The second peptide we were interested in producing was arginine vasopressin which is an antidiuretic hormone secreted from the posterior pituitary gland that exerts two important biological functions; (i) potent vasoconstriction and (ii) as the main regulator of water homeostasis and extracellular fluid volume.

Conditions of the integration assay could be suboptimal to favour reaction kinetics of the fusion protein.
Incompatibility of buffers required for transposase and dxCas9 binding reactions, or incompatibility of these buffers with ONT sequencing buffers.
Probable suboptimal compatibility of our designed sequencing adapters with  ONT sequencing platform. The specific adapters’ sequence is not known due to corporate secrets.
We have, however, proven that our fusion protein is able to load sequencing adapters and integrate them at a specific site in their target DNA, allowing this DNA molecule to be sequenced with ONT sequencing platform. Moreover, we were able to identify 89 sequencing events aligned to the DNA target, and even analyse the possible direction for integration of our fusion protein based on one single DNA read out of over 200 000 reads.
4.4 Data Analysis Software
Design: We developed a software tool for data analysis of sequencing data based on a machine learning algorithm to increase the database for reference alignment in an iterative process.
Results and interpretation: To use this tool, please visit our software tool page .
Conclusion
We demonstrated that our fusion protein and sequencing adapters could be used to replace the first reaction in library preparation for ONT MinION sequencing. More importantly, we proved specific targeted enrichment by our fusion protein for library preparation and ONT MinION sequencing. We obtained preliminary results on the position of adapter integration from sgRNA binding site.

Bacterial Reporters
One of the many applications within the area of Synthetic Biology are whole-cell bioreporters. Bioreporters are defined by Jan Roelof van der Meer and Shimshon Belkin as: “microorganisms, cell cultures or cell lines, often genetically engineered, with an activity that reflects changes in environmental conditions in a dose dependent manner”. (van der Meer & Belkin, 2010) They can be very useful to detect the presence of a certain type of compound or organism within a medium.
One of the first uses of bioreporters was the now called Ames test, developed in the 1970s. This test uses a strain of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica that containes an auxotrophic mutation (that is, a mutation that inhibits the capacity of a strain to produce an essential substance so this nutrient must be administered artificially in order for the microorganism to survive) that makes it incapable of synthesizing histidine. The strain can then be exposed to metabolically active proposed carcinogens in order to detect if they are mutagenic. If the strain grows in medium that doesn’t contain a supply of histidine, it means that it developed a new mutation that enabled it to synthesize histidine once again, proving the substance is indeed a mutagen (van der Meer & Belkin, 2010) . Salmonella is considered a bioreporter in this case, because it detects mutagens and reacts to their presence. However, it is not a very efficient biosensor because it depends on the probability that the mutagen will have its effect on the region that codes for the synthesis of histidine.
Over the course of the following years, as scientists gained more knowledge of molecular biology and genetic engineering, whole-cell bioreporters became more common and more precise. Instead of relying on mutations, they began to take advantage of naturally occurring gene regulation mechanisms that enabled the expression of proteins and molecules when the organism was in the presence of a certain substance. Finally, molecular biologists began to genetically modify microorganisms to make bioreporters according to their necessities.
The potential commercial and academic applications of this technology, led to even more research in the area and in the 1990s several whole cell bioreporters were developed using genetic engineering. Some reporters were developed to detect nutrients in soil, such as sugars and proteins. Jaeger and his team published an article in 1999 in which they detailed the construction of a bioreporter that detected sucrose and tryptophan in soil using promoters"

""""Every milk farmer faces mastitis, a challenging udder disease affecting dairy cows."""" Bouwe Gall Frank (veterinarian)
This infection is not easy to get rid of; udders are exposed to the open environment, making the infection a common re-occurrence. All dairy farmers we spoke to in the Netherlands have had to deal with mastitis. Farmers want to have fast administration of antibiotics when treating this disease, as time is of the essence. Our tool makes sure that fast treatment of mastitis can be done in a responsible way, without misusing antibiotics, thereby helping to prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Looking to mastitis, we adapted our tool to detect relevant resistance genes in the common pathogen, Staphylococcus Aureus (SAU), causing this disease.
""""It is relevant to be able to detect SAU pathogens. As there is a huge difference in sensitivity for antibiotics considering MRSA, it would be added value to have a conclusive result on the sensitivity."""" Maaike van den Berg (veterinarian)
After talking to experts with expertise in mastitis from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.
""""MecA can be used to detect resistance against all β-lactam antibiotics."""" Fimme van der Wal (agricultural researcher)
""""Detection of blaZ is a conclusive result to exclude commonly used penicillin treatment."""" Dik Mevius (agricultural researcher)
For further information about these genes check out our applied design and demonstrate page.
After defining our end-users and detection goal, we looked at how we could make our device as user-friendly as possible. From the start of our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the functionality of other proteins upon desiccation. This fitted perfectly in our design with respect to our end-users, as our TDPs enable the transportation and storage of our detection tool at room temperature. Normally, protein function can be maintained when stored at -80 degrees celsius, something that is not always available at your local dairy farm! We also envisioned that this improved storage method will be advantageous for shipping our versatile RNA-detection tool for broader applications.

GeorgiaTech,2015,Team:GeorgiaTech#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," binds to the pili of an E. coli, and Tol proteins Q, R, and A of the E. coli depolymerize the phage coat proteins, allowing translocation of the viral ssDNA into the bacterial cytoplasm (Russel, Lowman, Clackson, 2004). Once inside the E. coli host, the ssDNA is converted into dsDNA by host polymerases. Initially, only dsDNA is generated, but as more of the pV protein is synthesized, it becomes available to bind to newly made single strands and blocks host polymerase from assembling complementary base pairs. After all of the genes are expressed, the phage progeny exit the E. coli lysogenically.
Phage Display
Phage display is a well-established technique that uses bacteriophages to study protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. “Foreign” genetic code is fused to the bacteriophage genome, causing the bacteriophage to display the corresponding “unnatural” peptides or proteins on its coat.
The pIII coat protein is the most commonly used protein for phage display and can be performed with commercially available kits. One important advantage of pIII phage display is its compatibility with a variety of proteins of different sizes. In addition, pIII protein is relatively easy to modify.
Figure 2. Phage display. Phages with varying genetic sequences express varying proteins with differing binding affinities to the substrate. The non-binders are washed, and the binders are subjected to additional cycles of this process and ultimately analyzed (sequenced). Adapted from a figure created by Dr. Graham Beards.
Phage populations can be encoded with entire libraries of varying mutations of a genetic sequence, resulting in the display of a diverse protein collection that can be screened for binding (Figure 2). Non-binders are washed away while binders are eluted, and the selected variants can be further mutated. This cycle is repeated until the library is enriched with only the strongest binders. In the end, all the proteins that exhibit desired binding properties can be efficiently identified and sequenced, making phage display a powerful tool for a wide array of evolutionarily driven protein-discovery research efforts.
In addition to binding-based screening, phage display can also be used for activity-based screening. For example, our project will require a given displayed protein to successfully facilitate the CuAAC reaction if it is to avoid being washed away. More specifically, we hope to use the in vitro selection capabilities presented by phage display to artificially evolve naturally occurring copper-binding proteins into unnatural enzymes that can aid the CuAAC reaction"

Moreover, as an important aspect in the biological research, the safety issue in genetically modified plant requires more consideration.
However, this doesn’t mean that we should give no thought on plant iGEM.
Actually, some previous iGEM teams have done good job in plant. A good choice of chassis is important. Considering the growth cycle, the possibility of genetic manipulation and other factors, plants like Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens may have advantage. On the other hand, teams can consider extending the participation cycle for a deeper research. Also, with a lot of mysteries remaining in the field of plant, its application in breeding, evolution and environmental protection is promising. Even the advancement of experimental techniques can be a good direction in plant research.
Therefore, plant synthetic biology deserves careful consideration but also a brave try. With enough preparation and efforts, it can be possible.
End-User Considerations
According to the discussion during HUST-Cheering conference, we found huge audience market of our gene expression toolkit. If we can relieve iGEMers from constructing complex circuit, more and more people will easily join and create their own project to boom synthetic biology. So we moved on to figure out what our potential end-users need indeed to make a more user-friendly toolkit. Therefore, we delivered a questionnaire to hundreds of iGEM teams around the world by means of e-mail and social networks. Luckily, we received 24 responses. Here is the questionnaire and its analysis.
Questionnaire for Human Practices (End-User Considerations)
Dear friend:  
We are team members of HUST-China. We are looking for potential end-users of our product this year: Signal Filter (for more information, see https://2016.igem.org/Team:HUST-China). In order to optimize our design to better fit the needs of iGEM teams, we hope to hear the voice from all the iGEMers who might be suffering from the problems of unstable gene expression. We will be grateful if you can spare some time to complete this questionnaire. Thank you!

IIT_Delhi,2016,Team:IIT Delhi#Oscillator_-_-_TEXT.html," AiiA. However, as  the temperature is raised to 37 deg. celsius, the lambda repressor undergoes  thermal denaturation and thus the system starts acting an oscillator. The second  part ofour project focuses on modifying the oscillator in [3] such that we are able  to tune the frequency response. The frequency tuning is under the control of  light. Addition of an optogenetic component to the system affords us control over  the frequency by simpling shining light on the system; thus, we call the second  system ”Highly Optogenetically Tuned Frequency Modulator” or as we like to  call it, HOT-FM. We desgined the purported optogenetic system using the Ccas-  Ccar system. Simulations support the hypothesis for frequency modulation. The  Biological realization for this part of our project is still under work. Throughout  the wiki, we explain the different stages of implementation for the two systems.  We begin with a very brief review of the work done of oscillators, followed by a  detailed description of the synchronized oscillators of [3]. An increasingly crucial  component of synthetic circuit design is the use of computational resources. In  this regard, first we replicate the results of [3]; and we build on this computational  model to study the effects of our proposed modifiations. Simulations support our  hypotheses regarding the two systems that we have proposed.
Oscillator Circuits
The aim of synthetic biology is to design and synthesize biological networks that  perform desired funtions in a predictable manner. A significant chunk of workin synthetic biology has focused on the construction of two important type of  networks: switches and oscillators. Synthetic biology is at the intersection of  biology, engineering and computational mathematics. Consequently, there are two  distinct aspects to the design, analysis and implementation of a synthetic circuit:  in-silico and in-vivo validation. Under the in-silico paradigm, we forego the specific  implementational details, rather we are focused on the abstract mathematical  model and the dynamical behavior such a model allows. While for in-vivo analysis,  we work on identyfing the specific biological components that can be used to  implement the identified topology for the synthetic network. Here, we look at  both these aspects for the Danino Oscillator [4].

Human Practices
Our team knew from the start that human practices were just as important to our project as lab work, and so the dry team worked together to brainstorm and discuss some of the main issues our project might face. We wanted to look into the cures for Cholera and Shigellosis already available for those in need in the developing world; after doing some research we found out the distribution to “Third World consumes only 20% of the global supply of pharmaceuticals.”[1] From this we realised that access to pharmaceuticals is massively lacking from ordering to resupply. This became a problem we wanted to try and find a solution for, which we have incorporated into our design . We also realised that with our project using GM bacteria, the people who would potentially use our product might be concerned about that, and so decided this ethical issue was something that must also be discussed and taken into account.

Due to the fact that humans have at least four different blood groups and two different Rhesus factors - all antigens on erythrocytes - blood can not simply be transfused to any random patient. Only blood type O RhD(-) is the universal transfusion blood type, which can be received by every person. One exception is the rare Bombay type. Because of its universal applicability, blood group O is generally used as emergency donor blood, in cases where a patient urgently needs transfusion.
This is where we came up with an idea for T-ECO (Tuebingen erythrocyte converter to O), a practical system to convert blood groups of type A, B and AB of the ABO blood group system into blood group O. The antigens of the ABO blood group system consist of glycosylated proteins on the surface of erythrocytes. Antigens of blood group A and B both have a distinct glycosylation. Blood group AB has both antigens present on the erythrocyte surface. The antigen of blood group O only consists of the primitive glycosylation of five sugars, this is the reason why blood type A and B cause no immunoreaction. Bombay type blood (Oh) has even less sugar residues. Therefore, persons with the Bombay type blood can only accept Bombay type blood.
The main goal of the T-ECO project (also see Figure) is the covalent immobilization of three conversion enzymes onto a matrix. These enzymes are N-aacetyl-galactosaminidase (NAGA) from Elizabethkingia meningosepticum"

BIOCONTAINMENT
Engineering genetically modified microbes requires special precautions to prevent escape or environmental release. To promote innovation at community laboratories, a standard biocontainment method should be available for interested parties that develop a genetically engineered organism to solve a problem. A biocontainment method robust enough to allow a scientist to take a genetically engineered microbe from Open Bio Labs to another facility for further testing should be implemented, effectively securing this community lab as a launchpad for innovation. Additionally, due to the self-governed nature of a community laboratory, there is likely to be more risk for an engineered organism from a laboratory to get released into the environment by accident. A biocontainment method can also serve as a layer of protection for a researcher at a community lab that a large flux of people through its doors. This objective needs further investigation."

We have designed a yeast strain expressing the miraculin protein which will create a beer with this interesting flavour additive. Related part: BBa_K1845002
Lycopene biosynthesis
Lycopene is a carotenoid compound that can be found in tomatoes and many other red fruits. We have designed a yeast strain expressing the three enzymes (CrtE, CrtB, CrtI) responsible for the biosynthesis of lycopene which will create red pigmented beer. Research into the nutritional value of lycopene also suggests that it acts as an antioxidant and therefore has a number of health benefits when consumed as part of a balanced diet. Additionally, this strain provides a basis for producing a yeast strain that synthesises beta-ionone, a woody flavour compund, as lycopene is a precursor in beta-ionone's synthesis.
ATF1 overexpression
The yeast alcohol acetyltransferase gene ATF1 is responsible for regulating the production of a broad range of volatile compounds by yeast during fermentation. We have designed a yeast strain with an overexpressed copy of ATF1 derived from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis which will create a beer with boosted fruity notes. Related part: BBa_K1845003
OneProt2 expression
OneProt2 is a synthetic protein based on the principle of Team SDU-Denmark 2014 's OneProt protein. It contains all the essential amino acids (in the WHO recommended ratio) required in human diet. We have designed a yeast strain expressing the OneProt2 protein which will create a beer with improved nutritional element. Related part: BBa_K1845004
Community resources for growing the brew kit yeast library
We have great hope that brewers and already established members of the DIYBio community will want to create new strains of yeast and add to our open source strain library. TO facilitate this, we have designed a set of genetic parts and protocols to enable the community to more easily produce new and interesting yeast strains from existing commercially available brewing strains. Additionally, these open-source tools for working with yeast are primarily designed to work in a community lab setting, thus we hope to lower the entry barrier for new and existing community labs looking to participate in iGEM as well as making it easier for community labs to share resources.

Week 10 & 11: July 24 - Aug 4
FBA: This week we looked into having a visual representation of the reactions/pathways in e coli BL21. However, the graph had too many nodes and the cobra toolbox could not visualise it. Thus, we looked into plotting a part or subsystems that included reactions of interest. This was done after optimizing the model and then calling the draw_by_rxn command. The command we used to select the specific reactions of interest such as the citric acid cycle was: fluxReactions = Model.rxns(ismember(Model.subSystems,'Citric Acid Cycle'));
Figure 2. A zoomed in section of the Paint4Net dray_by_rxn command on the ecoli_core_model.
Unfortunately, members of the modelling subgroup were more involved with running experiments and other lab duties. The models chosen required more research in order to be developed for our project and required a lot of time. Thus, the group decided to prioritize lab experiments.
Human Practices
Week 1: May 1 - May 5
In the planning phases of our project, our team envisioned a wastewater treatment application to our engineered bacteria; however, much of the planning work done before the start of May was focused on the synthetic biology and engineering aspects of our project. On May 2nd, our team began holding human practices meetings. These meetings, held throughout the summer, focused on both high-level policy aspects of human practices and the education and public engagement aspect of human practices. At our first human practices meeting, the human practices team brainstormed different ways to get involved with the community.
We made a list of bioplastic production companies to contact regarding the input they would have for our team. We sent emails to TELUS Spark, Minds in Motion, TedX, and the wastewater treatment plant in order to secure possible meetings with these organizations.
We also considered different aspects of policy to look into if we had chosen the wastewater treatment application: the safety of bioplastics, the impact of our engineered bacteria on the ecosystem, and the different applications to which our bioplastic is suited (medical implants, 3D printing, etc.) We reviewed the 2016 UofC Calgary team’s human practices efforts in order to understand possible avenues which we could take for our human practices efforts this summer.

UESTC_Software,2015,Team:UESTC Software#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," more extensive, students from different universities gradually obtained a further and clearer understanding of synthetic biology, especially the minimal cell, the minimal gene set and the relationship between them. At the same time, our introduction made everybody get through to our project   and promoted much more interest. This is a good start for the collaboration of iGEM teams in southwest of China. In the end, our instructor Guo Fengbiao made a summary and encouraged us to do what we lobe. After the seminar, we wrote press releases and published in school website of UESTC, attracting more people and making them know much more information about iGEM.
②  Communication with HKU and senior high school
On June 20, 2015, Faculty of Medicine came to our school to introduce their genome sequencing for dissecting transmission pathways of Elizabethkingia anopheles, whose data was very sophisticated and enormous. But their research was charming and provided our project with some advice as well.
The next day, we came to Chengdu NO.7 High School JiaXiang Foreign Language School to preach iGEM competition and related knowledge on synthetic biology with the students from Faculty of Engineering of HKU. We together introduced our software to the high school students, which was a very interesting and significance experience to both of us. Fortunately, the senior high school students showed great interest in synthetic biology and our software, which   inspiring us greatly. Except presenting our own iGEM work and sharing a lot of experience, we would also have more communication in the future.
③  Game--Father’s Gene Detector
We developed an interesting game based on the strategy of our software, which could make users a complete understanding of our half-retaining method. Actually, it is a game for simulating minimal genome selection and linking with PC—side software, developed completely by Xcode. With careful preparation of our art designers, we use five roles instead of nine roles in ancient story, which could reduce the difficulty of the game to some extent. Generally, it will let players enjoy fun and the feelings of freshness of ancient story. Through the game, we wish more and more people experience the function of essential gene visually as well as known more about our software and synthetic biology.
In order to make the comprehension of game by people without the background of biology become easier, we also invited some foreign students to play our game after the publication of version 1.0. It is interesting to note that most of them are attracted by it. Meanwhile,we also collect some comments from these student ，which is more objective.

BIOSINT_Mexico,2014,Team:BIOSINT Mexico#collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," pollute some of our most precious resources, such as water, some of our peer iGEMers have designed  solutions to remediate these hazards. Such is the case of UFAM_Brazil, whose project involves the integration of mercury resistance operon mer into a bacterial chassis. We were glad to involve ourselves with their mathematical modeling development...curious about the outcome? Here we show how it was resolved:
We use the GFP data for the factors concentration and time. Data was provided for specific experiments and we plotted the graphs for time vs concentration.
From this plot we infer that the equation that fitted our model would be and exponential equation. We transferred the data to the Mathematical software and organized the factors as time=x1 and concentration=x2.
Using a non-linear regression for the observe patterns. First we plot a 3d graph for the analyzed data and then we fed a model of the form.
Where GFPi is the data that we obtained, IC is the initial mercury concentration and t is the time.
Therefore, our equation for the fitted model is
With this equation we can infer the intensity of GFP given any time or any initial concentration of mercury, then using the equation reported by JCBRAFF(BBa_E0040) which is
Where y = GFP intensity and x = GFP concentration in nanomolar, we can infer the amount of GFP protein produced by the cell and finally have the ability to predict the concentration of our bioremediation proteins since the concentration of GFP is the same that this proteins. By the equation:
Since the GFPi is given in µg/ml, we have to divide the equation for the Mol weight of Hg.

What is your dream application of syn-bio? “I think a biological supercomputer would be awesome. Either that or genetically modifying flour to be naturally gluten-free.”
Would you be alright with GMOs as food sources even if it risked an ecological imbalance? “If it would throw the balance completely off, like rabbits in New Zealand, then no. Other than that, no. People have been genetically modifying foods for years, just at a lesser state.”

""I’m actually ok with it as long as it’s for a better purpose.""
How would you define better purpose?
""Cloning for instance, a lot of people are against that. I would consider that the ability to have harvest organs available, readily available for people is a better purpose.""

""In general I feel that GMOs are probably a good thing. One of my concerns would be that organizations are taking advantage of developing countries to do things that they wouldn’t be allowed to do in a more developed country. The principle I’m in favor of, obviously if a developing country has the conditions that have the problem needing to be solved that it would make sense to actually do the research where the problem is. So I would be supportive for sure.""

""Humans modifying the way biology works. It has potential to go into unwanted areas I think. There are a lot of good things you could do with it, but there are a lot of things that could happen that wouldn’t be so good. It depends on how far it develops.

Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html," solve our gel problems. Due to better gels we could prove the successful PCRs of Panb1 and Psuc2 and promptly started ligation and transformation of these parts. Initial transformations of mig1 were unsuccessful. However, luc PCRs went very well and we already had highest hopes for this part. Unfortunately, we found two illegal restriction sites (EcoRI and XbaI) inside of luc thus we had to come up with something special: site-directed-mutagenesis (quick-change) using 3 pairs of primers and Pfu-polymerase. Restricitons of Padh1, Psuc2, rox1, mig1, mPR Dr, mPR Xl and RFP (our initial reporter) went rather well but due to missing negative controls in the control gel further steps were not possible this week.

The pellet is resuspended in 250 μL of Resuspension Solution (RNase A added to it previously. This solution is kept at 4ºC). Important: resuspend it completely.
Transfer the suspension to an eppendorf tube.
Add 250 μL of Lysis Solution.
Mix it inverting the tube 4-6 times (DO NOT VORTEX!) until solution gets viscous and slightly clear.
Important: Do not incubate more than 5 min.

This week was all about moving into our new lab and getting everything organized!
Elia, Lena, Lisa, Malek:
We started running PCRs to amplify linear DNA templates we needed for our experiments.
To see whether our lysates are able to express β-Galactosidase, we ran plate-reader experiments that took a bit longer than anticipated, due to the plate-reader's lack of cooperation.
We prepared our own competent cells and transformed them with a vector containing part of the β-Gal gene that can be found on the iGEM plates.
Worked on the fabrication of MITOMI chips that can be attached to epoxy-coated slides.
Felix, John, Matteo, Tim:
Worked on the fabrication of 50 epoxy-coated glass slides for our experiments.
Four of the epoxy-coated glass slides were spotted with Cy3/Cy5-labeled aptamer dilutions.
An experiment was carried out using MITOMI chips to determine whether or not the thrombin aptamers 1 and 2 were able to bind biotinylated-thrombin. As expected, we observed a fluorescent signal from Cy3/Cy5 labeled anti-thrombin aptamers bound to immobilized biotinylated thrombin in the button areas. This experiment was repeated three times and a calibration curve for both aptamers was performed on the same chip.

although we do not successful refold the A-B Toxin, but from the results from the essay, we can infer that use this part as a tool to transport plasmid is very possible to realize. And our cell line building initially prove the possibility of our Project, if give us more time , we will approach the results we design, after the wiki finished, we will try our best to purify this protein in the last 10 days.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Methods_-_-_TEXT.html,"ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Modeling#Landmine_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.2 is recorded. This corresponds to a cell concentration of \(1.6 \times 10^{8} \ mL^{-1}\) or approximately \(2.7 \times 10^{-13} \ M\). With a value for \(k_{1}\) of \(7.3 \times 10^{-12} \ M\), this corresponds to a protein production of approximately 27 proteins per cell per second, which seems fairly reasonable.
Although the model described by equation (15) is able to match the experimental data in [1] really well, assuming that the cooperative binding of DNT to the promoter is the actual mechanism that happens in nature, is too short-sighted. It was already hypothesized by Jagur-Kroll et al. [1] that ""the induction of the yqjF and ybiJ promoters is probably not caused by our target compounds but rather by their metabolites or degradation products, possibly a quinol or quinol derivative."" To obtain a more suitable model description of the landmine promoters, further research in their activation mechanism is needed. However, this is beyond the scope of iGEM and therefore we will suffice with the cooperative binding model described by equation (15).
Fitting to Experimental Data
To further test our promoter activation models, we fitted both models to experimental data found with a plate reader experiment . We decided to fit only the data sets of the yqjF and ybiJ promoters combined with the N  genes, since these are the only ones to show a clear increase in fluorescence. The results are shown in figure 8.
Figure 8: Fits of the promoter activation model described by equation (15), called cooperative promoter activation here,and the standard activation model described by equation (13) to our experimental data. The left panel shows the fit for the jbiJ promoter, the right panel the fit for the yqjFB2A1 promoter.
From the fits shown in figure 8, it is clear that both the standard and cooperative activation model fail to describe the experimental data we obtained. This might have several reasons. Firstly, the response ratio of our measurements is very small compared to the measurements in [1]. Secondly, our experimental data suggest a detrimental effect of induction with high DNT concentration. This effect is not described in [1] and we don't know its reason. It is therefore not included in our model. Thirdly, both the data set from [1] and our experimental data set are small compared to the amount of parameters. This makes finding the right model difficult.

First Inter-Team Meeting (07/14/2017)
In an attempt to learn the methods used by other iGEM teams we participated in an inter-team Skype call. We chose to meet with the other teams sponsored by the United States Armed forces, because we share many of the same challenges. These teams are Lab Pats Carroll High School and the US Naval Academy.
Our team took many notes over the course of the hour-plus long Skype call that helped us to prepare for the upcoming challenges that iGEM poses.
iTesla-soundbio team meeting (09/28/2017)
Cadets2Vets Adviser Judy Nguyen and Cadets2Vets Collaborator from Center for Urban Waters Joel Baker had a conference call with two team members from iTesla-SoundBio: Anna Vasyura and Advisor Zach Mueller. They shared information about each others’ projects and the status of their experiments.
Anna and Zach are looking for help regarding the analysis of the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Joel had previously collaborated with a lab that performed this type of research and had a lot of valuable information to share. One of the significant bits of advice was to pivot the analysis from PCBs to PCEs (tetrachloroethene).
PCBs take a really long time to degrade and the analysis is not fast or easy to do. PCEs degrade a little quicker and make more sense to measure for the iGEM timeline. Joel will meet face to face with"

The aim of our project is to create a bacterium that can detect the presence of vibrio cholerae in water. Some bacteria use quorum-sensing. They produce and release autoinducers; signal molecules which vary in concentration as a function of cell density. When a minimal threshold of autoinducer molecules is detected, gene expression is altered. This provides a mechanism for coordinated behaviour within bacterial populations. The detection of autoinducers involves a histidine kinase in the membrane which detects the signal and autophosporylates on a His residue. A phosphate is then transferred to an aspartate residue of a response regulator which relays the signal. We aim to create a fusion protein in E.coli capable of detecting the presence of CAI-1 (cholera autoinducer). This requires fusion of two related receptors with similar topography. The signal is then transmitted down its native pathway. We have chosen 2 similar receptors to create our fusion protein; BarA and CqsS. BarA is a sensory histidine kinase present in the membrane of E.coli. CqsS is a sensory histidine kinase from vibrio cholerae which detects CAI-1. We aim to fuse the N-terminal (receptor) domain of the CqsS (which detects CAI-1 and autophosphorylates) with the C-terminal (transmitter) domain of BarA (which accepts a phosphate and relays the signal downstream. We will then insert the recombined BarA gene into a high copy plasmid. An alternative is to transform the whole CqsS pathway into E.coli. Phosphorylation of the BarA/CqsS causes the phosphorylation of the response regulator UvrY, which then binds to DNA causing transcription of CsrB (a small regulatory RNA). CsrB inhibits CsrA which, in turn, inhibits certain genes. These genes are part of the pgaABCD operon, a 4 gene locus in E.coli. Upon CAI-1 detection by the fusion kinase, transcription of CsrB causes inhibition of CsrA therefore relieving the inhibition of the pgaABCD gene transcription. We want our biosensor to produce a response visible to the naked eye. We plan to insert E.chromi (from the Cambridge 2009 project) into this operon,"

Lysate Clearing
Transfer 2ml of lysate to a 15ml, capped, disposable centrifugal tube. Lysate volumes larger than 2ml may be processed with multiple columns or the remainder can be stored at –70°C for later use. If the volume of lysate is not a multiple of 2ml, add an appropriate volume of Lysis Solution to achieve 2ml per prep.
Add 4ml of RNA Dilution Buffer (blue) to 2ml of lysate. Immediately seal the tube, and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 3–4 times and then vortexing. Process all samples before continuing.
Thoroughly mix the white Clearing Agent by shaking or vortexing the bottle until all of the material is in suspension. Mix until no material adheres to the bottom of the bottle when inverted. This may take several minutes. Note: The Clearing Agent settles over time and should be remixed between samples. When the Clearing Agent is mixed properly, it will not clog pipet tips.
Add 1ml of Clearing Agent to the diluted lysate. Immediately seal the tube, and mix by inverting 2–3 times and vortex until homogeneous. Process all samples before continuing. Notes:
Combining the RNA Dilution Buffer and Clearing Agent prior to use is not recommended. The Clearing Agent settles more quickly when diluted, and the mixture thickens over time.
The Clearing Agent may form a white powder on the threads of the bottle. You can collect the powder with a wet paper towel and discard it as nonhazardous waste.
Place the tubes in a heating block or water bath at 70°C. Make sure that the tubes are spaced such that they are fully in contact with the heating block or water and the entire sample is heated. Incubate at 70°C for 5 minutes to denature the samples. The heated mixtures may form clumps of precipitated debris. [!] Incomplete heating of samples may result in DNA contamination.
Remove the tubes and cool the heated samples at room temperature for at least 5 minutes.
Wearing clean gloves, place one blue PureYield™ Clearing Column for each sample in a 50ml collection tube. Save the collection tube caps. Label the Clearing Columns and collection tubes to maintain sample identity Note: If cross-contamination is a concern, flat-top tubes should be used, as they can be sealed during centrifugation.
Mix each sample by vortexing or vigorously shaking until homogeneous. Immediately pour the mixture into the assembled PureY"

ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI)
Aiming at spreading the iGEM as well as dedicating to various  social engagements, ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI) was found in 2016, along with the establishment of the first ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech University. The iDPI at ShanghaiTech is set up to encourage every iGEM team to devote themselves not only into advanced scientific researches, but also active social practices.
In the acronym name iDPI, “D” stands for dedication, “P” stands for passion, and “I” stands for inspiration. We expect that with the establishment of iDPI, every iGEMer at ShanghaiTech would bear a strong social awareness in mind, yielding profound contributions and achieving valuable social interests.
This year, the iDPI collaborated with Shanghai Coordinate International School, holding an iGEM Lab Open House Day on Zhangjiang campus.

Self-developed Movie for Propagation Purpose
To better illustrate our strategy and mechanism behind the Solar Hunter, our team self designed, filmed and edited a movie. The movie can be viewed in the following to help you build a better understanding on our project.
Meanwhile, this video is used as propagational and educational tools to spread the iGEM competition as well as synthetic biology. Multimedia approach is undoubtedly the best way to arouse interests when it comes to the young generations. Through our efforts, we expect more and more people, especially young kids could know deeper about synthetic biology, eventually resulting in more social contributions and significance."
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the flagella and single filaments were not visible anymore (B).
Results
For MG1655 nice pictures were obtained since the strain grew very fast and seems to be quite robust (Fig. 9). However, we were not able to obtain meaningful pictures showing flagella of the BL21 strain. Under stress conditions bacteria tend to lose their flagella very easily (Blum, 1971). Apparently the transport form our Lab to the EM-facility was enough to stress the BL21 E. coli. It appears that this demands quite something for MG1655 however, or the pictures we got from this strain were already in a stressed state and the flagella are usually even longer or more in number. We had a look at the different strains with a light microscope in our lab before the EM sessions and they were all motile. This consideration, that the cells were stressed during the transport was supported by their subsequent investigation under a light microscope. The cells were not motile anymore and featured very heterogeneous shapes whereby some formed very long rods. All these appearances are indications for stressed cells. Another problem with BL21 was the very low growth rate, since a high optical density is required in order to obtain an adequate number of cells during preparation. Therefore we had to centrifuge the cultures in some cases which ended up in interwoven filaments (Fig. 9).
In conclusion, we were not able to get informative data about the flagellar structures and morphologies, but we found out, that BL21 is very sensitive and drops its flagella in no time.

This is a fusion protein formed with a Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) and semi-rationally designed copper binding domain (HHTC-Re) as subunits. There are two metal binding domains, allowing for two copper atoms to be bound to each protein molecule. GSGGSG linkers were added in between the CBD and HHTC-Re subunits to spatially isolate the individual domains while still allowing for flexibility.

42ºC state induction speed
Although the development of the improved flip-flop is focused to enhance bistability and not toogle swith speed, we compared the change speed for the “IPTG state” to the “42ºC state” transition (see the note at the end of the page) with the basic flip-flop. This assay was performed using our previously constructed X90 (SspB, RybB double deletion) E. coli strain expressing the improved flip-flop (module I and II) and the basic flip-flop with an empty plasmid (as control). The cultures were harvesting at 37ºC overnight and the switch was force by changing the temperature to 42ºC. Green and red fluorescence levels were measured by fluorometry. The results of this assay are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Fluorescence/O.D. of basic and improved flip-flop during a 42ºC continuous induction. We had to adjust the fluorescence level of the basic flip-flop, dividing the green fluorescence intensity by 7, as in this system the green fluorescence intensity is 7-fold higher than the red fluorescence intensity. This readjustment was not necessary for the improved flip-flop due to the fact that the basal intensity levels of the fluorescent proteins are similar. It can be seen that the state switch in the improved flip-flop occurs before than in the basic flip-flop. Furthermore, the graphics show a bigger green-red fluorescence difference in the improved flip-flop, compared with the basic flip-flop.
IPTG state induction speed
We have collected a huge amount of data to determine IPTG state induction time and swith change using flourometry and flux cytometry. Unfortunately we haven’t been able to analyse all of them"

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," symptoms, the biochemical processes in cells, and how will doctors treat with those situations. Dr. Gu’s review helped us to clarify a lot of details. For example, we found that, the most rewarding as well as the best applied situation in the allergy reactions are Type I hypersensitivity (or immediate hypersensitivity), for which the exposure may be by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or direct contact.
What’s more? During those days, we were also preparing for the exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum, so the review by Dr. Gu also inspired us how to make publicity to ordinary people. Above all, we could make sure that what we would disseminate was accurate, and after that we could try to demonstrate the allergy reaction process in the same Framework as Dr. Gu did, which was very easy to understand.
When this section was finished, we started to ask for some clinical data and experience which correlated tightly with our project.
Those facts and details included that histamine release in Type I hypersensitivity was within several mines, and remains for about 1h; the survival time of immunocytes by the normal way of storage since separated from body was about 24h; the volume of blood sample we were supposed to collect from finger was 10-20μl; the settings of controlled trials for every single test can help to get rid of the influence of Basophil count randomness, etc
The second clinician was Dr. Zhao, from the department of General Surgery.
He told us that himself is allergic to dust mite. And he had the experiment of treatment, so as both clinician and patient, he gave us several application possibilities at both hospital and home.
For the application at hospital, the blood could be collected via Hemospasia from vein, which just needed inserting the needle for one time. It’s already better than Skin Prick Test, for firstly it was in vitro and secondly it only made patient feel “hurt” for one time. And as for the required blood volume for each certain allergen test was relatively small, maybe over 200 allergens could be test with the blood sample collect from the patient at the same time.
For the application at home, it could be used by those patient being treated with desensitization therapy. They had to tracking therapeutic effect, and without our system, they would need return visits to hospital frequently. But once they got our system, they could do finger blood collection with simple hemostix themselves, and test the histamine release to the specific allergen, to which they are treated to get desensitization. Week by week, they"

Summary
On different levels, policy-, competition-, and user level, we investigated the values that our design had to meet. How we translated the values of the stakeholders to design requirements can be found in the figure about the Hierarchical Nature of Values (figure 1). Even though some norms were contradictory (as can be seen figure 2, summary values and norms) , we aimed to meet all the norms and values as good as possible.

Summary
Interview summary
Sjouke Hoekstra is a chicken farmer who has been battling salmonella for a long time. A new policy set up to tackle antibiotic resistance problems says that chickens that test positive for Salmonella have to be slaughtered immediately. In an attempt to prevent salmonella from spreading, Sjouke has spent a lot of money on different cleaning methods. However, the underlying, fundamental cause of the salmonella problem was never really looked into. Sjouke believes that his chickens were infected via their food, which is derived from the Yucca plant.
Sjouke recommended us to dive deeper in the salmonella problem. For this purpose, he referred us to the company AVINED. Furthermore, we could contact the slaughterhouse, to which the diagnostics centre is connected.

Transformations of ligations were unsuccessful :( Positive ligation control was plated on the wrong antibiotic plate, so will repeat that tonight.  Today de-bugged restriction digests.  The gels showed about 50% ligation after 3 hours, so have repeated the double digest with another pSB3K3 sample and 380, 381, 382, 384, and 385, this time separating the DNA into 2 separate digests.  Gel extraction was successful for 380 and 384; PCR-ed more pSB3K3, as this was lost in the gel extraction (actually doesn't need to be gel extraction, can just be column purified).
Another batch of overnight cultures of the 390, 391, 392, 394 and 395 constructs on the pSB1A2 plasmid were made up in preparation for another set of minipreps on the morrow, following exhaustion of the original miniprep stocks.

Dry Work
Modelling
From preliminary data we saw the rate of output drop off at higher input concentrations after an initial rise to the highest rate of production. One possible explanation was that the transcriptional machinery becomes tied up in processing the huge input and results in a slowing of output rate. This could be seen as a form of negative autoregulation that frequently results in oscillation about a stable value. The key factors responsible here were the direct negative autoregulation of protein production and time lags in the transfer of mRNA out of the nucleus, translation and the possibility of mRNA degradation.
It was realised that the simple amplifier system can be solved analytically. A new Matlab file was made to show the results of this, also implementing vectorisation techniques. For degradation of the reporter, numerical integration was necessary.

Positive ligation control grew successfuly overnight, confirm that the ligation was successful.  Possibly lack of vector DNA is why the other ligations didn't work.
