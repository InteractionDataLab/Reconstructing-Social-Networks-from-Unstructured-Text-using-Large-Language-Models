EPF_Lausanne,2013,Team:EPF Lausanne#Kit_-_-_TEXT.html," events organized at our university. For instance, we could use it during high school students visit day or in the ""science bus"" that promotes science amongst young students in Switzerland. And of course, we will use our kit during the Women&Engineering day, the new event our team organized.
Our team translated all the material of our kit in the 3 national languages: German , French and Italian and in English . The kit is entirely designed by us and contains awesome educational material kindly provided by Biobuilder.
Our kit
The kit contains:
- An introduction to synthetic biology and a glossary, written by the team,  explain the fundamental elements of synthetic biology in order to introduce the students to the subject and to the iGEM competition. This document reflects the vision and the summer experience of the team regarding the iGEM competition. It will definitely motivate the students to take part in such an experience!
- Our team not only aims to introduce the students to synthetic biology, but also wants to help the teachers by providing them educational protocols easy to perform, explaining clearly and in a fun way the fundamentals of synthetic biology. Therefore we provide a protocol divided into two parts a “ teacher protocol ” and a “ student protocol "". The teacher protocol is filled up with tips, youtube video links to show how to perform some steps of the protocol and references to material supplies. The student protocol is meant to guide the student thanks toclear pictures of the protocol's steps taken by the team and small tips to help them through the experiment. We provide two protocols, one courtesy of Biobuilder and one done by ourselves , meant to transform competent E.coli with our team’s plasmid . And last but not least, a small summary of the expected results .
- A fun mini safety multiple choice and an educational video from Biobuilder remind the students that safety always goes along with good lab practices.
- Links to youtube videos and comics , courtesy of Biobuilder, show some important lab steps, e.g. how to perform a transformation. Other links to Biobuilder’s famous comic: Adventures in synthetic biology and to Biobuilder forum were added so that students can share their love for synthetic biology! There are also more comics regarding some synthetic biology fundamentals and links to the iGEM competition. We also provide stickers of Biobuilder, iGEM and our project ""Taxi.Coli: smart drug delivery"" as goodies!

Our annealing temperature started at 70*, repeated for 2 cycles, and then decreased 2*, every two cycles, until it reached 58* (the optimal annealing temperature), where it remained until the 25 cycles were complete. We left this PCR going overnight. (See July 13th for the gel image.)
PCR of expression plasmid cross-junction
We also performed a second PCR on colony nine (the colony we decided with which we decided to proceed) to confirm that our omega+zif268 in the spec backbone was successfully inserted into the E. coli. The expected product was the cross-junction on the plasmid, approximately 1.4 kb. We used the same recipe as that used on July 9th, except with a forward primer of PZE23G-3581 F and a reverse primer of PZE23G-2133 R, and had a 55* annealing temperature and an extension time of 45 seconds.
After running an e-gel, we confirmed that our w+zif268 was inserted into the plasmid.
Lane 3: Gel of our PCR to check for the cross-junction in colony 9.
PCR and gel extraction of omega subunit
We performed a PCR to get out the omega subunit+linker, with an annealing temperature of 56* and an extension time of 15 seconds. The miniprep from colony 8 was the template DNA. We will use the product in assembling our final expression plasmids.
We determined that the PCR was successful after running the sample on an agarose gel, and performed a gel extraction so that we could use the product in our isothermal assembly.
Lanes 1 and 2: Gel of our PCR to get omega subunit.
The gel extraction was successful, and we had a final concentration of 120.5 ng/ul.
Overlap PCR of OZ052 and OZ123
We performed an overlap PCR using the ultramer pairs that solely encoded the F1, F2, and F3 fingers of OZ052 and OZ123.  The annealing temperature was 62* and the extension time was 15 seconds.  The results of the PCR can be found below (the products are only in the last two lanes) and the products were also PCR purified before being put into storage at -20*C.
Last two lanes: OZ052 and OZ123 products, respectively

Observations
Here is the gel photograph in which the PCR products were analsyed. The lanes are as follows:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = czrA PCR product
Lane 4 = czrA PCR control
Lane 5 = sac PCR product
Lane 6 = sac PCR control
Lane 7 = ara PCR product
Lane 8 = ara PCR control
Lane 9 = sspb PCR product
Lane 10 = sspb PCR control
Lane 11 = HindIII DNA ladder
It can be seen that the only PCR products produced (i.e. PCR reactions that worked) are the sac and sspb coding sequences - the other PCR reactions didn't work.
Procedure
In light of the unsuccessful PCR reaction (attempting to amplify the czrA coding sequence) the Metal Sensing Team will carry out a second PCR attempt. This time it will be done on the prepared genome of B. subtilis

Graph illustrates that there is a very significant difference( ** indicates P value 0.001 to 0.01) between different conditions. Data represents an average of 3 samples. Error bars show standard deviation.
The results above indicate that it is possible to tune the expression of the sigma 11 promoter by tuning levels of sigma11. The first approach is to change the expression level of promoter generating the sigma factors, and the second approach is to change the copy number of plasmid in which the sigma factors are expressed.
Anti Sigma Factors
To be used together with the ECF sigma11 and its promoter pair is anti sigma11 ( BBa_K1461007 ) reported to be able to repress the activity of ECF sigma 11 in activating the sigma11 promoter. However, when its functionality was tested previously, by iGEM-UT Tokyo 2014, the results suggested that the anti sigma 11 was not able to repress the activity of ECF 11. It was hypothesised that anti sigma11 not functioning due to “ the sigma factors [were] expressed more than the anti-sigma factors could repress their activation of the corresponding promoters.” Thus, we attempted a new characterisation this time ligating anti 11 on a high copy plasmid and ECF sigma11 on a low copy plasmid in order to increase the level of anti 11 relative to sigma11.
The figures below show the result of our characterisation and the previous characterisation of anti 11 done by UT-Tokyo 2014.
Figure 8. Functionality assay of anti 11 by increasing concentration of anti11 relative to sigma11.
Instead of generating sigma11 on backbone pSB1C3 as done in by iGEM UT-Tokyo 2014, sigma 11 was generated on backbone pSB3K3 and anti11 in pSB1C3 as an attempted to increase the level of anti11 relative to sigma11. The measurement shows that there is a significant level of difference between the anti sigma 11(-) construct and antisigma 11 (+).  However, the difference between the complete OFF state (without sigma) and with anti 11 state is also very significant.  Data represents an average of 3 samples with error bars representing the standard deviation.
From figure 6 above, it can be suggested that anti sigma11 can function to inhibit the activity of sigma"
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Panel Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html," it fits well in this event day of the city of Darmstadt. It's a long way for synthetic biology to be accepted as normal technology in Germany. The iGEM team from Darmstadt played a small part in this issue but the following iGEM teams in Germany will also do so.
1. Junior
9th September 2012 Lab course with students from Highschool
To make not only the iGEM competition, but also the Synthetic Biology well known in the public awareness, the Darmstadt iGEM team decided to host a student internship. At the beginning of September came about 20 students of the Ludwig-George Highschool to the biology campus of the TU Darmstadt. In this laboratory course, students were able to transpose their theoretical knowledge of molecular biology techniques into practice. As molecular detectives their task was to analyze an unknown meat sample on its species. For this purpose, the students were allowed to purify mitochondrial DNA and perform a PCR for amplification of a specific mitochondrial gene. After a restriction digest and separation of the resulting fragments with agarosegel-electrophoresis the students were able to define the species of their samples. During the breaks, the iGEM team used the opportunity to present their project to the students and to discuss the importance of synthetic biology. The students were very receptive to the topic and immediately recognized that such issues playing no role in school and should be discussed more often. It was not only a new experience for the students, but also for the iGEM team to discuss ethic issues of Synthetic Biology and how the society could learn more about the opportunities which are given by that.
We really enjoyed the day with the iGem Team . We learned a lot of new things, but we also repeated what we already knew from school. It helped a lot that we could do the experiments on our own, because in biology it is very difficult to understand experiments if you don´t see them in front of you. If we had questions, we could ask the iGEM team and they explained it very well. They also explained us the idea of the bacterium which is able to recycle plastic and the whole group liked the idea. Altogether it was a very interesting and informative day and it should be possible for every class to take part in something like this.

Plasmid construction
In our project, these plasmids are required.
Receptor plasmid
Coding sequencing of Human histamine receptor (HRH4) was got from plasmid pH4R-mCherry-N1. Separately, HRH4 CDS and HRH4-mCherry fusion sequencing were obtained by PCR. We chose pGADT7-AD (Leu2 marker) and use HindIII to remove SV40-NLS sequencing, GAL4 activation domain and HA tag. Then insert HRH4 or HRH4-mCherry between ADH1 promoter and ADH1 terminator.
Fig.2 The insertion of HRH4 or HRH4-mCherry into pGADT7-AD plasmid
pGADT7-HRH4-mCherry was used to express HRH4-mCherry fusion protein to show the expression and localization of HRH4 in yeast. pGADT7-HRH4 was used to express functional HRH4.
Reporter
We used part: BBa_K775004 as our reporter, because it was not released, so we used PCR to get Fus1 promoter from yeast genome, EGFP and ADH1 terminator from other plasmids, then used Gibson assembly it with EGFP and inserted into plasmid pYSE2.0 digested with SpeI and EcoRI (Ura3 marker).

OLS_Canmore_AB_CA,2015,Team:OLS Canmore AB CA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," specific characteristic that we could do directed evolution on- finding a high temperature functioning mutant is a possibility, but many Keratinases have already been identified from hot-spring bacteria (I think, might be wrong on this) that naturally function at high temperatures; simply finding a mutant that ""has greater activity"" doesn't seem particularly fruitful since the main problem isn't low activity intrinsic to the enzyme but instead its recombinant overexpression at industrially useful levels. We also tried looking at was possible applications of using the byproduct of the reaction besides chicken feed (the degraded feather waste is sometimes reused as feed for chickens), maybe to make a useful biomaterial or something- but had no luck after a decent amount of searching. Of course, it would be cool if we could get an actually functional Biobrick of any given Keratinase in the registry, so that by itself would be a great potential goal for you- we just wanted to go beyond that. Obviously recombinant Keratinases have been successfully expressed in many other contexts/papers by multiple different approaches, so it is definitely possible. Also, if you find anything else that we missed, that would be cool too- for instance we hadn't thought of the wastewater plant application. Let me know if we can help you with anything else, as we would definitely be interested in collaborating/helping to mentor your team. We'd definitely be very interested to find out what approach your team ends up going with this project. I'm sure you've read some papers on Keratinases already, but I've attached the reading that I've found to be most helpful in terms of overall orientation in the field (starts Chapter 33, p. 881). Sorry if I went too detailed into things- I had a bit of time between experiments so decided to elaborate a bit. Hope this was helpful.

Hi,
Firstly we would like to thank you for giving us so much advice. We have already designed our biobrick for this year, but will take many of these considerations into thoughts for upcoming years. We had some questions about the cleaving of the feathers. You said that a Keratinase alone could not cleave the disulfide bonds of the feathers, but would that cleavage be possible if first we put the feathers through a manual mechanical treatment beforehand, to allow for them to be broken down as much as they can be when we put them into the Keratinase solution? We had thought about this when brainstorming.We also wondered how you would implement the enzyme, or the bacteria safely in the poultry industry"

March for science
On  April 22nd , people went on the streets to support science and research against the ignorance regarding scientific facts for political purposes worldwide. The iGEM team Potsdam partook, equipped with our handmade posters, on the sister march for science in Berlin. We protested alongside with other scientists and supporters against the distribution of “alternative facts” and the hostility towards science. According to the organizer, 11.000 people demonstrated in Berlin. On the same day, there were also sister demonstrations in other german cities like Bonn, Cologne and Hamburg.

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," dimers, bases modification, etc., therefore the bacteria releases RecA resulting in polymerized and filamentous structures which bind to and stabilize DNA [2], letting some error-prone DNA polymerases (translesion synthesis) to come and copy, randomly, the DNA. Solving the problem this way provokes several mutations in the bacteria's genome but it will stay alive because it maintains a functional DNA. Activation of the polymerases IV and V only occurs in advance stages of the response.The system comprises a negative regulator of the SOS response (LexA) and a positive regulator of the SOS response (RecA). The idea is that UV irradiation promotes LexA autocatalytic activity and RecA is activated. Then, LexA will not be able to bind to the promoters (SOS boxes or LexA boxes) and transcription will start (here is our construction with the protein we want). The process is relatively slow, reaching higher values of expression more than one hour later [3].
In our construction, we have picked out the LexA-binding site inside RecA promoter and then we have inserted a GFP sequence. Then, after irradiating we can see fluorescence… E. coli has accomplished our order!
How did we deal with this construction? We designed a UV-irradiation controlling device called Tordeitor 3000, so we could emit UV (254nm) without risk. After putting the plates, we irradiate different times in order to expose E. coli to different energies [4,5,6].

Dr Embers also discussed her research into the challenges of diagnosing and curing Lyme disease. She reviewed the current testing methods for diagnosis – with early serology tests including IFA, ELISA, western blots and PCR, and later stage diagnostics testing for antigens/antibodies in CSF, urine and the blood. Dr Embers identified several issues with the current system - these tests are not specific or sensitive enough to diagnose patients at all phases of the disease, antigenic variability may prevent antibody recognition and western blots have a degree of inaccuracy when detecting the antibodies present. She proposed a more sensitive analysis technique that her team had been developing – a 5-antigen Bioplex assay.
During the afternoon session, Dr Jinyu Shan presented the University of Leicester's alternative diagnosis method – engineering bacteriophages to effectively kill Borrelia by overexpression of holins and endolysins (phage-encoded enzymes). According to Dr Shan, the pilot study indicated the novel diagnostic test had a 75% senstivity and 100% specificity on serum samples as small as 400 µl, as well as being able to distinguish between Lyme and relapsing fever Borrelia strains.
Being able to interact with research specialists, GP’s and actual Lyme disease sufferers was a fantastic opportunity to gauge first-hand the opinions of different demographics in response to our project. We spoke to several researchers investigating epidemiology, novel targets for diagnosis, and new treatments, as well as several patients who had recently finished their course of antibiotics following diagnosis. We were very fortunate to speak to Dr Tim Brooks – the current director of Public Health England’s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL). The RIPL act as the governmental body for acute diagnostic facilities for a wide range of diseases in the UK, including zoonotic vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease. After discussing the advantages and limitations of the current serology and PCR diagnostic tests, we proposed our paper-based sensor and explained the testing procedure. He acknowledged the usefulness of a more robust, faster detection system, but shared some reservations concerning our intended method for sample testing – Borrelia bacteria are very rarely present in the blood at a high enough concentration for detection through traditional techniques. As we discussed this issue and how we could overcome this, we mentioned our plans for alternative applications. Dr Brooks emphasised how useful our sensor would be for detection of leptospirosis – a bacteria commonly detected in the blood samples RIPL"

We also had the opportunity to know a little about the perspectives and concerns of the three persons in the meeting. They perceive the problem that the regulations regarding the handling of bees and their products are not enough for reaching a strong and growing beekeeping sector, and although they have tried to promote the implementation of a NOM (Official Mexican Norm), they have seen little possibility and many impediments. They also shared with us their concern about how there exists a barrier between researchers and producers; the needs and advances sometimes do not go hand in hand and there is no adequate implementation and development.
Device where queen bees are transported
We had the privilege to share all this important talk with queen bees and worker bees! They were being transported and couldn’t stay in the car. We could get to know how the transport should be done and how queen bees were marked in the superior part of their thorax to be recognized.
The three assistants to the meeting could obtain a new approach to beekeeping when we presented them our project and the scopes of synthetic biology. They congratulated us, approved the project and put themselves at our disposal for what we could later need.
We consider this event very important in the development of our project. Here, the legal plan originated thanks to the guide of laws that we were told were essential to review; a project like ours needs to adhere to the norms and regulations of the place to be implemented. Finally, it is essential to have the points of view and recommendations
of MVZ specialists in bees regarding the experimental plan of the mathematical model that is based on the different environments of the bee anatomy.

Control by repression: lambda cI
The repressor used for this project is the lambda phage cI repressor. When the lambda phage infects a bacterial cell, 2 outcomes are possible: i) it either produces phage particles and lyses the cell (lysis) or ii) integrates its DNA into the bacterial genome (lysogeny).  cI is a protein that repressed the phage lytic function and is expressed during the lysogenic state to prevent the production of phage particles and therefore prevent the host cell lysis. cI forms a dimer in order to act on the promoter “PCI” regulated by cI. If the PCI sequence is adequately inserted within a promoter sequence of a given gene, the later is control of the cI repressor (if present).  The repressor in available with the BBa_C0051 biobrick, the PCI sequence is present in BBa_K098995 biobrick.
Expression above a given temperature: RNA thermometer
RNA thermometers are 5’UTR regions of mRNAs that have alternative structures according to the temperature: i) at low temperature, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD) associates by base-pairing to a sequence of its transcript preventing the recruitment of ribosomes and protein synthesis; ii) at higher temperature, the pairing is weakened and ribosomes recognize the SD allowing the protein synthesis (cf. Fig 1). These sequences are present in prokaryotes. They were identified in 1989 [4], however the expression ""RNA thermometer"" was coined in 1999 to describe the RNA rpoH discovered in E. coli that controls the expression of heat shock genes. Some pathogenic bacteria used RNA thermometers to induce the expression of virulence genes at high temperature within the host as it is the case for Listeria monocytogenes.
Figure 1: The regulation of a gene translation by thermometer RNA.
An RNA thermometer characterised by The TU Delft 2008 team is available via the biobrick BBa_K115017 (Fig. 2) which can be used to allow protein expression only above 32°C.
Figure 2: The biobrick BBa_K115017, composed of an RBS, containing an RNA thermometer, under the control of a constitutive promoter.

Background
Our project includes different proteins and an underlying concept seen in nature. In this section we will provide some additional information about the parts and principles on which our project is based.
Gelation and Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation
As the name of our project (GUPPI) states, we are making a system that initiates gell formation based  multivalent protein protein interactions. In the design process we took inspiration from a common cellular organiser; Membraneless organelles.[1]
Classical views on cellular organisation show that this is carried out by membrane surrounded organelles like the Golgi and Endoplasmic Reticulum. In recent years a lot has become clear about a new type of organizer, called membraneless organelles. These organelles are phase separated from their surrounding environment and function to separate or concentrate biological macromolecules.
Examples of membraneless organelles are the nucleolus, P bodies and stress granules. There is a wide range of the biological functions that membraneless organelles facilitate. The nucleolus is an example of a membraneless organelle and it produces ribosomes. P-bodies, also membraneless, are required for the translation and transport of mRNA (lack of P-bodies results in large amounts of untranslated mRNA). Next to the protein processing, protein storage and transport, the organelles are also important for signalling. An example is the activation of MAP kinase by the clustering of binding partners to a phosphorylated TCR.[2]
Phase separation is a phenomenon seen when molecules reach their miscibility limit in solution. i.e. if a molecule concentration is too high it will phase separate. What we know of membraneless organelles is that these often contain multivalent macromolecules which have either intra- or inter-molecular interactions. Multivalent molecules inherently assembly into larger structures leading to high local concentrations driving phase separation of membraneless organelles into liquid-like droplets [1,3-4]. You can think of this like oil droplets in water. In other words, phase separation is a consequence of"
BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," However, note that there was significant red fluorescence in all colonies, which is against our expectations seeing as the plates had a fair amount of methionine in them (meaning that the promoter driving expression of the repressors, PMET25, would be inhibited) and no galactose (meaning that there is no inducer for the promoter driving expression of the activators, PGAL1).  Thus, one might expect lower levels of RFP for all plates, low levels of YFP for the activator networks and high levels of YFP for the repressor networks.  These discrepancies could stem from the fact that there is leakiness of the PGAL1 promoters (explaining too much RFP) or the mCYC promoters (explaining too much YFP in the activator plates), that the yeast strain used could have different pathways that affect the activity of the promoters in a different way than originally observed by Ajo-Franklin, or that the media itself contains something that could affect the activity of the promoters.  Also, is the Bacto Agar completely free of both amino acids and galactose/methionine?  If not, it could contribute to changing what we observe on the plates, but would have no effect on the liquid cultures.  The only way it would have an effect is if the Agar somehow complemented the auxotrophies itself, thus allowing cells to grow without being properly transformed.  At the very least, this would explain the difference between the brightfield and fluorescent views. Another possibility to consider is autofluorescence.  What is interesting is the difference in the number of observable colonies between brightfield and fluorescent modes.  One might expect that all colonies on a plate would have the same fluorescence because, in order to grow, they all need to complement the correct auxotrophies as those contained in the shuttle vectors.  That there is a discrepancy here as well might even point to how we linearized the DNA.  It might be worthwhile to run a gel on the linearization digests in case we suspect that they did not cut as we wanted them to.
Description of Bacto Agar:
""BactoAgar is optimized for beneficial calcium and magne-
sium content. Detrimental ions such as iron and copper are
reduced.Bacto Agar is recommended for clinical applications,
auxotrophic studies, bacterial and yeast transformation
studies and bacterial molecular genetics applications.""
It seems we don't have a problem using BactoAgar.  This quote came from http://www.bd.com/ds"
NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," The drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as ""starve cancer cells"".
Chemotherapy treatment costs 5-6k RMB (around 890$) each time, and interventional treatment charges the same. Medicare reimbursement for cancer patients covers about 50% of the expense, including repayment for about 90% of drugs costs, but this does not include imported drugs or molecular targeted drugs.
Mr. Zheng also had a good knowledge of gene therapy and other new therapies. From the perspective of patient and his family, gene therapy in Japan is currently more advanced and developed, including a relatively well-known therapy called AK therapy. The patient told us that, molecular targeted therapy treatment can cost hundreds of thousands RMB per years. Molecular targeted drug costs as high as 20 thousands RMB (30,000$) per month. Added with fees of chemotherapy and infusion of nutritional supplement, the monthly treatment will be costing at least 30 thousand (4,500$) RMB. Therefore, Mr. Zheng cannot afford the treating charges, although he believes that treatment consisting of chemotherapy controling the disease and targeted drugs is ideal.
At present, the unaffordable price of molecular targeted drugs still block the way towards actual clinical use.
Ms. Meng (30-year-old)      Gastric cancer sufferer
Several months ago, Ms. Meng felt stomach pain very occasionally, but she thought it was just a small stomach problem. Until an examination in May 23rd, 2016, Ms. Meng was told that it was gastric cancer. So far she has been treated for nearly half a year.
Now Ms. Meng mainly takes the treatment of chemotherapy combined with medicine taken orally. Her treatment period is 3 days chemical injection every 24 days and her temporary treatment cost is about 20k RMB (3,000$) as she has just started chemotherapy. Ms. Meng quitted her own work, and her husband frequently ask for time off work to take care of her. Currently the treatment cost has became a massive burden for her family. At present, the main side effects of chemotherapy on Ms. Meng is nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite etc..
Since Ms. Meng hasn’t been treated for a long time, she did not know much about the updating treatment method specifically. As for the molecular targeted therapy, she has only heard of it. Ms. Meng decided to follow the doctor's suggestions. If the doctor considers her suitable for molecular targeted therapy, Ms. Meng will be really willing to try the new drug.

Results
Our plan from the beginning was to be able to successfully construct a number of new biobricks that would allow E.coli to produce a number of fragrant terpenoids.  It was decided early on that we were going to use Gibson assembly of linearized sequenced new biobrick parts, in conjunction with 3A assembly to assemble our composite parts, shown below:  
 
Figure 1: Original plan for composite parts
In conjunction with the composite part, we had planned to screen various compounds that where kindly given to us to by Givaudan as reference points, as the compounds we were producing with our biobricks matched the reference compounds we had been given, giving us the opportunity to compare our results to them.  On top of this it was hoped that an increase in the concentration of substrate could be used by the enzyme in the E.coli by introducing the Mevalonate pathway from plants, which in the scale up we would hope would increase our yield.
In summary during this project, we have designed new biobricks containing [the enzymes] that was subsequently synthesised. We then successfully constructed a new basic biobrick part containing R – Linalool synthase using the Gibson assembly method. We have caracterised this part using Gel electrophoresis.
We firstly optimized sequences containing R-linalool and Zingiberene and these genes were synthesized by Life technologies. We opted to use Gibson assembly method in the assembly of the linearized sequence fragments onto the standard RFC10 compatible backbone pSB1C3. We were then able to use Gibson assembly to successfully place R-linalool into pSB1C3 as well as Limonene from pSB1C3 onto pSB1A3 (Figs 1 and 2)

Figure 13. Results of high-throughput assay for MTB and control strain. F denotes fragments obtained from MTB genome (a) or control strain (b); P denotes markers from each fragment.
To validate the results in a quantitative way, we selected Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test of Block Design as a model, in which the sum of Wilcoxon Rank Sum statistics Wj (1≤j≤m) of each block was calculated as
With the data of our experiment substituted, the statistics WBD was calculated as
 
Therefore MTB and control strain (E.coli) are significantly different in signal. That is, our PC Reporter system is able to distinguish the sequence of MTB genome from that of other non-specific strains.
Methods
Clone construction of split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein
We cloned our split luciferase-dCas9 fusion protein in the pET-21a by Golden Gate assembly (Figure 14a,b).

Selection of test target sequence
Before taking the sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) genome as target of our PC Reporter system, we first performed our experiments within a test target gene, which must not only conform to the substrate requirements of dCas9, but also harmless and safe enough to its bacteria carrier after chemical transformation. After screening over iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we finally took Part: BBa_K909009 (cDNA of UV-B sensing protein UVR8 from Arabidopsis thaliana (from iGEM12_ETH_Zurich) as the test target(Figure 15).
Figure 15. Schematic of Part: BBa_K909009.
sgRNA generation
To obtain sgRNA, we used SSPD to screen out all guide sequences from the entire genome and Oligo Generator to generate oligos for Golden Gate Cloning, then inserted all guide sequences into sgRNA Generator backbone (Figure 16). Through PCR amplification and cell-free transcription using HiScirbe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs), the sgRNA was produced and purified at last.We specially thank ZHA"

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html,", however these are not necessary as carbon fixation would be performed by the plant itself. Finally a CaA - carbonic anhydrase converting HCO3− to CO2 would be included, also Cso3 a Carbonic anhydrase embedded in the carboxysome membrane would be present.
However it needs to be inactive within the carboxysome/vesicle and active only upon entry into chloroplast. Therefore possible fusion protein with 3 domains could be created containing CA on the inner end, then transmembrane subunit and a transit/fusion peptide targeting it to the chloroplast. Upon fusion into chloroplast the fusion protein would be cleaved and CA would become active.
problems:
-Creation of carboxysome ( a whole ""organelle"") within a chassis not previously having any.
-Creating vesicles out of carboxysome, which would not release any of its content out into bacterial cytoplasm (whole compartmentalisation would not work)
-This also raises a question of what concentration of HCO3− can be transported within one vesicle, if the concentration is too low it will not function.
Transport of vesicles from bacteroid into the chloroplast: OMV
Could be largely based on the OMV-outer membrane transport, which has been worked out by igem team paris 2009. However a number of outer-transit/fusion peptides would have to be different to ensure targeting towards chloroplast and succesful fusion into the chloroplast.
problems:
-Usual transit peptide used for fusion protein targeting from cytoplasm into chloroplast (5kDa Rubisco subunit) might not work in targeting of the wholve vesicle into the chloroplast.
-Previous igem team have developed OMV to transport proteins from cytoplasm to another bacteria. In this situation however we would use OMV to transport concentrated solution from carboxysome - ""organelle"", therefore the OMV itself might not work on our setup.
Ideal solution: Engineer carboxysome with Carbonic anhydrase within plants (possibly within chloroplast) and use it to generate high CO2 concentration.

First Assay:
Figure 19: Representation of our biochemical assay #1
Throughout our first assay, each group was grown in LB broth mediums containing 2% glucose and antibiotics.
To culture group #1 (KO11 un-engineered), we only added Chloramphenicol at a final concentration of 40 µg/mL since KO11 un-engineered only had resistance to Chloramphenicol in its genome; and to the mediums of the groups numbered 2, 3 and 4; we added Chloramphenicol at a final concentration of 40 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml Ampicillin. The reason was; groups 2, 3 and 4 had plasmids which carried Ampicillin resistance due to their backbone (pSB1A3). Thus, with the addition of antibiotics to the mediums, selectivity was assured.
Cultures were grown overnight, and refreshed in the morning as two sets (First set: 10 mM furfural, 2nd set: 20 mM furfural). After approximately two hours of incubation for both of the sets’ falcon groups (when they reached OD 0,6), furfural was added to their mediums.

We implemented a protocol for testing the response of our Minimum Blue Light Receptor Promoter (Min-BP) in which we irradiated cells with the construction Min-BP + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040 with blue light (470 nm) leds for different times. We also irradiated with green (540 nm) and red (660 nm) light leds to discard any crosstalk of these wavelengths. GFP expression was compared to a reference: J23101 promoter + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040.
We measured GFP expression of our constructions, in order to irradiate the cells with Min- BP + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040 we used blue leds and irradiated the cells for 300 minutes, we also measured GFP expression of cells that were incubated in the dark and cells with the constuction J23101 promoter + RBS BBa_K360031 + GFP BBa_E0040.
For the experiment, cells were incubated overnight in M9 medium with glycerol (0.4%) as carbon source, in the morning OD600 was measured and cells diluted to 0.07 nm. After dilutions, we started irradiation with blue leds. Temperature is a very important factor in the function of the YcgF/YcgE system; it is reported that at 25ºC the ratio between the YcgE repressor and YcgF activator allows a good repression unless there is blue ligh irradiation, so we incubated cells with this promoter at 25ºC. Cells with the constitutive promoter BBa_J23101 were also incubated overnight at 37ºC.

On September 23 Team BIT together with BIT-CHINA held a session for the class of 2016 undergraduates in Beijing Institute of Technology. Because most of the students’ knowledge of biology was just stayed in the stage of high school, the whole session was on the basis of synthetic biology knowledge and then extended to the projects of two IGEM teams. Before the beginning of session, Team BIT had distributed the leaflets which included brief introduction of our project to the students. The whole session lasted almost two hours and had great feedback.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Latex_-_-_TEXT.html," with production
Produced by the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis, natural rubber is an emulsion consisting of numerous proteins, starches, sugars, oils, resins, and alkaloids.  From this emulsion latex is perhaps the most important product.  Used in a wide variety of applications, latex accounts for the highest fraction of technically used elastomers, besides polyesters that consist of medium chain length hydroxyalkanoates (PHAMCL).[1, 2] Additionally, latex exhibits a large stretch ratio and high resilience to repeated stress, which makes it an ideal material for constructing flexible yet durable structures.[3] Because of its structural properties, latex is an ideal material for constructing flexible structures that need to adjust to variable mechanical stresses.
Currently the only source of commercially usable natural rubber that can be processed into latex is available from the rubber tree H. brasiliensis.  While other plants are capable of producing rubber particles, these particles when processed are weaker, requiring less extension to break, compared to natural rubbers produced by H. brasiliensis.[4] In fact, H. brasiliensis is responsible for almost all of the world's natural rubber production through mostly rubber plantations or tree tapping.[2]  Rubber farming however in recent years has been threatened by production shortfalls owing to diseases such as South American Leaf blight. H. brasiliensis’ narrow genetic base also signifies most large acreage farms plant genetically identical trees, making them prone to large crop failure.[5, 6] This problem is further exacerbated by deforestation and the growing land need for agriculture, which both decrease the amount of land available for rubber tree plantations, and consequently limit rubber production.[7, 8]
Due to the difficulties of harvest and acreage demand on latex plantations, chemical synthesis of synthetic latex is appealing alternative to natural latex. Although natural latex and synthetic latex have different chemical and physical properties, both materials are largely comprised of cis-1,4-polyisoprene polymers. While natural latex is difficult to handle and has diminished durability, resilience, and elasticity without vulcanization, synthetic latex does not require vulcanization and can be prepared using different proportions of isoprene monomers to yield a wide range of physical, mechanical, and chemical properties.[9, 10] By varying the mixture of isoprene and styrene butadiene polymers, synthetic rubbers have a unique advantage in that they can be tuned to a particular use.  However, synthetic rubber lacks the mechanical and low temperature performance of its natural counterpart.  Despite characteristic differences, both natural latex"

The Hybrid Model
Introduction
The hybrid model represents an intermediate level of detail in between the                         colony level model and the internal model. Bacteria are treated as individual agents                         that behave according to Keller-Segel type stochastic differential                         equations, while chemical species are modeled using partial differential       equations. These different models are implemented and coupled within a single       hybrid modeling framework.
Partial Differential Equations
Spatial reaction-diffusion models that rely on                         Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are based on the assumption that the                         collective behavior of individual entities, such as molecules or bacteria, can                         be abstracted to the behavior of a continuous field that represents the density                         of those entities. The brownian motion of molecules, for instance, is the result                         of inherently stochastic processes that take place at the individual molecule                         level, but is modeled at the density level by Fick’s laws of diffusion. These                         PDE-based models provide a robust method to predict the evolution of large-scale                         systems, but are only valid when the spatiotemporal scale is sufficiently large                         to neglect small-scale stochastic fluctuations and physical granularity.                         Moreover, such a continuous field approximation can only be made if the behavior                         of the individual entities is well described.
Agent-Based Models
Agent-based models on the other hand explicitly treat the entities as individual                         “agents” that behave according to a set of “agent rules”. An agent is an object                         that acts independently from other agents and is influenced only by its local                         environment. The goal in agent-based models is to study the emergent                         systems-level properties of a"
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo,2017,Team:Botchan Lab Tokyo#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.   In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialize GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?  It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Identify the level of risk.
Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Good hygiene of workers.
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures"

Dealing with intellectual property is not only necessary on a competition-wide level - each team must also make decisions as to how they wish to deal with the intellectual property they will acquire during the course of their project. Deciding whether to file a patent application can be a tricky decision - below are just some of the factors you might want to take into consideration...
We conducted a survey of attitudes within iGEM teams to intellectual property. The results, illustrated below, are analysed in detail in our report. Broadly, we found a noticeable lack of understanding of IP issues (confirming the findings of ??? iGEM team in ????), and a great deal of social mindedness in the responses.

What is your primary source of information about synthetic biology?
As we can see,
How would you rate the quality of this information?
The respondents rated information highly for accuracy (although perhaps this is to be expected as it is unlikely one would continue to read information from a source which regularly got the facts wrong). Relevance also scored highly, showing that people feel synthetic biology has a sufficient impact on their lives that they ought to be kept informed about it. The high score for availability is likely due to the heavy reliance on online information, however it is probable that this reliance also contributes to the relatively low scores for independence and accessibility. The sources accessed by the public online may well not be aimed at laymen but intended to be read by students or professionals and so may contain a high level of technical detail not accessible to the lay public.
The majority of teams (85%) appear to feel that there is at least the possibility that their project could be turned into a viable business or project – this makes sense given that many teams seek to use their project as an opportunity to use synthetic biology to address a problem.
Again this chart shows how few teams believe their project is relevant to society. There was a split, slightly skewed towards commercial investment, in terms of the favoured means of funding, although it should be noted that many participants selected more than one option, suggesting mixed feelings and uncertainty on this question. Donation to the public domain was a popular option, indicating that many students support the BioBrick agreement and are keen to contribute their parts to it.

The UmuD protein then undergoes an auto-digestion and produces UmuD’ which associates with the umuC product to form a complex UmuD’2C, the form active in translesion synthesis [3]. To accelerate this progress, recA730, umuD’ and umuC are introduced in the mutagenesis plasmid. RecA730 is one of the mutants of recA whose product is the most proficient in the competition for single-stranded DNA and thereby more activated for the repressor inactivation that leads to SOS induction [4].The over-expressed umuD’ and umuC will enhance error-prone lesion bypass and inhibit RecA-mediated homologous recombination, an additional mechanism by which the umuDC gene products help E. coli tolerate DNA damage [3].

Soon after infection, phage DNA replicates in a speed much faster than E. coli’s genome. Progeny M13 phages are then released from the hosts and infect other uninfected bacterium. Owing to this fast speed of the phage life cycle, mutations take place mostly in the phage DNA and the mutation of host cells should therefore have little impact on the selection. With the help of inducible promoter, the mutagenesis module will work only when it is necessary and the mutation rate can be adjusted according to needs with different inductor concentrations, making this module more controllable.

Then we code in MATLAB, and the simulation result is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Simulation result of dual-feedback oscillator.
Parameters
Parameters play an important role in simulating, which would determine the behaviors of the system. In our modeling part, parameters in quorum-sensing e-oscillator are from parameter part of Original Full Model by Tsinghua-A iGEM 2011 and the paper “Rapid and tunable post-translational coupling of genetic circuits” by Arthur Prindle et al. And parameters used in dual-feedback e-oscillator are based on the paper “A fast, robust and tunable synthetic gene oscillator” and parameter table in HUST-China iGEM 2013 . Although these previous work give us some experience, we still adjust some parameters more reasonable in terms of our system and some experimental tests.
Regulation to oscillator--light control system
In order to establish the connection between genetic oscillator in E.coli and e-oscillator in computer, we adopt light as the medium and bond. A light control system is employed in our project as the wetlab mentioned (Figure 3). Therefore, we can change the expression level of the gene behind the ompc promoter through different light intensity.
Figure 3. Light control system.(Tabor J J, et al,2009)
Based on the paper of Jeffrey J. Tabor(2009), we get the transfer function between light intensity and expression rate:
where
is the expression rate, the fit parameter is K=0.0017
,
,
are the maximum and minimum expression level,  L is the intensity of light (
).
In our project, the expression of lacI behind the ompc promoter will change with the light intensity. So we add it to the DDEs model of dual-feedback oscillator,
and modify the procedure in MATLAB.
Coupling
Virtual-virtual coupling
Based on the experimental result, we select the dual-feedback oscillator to finish the modulating and coupling process. First, we will finish the virtual-virtual coupling. So different initial values of parameters are set to the simulation to form two e-oscillators which are of the same properties.
Then how could they adjust to each other and be strongly coupled or synchronized? We think about the dynamic equilibrium of wolf and rabbit. If the number of wolves increases rapidly, lots of rabbits would be eaten and the number would reduce. Faced with the decrease of prey, the quantity of wolves would also cut down. On the contrary, rabbits would multiply with fewer natural predators. Cycling like these, wolf and rabbit"

Biofilms: Results of July 7 Recultured Biofilms, Degradation of July 8 Biofilms and Preparation of New Biofilms for Further Testing
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Tiffany Dang, Dinula De Silva, Ronja Kothe, Jonathan Kwan, Aum Patel, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: Determine if yesterday’s recultured biofilms were successful. In addition continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms created yesterday.
Results: Reculturing of the July 7 Biofilms
We were successful in reculturing the biofilms to varying extents based on the overnight cultures of the degraded RFP biofilms. Based on reference of the biofilm that had been cultured before the cleaners were added, the Truly is still the most red in colour. Both Fantastic and Tilex was cloudy with culture but not with the RFP used to originally culture the biofilms.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html,"ones, selected through the mutation library. Retrafos: Clones, transformed with the extracted plasmids of the selected clones.
In order to investigate, whether the observed swimming behavior was related to the vector containing the mutagenized tar or the cells themselves, the isolated and sequenced plasmids were transformed into fresh BL21 cells and applied to a new swimming/chemotaxis assay. Additionally to the respective attractant, the effect of L-aspartate  and H2Odd was evaluated. In general, the observed halos of the fresh transformed cells were smaller than the ones of the selected clones every time (Figure 2C). Thus, it can be concluded that the cells themselves were also selected for faster swimming abilities.  L-aspartate  also was an attractant for nearly every clone and the halos were never reduced significantly in size when H2Odd was applied to the Whatman paper.
Separation Assay and RFP-interference
One of the aims of group one was to invent an assay that enables us to separate two strains from each other that have grown and swam together in a mixed culture.  This would be especially beneficial for the determination of the effect of the promoter strength for a tar insert in a vector or to determine whether an attractant affects two different strains in a different way.
In the beginning, it was planned to conduct the separation of the strains via the strong overexpression of RFP of one strain whereas the other strain would not express RFP. The ratio between the red and the white colonies would give us information about the distribution of the different strains in one swimming halo. After the first round of cloning the RFP gene and the tar inserts were on different vectors containing different antibiotic resistances. Therefore, a separation via the resistance marker seemed to be more plausible.
The separation assay described in the methods section was conducted multiple times and in many different variations, but the achieved outcomes were contradictory (no data shown).
In some cases when the agar from the middle of the drop was cut out a much higher number of colonies of the non RFP expressing strain was counted, even though the strains were mixed in the same ratio and thus should be present in the same amount. It was suspected that the expression of RFP contributes to the optical density value measured at a wavelength of 600 nm. Consequently a much higher OD600 value is measured than is actually proportional to the number of cells in the culture. Some experiments were conducted to determine the influence of the RFP expression on the OD600 value. Because of the time limit no statistically significant values could be gained and the achieved data is not"
Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the core of iGEM- BioBrick and RFC Assembly Method , to build a universal purification tag. This tag includes a linker containing TEV protease site and sJanus, designed by the RFC23 method which is specific for fusion protein. Thus, if other teams want to use this system to express and purify their proteins, they could use the standard assembly to make a fusion protein.
Secondly, we explore for the best detergent, the best concentration of detergent and the best buffer solution. For example, we tried Berol 532 and Triton-114 as the detergent, and used 2%, 5%, 10%, 20% as the gradient of concentration. We also tried PBS, Tris-HCl and many other buffer solutions. Thirdly, we construct many fusion proteins, including three kinds of fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP and RFP) with four kinds of Janus, which are inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants. We also construct experiments about fusion proteins with cutinases Thc_Cut1, FsC and LC to test if this system could be used on the purification of enzymes. After back-extraction, we run SDS-PAGE and calculate the efficiency.
Then we use these data to run our model . To find the universal experiment conditions, we designed a mighty-possible way to do prediction. The first thing to be made clear is that, it is the presence of difference in protein that will affect the effect of extraction most on the first way and then we have to change our experiment conditions to achieve better results. The second thing to know is that, among all properties of protein, the molecular weight, isoelectric point, hydrophobic property is the most possible impact factors, so we build a universal model to find the feasible extraction conditions, such as what concentration we should choose, or how much volume should we add…by choosing the properties of protein as main variables, and the conditions as dependent variables, using the best condition we got from our experiment and model and the protein’s properties as interpolation point to do interpolation, through this way we can gain the formula suits all proteins as long as we know their properties.
The results of our experiment could be found in results of Protein Extraction Kit..

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

Abstract: In the lab, we have to respect numerous safety regulations for the security and health of others and the environment.
Presence of safety department in INSA
During summer, our team worked in the engineering school INSA, which has a safety department. Their goal is to ensure the well-being of the employees, regarding safety rules and risk prevention. In our laboratory, the LISBP, safety is supervised by Nathalie Doubrovine who was the one instructing us regarding safety procedures. Thanks to her, we have completed a formation (with the NEO software) to learn the different risks related to our work in the laboratory and how to react in case of danger. The formation contained four parts: prevention, fire risk, biological risk and chemical risk. At the end, we had a test to make sure that we comprehended everything.
--> Autoclave training: Our team has taken an autoclave training, which showed us the explosive and implosive dangers of the dispositive and the security measures to take in order to protect oneself. A lab coat, heat resistant gloves and glasses were required for the manipulation of the autoclave.
--> Legislation and French Labor Law: We work in a public school for engineers (INSA Toulouse), thus we have to respect the French national regulations about working conditions and the manipulation of genetically modified organisms. As we work with microorganisms and cell cultures, we are concerned by the regulation on workers’ protection against risks resulting from their exposure to pathogenic biological agents (Decree No. 94-352 of 4 May 1994). It also includes human endoparasites which may cause infections, allergies or toxicity. This Decree is the French transposition of the Directive 90/679 / EEC and is also transcribed in the Labour Code (Articles L4421-1 R4421-1 to R4427-5). This Decree of the 16th July 2007 describes the technical preventive measures that are to be followed in research"

MEET-UP VALENCIA
Last August (18, 19 and 20), the three Spanish iGEM groups met in the city of Valencia. The purpose of the meeting was to know better the rest of the projects and the members from the other teams. In this event, we did not only get to know the projects, but we also were able to appreciate the great work that the groups were doing.
The initiative came from iGEM group of Valencia, who contacted us and the iGEM team from Barcelona. We were chatting for a few weeks until we agreed on a date for the meeting, which was not hard.
On August 19 (Friday), the 3 groups presented their projects in the student residence Galileo Galilei. The first group was Valencia UPV with their project “Hack Your Plants Editing”.They were pplaying at home, so it made the rest of the groups feel more confident.
Each part of the project was explained by a different member. It was a very entertaining and surprising exhibition. It was very interesting to know the use of biomechanics and biomedicine to create transgenic plants using a novel and much more efficient technique .
Our group was the second one to present the project. We talked about our project, and also explained the techniques we make use of to fulfil our goals. We presented our project ""Biofilms Transformer"" They were very interested and gave us their opinions. It was very rewarding for us.  Each of us explained their own work, except for our friend José who could not come. We finished the exhibition with a Spot of Human Practices.
Finally, it was the turn of UPF-CRG Barcelona. They were a little embarrassed to present their project because they thought it was not as good as the others. When they began to tell about their idea everyone agreed it was a great project.  They made a really fun show and we had a great time listening to their progress and difficulties on the creation of a probiotic to act as a preventive treatment for cancer. The other groups gave them some ideas to help them improve their techniques.
Once the presentations had finished, all group members met together"

The 4th week, everyone will send their results to Isiah who will compile the data into 2 different books that will allow us to be effective during summer. - Times for this week: Monday 11 AM – 5 PM, Wednesday 11 AM – 4 PM if necessary, Friday after 11 AM. We are NOT allowed to be in the IGB after 5 pm. Watch for Isiah’s email that will follow up to this. Cara, Social: - No news back from WashU, and there is currently no IGB money to travel to any other colleges at all. - Cara and Asha will look into traveling funds from Engineering Council. Anthony, Treasurer: - If we get SORF funds we will get reimbursed for all of our travel expenses. So we will have to pay for everything upfront, but once we present a receipt we will be endorsed. This will not cut into our IGB funding. - This will be discussed with Courtney in the next advisor’s meeting. Uros, Vice president: - Uros had the same idea as Adi. Dr. Jin suggested creating magnetic organisms – yeast that are magnetic. However there are not many applications. Uros will be further communicating with Dr. Jin about this and brainstorming ideas to come up with a proposal. In the meantime, Uros and Adi will be collaborating on the project proposal. - Since degrading plastic is a popular idea, we will investigate to see if any other teams are going to be pursuing it. If so, then we will try to collaborate with that university’s team. Asha, Secretary: - Please email me your powerpoint presentations for your proposals! Also, post them to poptab. - Cara and Asha will be attending another Engineering Council meeting this week. We will be voting for Engineering Council positions. You have all received an email with information on the candidates, so please send your opinions and feedback to both Cara and Asha Angela, President: - Everyone needs to go officially sign up for the UIUC-Illinois iGEM team.

Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,".1), which contains an insert that was constructed in a separate batch of scar ligation, did show a steady and moderate induction by AHL.
In addition, it can be seen that the basal level of transcription of mcherry under Plux is double in the strain that contains LuxI.
We suspect that the presence of AHL synthase (LuxI) in our bacteria causes induction enhancement, but since the strain Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry did not show any induction by the presence of AHL, we cannot fully compare between the results.
It is impossible to determine whether the presence of AHL synthase (LuxI) in our bacteria causes induction enhancement without repeating the experiment using a strain of Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry that contains an intact construct.

AmilCP
Determine the qualitative expression of AmilCP under the promoter Plux
Objective
We aspire to verify the expression of the reporter pigment protein AmilCP under the promoter Plux.
Description
In this experiment, a culture of E. coli K-12 Top 10 expressing AmilCP (a dark blue pigment protein) under the promoter Plux was grown overnight.
The bacteria were engineered to contain a plasmid with the gate Plux-AmilCP.
We originally aspired to determine the activity of the promoter Plux using the reporter gene AmilCP, by cloning and testing bacteria containing the gate Pcat-luxR-Plux-AmilCP.
Pcat is a constitutive promoter- therefore, luxR is expressed in excess in the bacteria, creating a dimer with AHL. This dimer binds to the Plux promoter, resulting in expression of AmilCP.
However, we ran out of time, so we decided to at least show that the construct Plux-AmilCP functions properly while relying on basal levels of transcription. Our next step would have been a scar ligation, similar to the one conducted to create Pcat-luxR-Plux-mcherry-luxI from the previous experiment.
Protocol
A starter was prepared by growing the cells in LB medium + appropriate antibiotics at 37°C for 19 hours. The bacteria were then centrifuged for 10 minutes, and a picture of the pellet was taken.
Results and conclusions
The pellet was dark blue, it is highly probable that the bacteria contain the gate Plux-AmilCP.

Northwest School
One  group had high engagement in the toggle switch lab,  despite not choosing A level biology
One student chose to use the TinkerCell computer aided design for their school extended project
The biosensor design was presented as an extension discussion and was very well received with some interesting designs including a bacterial Geiger counter
The logistics of using the TinkerCell program was difficult as laptops were limited, therefore students could not work independently
Due to lack of computer resources we had to create a paper based bacterial tinkercell circuit, which was just as well received in the other sessions
Originally the ethical discussion was left as an open discussion at the end of the session, however this was not well received and discussion were very general. As a consequence we decided to create a structured ethical washing line using real synthetic biology applications as case studies
Developed the biosensor design into a structured worksheet after the success of the extension activity
Oriel
The students  creatively engaged with the biosensor design worksheet
Groups worked at different rates
Students struggled to conceptualise the toggle switch
Suggested discussion points on the worksheet so demonstrators could extend the activities if they had a particularly quick group
UNIQ
The students were highly engaged and discussed beyond the activities
Many students described the workshop as the highlight of the week
In the general question and answer session students had many general questions about synthetic biology
Timing was an issue with groups not completing all tasks within the set 2  hour time frame
Added timings of activities to the lesson plans
Curiosity Carnival
The Curiosity Carnival is an Oxford-wide festival for researchers to share their research in innovative way as a part of the European Researchers' Night. The Oxford team were thrilled to be accepted to participate by having an activities stand at this event. Our stand was in the centre of the city and attracted a diverse audience of more than 4500 members of the public, from young children to other researchers.

Aim
- To expose high school students with the general concepts of synthetic biology by holding a workshop.
Description
This workshop was held in Chinese as a medium of instruction to F5 (grade 11) students. In the workshop, a brief introduction of synthetic biology is first introduced, followed by explanation of relative concepts such as the Central Dogma, Recombinant DNA Technology and Biosafety. The process of transformation was carried out to familiarize students with what they had been learning in their biology class. Besides, materials for fruit DNA extraction experiments were given to groups of students to let them try out the implementation of scientific principles, and of course, have fun learning science!
Achievement
The feedbacks of workshop were satisfactory. Some students claimed that they had an interest in engaging into this field. Majority agreed that our workshop has influenced them in a field of synthetic biology.

Example 1. A Synthetic Oscillator
Introduction
The synthetic oscillatory network designed by Michael Elowitz is  pioneering work. In the first place, based on his model, we want to illustrate how to tune the parameters to get pre-defined wave amplitude and wave frequency. In the second place, besides this three node repressive model, is it possible to propose a alternative topology that could also achieve tunable oscillation. In Tim Gardner 's PhD dissertation, such a different topology is proposed. We search feasible parameter that could achieve oscillation.
Mathematical Formulation
The activities of a gene are regulated by other genes through the interactions between them, i.e., the transcription and translation factors. Here, we assume that this system follows Hill kinetic law.
<math>\begin{align} \frac{dm_{i}}{dt} &=-a_{i}m_{i}+\sum\limits_{j}b_{ij}\frac{p_{j}^{H_{ij}}}{K_{ij}+p_{j}^{H_{ij}}}+l_{i}, \\ \frac{dp_{i}}{dt} &=-c_{i}p_{i}+d_{i}m_{i},  (i=1,2,...,n) \end{align}\,\!</math>

This meetup was indeed a great learning   experience, and has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston!
Strategy discussions:
After our institute re­opened post summer vacation, we have had a series of meetings amongst  the team members. They were mostly aimed at focusing on the design of wiki and all other stuff   regarding  meeting  the  necessary requirements  for  a  proper  website.  Apart  from  that,   discussions on the design of poster, banner and video were also held. Proposals for community   participation were also entertained. On  the  3rd  of  August,  our  team  had  a  major  strategy  discussion  meeting  covering  all  the   pressing issues with regard to the pending work for the grand competition finale at Boston.The   entire  team  actively  participated  and  contributed  to  the  discussion,  several  beneficial   suggestions were put forth, and updates on all the completed tasks were made. It was definitely   a very productive session, and tasks were assigned hoping to execute our re­defined strategies   in the best way possible! On the 15th of August, some of our team members met for the iGEM project modelling related   discussion.Equations hypothesizing the reaction rate kinetics of our system were put forth, and   the required biochemical assays for each of the entities were discussed. The kinds of graphs to   be made and associated modelling to be done were finalized.Post all the technical discussion,   we ended the session on a lighter note by deciding a catchy tag­line for our project!  On  the  22nd  of  August,  we  had  a  meeting  regarding  sponsorship  and  media  outreach.  We   discussed important methods to be undertaken to increase awareness of our project. An article   was written by Jugal to be sent for media purposes and we also put forth ideas for the making of   a brochure.

Our days were spent in scientific commune, our nights less so. As the event winded down, we approached the award ceremony with little trepidation - we were proud of our work, and compared to our experience in doing iGEM, any recognition of this would be enough. Fortunately the judges agreed with us, and we achieved silver, which was exactly what we hoped. May have celebrated a little loudly when that was announced :P
To finish, I'd like to note that this isnt a complete record of our project, but i hope it was insightful into how our experience was. From the countless hours spent in the corner of lab, to the sweeping cityscape of Boston, there is nothing about Cardiff 2016 I would have changed. Thank you. -Chris

Ligation reaction
The assembly of DNA fragments, commonly referred to                         as Golden Gate assembly, is an efficient technique                         where multiple inserts could be assembled into a vector                         backbone. The net result is the ordered and seamless                         assembly of DNA fragments in only one reaction. The                         ligations have a total volume of 10 μL so all of                         sequences that form part of the constructions are mixed                         up in an Eppendorf of 0.2mL.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Calculation_-_-_TEXT.html,", there are two objectives of the PAC listed in the following:
To discover or to reduce the dimensionality of the data set;
To identify new meaningful underlying variables.
How to start?
We assume that the multi-dimensional data have been collected in a Table Of Real data matrix, in which the rows are associated with the cases and the columns with the variables. Traditionally, principal component analysis is performed on the symmetric Covariance matrix or on the symmetric Correlation matrix. These matrices can be calculated from the data matrix. The covariance matrix contains scaled sums of squares and cross products. A correlation matrix is like a covariance matrix but first the variables, i.e. the columns, have been standardized. We will have to standardize the data first if the variances of variables differ much, or if the units of measurement of the variables differ. You can standardize the data in the Table Of Real by choosing Standardize columns. To perform the analysis, we select the Tabel Of Real data matrix in the list of objects and choose To PCA. This results in a new PCA object in the list of objects. We can now make a scree plot of the eigenvalues, Draw eigenvalues to get an indication of the importance of each eigenvalue. The exact contribution of each eigenvalue (or a range of ei-genvalues) to the ""explained variance"" can also be queried.
Determining the number of components
There are two methods to help you to choose the number of components. Both methods are based on relations between the eigenvalues.
Plot the eigenvalues, Draw eigenvalues. If the points on the graph tend to level out (show an ""elbow""), these eigenvalues are usually close enough to zero that they can be ignored;
Limit the number of components to that number that accounts for a certain fraction of the total variance. For example, if you are satisfied with 95 of the total variance explained then use the number you get by the query Get number of components (VAF) no less than 0.95.
How to get the principal components
Principal components are obtained by projecting the multivariate data vectors on the space spanned by the eigenvectors. This can be done in two ways:
Directly from the Table Of Real without first forming a PCA object. You can then draw the Configuration or display its numbers.
Select a PCA and a Table Of Real object together and choose. In this way you project the Table Of Real onto the PCA's eigen space.
Mathematical background on principal component analysis
The mathematical technique used in PCA is called eigen analysis: we solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of"

SCU-China,2016,Team:SCU-China#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"Firstly, we raised a simple theory called “Energy balance theory” in modeling prediction for VHb.
If energy gained by VHb synthesis is more than energy cost on VHb synthesis, E. coli grow better.
If energy gained by VHb synthesis is less than energy cost on VHb synthesis, E. coli grow worse.
We guess the most important factor for the balance theory is depending on the oxygen concentration in environment, then we started to design the experiment and use modeling to predict the final curve like this (Figure 1).
Figure 1. X-axis refers to oxygen concentration and Y-axis refers to cell division speed for K1919500 strain. In low oxygen concentration, energy gained by VHb synthesis is more than energy cost on VHb synthesis, division speed is high than control. However, when oxygen concentration is higher, energy gained by VHb synthesis is less than energy cost on VHb synthesis because oxgen concentration is high, there’s no need for VHb to accelerate the oxygen supply. The result fits one Chinese paper published [2]. More information, please visit modeling part.
Except observational measurement, we designed the quantitative measurement in different oxygen concentrations to test its ability to promote the growth and protein production.
We ligate biobricks K1321200 (J23106 + VHb + Terminal) and J04450 (J23100 + mRFP + Terminal) to construct the Biobrick K1919500 to test.
The K1919500 is transferred into BL21(DE3) to grow on LB agar plate to observe its morphology.
Then, we plan to use oxygen packs and device from MITSUBISHI GAS CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. There are three kinds of oxygen pack to construct different oxygen concentrations in a special plastic box: Anaero Pack (~0% oxygen), MicroAero Pack (~8% oxygen), CO2 Pack (~16% Oxygen). We put 20ml LB in the box and put in oxygen pack to construct different oxygen concentrations for E. coli to grow.
We want to test the time for the liquid culture to attain the stable oxygen concentration by dissolved oxygen meter. We want to cultivate K1919500 strain in different oxygen concentration and test the OD600 and fluorescence intensity with time to measure the VHb ability to promote the growth and protein production.
Results
SDS-PAGE results shows that it express successfully in E.coli (Figure 1).
Figure 1
The morphology plate experiment shows that compared to J04450, K1919500 strain colony is distinctly bigger and redder (Figure 2).

Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Biobricks#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," promoter activities: fine-tuning protein expression. Again, no information was available of RBS activity at different temperatures. We would have liked to carry out characterisation experiments, but failing assemblies and constraints on time prevented this. In the end, we simply decided to work with one of the strongest RBSes in the Community Collection: BBa_B0034 .
Coding Regions
Our project aims to enhance E. coli's growth rate at low temperatures, by heterologously expressing chaperones from cryophillic bacteria. Their effect may possible be further exacerbated by adding genes encoding anti-freeze proteins (AFPs). Three different AFPs we'd hoped to use for this were generously provided by the team that represents Yale this year. Unfortunately, we received their shipment too late to incorporate their parts in our project.
Selection of chaperones suitable for our project was done based on literature study. We have selected five, the first two of which depending on eachother to function. The selected chaperones are: Cpn10 and Cpn60, forming Oleispira antarctica 's Cpn60/10 system ( BBa_K538000 and BBa_K538001 ); SheDnaK, from Shewanella sp. AC10 ( BBa_K538002 ); CspA, from Polaribacter irgensii ( BBa_K538003 ); and CspC, also from Polaribacter irgensii ( BBa_K538004 ). GeneArt synthesized these parts for us de novo, from sequences that were taken from online repositories and recoded for compatibility with assembly standards.
Composite Parts
The composite parts we submitted to the registry are either construction intermediates or finalized parts. The construction intermediates consist of all possible combinations of our selected promoters ( BBa_R0010 and BBa_K206000 ) and RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), and all combinations of that same RBS with our coding regions ( BBa_K538000 through BBa_K538004 ). Note that the promoter + RBS parts contain no bricks that weren't already in the registry.
The finalized parts all comprise a promoter, an RBS and a coding region. They are made either by appending a coding region to the construction intermediates containing a promoter and RBS, or by prepending a promoter to the construction intermediates containing an RBS and a coding region. An additional four final constructs are designed as 'operons' comprising Cpn10 and Cpn60. They are made by appending either the RBS + Cpn10 or the RBS + Cpn60 construction intermediates to the finalized parts"
TU-Eindhoven,2017,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Results#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," 1.21 Molecular Weight [3].  This leads us to a volume of 73.084 Å3 per molecule. As 10 Å=1 nm this means that 73.084 A3 = 73,1 · 10-3 nm3 per molecule. Like the formula for the volume of the protein, there is a formula for the volume of spheres, which is more generally known, and defined as Volume Sphere = 4/3 · π · r3 . Using this formula, we got a volume of 0.88 μm3 = 0.88 · 109 nm3. When dividing the volumes, you would think that this means that there are about 1,2 · 1010 proteins in one droplet. However, this is not quite the case, as you have to take into account that sphere packing has a lower density and that there are different ways of packing, and we do not know which is applicable yet. If we assume there is a surrounding of 4 molecules, as in a tetrahedral lattice, there are only 4,1 · 109 molecules that should fit in the droplets.
Analysis of Results
Because simulating that many molecules takes a lot of computer memory, which we did not have, we rescaled the system. A yeast cell has a volume of 42 μm3 [4] and we used a simulation box with the size of 10 μm 3. If we rescale the measured droplet size, which is 2% of the yeast volume, we expect to have cluster that also have a size of 2% of the initial amount of molecules. This would indicate that the simulated complexed would have an average size of somewhere around 60 molecules, as the initial amount of molecules was 3010. In Table 1 you can see what the results of the simulation for different valencies are, and that the average complex size of 60 lies between a valency of 3 and of 4.

Riyad Worked with Kanishka on biobricks. He pretty much did an excellent job summing it up so not much to add. Right now we are looking into incorporating sometype of BLAST into our program to compare our output gene sequence with the biobrick registry.
Palak
This week I began working on an algorithm that would search for the path with the fewest changes to the host organism. I got the algorithm to function properly but the database did not have all the organisms paired up with the reactions yet. The next steps will be to populate the database with the additional information such as reversibility of reactions and stoichiometry.

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html,", caused by the loss of fumagillin. The loss is threatening because it means that beekeepers are more likely to be affected by Nosema, and by extension lose hives. But beekeepers also established that fumagillin was far from perfect, and so an alternative was needed regardless of its existence.
Application: This made the importance of our project absolutely clear, as we had first-hand accounts of how detrimental Nosema could be, and the fear the loss of its only treatment was created.
Question: How will this affect organic certification? An important trend in the food industry is the production of GMO free and organic products. Once we were able to provide them full information regarding our project, we found it important to get the perspectives of beekeepers, particularly commercial bee ranchers. This was because such research would affect a beekeeper’s organic certification.
Answer: Through conversations with beekeepers we are confident that for the majority of beekeepers this will not be an issue. Beekeepers such as Paul Gredanious told us that in order to get organic certification for honey, your bees could not come in contact with anything non-organic. This means that organic beekeepers would not be able to use any Nosema treatments, feeds, or any form of additives on their bees. Moreover, the beekeepers had to ensure that their bees did not come in contact with GMO plants to the best of their ability. What this meant was that most honeybee ranchers already are not and cannot be organic certified because of the presence of GMOs in Alberta.
Application: Our project would not have a massive effect on a beekeeper’s ability to get organic certification. However, it can be inferred that our product may actually be preferable because in status quo, the fumagillin beekeepers are using is mutagenic to mammals [1] which is not preferable for their farms and their customers. Beekeepers also seemed to be responsive to the idea that we were building on something from nature and enhancing it to help the bees.
Question: Do you think the use of a GMOs will harm the consumers perception of your product? We thought it was important to ask this because we were trying to help beekeepers and improve their businesses not harm it. This means that the public perception of their product is important.
Answer: As they already had history of working with GMOs, beekeepers expressed to us that they were willing to continue doing so as the practice helped protect food security as well as their livelihoods. They did, however, ask that if we gave them a product that it would be thoroughly tested. They additionally requested that the product be"
