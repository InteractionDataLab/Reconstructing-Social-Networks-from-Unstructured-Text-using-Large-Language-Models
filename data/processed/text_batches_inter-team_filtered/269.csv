The NemR recognition promoter ( BBa_K1398008 )
One of the problems faced by the 2009 Edinburgh iGEM team was the issue of how TNT was to be detected in order to generate a gene expression response.
https://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/biology%28results%29
https://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/biology%28biobricks%29
While their design and parts demonstrated a staggering amount of work and understanding, we felt that their proposed TNT-sensing construct was too complex and could be simplified. As a system of parts we felt that it relied too heavily on several freshly designed and uncharacterised parts working together in unison to be easily engineered for success.
Figure 7: TNT sensing pathway developed by the Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team. https://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/biology%28tntsensing%29 TNT binds to TNT.R1 in the periplasm. The TNT-TNT.R1 complex induces a conformational change in the Trg-EnvZ (Trz) fusion protein. Trg-EnvZ autophosphorylates and subsequently phosphorylates ompR. Phosphorylated ompR activates transcription.
As a result, we decided to see if we could discover and develop a simpler system that would be easier to engineer and conceptually extrapolate to other chemicals. After the discovery that the NemA enzyme could already be expressed at a very low level in E. coli, it was hypothesised that E. coli should have a gene regulatory molecule which controlled the nemA operon enabling"

Conference of China iGEMer Community
The 4th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Community) was successfully held in FUZHOU China during 26/08/2017 to 28/08/2017. The host is Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU) iGEM team, the office of academic affairs of FAFU, and cooperated by University and Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, iGEM teams of Peking University, Sun Yat-sen University, Huazhong Agricultural University and the Association of Science and Technology CMLS-OUC. The organization process has also been supported by a team of consultants including members from all over the world.
What is CCiC？
CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Committee,also Central China iGEMers' Consortium) The Conference of China iGEMer Committee(CCiC) is a advanced academic conference of synthetic biology in China, aiming to promote the development of synthetic biology and improve the connectivity and communication of nationwide iGEM teams.Besides, CCiC provides a excellent platform for Chinese iGEMers to prepare for the Giant Jamborees. The prototype of Conference of China iGEMer Committee is Central China iGEMers' Consortium in 2014.In 2015, with the number of teams doubling and the origin of teams expanding from Central China to nationwide, Peking renamed the meeting Conference of China iGEMer Committee. Up to now, CCiC has become one of the largest advanced academic conference. The participants include high school students, undergraduates, graduates, scientists, iGEM HQ, iGEM judges etc.
To resolve the problems of unequal allocation of subject resource, uncompatibility between general education mode in Chinese universities and iGEM competition mode, CCiC makes a bold and overall reform this year by increasing the proportion of salon and panel session and adding new sessions,which includes inviting the first generation Chinese iGEMers, iGEM headquarter and experienced judges to communicate with young iGEMers"

The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016
Introduction
The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan was organized by iGem NCKU and held grandly at National Cheng Kung University Tainan from Aug. 8, 2016 to Aug. 14. We, iGEM NCKU, are the first university from the southern Taiwan to attend iGEM  Competition organized by MIT, Boston. By involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competition, our team is confident to make a breakthrough in this field via multidisciplinary cooperation and can proudly present our work on the international platform.  In turn, this Asia-Pacific Conference was the first step for us to introduce the idea to other teams from different countries in Asia.
We invited 20 teams from different schools in five countries to this Meet-up Conference. Professional scholars and entrepreneurs were also invited to provide us academic knowledge and suggestions. The approaches for meeting people and expanding ideas in this conference are presentations, poster exhibitions, team experience sharing, Round table, and Tainan cultural tours. After this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, we believe that we make others understand our intension and indeed makes NCKU a step closer to spreading the idea universally.
Team's Project
Several presentations were made by the professors and representatives of our sponsor. Besides, our team presentation which was about our device was also performed to gain valuable feedback from the audience. This 20-minute English presentation, including the present and future research, objective, device and Q&A session.
Poster
There was a poster presentation from every team to enable every team sharing their research works and findings.
Experience Sharing Workshop -- [Random Group Formation]
One very exciting part in Asia-Pacific Conference is a variety of workshops to share attendees’ thinking. Within the workshop, attendees were randomly grouped. One member from iGEM NCKU_Tainan led the group discussion to elicit their iGEM experience along the iGEM journey. In those sharings and discussions, we could view the problems from other districts"

Two core methods, lambda red recombination and recombinase-based bistable switch are applied to build our Gene Socket. Lambda red recombination is a widely used, e fficient r ecombination system i n prokaryotes. R ecombinasebased b istable switch i s relatively more stable and easier than t ranscription factor regulated bistable switch modules. Both the two are the best choices for achieving the characteristics of Gene Socket. We hope that by using standardized Gene Socket, synthetic biologists can turn their theoretical design into reality faster and better, concentrating more on the designing and improvement of genetic circuits.

The red line on the figure above shows when the reaction reaches 22.176 µM, which is the concentration at which a blue dot or line becomes visible. This value was calculated based on the kinetic parameters we determined in our characterization of prussian blue ferritin . This takes approximately 4.9 minutes, meaning that we will be able to see a visible response from a super shedding cow in less than 5 minutes!
Further Characterization of our parts
Additionally, we have demonstrated the same pH change of benzylpenicillin to penicillinoic acid by the TALE A β-lactamase fusion ( BBa_K1189031 )  with bromothymol blue. The pH change causes the bromothymol blue to change in colour from blue to yellow as it gets more acidic (Figure 11 & 12).  In the presence of TALE A β-lactamase fusion we see the colour change to yellow whereas the negatives not containing TALE A β-lactamase fusion remains blue (Figure 11). We did a kinetic analysis at 616 nm every 30 seconds and as the blue colour disappears, the absorbance at 616 nm decreases (Figure 12). Therefore, the lower the decrease the better the TALE A β-lactamase fusion reporter activity. Our kinetic activity shows that the biggest decrease is in our positive recombinant β-lactamase followed by the TALE A β-lactamase fusion at 10 micrograms. This decrease is lessened as we decrease the amount of TALE A β-lactamase fusion. We can also show that in our negatives with no TALE A β-lactamase fusion we do not have a decrease in absorbance.  We have demonstrated the reporter activity both qualitatively (Figure 10 & 11) and quantitatively (Figure 12).
Figure 11.Change in pH catalyzed by TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) using benzylpenicillin. Bromothymol blue was used to keep track of this colour change. Absorbance readings were taken at 616 nm every 30 seconds. Different amounts of TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ) were tested. Commercial β-lactamase was used as a positive control.

Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.
Eliminate Chinese’s prejudice about biotechnology
After hearing the community's concern about biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 200 booklets to expand publicity.
Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Brochures

Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,"As a reminder, required acid concentrations for our system to be effective are:
butyric acid: 0.436 mol/L (436 mmol/L) (see results in vivo)
formic acid: 0.010 mol/L (10 mmol/L) [2],[3]
The results presented above show that we won’t be able to obtain these concentrations without optimizing our system.
In particular, we can see that to optimize either butyrate or formate production, growth level should be as low as possible. Our first solution would thus be to exert a control on this growth rate by limiting the availability of the nitrogen source in our bacteria’s environment. To test the relevance of this method we used FVA (Fig 7.).
Figure 7: NH4 flux (mmol.gDW-1.h-1) depending on growth rates
By combining this graph with the precedent results, we are able to define the nitrogen concentration required to get the wanted growth rate, which in its turn depends on the associated butyrate and formate quantities.
Another solution to optimize the metabolites   production would be to change the initial carbon source.   That’s why we tested different possible carbon sources and   optimized either formate or butyrate production as the objective   function, keeping initial glucose   flux at 0.4 mmol.gDW-1.h-1.   Results (Fig. 8) thus show the maximal concentrations   of either butyric or formic acid we can expect   (let’s note that the method used suggests that   there should be no cellular growth).
Figure 8: Butyric and formic acid productions depending on the carbon source
According to this modelling, the use of lactose, maltose or melto-triose/-pentose/-hexaose could enable us to obtain the required formic acid concentration. More generally and with no surprise, production of formic and butyric acids will be higher as the sugar given will contain more carbons. As for butyric acid, even though the aforementioned sugars yield a higher final concentration, it is still not enough. To meet our expectations, it would be interesting to work on the parameters (size, volume…) of our device and/or our trap.
Finally, we also can adjust the pH value to increase final acids concentrations. Indeed, so far, pH has been set at 7. However, for example, if we set the pH value at 6, we can increase formic and butyric acids concentrations by a factor of 10 (Fig. 9).

Module ALPHA
ALPHA was created in August 21, 2009. It consists of three robot arms. Each arm consist of two arm segments as shown in the picture. One arm segment is referred as the control arm and is connected to the motor which controls entirely the joint. The other arm segment, referred as a linkage is loosely attached and moves in a sphere. The end of this attaches to the platform which holds the four pipette tips.

Technically, this is not a LegoRoboBrick. We call this a LegoEnviroBrick. In layman terms, this is just the chassis of the robot.
BETA provides the environment where the robot can move and  conduct its task. It consists of a telescoping frame and a big lego plate under the stand. The telescoping frame is used for holding ALPHAs and PHIs, and the lego plate is where the 96-well plates and petri dishes are placed.
V1.0 uses two separate petri dishes. The first dish contains ethanol and is used for cleaning the pipette tip. The second dish contains water to clean the pipette tip before transferring DNA, enzymes, etc. between wells in the 96-well plate"

Unregulated growth in chloramphenicol containing medium and regulated growth in ampicillin containing medium was tested in continuous culture. The growth kinetics observed for our Rhl regulated could be verified in a second growth curve for induced and uninduced growth. Further we received E. coli JM109 strains containing a reporter plasmid expressing luxCDABE in the presence of specific activating  N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHSLs) (Winsen, M.K. et al. 1998) resulting in bioluminescence of these reporter strains. We will be using these strains in order to verify the production of the specific homoserine lactones by our constructs.

Investigators: Roman
We prepared pre-cultures of our chromoprotein expression cassettes (promoter-RBS-chromoprotein) in E. coli XL1 Blue MRF'. For each chromoprotein (amilGFP, eforRed, aeBlue) 50 ml 2xYT containing chloramphenicol were inoculated from -80°C glycerol stocks and grown at 37°C and 250 rpm over night.
Monday, August 12, 2013
Investigators: Kerstin, Laura
Pre-cultures of chromoprotein constructs were mixed in one main culture in order to see how they behave during cultivation over several hours. OD520 of pre-cultures was measured in order to inoculate the main culture with  33% of each strain to a final OD520=0.3. For the main culture, 25 ml 2xYT containing chloramphenicol were inoculated with the three different strains and grown at 37°C and 250 rpm in a non-baffled flask. Samples from the culture were taken at several time points, diluted and plated on 2xYT agar-plates containing chloramphenicol. Agar plates were incubated at 37°C over night.
Today we also observed our cells containing the chromoprotein expression cassette under the fluorescence microscope.
During the day we noticed that the 2xYT medium used for the pre-cultures yesterday showed contamination. Thus, there is a high possibility  of contamination in the pre-culture as well as in the main culture. Therefore we decided to repeat the experiment. New pre-cultures of the three chromoprotein expression cassettes where inoculated in 50 ml 2xYT containing chloramphenicol directly from -80°C.

    • What is iGEM?
    • The trend in synthetic biology  (The trend in iGEM 2013)
    • The project of Team Tokyo_Tech 2013
    • The development of technique  that supports iGEM
     (BioBrick, database related to synthetic biology, MATLAB,  etc.)
    • Introduction of Team  Tokyo_Tech
    • What Team Tokyo_Tech 2014 has  been doing since the new team was organized
In the presentation, we used many pictures and figures in the slide to make it easier to image synthetic biology, which is a completely new field for them.

After the presentation, we were able to get opinions from the audience. Hearing from people working in a different field was a great opportunity for us. Some people gave us ideas of a new product which we never thought of. Also, there were people who asked questions related to safety. All the people with those questions had things in common; they all thought it would be a big business chance if genetically engineered E. coli can be released safely in human and nature.
By listening to our presentation, many audience were impressed with the technology of synthetic biology, and acknowledged it as a research which estimates future prospects. We are planning to present in this workshop again after this year’s Jamboree, so we will be glad if more people from a variety of fields come to attend.

part of EPF-Lausanne DB but not all, so Yubo Qi kicked in to investigate the proper
parameters for reaction. Unfortunately, it’s almost a hopeless task, no reliable source with
specified parameters can be found, so we gave up at last.
I finished another detail draft on input UI design, and Soimort is constructing our UI
according to it. I tried to discuss more with Soimort and push him harder, but can’t find
the right way…
My girlfriend came and we spent 3 days together. It was 3 halves of days actually, since
there are tasks I cannot put aside. However, she was so thoughtful and supportive, and didn’

study in Hong Kong for one semester! Though there is much to do and I have to get familiar
with the environment in Hong Kong, I try my best to find time for our project. I skim most of
igem teams in latest three years and list some teams whose work can show the advantages and
innovations of our database. Their works are about some biological reactions related to
light, temperature, PH, etc. Read a paper of Nature about synchronized Ecoli clock, try to
master the idea of it and list the reactions in it. It will be added into our database.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"

Science Communication Seminars
To share our work in science communication with an audience of scientists, we held seminars with two research groups. In these seminars, we presented our research, and then opened up for discussions and debate about the issues we had raised. A lot of the scientists had stories to tell about personal experiences they’d had with science communication, and it was interesting to hear how they felt our research could have an impact!
Transform and Translate
After finding out how people of varying ages engage with science outside of the classroom at Big Bang, we were inspired to write a blog about the science communication areas of our research. The blog, Transform and Translate, can be found here . Social media and online sources were really popular ways of reading about science outside of the classroom, so the blog helped us engage in a more informal and wide-reaching way. We also maintained an active presence on our twitter (@newcastle_igem) to share all of our iGEM activities and interact with the worldwide iGEM community."
Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html,">K525512</partinfo> as observed during our cultivations . The fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB improves the BPA degradation by E. coli. Introducing a polycistronic ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase gene into these systems does not lead to a higher specific BPA degradation rate. The rates are a bit lower, though. The effect that the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein is more efficient than BisdB when expressed polycistronically with BisdA can still be observed in this setup. The cultivations with the expression of the fusion protein FNR | BisdA | BisdB differ from the expression of the other BPA degrading BioBricks. The BPA degradation rate is concentration dependent which is typical for enzymatic reactions but was not observed in the other cultivations. In addition, the growth was faster and not diauxic. The maximal specific BPA degradation rate of this BioBrick is higher than the observed specific BPA degradation rates in the other cultivations. But due to the dependence of the BPA degradation on the BPA concentration, the BPA degradation with this BioBrick is not as efficient and not complete. Anyway, the fact that this BioBrick is working is impressive.
Interpretation of the results
Misfolding seems to be a problem when expressing BisdA and BisdB in E. coli. To reduce this, the cultivation conditions were improved for the BPA degradation with the polycistronic bisdAB gene in E. coli first, compared to the literature ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ). Problems with misfolding of BisdA and BisdB could be reduced by lowering the temperature as well as growth rate and by using a weaker promoter for expression.
When degrading BPA with E. coli using the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein, both domains (BisdA and BisdB) are active and correctly folded because otherwise there would be no BPA degradation measured and no BPA degradation products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol would be detectable, which could definetely be identified via MS-MS. The about 50 % higher specific BPA degradation rate in E. coli expressing the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein could be explained either by improved folding properties of the fusion protein or by the closer distance of BisdA and Bisd"

BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Human Practices#Marketing Campaign#Public Perception_-_-_TEXT.html," on a subject. As part of his crusade against ‘bad science’, Ben Goldacre in a 2007 Guardian article reinforced the point raised by the TUDelft 2008 team in reference to the involvement of the scientific community public communication. In response to subsequently discredited research linking GM potatoes with health risks, Goldacre notes that “during the two days after the GM ""Frankenstein foods"" story broke, [...] not one of the news articles, opinion pieces or editorials on the subject - in any British newspaper - was written by a science journalist, and because the work was unpublished, no one could comment on the science anyway.” It is important for us to communicate our work effectively and accurately to avoid misinterpretation by non-experts.
Secondly, mistrust of the biotechnology industry seems to have been borne in part out of revelations of unknowing consumption of genetically engineered products. Although regulations specify that any intentional use of GM ingredients and accidental amounts of approved GM ingredients above 0.9% must be labelled [17] , media reporting has brought the GM labelling debate to the public attention by implicitly suggesting their consumer rights are being violated by inadequate labelling. These include stories such as:
“We're used as guinea pigs for GE food”, (headline), Western Morning News (Plymouth, UK), November 25, 2008
“Six out of 10 respondents also fear they are eating GM foods unknowingly, and, according to the Food Standards Agency, they are probably right.”, The Guardian, 2 September 2004
For our product therefore, it is important that we have a clear message about what our product is and does and its impact or otherwise on crops.
Thirdly, a balanced GM debate has not been encouraged by the invocation of other health scares in reporting. For example, a ‘Wales on Sunday’ article dated August 17, 2008, considering Prince Charles’ stance on GM crops included a reference to BSE: “There have been food scares before - look at Mad Cow Disease.” [18] Other emotive statements such as “GM could be the biggest environmental disaster of all time” are also being attributed to the Prince. In our case, it will also be necessary to address our use of bacteria in relation to the recent E. coli outbreaks at petting zoos.

Software
GAIA
GAIA was used to generate mutations in a glucoronidase sequence, beneficial for galactosidase activity. A subset of the generated sequences was ordered as oligonucleotides for kinetic assays. In order to show that the score from the used classifier correlates with the real-world activity, a set of less active beta-lactamase sequences was predicted by gaia. Those were also bought as oligonucleotides and will be tested for their activity.
A randomization function was implemented to examine how the different scores develop when the number of mutations increases. The results look sigmoid, showing almost no change in the score for the first mutations, then rapidly dropping below the threshold for positive classification, after which they only decrease slowly.
A combination function to examine all possible combinations of a set of mutations was implemented in order to aid the decisions on which sequences to test in the lab.

Modeling
Modeling the phage titer based on a distribution of fitness was improved. Mutation modeled by a skewed normal distribution was enabled.
The model was compared to phage titer data from the lab and performed well. However, improvements in the scaling are needed. All available interactive tools were unified and put into the wiki layout.

We knew from our researchs of past iGEM projects, there are some great projects about generating electric from E. coli and some other microorganisms by MFC. MFC (Microbial Fuel Cell) can be utilized for electric generation through the conversion of organic and inorganic substrates by microorganisms.  We read wiki sites of some iGEM teams ,especially Bielefeld 2013 and TU Darmstadt, which was about generating electricity through MFC.  We know that through the reactions of PET degradation until pyruvate, after pyruvate metabolism there is overproduction of H ions and we think that excessive H ions can generate potential difference which can be further used for electric generation.  Can you imagine we can live in such a world, while generating electricity it destroys all plastic wastes!

In other words, the time-dependent copy number N(t) is a jump process.
The stochastic process N(t) is characterized by a collection of state probabilities and transition probabilities. The state probability P(n,t)=Pr[N(t)=n] is the probability that the process N(t) is the state n at a time t. The transition probability Pr[N(t0+t)=n|N(t0)=m] is the conditional probability that process N(t) has moved from state m to state n during the time interval [t0,t0+t]. The analysis of a stochastic process becomes greatly simplified when the above transition probability depends on (i) the starting state m but not on the states before time t0 and (ii) the interval length t but not on the. Property (i) is the well-known Markov process. The process holding property (ii) is said to be homogeneous process.

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html,"The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute the escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, accidentally or intentionally. We used two environment factors to monitor the bacteria’s situation: temperature and population density, they are both high and tunable in the fermenter. So, the device will initiate when temperature and density are both low. We used thermal sensitive regulator (NUS iGEM2017)(Piraner et al.) and quorum sensing regulator (MIT iGEM2004) (Canton et al.)as our sensor, sRNA(Storz et al.) and tetR family repressor PhlF(Glasgow iGEM2015)(Stanton et al.) as the signal inverter. We add intergrase (Peking iGEM2017) controlled by the thermal sensitive regulator, which will turn the promoter of a lethal gene when temperature rise in the fermenter so that bacteria can survive at the very beginning. Also, we build a model to stimulate the minimum autoinducer required at the beginning of the fermentation, same as the purpose of integrase. This model is for keeping bacteria alive at the very beginning of fermentation. Together they form a NOR gate which will lead to cell death through genome degradation when temperature and density decrease.
For Therapy
The second device we build is for therapeutic bacteria, the device can carry out noninvasive tracing through ultrasound imaging of the gas vesicle(Shapiro et al.), release the drug (from SHSBNU 2017) controlled by a thermal sensitive regulator at nidus by ultrasound tissue heating, and heat to a higher temperature to release nuclease and kill the bacteria after it finishes its mission.
For Metabolic Stress
We applied capacity monitor (Ceroni et al.) to quantify the expression burden of all our systems, and to reduce the metabolic stress, we designed another device for fermentation which used a LuxR repressive promoter (Peking iGEM2011) and cold-regulated 5’UTR region (Ionis Paris 2017). This device only involves one transcriptional regulator, which will be less energy consuming.

Since E. coli can tolerate the presence of the substrates for this reaction, it will not be necessary to import all enzymes; in theory, the in vivo activity of hydrazine synthase can be tested and verified before trying to develop the complete anammox system.
Recent work has identified the gene cluster encoding the hydrazine synthase complex. These genes will be codon optimized and cloned into E. coli under an inducible promoter. Growth of the modified bacteria in the presence of ammonia and nitric oxide will be monitored. After expression of the new cassette is activated, hydrazine production and concomitant hydrazine toxicity induced cell death should be observed. If time permits, this project will be expanded by identifying an ammonia or nitric oxide responsive promoter and incorporating it to control the expression of the hydrazine synthase.

So we use the Pla 9401 (GenBank: AJ132354.1) and Pla 9402/b (GenBank: AJ494991.1) gene sequence as the template to design primers for gvpA, gvpC-20psi and gvpC-16omega. In consideration of Pla 9402’s repetitive sequences of gvp gene, we took two different approaches to take out the genes: one is directly doing PCR with the genome of Pla 9402 as template, while the other is PCRed on the BssSI-enzymed template of Pla 9402 genome. The gene gvpA and gvpC-20psi was successfully cloned through both these pathways, but the attempts to clone gvpC-16omega gene failed.

Lecture in Nanjing Jinling High School
Although iGEM also has High School Division, few local high school students know about iGEM and synthetic biology. In order to let them have a rational understanding and encourage more students to participate in the IGEM competition, we decided to introduce synthetic biology, IGEM and our project in the form of lectures.
In the lecture, we used the third biological revolution to give way to synthetic biology. And we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM in a vivid way.When we talked about synthetic biology, we delivered the idea of synthesis. When we speak of iGEM, we delivered several key points that comprise a whole project in iGEM: a practical idea, construction of gene circuits, verification, modification, safety and human practice. What's more, we emphasized the idea of engineer and standardization. At last, we introduced our project.
After the lecture, many students showed great interest in iGEMHigh School Division. We hope that we did could influence more and more people to participate in this competition and enjoy it.
Apply Our Project to Time Farm
We have always been considering to apply our project tothe field of farming industry and environmental governance. Guided by this belief, we visited the Time Farm, a newly built organic farm in Nanjing.
The technology of this farm is based on permaculture. They want to cultivate healthy products by constructing harmonized eco-environment. In the process of communication, we learned that they purify water mainly by constructing artificial wetlands and spraying organic fertilizer which contains a lot of microorganisms. These strategies indeed obtains satisfying results in water purification, and the products are much healthier than those cultivated in the original farms. However, some refractory deleterious organic compounds used in other areas around the organic farm, for example, atrazine, may still remain in the water. In this case, bacteria with biological function may benefit the farmers a lot. They also realized that synthetic biology could be an effective and environmental friendly tool in the near future.(Friendly link: Time Farm http://www.timefarm.com.cn )

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing R"
Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#Coil system_-_-_TEXT.html," Comparing the intensity of the florescence of the positive control (JM109 containing Bba_I13522 - GFP with a constitutive promoter) with the transformants containing our constructs it seems that our GFP-coil fusion protein results in a weaker florescence. However the expression cannot be compared since it is induced by different promoters.  Our negative controls (transformants prior induction) show no fluorescence (Figure 11).
Figure 11: fluorescence GFPcoil + IPTG induced promter in pSB1AK3 in BL21, GFPcoil + His tag + IPTG induced promoter in pSB1AK3 in JM109, BBa_K883704 in DH5α, BBa_K883705 in DH5α measured with fluorescence microscopy. On the right side: before induction (sample taken from liquid medium); on the left side: after induction with IPTG (sample taken from a plate) - of each sample a picture was taken once with light microscopy and once with fluorescence microscopy'
""Leucine zipper"" coils
Next to the E-/K-coil combination we are searching for suitable alternatives. We found the EILD/ KILR coils made by UC Berkeley, which are already presented in the Registry of Standard Parts ( BBa_K197021 and BBa_K197022 ). Both coils are GNC4 leucine zippers which can form both homo- and heterodimers. The 2009 iGEM Berkeley wetlab team used this property to show cell-cell adhesion of Escherichia coli cells, if the coils are presented on the cell surface (Figure 12) [3].
Figure 12: cell-cell adhesion using coiled-coils
Although functionality of these coils was proved in cell-cell adhesion, they were cloned into a BBa_197038 plasmid backbone. This backbone is very unusual for standard registry parts and is not compatible with any of the iGEM cloning standards. To allow future iGEM teams to work with the Berkeley system more easily, we decided to clone the KILR-coil into a standard 10 plasmid backbone pSB1C3.  This experimental approach was done only for the BBa_K197022 KILR. We designed 2 primers containing iGEM standard 10 pre- and suffix to anneal directly on the sequence of the KILR coil.

Overview
This is a brief profile on the topic of synthetic biology in China. Information from reliable English and Chinese media was gathered from on-line sources. With the help of our Chinese teammates, information from Mandarin media was translated to English. The profile is divided into seven parts: SynBio map entries; iGEM competition; biotechnology market; biotechnology funding; regulations of synthetic biology; the perception of synthetic biology; and general information on leading institutes and organizations. We present information so that readers will be able to get an overall picture of the current situation and China’s efforts in promoting synthetic biology.
Synthetic biology in China is still in its infancy compared with other countries, e.g.: the United States (“Synthetic biology”, n.d.). Researchers and the government, however, have realized the importance of developing synthetic biology and are facilitating through various activities such as funding researches, and incorporating into government plans.
China’s impact on synthetic biology is small at present. In the future, however, the country plans to utilize its current technologies, such as genetic sequencing and recombinant DNA, to facilitate the field of synthetic biology (香山科学会议第322次学术讨论会综述, 2008). With technological advancement, independent innovation and thorough regulations are expected to support the development of synthetic biology in China.
Synbio Map
In 2009, the Synthetic Biology Project began mapping the research in the field of synthetic biology. As the field develops, this map expands in region and identifies companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in this emerging field.  This map is based on publicly available data from official websites, scientific literature, government reports and records, and newspaper and journal articles"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html,"PEC with single fragments that were amplified from a P. luminescens cell pellet.
Both pKH5 and pRB22 were correct as seen by PCR screenings and sequencing. We used pRB22 to assemble pRB23, which is the ccdB-variant of pRB22, enabling to test every combination of T-domain in co-expression with the four PPTases.
Week 20
T-Domain Shuffling
We prepared pRB23-T1 to -TTE19 and performed transformations in E. coli TOP10 as well as co-transformations with the four PPTase plasmids pRB15-18 and a pSB3K3-plasmid with a nonsense insert. This shows whether there is a dependency of T-Domain activation on the PPTases and if there are differences in indigoidine yield using different combinations of T-Domains and PPTases. The co-transformation with a pSB3K3 plasmid with a nonsense insert shows whether the smaller size of the colonies in our co-transformation experiments is due to the co-transformation itself or to the PPTases.
We sequenced every variant of pRB23-Txx and they were all correct. The cotransformation experiment showed, that some of the engineered indigoidine synthetases are still capable of producing the blue pigment. The indigoidine production strongly differs among the various T-Domains. All the combinations are shown in a big table in the detailled lab journal below.
T-Domain Borders
This week we tried to assemble pRB23-b11 to -b34, which are 12 pRB22-derived plasmids, in which the indC-T-Domain was exchanged by the bpsA T-domain. In every variant, the domain borders were defined differently. Those constructs were co-transformed with the four PPTase plasmids pRB15-18 as well as with a pSB3K3 plasmid containing a nonsense insert (Transformation strain: E. coli TOP10). The appearance of blue colonies on the plates showed which domain borders work best for the  domain exchange between functionally related NRPS.
The cotransformations of the pRB23-bxx CPEC assembly products with the PPTase plasmids was not successful. Therefore, we prepared plasmid DNA of the pRB23-bxx variants and repeated the co-transformation experiments.

Short Summary
Our analysis tool gives the opportunity to measure intermolecular distances with the help of Foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the target protein. We provide three tRNA/aminoacyl-synthetases (aaRS) for the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) with additional functional groups compared to the canonical amino acids. The functional groups could form a covalent bond to a fluorophore in chemical reactions. The fluorescence of the fluorophores indicates how far the distance to each other is. With this tool, target proteins could be labeled at specific positions to find out if the folding of the protein changes, give information about the protein structure or if two different proteins interact.  To demonstrate this tool, we labeled the yeast prion Sup35 at specific positions. During translation of Sup35, two different orthogonal tRNA/aaRS incorporate two different ncAAs which can be labeled specific with fluorophores. With this test protein, applications like a quick prion detection assay are possible.

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," it is obvious that the yeast cultured in original product outgrew the sterilized group in the first few hours. Though the two group reach the same level after 19 hours culturing, we could still judge the original blood serum to be better since the reaction time we had estimated for our ATM testing box is around 4 to 5 hours ---- still within the dominant period of original blood serum culturing.
Fig.12 The growth curve of yeast
A: 100% BS  B: 100% FBS
C: 10% BS+ water  D: 10% FBS+ water  G: 1% BS+ water  H: 1% FBS+ water
E: 10% BS+YPD  F: 10% FBS+YPD  I: 1% BS+YPD  J: 1% FBS+YPD
The overall graphic shows that the growth rate of yeast in YPD is faster than water, while during the estimated reaction time, the whole blood serum group also outgrew the water group. The above results suggest that blood serum won’t disturb the proliferation and cell activity of yeast, and even enhance them in water environment. The dominance of original blood serum leads to convenience that users don’t need to filter or heat inactivate complement protein to avoid precipitation.
In conclusion, the modified yeast could survive in blood serum environment provided by users which is the testing environment in our design normally, without any need of further processing.
Future Work
Gα modification
Because human G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can‘t improperly couple with α subunit of yeasts’ G protein, five carboxy-terminal amino acid residues of the guanine nucleotide binding protein a-subunit (Ga) in yeast Gpa1 can be replaced by human Gα[2]. Human histamine H4 receptor is coupled to Gαi/o proteins [3], so we got the sequence of last five amino acid residues of Gi1 and added it to the primer. Then we used PCR and Gibson assembly to constitute fragment for homologous recombination. Ura3 marker will be recovered after the whole fragment is integrated into yeast genome [4].

Announcements: - In the next 2 advisor’s meetings, decide which projects are the best ideas, focus on those, and represent them in groups. Have different people both critique and endorse the different projects. o Rank the projects. - There will be one main project, and then one good side project. o The side project functions as both a safety in case the primary project fails, and as a continued project for the next year. - Keep in mind what looks good in competition. The work we’ve put in might be enough, even if there is no finished final project. But the research and groundwork must be excellent in that scenario. - Final advisor’s meeting is Tuesday, May 1. At this meeting the main and side projects will be finalized. - Next Tuesday we are meeting Dr. Robinson. - April 17th, we will have a group picture for the brochure. Dress up! - On Sunday’s meeting we will vote on what projects we will focus on pitching again. This is the opportune time to add more to your presentation. We’re not picking 2 projects, we’re picking several to re-research and reevaluate. Remember, we’re objective and no project is a bad project! - This Sunday Angela will also explain about the standard cloning procedure. - Sunday meeting will be at 8PM in the BIF.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#jp_-_-_TEXT.html,"  In 2010, the Japanese government invested US$ 50 to 60 billion in science and technology, with life science being viewed as an area for significant future growth. Many companies are therefore looking for chances to benefit from this opportunity (""The Japanese market,"" ).
One example of a government-funded research institute is Okinawa Health Biotechnology Research and Development Center. It provides free research facilities to biotechnology companies. Additionally, it promotes the development of manufactured products through collaboration between government, industry, and academia (""The future of,"" 2011).
Regulations for Synthetic Biology
In a life science workshop in 2006, “design and reproduction of life function” was highlighted by the Center for Research and Development Strategy, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST CRDS) as a field with principle priority. Also, in cooperation with local experts in fields related to synthetic biology, the Council of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology proposed a policy to promote research on synthetic biology. At the same time, it considered the need to draft regulations against improper applications of synthetic biology. Although following the pre-existing “Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms” could minimize the occurrence of a serious problem, it would be necessary to improve regulation of synthetic biology by specifically mentioning it in a new law (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011).
Perception of Synthetic Biology
In 2010, only 15% of the population was familiar with the term synthetic biology.  This term showed up in 15 articles in the 5 major Japanese newspapers. The relatively low degree of social recognition is probably because significant discoveries of synthetic biology have not been widely reported, and researchers use terms other than synthetic biology such as molecular biology and systems biology to describe their work (Mori & Yoshizawa, 2011).
People
Hirohide Saito, Koji Sode, Kenichi Yamazaki are examples of Japanese scientists who have interest in synthetic biology.

General Information
L. johnsonii is a bacterium belonging to the family of lactobacillaceae. Next to nearly 500 other microbial species it is part of the human intestinal flora which is located in the gastro-intestinal tract. L. johnsonii, like all lactobacilli, is gram-positive, anaerobic and has a rod-like shape without spore formation. It’s main aid for the human body is to digest polysaccharides and proteins. Apart from this, L. johnsonii is capable of producing short-fatty acids and vitamins, that can make up to 15% of the human caloric intake. Due to its capability to undergo fermentation, it also provides help in preserving food, such as cheese, milk and vegetables, by producing lactic acid. We choose L. johnsonii as part of the “acidophilus complex” for our project, because it helps the human body in a probiotic way and is capable of undergoing certain transformations.
Pathology and Application in Biotechnology
L. johnsonii is part of the human intestinal tract. Therefore it is not known to have a pathogenic effect in humans. It is mostly known to work in a probiotic way. Apart from some cases, where patients had previous diseases, there are no known pathogenic effects caused by any lactobacilli strain.
There are many possible ways lactobacilli can be used due to its capability to undergo fermentation and the production of acid. First, L. johnsonii can be used to preserve fresh food, i.e. dairy products, meat and vegetables. Second, L. johnsonii can be used directly as a probiotic, cultivated for example in yoghurt. This can be seen in the human stomach, where L. johnsonii has a regulating effect on Helicobacter pylori, which resides in the gastrum. Apart from the human body, L. johnsonii is used in poultry industry by reducing diseases caused by Escherichia coli. This can significantly reduce the usage of antibiotics"

We performed titers of T4 infected phage from off of two separate E. Coli strands, BL21 and W3110. We added .1mL of the liquid culture to 1 mL of both strands of bacteria. After allowing infection to occur overnight, we centrifuged the tubes to separate the bacteria from the phage. We separated the supernatant into a new eppendorf tube, and used 10 µL as the 0 concentration. We then performed a phage titer using five tubes of 90 µL LB each, adding 10 µL from each one to the next. Using a micropipette we spotted 2µL of each dilution onto both 4.5 ml 1x plates and .5 mL W3110 plates. To avoid smearing, we allowed the plates to sit for over an hour and then we incubated them at 37 C overnight.
Results: The concentrations we used are still way too strong. We will have to dilute the concentration even further if we want to see anything more than cleared plaques.

This early peak, if it is activated in all cells and not a subset of the population, would probably be sufficient to kill the vegetative cells too early, before entering the sporulation cycle.
Though we will have to make this measurement reproducible, we are hoping that the other, weaker promoter PsspK, which was not finished cloning, might be a better candidate. We hope that it will not have such an early peak and if so a much weaker one. But as the Ecf41bli aa 1-204 is so highly active it probably will still be sufficient to produce toxic levels of MazF.

Biosafety Handbook
Biosafety handbook is one of most important part of our human practice. Our handbook is based on the iGEM programs, from which we select the teams whose safety parts are beneficial and fruitful. And we also made reference to some related papers. At last, we summarized and wrote this biosafety handbook. We hope our handbook can help people with the work of gene pollution prevention. And we believe our biosafety handbook will provide reference to other iGEM teams in the future.
Genetic pollution refers to the unintended or uncontrolled gene flow of native species gene pool. In 21th century, the recombinant organisms begin to spread into the environment extensively.
Biosafety should be the primary concern in the laboratory
Admittedly, scientists and international groups have already started to seriously consider the safety of transgenosis, but there are still a lot of limitations and a lack of long-term data. Although genetic engineering can bring huge benefits to us, but the potential threats it cause can never be ignored. Like DDT, which won a Nobel Prize in the year when it was created, but caused great injury to both human beings and the environment after 50 years. We can't stop this kind of things totally, but at least we can make efforts to prevent it. Considering the specialty of our program, it can be creatively used in the career of the gene pollution prevention, we will show the possibilities and examples in the third part.
We divided our handbook into three parts:
Operation
Laboratory Practices Followed By Our Team
1. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Feet and legs should be covered; sandals and open-toed shoes should not be worn in laboratories. Wear appropriate gloves while handling infectious or toxic materials and animals. Do not wear lab coats, gloves or other personal protective equipment outside the laboratory. Change gloves when contaminated, and dispose of used gloves with other contaminated laboratory waste.
A safety goggle
2. Do not eat, drink, smoke, handle contact lenses, apply cosmetics, or store food for human consumption in the laboratory.
3. Wash your hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
4. Follow the institutional policies regarding safe handling of sharps (i.e., needles, scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware). Be careful with needles and syringes. Use only when alternative methods are not feasible. Syringes, needles, Pasteur pipettes"

An index file was generated for each of the sample using the
index
function in Samtools. The index file allow aligners to narrow down the potential origin of a query sequence within the genome, saving both time and memory. The                   index file typically is a .bai file, with the same name as the alined BAM file. This step is key for future package alingers to asses the sequences.
Remove Duplicate Reads - Picard
After assessing the quality of the samples with FastQC, the reports show that more than 20% of the total sample is composed by duplicated and non-unique sequences as seen in Figure 3 (Shlee). The duplicated sequences were search and deleted                   from the libraries using Picard Tools (v 2.18.14) MarkDuplicates program. The remove sequencing duplicates option was tagged to output the file with the duplicated sequences already removed. Alternatively, it is possible to flag the                   duplicates instead of removing them from the file by using <-drf> DuplicateRead option (Shlee). The duplication metrics of this analysis were also compiled and can be found in the Ginga Github. A summary of this metrics can be                   found in Table 3. The average percentage of duplication for the library was 36% which correlates to the previous information reported in the FastQC report. For more information about correct usage of MarkDuplicates please refer to this link .

It was important to us that the club was interactive and can be delivered by other schools in the future using the resources we created so for every session we created a Kahoot quiz which can be found by searching Kahoot for the username ‘BioBlast_Club’ and all the PowerPoints we used can be found on our <a href="" https://frog.judd.kent.sch.uk/app/os#!igem/home "">website</a> as well as a more detailed description of what we did and how others can run this club.
Presentations
Young Scientist Journal

"" style=""width:30%"">
This event held at Queens college Cambridge, allowed the team to present our project in a number of different ways. As well as doing a talk and presentation, we also used our poster. Their feedback on the poster was extremely helpful in telling us what we need to change before the Jamboree. Overall, the whole experience was extremely beneficial in preparing us for the Giant Jamboree which was only a month away. We had the opportunity to present our work in a similar way to what we expect to do in Boston; a dress rehearsal if you like. We were lucky enough to meet some leading academics and discuss our project as well as win the prize for Best Scientific communication.
Furthermore, all of the students at the young scientist journal were at similar stage in their education to us and were interested in STEM so we hope that the young students enjoyed our talk and felt inspired by the IGEM competition and would consider joining a university team. As a team we are very keen to lead the way for other British schools to follow in the future. Being one of the first British state schools to enter the competition, we are particularly keen that other schools such as us follow in our footsteps.

The presentation that was delivered to the Biology society in school and was aimed at the sixth form who are already studying Biology A level and was focused on the lab work, protocols, our genetic construct and the scientific research involved in our project. Aside from possibly inspiring the year 12s to become the next Judd iGEM team, it introduced those who already study sciences to synthetic biology and potentially encourage the year 12s to consider a career in this field as this year they will need to consider university. We decided to present to the year 12’s who expressed an interest in biology because we wanted them to be aware of the great potential of synthetic biology that is not covered in the"

The sequence in the hairpin added after the start codon was also screened for the presence of stop codons, as they would prematurely terminate translation of the gene of interest when the riboregulator was activated. We employed a 12 nt Toehold domain at the 50 end of the hairpin to initiate its interaction with the cognate trigger strand. The trigger RNA contains a 30 nt single-stranded RNA sequence that is complementary to the toehold and stem of the switch RNA.
Figure 6: (C) Flow cytometry GFP fluorescence histograms for toehold switch number 2 compared to E. coli autofluorescence and a positive control. Autofluorescence level measured from induced cells not bearing a GFP-expressing plasmid.(D) GFP mode fluorescence levels measured for switches in their ON and OFF states in comparison to positive control constructs and autofluorescence. Error bars are the SD from at least three biological replicates.
Based on all information given above, we decided to use Toehold-Trigger RNA system fort he AND Gate part of our project.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," successfully transform frozen B. subtilis cells with all three of our integration vectors, however each plate yielded only a handful of colonies and many of these colonies were transformed. After some discussion, we reached the conclusion that our B. subtilis cells either had a very high transformation efficiency, or a very low cell viability. We also assumed there was an issue with our antibiotic plates (spectinomycin) since untransformed colonies (white) were able to grow.
To test the viability of our B. subtilis, we will be manipulating the amount of glycerol added to our stocks before storing them at -80°C. We plan on completing this as soon as possible next week. We will also modify certain aspects of our current transformation protocol. First, we will use freshly streaked cells for our transformations, as we are under the impression that stale cells may be more fragile. Next, we will grow the cells for a shorter period of time in order to minimize any dilutions caused by adding the 1% LB-Xylose solution. Alternatively, we will use a 2% xylose (w/v) solution to ensure that all of the B. subtilis cells receive enough xylose to achieve supercompetency. Finally, we plan on including both a 10 minute ice and room temperature incubation step prior to the 90 minute shaker step. We believe that this will reduce the trauma experienced by the cells due to the rapid temperature fluctuations.
While scrutinizing our transformation protocol, we also tested whether our vectors integrated into the desired locus by using colony PCR. We did not see any bands for the sacA vectors, however we also saw abnormal  samples that were not even run on the gel. We believe that our initial lysis step was not long enough, thus the Taq enzyme could not get access to the DNA and the PCR failed.. We will attempt a second colony PCR with a longer lysis step early next week.. For the lacZ vector we saw a band that was approximately 2700 bp long; this was consistent among our three replicates. However, we were expecting to see a band that was actually ~6000 bp long and hypothesized that the B. subtilis may have forcefully ejected the lacZ genes.Dr. Wong had warned us earlier that B. subtilis has a tendency to eject genes when multiple copies are present. After taking into account the RFP generator we were still missing ~2000 bp. We decided to get this product sequenced in order to determine exactly what parts of the vector were being amplified by our vectors. For the thrC"

Clearance of cfDNA from the blood
Alegre et al. 2015
The EPO from the infected cells is released into the bloodstream. The EPO reaches the bone marrow where it stimulates red blood cell production through erythropoiesis. Red blood cells begin as stem cells and go through a series of cell differentiations before maturing into red blood cells (figure 12).
Figure 12. Cell stages in red blood cell production. Stage 1 is the BFU-E cell stage. Stage 2 is the CFU-E cell stage. The proliferation rate of CFU-E cells depends on the concentration of EPO. Stage 3 is the erythroblasts stage. Stage 4 is the marrow reticulocytes stage. The length of time cells stay in this stage is dependent on the concentration of EPO. Stage 5 is the circulating red blood cell (RBC) stage. Neocytolysis of RBCs is triggered when the concentration of EPO drops below a certain threshold. The red blood cell count acts as a feedback loop that determines the endogenous production of EPO.
EPO promotes the proliferation of CFU-E cells. Increases in EPO levels lead to faster proliferation rates of CFU-E cells. Increases in EPO levels reduces the marrow transit time of cells for marrow reticulocytes, releasing the cells into the blood in a shorter time frame. In the blood, the reticulocytes mature into red blood cells which increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. If the partial partial pressure of oxygen in the blood drops below normal due to an excess of red blood cells, the endogenous production of EPO in the kidneys decrease. A low enough concentration of EPO in the blood will trigger macrophages to phagocytose young red blood cells. The process is referred to as neocytolysis and allows the body to quickly respond to changes environmental changes including changes in altitude ( Rice et al. 2005 ).

Advertising Plan
A multipronged approach to advertising will be taken to our niche market.  Service companies and large government analytical laboratories will be the primary targets, however, we hope to be able to simultaneously be attracting interest from private companies in similar oil and gas service roles. Advertising will occur as follows in our timeline:
Year 1 - 2014
Social Media - We have established Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts to attempt to advertise our potential products and technology platform to our target market.  We will begin to advertise specifically to individuals in these markets using targeted social media marketing.
Conferences - Our group plans to attend market specific conferences to be able to network with key players in the industry.  We plan to use these connections to establish our reach in the marketplace.
Website - We will have a website where potential customers can come to learn more about our company and our product, as well as place orders and request quotes- point of sale.
Year 2 - 2015
In addition to Year 1:
Industry Specific Events - In addition to the conferences from Year 1, we plan to expand our breadth to trade shows, conferences, conventions, and key industry events.  We plan to hold kiosks and booths at these events to directly engage potential clients with a focus on establishing pre-sales of our technology to prepare for our technologies release into the marketplace.  We plan on investing in signage, fliers, brochures, a monthly newsletter, and other advertising components to achieve this reach.
Year 3 - 2016
In addition to Year 1 and 2:
Print Advertising - We plan on targeting key industry specific newspapers and magazines in our target market to expand our reach.  These will be important to potentially expand our market into private companies which may be more difficult to reach via conferences or other methods.
Endorsement - In order to gain confidence from our clients, we hope to be able to partner with a key player in the industry to gain market confidence in our technology.  We hope to gain their endorsement and utilize this to gain further share in the market place bringing on other companies in the space to adopt our technology.
Competitive and New Emergent Technologies
Our product provides a distinct advantage to our target market, being fast, affordable, portable, and robust. These are many elements which other general toxin biosensors do not possess. An analysis against other competitive technologies in the market follows:

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

In this meeting we discussed eight reviews read by the team members during the past several days. The contents of the reviews are in the areas of gene switch which is based on the research of protein isomerism; mammalian cell structure design using the idea of engineering of small molecules; synonymous codon bias; application of catalytic efficiency of light in synthetic biology reactions and RNA functions. The software Notebook done by other team for past competition was also introduced. Considering what we have already discussed before, we decided to focus more on the projects from the past iGEM teams. Now the topic that interests us is codon optimization based on selection bias, but it calls for  further discussion.

In this meeting we discussed four papers and some software. “SynBioSS: the synthetic biology modeling suite” is a synthetic gene structure modeling and simulation software in which different parts could be set in a complete network, but it highly recommends a wider and more comprehensive knowledge on synthetic biology, molecular biology and computers. Another paper talked about how antibiotics kill bacteria, and what we can learn from it is the possibility to create a piece of software to simulate this process, which, of course, will provide great convenience to synthetic biology researchers. Yang Xue introduced SBOL to the team, which is an open language for synthetic biology. “Engineering of synthetic intercellular communication systems” summarized how to accomplish cell communication systems in cells in synthetic biology. The software Bioguide introduced by Jurong Zhao focused on the categories for pathway generation and database search. After the discussion, we all agreed that the project we plan to do should be fully considered with the user needs and provide convenience to synthetic biology researchers.

The Dragon Cafe and Photohonesty
Dragon Cafe: We visited this small pop-up cafe located in the crypt of a church in South London. in which every Monday creative activities (and yummy vegan food!) run throughout the day. Open for all and with a special focus on those who are either recovering from a mental health, this project sprouting from Mental Fight Club (http://mentalfightclub.com) runs creative activities (and serves yummy vegan food!) to those who pop by each Monday. Having the chance of presenting our work to a broad audience opened our perspectives and allowed us to bring to life the drive we have to explore all possibilities within Mind the Gut. As a follow-up to the session, we run interactive and open Q&A sessions where, working in small groups, members of the team discussed with those present what really matters in providing psychological care and treatment for mental health. .
Photohonesty: the name under which Graham Miller’s work can be found, drives the attention away from the photographer and towards principles behind the “accessible conceptual” through which stigma is targeted. In the words of Graham: “My aim is to make people stop and think and then get the message that I’m trying to communicate”. This then allows for an interaction which brings the the artist much closer to the observer, whose condition as such becomes challenged. In the exhibition and art discussion organized as part of Mind the Gut, the photographs were shown in outdoors metal canvases. This exhibition, The Most Important people in the World: Honesty, had been previously shown in the Scottish Mental Health Art and Film Festival. The large size of the images filling the room portrayed the intensity of the message conveyed by those who matter most in mental health. Their stories, arising from the moments (and sometimes days!) of interaction with the photojournalist, were also displayed besides them. As it turns out, Graham also has a day job in Agilent Technologies, sponsor of iGEM 2015, and hence the powerful discussions we had on stigma, art and bioscience.

Fig 1. Flow chart of E. coli carbon utilization system
Overview
In this project, we, the NCKU Tainan Team, have proposed an                                         alternative way to reduce the emission of Carbon dioxide (CO2).                                         Referring to the opinions and feedbacks from many industry experts and                                         professors, we design a new factory flow to capture CO2 by E.                                             coli Not only our device meets the specs to commercialize, but it also                                         demonstrates high cost performance.
The emission of CO2 has been a serious problem for a                                         century that causes global warming and severe climate change. Even though many                                         ways have been tried to reduce it, the generation of CO2 primarily                                         from industry is still overwhelming. Therefore, scientists and governments have                                         been working hard to find solutions to tackle the problem.
Control System
Fig 2. Overview of the control system
There are many aspects we need to consider. First, we calculate                                         the emission velocity of CO2 from the factory, as well as the medium                                         exchange rate and the growth rate of E. coli.
Fig 1. is a process of whole E. coli carbon utilization that we design                                         for industrial application. We simplify it into three parts which shows in Fig                                         2. to explain more clearly. Three switches control three parts, named A, B and                                         C. Basically, the factory replaces the medium twice a day. At one hour before                                         replacing the medium, the user needs to turn on switch C to discharge ninety                                         percent of the medium. When it is time to replace the medium, switch C will be                                         turned off and switch B will be turned on to refill medium. When sufficient                                         medium is added, switch B will be turned off and switch A will be turned on to                                         let CO2 in. Just like the animation showed on Fig 1..

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
