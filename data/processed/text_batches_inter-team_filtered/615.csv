Collaboration
Since firstly taking part in iGEM, NJU-China has the tradition of communicating with   other teams in China. We do not only exchange our ideas and experiences with others, but   also spread the knowledge of synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition in China.   This year we kept the tradition and took part in several activities. These activities strengthened our understanding of synthetic biology and deepened the   friendship with other teams. We benefit each other in a mutual way.
Collaboration with SYSU-Software
We cooperated with the Software team from Sun Yat-sen University to develop the   conditioned place preference (CPP) mice image recognition software, and utilize the   software into our CPP test to record the reflection of mice. The software is able to present the statistic results in the form of heat maps,   reflecting the movement of mice directly and vividly.  We thank our collaborator for receiving us with attention and for such strong   contribution to our work.
In this experiment, we have seven mice. Each mouse is placed in a pair of interconnected   cages, including a bright one and a dark one. Our experiment requires us to record the   mice movement in order to accomplish the following goals:
1.To tell which cage the mice prefer to stay, bright one or dark one
2.Record the mice coordinate precisely
It’s hard for us to finish such job in tradition way. So we decided to seek some   software to assist us. However, the software available to us can not meet our demands.   It is really tricky. Fortunately, in iGEM China Community, we contact SYSU-Software, a   well-known software team and ask them to produce a tool for us. With their tool, we   record and analyze the video. Finally we obtain the following results:
1.The data of the mice coordinate, 30 times per second
2.Based on the data, the tool can generate a Heat Maps, from which, we can know which   cage the mice prefer to stay
Once again, we would like to thank SYSU-Software.

The basic motivation for me be a part of iGEM is that here we can work the way we want. From designing the strategies to encountering every single problem which comes in our way, it's all us. We have the liberty to work on our own and that's the most important part of the team. The actors become famous by the movie they act in, while it’s the director who makes the movie famous! I am the director in this case.

In the MFC design that uses ferricyanide as cathode, the maximum cell voltage would be 0.182V. If oxygen is used as cathode, the maximum cell voltage would be 0.256V. The maximum power output could be 0.398W/gDW in ferricyanide while 0.56W/gDW could be reached using oxygen as cathode.
Effect of fumarate
Figure 7. The effect of fumarate on maximum direct electron transfer(DET) flux of Shewanella utilizing hexane at viable growth flux boundary
 
In pursuit of an overall higher electron output, we tried to identify how the nutritional factors in culturing media affect DET flux and growth flux. Hexane concentration was found to play a minor role since the actual uptake flux was restricted to be low(around -6.04*10-7 mmol/gDW/h) by internal factors of the bacteria.
However, fumarate was found to be an essential factor since it affects for growth, DET, and hexane uptake. In figure 7, the blue curve shows a positive correlation between fumarate uptake and DET flux (with growth flux set to 5%), and DET achieves its maximum value 81.68mmol/gDW/h at a fumarate uptake flux of  8 mmol/gDW/h. The green curve is the corresponding growth flux when DET was optimized. Since DET and growth cannot be optimized simultaneously, we separately constructed the red curve to describe the relationship between growth flux and fumarate uptake when optimizing growth. The curve shows a positive correlation and growth flux achieves its maximum value 0.9408h-1 when fumarate uptake flux reaches 94 mmol/gDW/h.
Aeration effect on DET flux
We also explored the difference of DET flux under aerobic and anaerobic condition. In anaerobic condition, we assumed fumarate as the electron acceptor. It is surprising that the DET flux is driven to extremely small negative value under anaerobic condition, while DET flux can reach 81.68mmol/gDW/h when oxygen flux is set as 20.42mmol/gDW/h according to literature[4].

UV kill curve experiments
Initial pilot test
UV box (ExoTerra flourescent bulbs and LEDs from nail curing light; Insulfoam sides) was set up in flow hood w/ 8 inch tall rack approximately centered. A horizontal reflector was placed on top of the rack.
Before start, two plates had been prepared for the experiment: one 24-well culturing plate containing 100uL of liquid culture of transformed pGLO HB101 and untransformed HB101 (grown overnight in TSB at 37oC w/ shaker) in each of 12 wells, and one 96-well plate w/ 90uL of TSB pr. well in 48 wells for dilution.
The culturing plate was used for UV exposure of the cultures. At intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 mins, the plate was removed from the box, and 10uL of sample was removed from each of 2 wells (1 for each strain). The sample was transferred to a well on the dilution plate to create an initial 10-fold dilution, and the culturing plate was returned to the UV box for further exposure.
From the initial 10-fold dilution, further dilutions (10-2, 10-3 and 10-4) were created. For each dilution, 4 drops of 10uL were spotted onto one quadrant of a petri plate (LB agar); plates were then incubated for approx. 36hrs at 37oC, and colonies were counted.

Why Plug 'n' Play with DNA?
We have developed a standardized assembly system, called “Plug’n’Play with DNA”, where any biological parts can be gathered without use of restriction enzymes and ligases. The method applies long complementary overhangs on the PCR product as well as the destination vector. These overhangs are custom made and can anneal to each other to form a stable hybridization product. This means that the parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products are directly mixed with a vector, which makes assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. All the parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products will be distributed in microtiter plates directly ready for cloning. The simple and easy use of the system was demonstrated by developing a reporter targeting system for the mammalian cell line, U2OS, where GFP was targeted to the peroxisomes. In addition, application of our system was demonstrated in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans.
Team
We are five students that have been working hard the whole summer. We were lucky to be able to enter iGEM at a late time in the competition but this also gave us extra challenges and little time. You can learn more about our challenges and about us on our Team page.
A new assembly standard
We think that iGEM should be about assembling biobricks fast and combining them in any thinkable way with existing or new parts. Therefore we introduce a simple and fast way of building new devices or whatever you want with ready to use PCR products. Read more about the Plug'n'Play with DNA assembly standard.
BioBricks
We have been working hard to construct over 48 biological parts and have constructed over 25 vectors. Our favorite parts can be found on our Data Page .

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component"

LMU-TUM Munich
‘We know surveys are not your favourite thing to do, but we have a few reasons why you should take ours!’. We completely agree with this opinion- people don’t like taking surveys... We had that feeling when we were conducting our survey about GMO- it was hard to convince people to write answers longer than one word. That’s why we were not wondering much whether or not to fill team’s LMU-TUM Munich questionnaire. We know how time consuming good survey preparation can be, not to even mention data analysis! So fully understanding what kind of task it is, we filled their survey entitled ‘Enabling Factors in Biotech’ with pleasure.
The survey contained many inspiring questions, which really allowed us to look at our project from a different point of view. Despite the fact that our group didn’t write business plan during  iGEM project, now when we see our promising results, we are starting to think about business founding. The survey focused our attention on very important issues, it visualized us that if we want to start our own business we should assess e.g. marketability of our project, define the size of the market and market competition. Thanks for this Hallie! We hope that our answers and whole obtained data will really help to promote the success of iGEM participants among scientific community.
meeting in Paris - the European Experience
At the beginning of July (2-3 July 2016) three members of our iGEM team (Marcin, Adrian and Maja) participated in the European Experience in Paris. It was our first contact with the other iGEM teams from Europe. The meeting was organized by two French groups: iGEM EVRY and iGEM IONIS. There was a poster session- it was a great possibility to exchange the ideas of our projects, ask questions and create collaborations. Our poster presented an expression system induced by sugars as well as our preliminary results connected with the dependence of the codon content on the fluorescence protein production. Then we took part in two synthetic biology conferences with researches from France. They raised interesting topics such as economical and ethical issues in synthetic biology. In"

IrrE biobrick for lubricant
IrrE  This construct already exists in the registry, however, we wanted to expand the pre-existing functionality. Here we have shown that this gene goes beyond helping growth in high salt concentration solutions by demonstrating that it actually exists bacterial growth in lubricant.
To achieve this we used lubricant from the market, specifically, Superdrug (Code: 380900), head quartered in Croydon, Surrey,  to demonstrate this in order to prove the gene would be functional in real-world conditions.
Our results indicate our proof of concept that under simulated conditions to be a success. This is because E. coli transformed with IrrE had improved growth in LB and lubricant compared to wild type.
We believe this is the first step to demonstrate that a living organism would be capable of living in lubricant.
Our functionality for our GMO lubricant would be two fold.
Initially we envisaged an STI-detecting lubricant which would change colour when in contact with an organism such as syphilis and chlamydia trachomatis.
When talking about ageing most of the diseases and implications that come to mind are quite obvious: loss of sight, hearing or mental capacity, arthritis and many more. One that doesn’t come to mind very often are Sexually Transmitted Infections, such as chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea. The fact of the matter is that between 2007 and 2011 the number of chlamydia and syphilis increased by 31%and respectively 52% in the American population over the age of 65. 1This may initially come as a surprise but it is a reality nowadays, especially in elderly care facilities.
With people living for longer, medication countering the effects of erectile dysfunction and a lot of free time it can be crudely compared to an American frat house. This might not yet be seen as a problem as people of all ages should be able to enjoy themselves however they want to. Yet the real problems start when there are secondary effects from the STIs, such as arthritis, vision loss and other symptoms. Those will usually be classified as just age-related problems and treated as such, rather than being treated appropriately.
However, it came to our attention the array of medical conditions that require lubricant, especially those associated with the elderly. We saw the potential of the addition of a safe GMO within them to prevent"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#HBK_-_-_TEXT.html,"Delta t = \Delta \mu = \) 0.01 days). Figure 26 shows that increasing the density of the population mesh results in a reduction in the difference (error) between the steady state solution and the dynamic steady state solution. It also shows that increasing the mesh density increases the run time of the model exponentially.
Figure 26. Effect of mesh density on run time and error reduction. (a) Shows the reduction in error due to the increase of mesh density. (b) Shows the effect of mesh density on the model run time. (c) Shows the error reduction plotted against the model run time.
The error in the dynamic model with a mesh density of 100 and the steady state model is 0.55%. This is an acceptable degree of error between the two models. The error in the dynamic model is reduced by 0.015% by increasing the population mesh from 100 to 200. The run time of the model is increased from about 2.5 minutes to around 15 minutes when increasing the mesh density from 100 to 200. For these reasons the mesh density was kept at 100 throughout the EPO gene doping tests.
Supplementary Results: Effect of Initial Population Mesh on Dynamic Steady State RBC Population
The red blood cell feedback loop on EPO release from the kidneys was implemented to determine the dynamic effect of changing EPO concentration. The initial population of the mesh was varied to determine is the starting conditions had an effect on the final steady state. The initial mesh was set to 0, steady state values, a population of 1010 at each maturity point, and a population of 1011 at each maturity point. Negative populations were not considered.
Figure 27: Effect of the initial population in the population mesh on the final steady state of the dynamic model.
For every initial population mesh, with the population density set to 100, the dynamic model reached a steady state of 24.59 trillion red blood cells. Due to the combination of feedback loops in the model, the red blood cell count will reach the same steady state regardless of the initial population in the mesh. To change the steady state of the dynamic model, the parameters in the feedback functions would need to be modified until a desired steady state red blood cell count is reached. This was not done in our model.

We selected PphoA for our construct. We compared the activity difference of two promoters for 0 and 300 μM of phosphate, as they are the minimum and maximum dynamic range suggested by Tokyo Tech 2013 iGEM team . Having The fold change of PphoA GFP is 2.99, which is greater than 1.88 of PphoBR. Therefore, we chose PphoA as it has a greater range, so it is supposed to have larger difference within a certain range.

1. Meetings with Professional Instructors
We invited four professors, professor Chen Ding, Ren Sheng, Teng Fei, Lijun Liu, for having discussions with our team members.
We presented our complete experimental project to the professors. During the presentation, professors asked us some questions about our experimental project, and we had an in-depth communication with them to better optimize our program. In the course of the discussion, the professors raised two questions: how long our testing system work can spend, and how many bacteria can be detected in the number of the threshold value. We did not discuss such issues in depth until then.
In view of the questions raised by the professors, we developed a series of discussions and finally completed the optimization of the experiment. In the final protocol, we used the optical fibers to detect the Fluorescence intensity. According to the data the conclusion can be obtained: when OD value is 0.6, reaction time is 5 minutes, fluorescence intensity of GFP can change with a high sensitivity, easier to operate and detect.
Figure 5. Regular Meeting.
2. Practice in Information Institute of NEU
To better complete our project, we went to the information institution of Northeastern University to deeply understand how to use electrical components to achieve the conversion between photoelectric, fluorescent protein detection.
We discussed our project with professor Yanan Zhang and Riqing Lu coming from information institution. After presenting our idea of using fiber to detect fluorescence, professors affirmed our project and suggested improvements to our project from a professional point of view.
We originally decided to use Photoresistors to complete the entire experiment device, but in the process of communication with professors, we found that the light intensity range of Photoresistors is very wide, but fluorescent protein emitted by the light is very faint, it is difficult to achieve Photoresistors photoelectric conversion.
After adopting the professor's suggestion, we have made some changes in practical project, and fully perfected it. In the process of communication with students in the information institution, we fully understand the practical use and parameters of optical fiber, better understanding the various properties of optical fibers, optimizing our experimental plans. We also cooperated with the Information Institute, which provided us with theoretical guidance in the process of optical fiber conversion and helped us complete the whole process of the experiment.

I think we have found all the sensors for lead, arsenic, and mercury.
We should now focus on how to express them.
For example, if we mix up GFP, YFP, RFP, would the results come out as a mixed fluorescence?
We can also use pigments, but we must look for them.
The amd gene professor recommended seems like a good candidate.
However, if we are to express them differently, we need two more pigments.
Let's look for them.

IGEM 2007 team has already tried mercury metal sensor, but they failed to make it work.  ( https://2007.igem.org/MIT ) I think this is due to lack of appropriate biobricks registered. I am looking through other teams to study. Hope we can all meet on Friday. See you all.

Fig.2
Model for substrate recognition and delivery of proteins by type III secretion machines [2] .
   When the needle tip attaches to the host cell membrane, a translocator complex that is also secreted by the T3SS is assembled on the host cell membrane and mediates the passage of the effector proteins through the target cell membrane. On the other hand an effector protein, which have a unique T3SS secretion signal domain on its N-terminal, is recognized by the specific chaperone and form an effector-chaperone complex. The secretion machinery, including a T3-secretion-associated ATPase, recognizes the complex. Then, the ATPase stripes the chaperone from the complex, which remains within the bacterial cell, and mediates the unfolding and threading of the effector protein through the central channel of the needle complex. Finally, the translocated effectors re-fold within the host cell to carry out their function (Fig.2).
Motivation
   It is valuable to develop a system that can modulate cell's behavior transiently by injecting a desired ""protein"" directly into cells using a non-pathogenic strain. This system can be applied for many purposes. For example,
Inject p53 to terminate cell division of cancer cells selectively
Inject factors required for iPS cells induction
   It has been reported in 2007 that T3SS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenesity Island 2(SPI2) is functional in vitro on the E. coli (K-12) strain [9] . However, the T3SS encoded in SPI-2 naturally function inside of the phagosome of the target cell [8] . So, there was no report about whether the SPI-2 T3SS, that is cloned on E. coli (K-12) can inject a heterologous protein from outside of the target cell or not. That is why we have decided to put this challenging project into practice.
Objectives of iGEM 2010
   Though it is so exciting to create a cancer killer or an iPS generator E. coli, it is too difficult to aim these practical goals from the very first; because it was reported that some domains are not able to pass the needle"

At first, all the readings came out as zero. After analysing our device we located the bug in Denver Biolabs' code and wrote a short solution. We later also removed some redundant sections.
You can download the fixed code from Github , however we recommend you use our far superior design using instructions below .
Our fluorometer and densitometer
We significantly improved Aachen and Denver Biolabs' design, having redone the most of the wiring and parts of the software. But we wanted to go further; we made our own combined fluorometer and densitometer, keeping only Aachen's cuvette holder design and their measuring principle.
Here we document the design decisions we made, how we built and tested it, and Judd-UK’s input to the design.
For the measurements, check out the measurement page .
Components
Our design uses only off-the-shelf components except for the cuvette holder, for which we couldn’t find an alternative. Aachen 2014’s design was good for this so we used theirs.
The key component is the Digispark, a USB-based development board similar to an Arduino except much cheaper, and with the ability to communicate with a host computer by mimicking keyboard events. It acts as a bridge between the light sensor and our interpreter app.
The device plugs in via USB so is compatible with almost anything, including desktop computers, laptops, phones and tablets. We created an interpreter application to be used on the device it is plugged into that can save the readings and convert them into common units transmittance percentage.
Our design is completely open-source by OSI standards [1]
Our code for both the device and the interpreter is licensed under the GPLv3 license
Our circuit design is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0
The keyboard library used (Digikeyboard) is licensed under the GPLv2 license [2]

Overview / Rationale
While time delay might not be applicable in some situations, for example, containment of bacterial spill, it still has an implication on lab safety that must be met. Under a condition when modified bacteria secrete commercial products into a culture medium, this genetically engineered bacteria can be controlled to express within a constraint period of time before it is automatically knocked out. Keeping cell intact is crucial to prevent protein contamination in the media.
Therefore, this construct aims to set a timer for an inserted gene of interest to function for a controlled period of time before undergoing knock out by Cre recombinase. Knocking out of construct will lead to inactivation of the gene of interest, providing a secure and safe method for researchers to control the genetic modified organism (GMO).
Our Design
Time delay turns Cre recombinase either on or off dependent on the presence of AHL. All promoters in the Time delay module is a constitutively repressible promoter.
There are two scenarios of activity in Time Module Construct:
In the absence of AHL, only phlF molecules produce and repress its pphlF promoter. Then, the expression of downstream recombinase is rendered.
The second scenario is when sufficient AHL initiates cI protein production (BBa_C0051). The cI molecules will inhibit phlF expression by repressing pcI promoter (BBa_R0051). This turns on pphlF promoter, leading to expression of recombinase.
The length of time control is dependent on the strength of ribosomal binding site (RBS) downstream to pluxR promoter. The stronger the RBS strength, the higher recombinase expression.
Potential Issue
....
Experiments & Results
In order to observe the change in GFP expression due to different ribosomal binding site strength, we select five RBS in this investigation: 0.01, 0.07, 0.6, 0.3, 1.0 respectively. RBS 1.0 will be the"

Have you ever been forced to abandon a project due to problems with the import of material?
Is funding provided by development agencies compatible with your needs?
How do you rate the financial support provided by development agencies?
Is there any bill in your country to improve the import situation?
The first limitation we faced doing this research was the few responses received.  To increase the chances of feedback, we decided to send our questionnaire to other universities from Latin America not necessarily participants of iGEM and we still got few responses. From 266 emails sent, we got 16 answers.
Questionnaire Results
Analyzing the answers to the first question of our survey, it was clear that Latin America faces important issues to do research. Notably, the lack of qualified personnel was not a problem that came up, indicating that we have indeed interested,  capable scientists who are eager to do more for science!
In addition to infra-structure, funding was indicated as the main difficulty to do Science (Figure 4).
Latin American countries are still on track to become developed, but  when it comes to funding in Science, the competition with well established nations, such as  the  USA and European countries, is an uneven game. Considering this, we can say that funding in developed countries is more abundant than in Latin America for sure.
The budget dedicated to Science investment is managed by support agencies, which distribute the money through specific bids. More than 70% of the interviewed said that the funding provided by support agencies rarely is compatible with their needs (Fig 5) and the support agencies that provide the funding are rated only as reasonable (Fig 6).
Comparing Brazil and USA’s gross domestic product (GDP), we can clearly see that USA is a richer nation than  Brazil (Figure 7). More money for the country, more money to invest! Therefore, since funding is a problem in Science and for the iGEM participation as well, USA being a richer nation, it obviously has more funded teams participating on the competition than Brazil (Figure 8).
But this is not the only problem. There is more to that. USA GDP in 2013 was  ≅ 16,8 trillion USD and ≅ 2,8 % of it was invested in Science somehow, representing a funding of ≅ 470,4 billion USD. Brazil’s GDP in 2013 was ≅ 2,246 trillion USD and only ≅ 1,2% was invested in Science, representing ≅ 26,952 billion, an amount 94,3%  smaller than what was"

Human Practices
This year, because our project has real potential to positively impact our small community, we did a lot of work in human practices. Evidence of our impact are the two articles in which we have been featured in our local newspaper, “The Rocky Mountain Outlook”.  The first article published introduced who we are what the iGEM competition actually is. It outlined our project as well as the potential impact on our communities’ wastewater treatment challenges. The second article was published when we hosted an Alberta Innovates and GeekStarter jamboree at our school, where all five Alberta iGEM teams competed against each other in a pre-competition.  This allowed for us to learn about others projects and meet our nearby teams.  This article focuses on the $8,000 grand prize that we won at this Alberta GeekStarter jamboree, earning us the distinction of best overall project, and “most potential impact”.
The team after the Alberta Jamboree
We have also been interviewed by the local radio station, mountain FM, where they asked us many questions about our project, iGEM, and the upcoming competition. The interview allowed us to get the word out about our project and connect with not only Canmore, but also the surrounding communities such as Banff, Exshaw and Lake Louise.
Maria Buchko and Alina Arvisais at the Radio Station
A significant human practices achievement was having one of our team members, Alina Arvisais and one of our teacher supervisors, Mrs. Puurunen, went to visit the wastewater treatment plant in Canmore. They learned about the current methods employed to deal with the hair issue, as well as the workers’ opinions concerning our project and it’s potential application in this industry. This visit allowed us to learn more in depth-information about the issue, and really visualize and understand how a Keratinase-expressing bacteria could be used in bio-reactor systems already in place.  We got some amazing photos… and won’t soon forget the smell.

Programmed polyketide synthesis
Polyketides, including macrolides, tetracyclines, anthracyclines, and other polyether compounds with anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, immune suppression and other functions, are a large class of natural products produced by bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi or plants. For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthase, the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains.However, such method can’t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. In this project, we use polyketide synthase domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, we optimize the linkers between domains. Furthermore, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, polyketide synthase domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, using our system, we can design polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.

Who: Benno
Aim The goal of the GC-MS and GC-FID runs is to have a second qualitative measurement technique for styrene to ensure a reliable proof of concept. Also we wanted to evaluate GC-FID for quantitative information
Sample preparation for GM-HS and GC-FID:
800 µl of liquid culture is pipetted into a 2 ml Eppendorf cup. 720 µl benzene and 80 µl 10 mM 2-methylanisole benzene solution (internal standard) are added. The Eppendorf is then vortexed for 20 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13.000 rpm. The organic phase is filtered over a 0,2 µM polyethersulfone (PES) disc membrane and brought into cealed GC vial. The GC vial is placed into the GC autosampler and the run is started.
GC-FID calibration curve:
For quantification with the Flame Ionization Detector a calibration curve has to be taken. Eight samples were prepared in duplo with known amounts of styrene, ranging from 0,5 mmol to 5,0 mmol. The samples were injected into the GC-FID system. The retention time of styrene was 3,741 min, the rt of the internal standard was 4,381 min. From the AUCs the Response Ratios (RR) were calculated and a calibration curve was fitted using linear regression.
The result for overnight grown culture that wasn’t fed extra phenylalanine was negative. The result for culture that was fed phenylalanine gave a miniscule peak at the correct retention time (3,7 minutes) but the AUC fell outside of the calibration curve.
The peak of the phenylalanine fed culture was very small and was therefore not viewed as proof of concept of styrene production. It was decided to grow another culture, also fed with phenylalanine, that would grow for 2 days and would be prepared for GC differently. The used GC protocol was made for e.coli and therefore didn’t account for the existence of the yeast cell wall which could hinder desorption of styrene from the lipid bilayer into the aromatic organic phase. It was therefore altered by adding a mechanical cell lysis step.

It is indicated by higher    energy score of interaction between chimeric HB-EGF/Tar receptor-DiphTox   than that of to HB-EGF natural receptor-DiphTox (Table 4). This means    that the chimeric receptor could bind towards DiphTox as good    (or even better) than the original one.
Beside the cell’s ability to detect toxin, our team also need to ensure    the signaling machine works well. Our team also modelled the interaction    between LuxA dan LuxB (that we fused with CheA). From figure 8 and 9,    we might expect that both proteins are still able to interact normally    after combining them with FRET unit (CheA or CheY protein).

Figure 21. Comparison of In bulk and CAT-Seq measured esterase mutant relative activity         In silico generated Esterase mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and  K227R mutant (lowest activity). The relative activity, extracted from the mean methylation score of each mutant read is compared to in data gathered in standard sized reactions (in bulk).
The relative methylation score (reference nucleotide count) of each mutant read corresponds to the activity of the enzyme it encodes. The higher the activity of the expressed enzyme, the more substrate nucleotides it converts to product nucleotides. Because product and reference nucleotides can both be incorporated into the DNA, lower methylation scores are assigned. The comparison of the results, gathered with CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing method and standard sized reactions kinetic measurements (Figure 21) conclude the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The activity reading, extracted from the DNA sequence correlates with the in kinetic measurement data perfectly. Except for the mutant R509K, the activity of the each Esterase mutant is measured accurately and is assigned to the corresponding DNA sequence. These results prove that CAT-Seq approach enables to screening the activity of million of enzyme variant sequences and accurately assigns the phenotype of each variant to the genotype it arises from.
Ribosome binding site activity sequencing
The constructed Ribosome Binding site library (BBa_B0030, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0034, BBa_K2621038 with a downstream CAT-Seq esterase gene BBa_K2621000) was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information was extracted and sequenced with Nanopore. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different RBS were filtered and extracted.. The activity collected data was normalized to BBa_B0034 data and is shown in Fig. 22.
Figure 22. Comparison of in bulk and CAT-Seq measured ribosome binding site relative strength.        The catalytic activity of esterase gene, regulated by a library of ribosome binding sites was measured using cell free expression system in bulk or CAT-Seq approach and compared side by side. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized BBa_B0034 corresponding to mean strength of 1.

Tell students about syn bio and project
Ask them what concerns and safety consideration they have about project,Qualitative,""The greatest advantages of synthetic biology they discussed can be summarized into four main categories:
The opportunity to improve food production. For example, increasing yield by resistance introduction, drought-resistant crops, and more sustainable production. Production and development of medicines. Both developments of novel, better and cheaper medicines were mentioned, as well as better diagnostics. General, non-specific improvements in current and new industrial processes; faster, easier, more efficient, and economically favorable. Reduced impact on climate, by using synthetic biology for protection of the environment, protect threatened animal species, and improvement of sustainability. However, there were also some concerns, both personal as well as on how they think the wider public will react on synthetic biology. These can be summarized into three categories:
Safety By mutations or combinations of different genes, hazardous microorganisms can be created or formed, like bioweapons, superorganisms, antibiotic resistant bacteria etc. Fear of possible dangers of the end-product made via a GMO-production process. Lot of uncertainties and misunderstandings about safety of GMO-products. Ethics Ethical issues on modification of organisms and transferring genetic material of one species to another. Religion-related ethical issues: interfering with God’s creations. Hard to set boundaries in genetic modification; are we going to modify people in the future? GMO-products are considered artificial/unnatural. Biocontainment The possible negative effect on an ecosystem and lowering biodiversity when GMOs are introduced in nature. Next, the students were informed about our project; making a modular diagnostic kit against tropical diseases. They were stimulated to think about possible problems this can bring into a community where it is applied. Their opinions can be summarized into:
Availability of treatments. After diagnosis, sufficient medicines should be available to treat the diagnosed people. If treatment is not available, resources are insufficient, or the people cannot afford treatment, a diagnosis will not improve the quality of life for these people. Overpopulation in those areas. Lower mortality rate by good diagnostics can result in overpopulation, and possibly more hunger and unemployment problems. A prerequisite that was proposed by several students was sufficient education about the kit itself, and the consequences for one’s life after diagnosis"

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," As a visiting scholar of American Pacific University and Visiting Professor in McCain George School of Law, she provided us with a full-scale perspective of gene technology law in China.
And at the same time we have an interview with Dr. Huang, who is specialize at civil procedural law, and we introduced him some knowledge about synthetic biology and gene therapy to him, which he like it so much that he said he will communicate consult with us if he has some professional questions or he just want to learn more about life science.
Dr. Huang share some case related to reproduction lawsuit. And he told us even though judge finally coped with the problem based on the existing law system, the existing law system needs more development and progress so as to adapt to the pace of the times development.
B. Law and Regulation Actuality in China
What legal achievement has China made in gene technology?
Technical Guidelines for Gene Therapy Research and Preparation Quality Control, the first fundamental technical specification made for gene therapy, was officially promulgated and implemented in 2003 by SFDA and in 2004 its English edition was published in Biopharm International to the whole world.
The regulation of agricultural genetically modified organisms safety and Regulations on the Protection of Wild Plants of the People's Re- public of China is a relatively well-developed regulatory system in gene technology, especially in the field of transgenosis technique.
Human genetic resources management interim measures, a regulation serves as the criterion for the management of human genetic resources, went into effect in 1998. And there are many other regulations that have some statements related to gene technology indirectly.
And some other laws concerning to genetic engineering directly or indirectly like the Seed law, Forest law, Grassland law, Fisheries law and the Agriculture law made by Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, or Ministry of Health play a significant role in protecting the development of gene technology in China nowadays.
legislative shortcomings：
Although China has made a great progress in the gene technology legislation, there still are some legislative shortcomings we need to face. And only if we have a clear understanding about the current situation can conquer these shortcomings.
Firstly, there is not a statute book for gene technology and the regulations are so miscellaneous that it’s not easy to regulate gene technology development systematically and effectively. Secondly, because most regulations like the The regulation of agricultural genetically modified organisms safety and Regulations on the Protection of Wild Plants of the People's Re- public of China are made by the State Council and/or its departments working under it and these regulations are classified into administrative laws and regulations and/or Departmental rules, it’s not so possible for the regulations to"

However, inserting PtcdB and the sgRNAs into the vector proved to be quite troublesome. It was repeatedly tried to insert PtcdB into the vector unfortunately sequencing results would always show mutations or rearrangements (Figure 2). Most likely these mutations can be attributed to the fact that high levels of gusA are toxic to E. coli. This has been previously observed with the promoter library construct Pthl-gusA.
In the original design the sgRNAs would be cloned downstream of the gusA gene. Unfortunately, several attempts to ligate sgRNAs with the vector pMTLdCas9-GusA were unsuccessful. Single digests were carried out and confirmed that the AscI restriction enzyme did not cut the vector (figure 3). Repeating the same digestion with several AscI restriction enzyme stocks did not resolve the problem, indicating that the AscI restriction site has a mutation, this was later confirmed with Sanger sequencing.
Figure 2. Single digestion of pMTL84121 with XhoI or AscI and it is proved that AscI restriction site has a mutation.
Due to the mutated AscI restriction site, a two-vector based approach was adopted. The sgRNAs were successfully cloned into two different vectors: pMTL82251 (erm resistance gene, high copy replicon) and pMTL71401 (kan resistance gene, low copy replicon). Subsequently both the dcas9-gusA vector and one of the sgRNA vectors were co-transformed into E. coli. In addition, the dcas9-gusA vector was co-transformed with the empty pMTL82251 or empty pMTL71401 vector. These strains (Ec and Kc respectively) were used as positive controls in the GusA assay. These controls were created because different antibiotics might impact the growth rate and thus the production of GusA in the various strains. In addition, the difference in copy number between the two vectors might affect the level of repression.
In order to establish the repression efficiency of the various sgRNAs an enzymatic assay was performed. The assay was repeated twice, harvesting the cells at different stages of bacterial growth; exponential and stationary growth phase. Cells at exponential phase were harvested when the cultures reached an OD600 of 1.0 and cells at stationary phase were harvested after overnight growth.
Figure 3. Repression efficiency of sgRNA variants (A1-6) was measured using a β-Glucuronidase activity assay"

In Vivo Characterization
In vivo Main | TetR-RFP System | TetR-LacI-RFP System | Ptet Characterization | Plac Characterization | Plasmid Details
Our overall strategy to develop new transcription factors includes an in vivo characterization of the affinity and specificity of our TetR mutants. To that end, we set up two reporter systems based on RFP fluorescence.
The first reporter system consists of a TetR-RFP cascade. It has been successfully used to characterize some TetR mutants. Our second reporter system is a longer cascade, made up of TetR, LacI and RFP. Whereas in the first system RFP is expressed in the absence of a TetR-Ptet interaction, in the second one, the TetR-Ptet interaction directly induces RFP expression. The affinity of each mutant can be deduced from the RFP expression profile induced in our reporter system. The specificity can be assessed by coupling each mutant to different Ptet sequences.
To set up and characterize our two reporter systems, we assembled several plasmids that are to be co-transformed in order to create the whole system. We also had to characterize the two different promoters we used to control RFP expression: an existing Ptet promoter and a new Plac promoter. It is important to know the intrinsic strength of these promoters in order to be able to properly analyze the data generated by our two reporter systems.

Morphologically, no clear change can yet be detected, but proliferation is clearly inhibited, however not stopped.
Undifferentiated SHSY5Y cells, day 0
After one week the first 1:1 split is executed onto new 6-well plates. After the cells have been removed, all wells are combined and applied to the new plates at the same volume. The incubation time of the trypsin is deliberately kept somewhat shorter than is usual for the conservation culture, because the epithelial like cells are only replaced later due to their epithelial character.  The next day the differentiation medium 2 is used. The amount of tretinoin remains unchanged at 10 µM, while the amount of serum is further reduced to 1%. With the withdrawal of the growth factors, the cells proliferate only sparsely. In this medium they remain only 3 days. Nevertheless, the first changes are clearly visible under the transmitted light microscope. The first real cell extensions form and the differentiation has begun.
First signs of beginning differentiation in SHSY5Y, day 10
On the tenth day, the cells are split again 1:1, but this time only incubated at room temperature in order to strain the cells with their fragile cell runners as little as possible. The cells are then applied to 24-well plates coated with 12 µg human fibronectin. The fibronectin was blocked with BSA so that the applied cells did not bind unspecifically. Since the differentiated SHSY5Y also lose the robustness of tumour cells as differentiation progresses, they also need more anchoring and support so that the cell-cell connections that are supposed to form are not damaged during handling or no connections are formed in the first place.
On the following day, medium 3 is switched to differentiation. Its basis is no longer EMEM, but neurobasal. The serum content is now completely reduced, instead various neural factors are now contained. Important are dibuturyl cAMP, which acts as a cAMP analogue in intracellular metabolic pathways, and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which in experiments1 already has a significant influence on neurogenesis and the formation and protection of synapses. Supplement B-27 plays a protective role as a radical scavenger.
The following days the cells are kept on the coated plates and differentiation medium 3, with medium changing every 3 days.

Figure 1: Different kinds of log-domain analog computation.
Due to the fact that our circuits can generate a steady oscillation, it is possible that using our circuits as a sinusoidal signal generator.
Signal generators, such as function generator (including sinusoidal signal generator), are electronic devices that generate repeating or non-repeating electronic signals. As an important part of basic circuit studies, they are generally used in designing, testing, troubleshooting, and repairing electronic or electroacoustic devices.
What's more, Li Guang-bi from TUST reported that they have constructed two kinds of electronic circuits which well simulated the gene oscillator. This indicates that our circuit can develop to a new kind of gene sinusoidal signal generator[8].
Figure 2.This picture shows a kind of electronic circuit generating the oscillation wave.
Figure 3.This graph shows the generated oscillation wave.
Future Version Trilogy
We blueprint our next step developing oscillatory gene circuits in following steps:
Step One
Complete our project by cleaning every obstacle on our way to oscillation.
Confirm that every part is functioning as expected;
Amplify the effect of different copy numbers;
Complete the comparison of different strains' effect on oscillation;
Complete the comparison of different EGFP & sfGFP effect on oscillation;
Confirm most suitable microfluidic parameters for oscillation;
Optimize our model
Step Two
We will make our oscillation a controllable one by integrating the catalase gene into the circuit.
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen. It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since our lab is studying Shewanella oneidensis, and its catalase protein has showed outstanding performance in catalyzing H2O2. So we thought we could integrate the catalase gene into our circuit and under an artificial inducible promoter, by which we can decide when to start this catalase gene and stop the oscillation.
Step Three
Realize everything we imagined in APPLICATION!
Make our circuit function as biosensor, cancer cell killer and gene sinusoidal signal generator.

Update: I was able to get the Hibernate connection to work!! Successfully created a table, and then added two entries using a class.  I admit, I used the help on an online tutorial , but there was a lot of self-teaching involved.  Now I just need to figure out if Swapnil wants this to be a part of Clotho or independent, or if it's just an intermediate issue to understanding connections, etc.

BU iGEM Computational Meeting #2
Swapnil tasked me with a new configuration window/setup that he would like me to implement.
Stack Configurations:
uses the Puppeteer Stack image
has an associated field to run a command-line per layer within the stack
has a sequencing option that lets the user choose when to run a sequence
should be attached to a config file that can easily be modified, etc. (not implemented yet)
has a tabbedpane status/output window for debugging, etc.
need to figure out how to incorporate user input for Viktor's python script
[6/30/2011]
Stack Configuration is mostly complete.  It has fully-functional checkboxes, along with a load/save configuration option. Most of these features will need to be expanded on, but for now they will suffice.

Just set up a query function to properly retrieve entries from my localhost MySQL database.  Using this setup, it shouldn't take too long to set up a nice interface within ResourceManager to properly communicate with the eventual MySQL Puppeteer database.
I will start a wiki-documentation on how to properly set up HCL/POJO to talk to a MySQL database within Netbeans soon enough.
Update: Added close-tab feature to Stack Configuration output/error window; screenshot will be uploaded soon.
[7/4/2011]
Compiled (what I assume to be the correct) sequence video of video clips from the first successful restriction digest test via the Tecan robot and Puppeteer.  Hopefully I will have enough spare time to trim this video (~27mins long) and produce a nice video.

Annotation of vector with Vector NTI (Register and we can save our data)
Some advice
Working with the Registry:
the wells (spots) have parts, there is a picture of it run on a gel, and there is a verification with antibiotic plates
When we test parts out, use color coding on plates for different antibiotics
Should we use 96 well plates for high throughput screening of parts?
Decide input and output of project
Make plasmid biobrick compatible (we should make every part a biobrick, this way we can mix and match parts on a plasmid as needed)**don’t get left with one huge part that does not function the way we want it to, then start from zero.
Presentations:
Norman: the big idea behind using BioBricks (MIT teaching the teach notes). Biobrick assembly, parts category (RBS, Regulatory, DNA, RNA, Protein Coding, Terminators, {skipped conjugation}) Meeting Slides (PDF)
Margaret: devices
Krystle: chassis & plasmids
Action
Krystle
read up on RSF1010 make proposal for plasmid project (post ASAP)
Norman

Shopping
Margaret
finish the annotation and figure out the functions of the components
Begin proposal on the plasmid, what do we want to keep, we can delete stuff we don’t need using PCR, learn how to design primers that can delete and make biobricks
Everybody
Prepare proposal for part B (the idea you are championing)
Biobricks come on plasmids, so we need to get transformation down

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," problems due to the superimposition of the commons and the patent models. It also highlighted the global lack of knowledge of the iGEMers upon the intellectual property rights, which shows the necessity of informing about this particular topic. We sincerely hope we have helped to do so.
Part III: Scientific popularization
Introduction
A lot of stereotypes and pieces of information circulate on sciences, so that we can sometimes find it hard to know where the truth is hidden. The public may sometimes look for a reliable source to make its own opinion. We are convinced that we have a role to play and have decided to involve ourselves in the researchers' night which is a european scientific popularization event.
More about the researchers'night
Since 7 years, this event has been taking place on a single September night in about 300 cities all over Europe. The main goal of this night is to put researchers in touch with the public. Thus, they can explain what they are doing, how and what can be the applications in the day-to-day life.
This year, the theme was ""Imagine the future"": what future will emerge from research laboratories? How do scientists imagine the future? Archeology, Physics, Philosophy, Biosciences or Linguistic: researchers shared their lab experiences and thoughts on the future. Therefore, in order to defend a controversial discipline, Synthetic Biology (a.k.a. SynBio), the Lyon-INSA team members participated in the Researchers’ Night, which was held on September 28th, 2012, at the CCO of Villeurbanne.
Indeed, an article published by a French team: “Séralini et al., Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize, Food and Chemical Toxicology, Volume 50, Issue 11, November 2012, Pages 4221–4231” and also in the paper “Le Monde” on September 25th, 2012, on deleterious effect of transgenic maize on rats, had a dramatic effect on the public opinion in Europe. Thus, to illustrate that SynBio can be used to improve the environment, health and life of people, we decided to explain the potential of SynBio and to exchange with the public through a scientific speed-dating and around a table containing diagrams and Petri dishes.
“What is it?” asked a little boy. “What are you doing?” asked a woman. We could introduce them to our friends: bacteria! Then, one of the iGEM team members answered: “Bacteria are little organisms which grow, eat"

3. Add 200uL bacterial samples from each centrifuge tube to the 96-well plate. Set two copies for each centrifuge tub as repetitions.
4. Read the OD600 and fluorescent intensity (with the emission wavelength at 607nM and excitation wavelength at 584nM) using a multifunctional microplate reader.
5. Divided the fluorescent intensity result using the value of OD600. Record the data for compare and analysis.
Result and discussion
Figure 2.1: Promoter test of PpcoA promoting induced by Cu2+. We can find that the promoting ability of PpcoA arises according to the concentration raise of Cu2+. This preliminary data was performed under the help from HZUA-China team.
Experiment Procedure
1. Cultivate bacterial samples overnight in the 37°C and set the rotational speed at 200 rpm/min.
2. Add 5mL LB culture medium, 5uL Kanamycin (50mg/L) and 100uL bacterial liquid from step 1 to a 20mL culture flask. Cultivate in the 37°C shaking incubator at the rotational speed of 200 rpm/min. When the OD600 is 0.5 to 0.8, add copper ions in different concentration. Set two copies for each concentration as repetitions. Cultivate in the 37°C shaking incubator at the rotational speed of 200 rpm/min for 3~4 hours.
3. Add 100uL bacterial samples from the culture flask to a 96-well plate. Set three copies for each culture flask as repetitions. Meanwhile, add LB culture medium containing and not containing CuSO4 as blank controls.
4. Read the OD600 and fluorescent intensity (with the emission wavelength at 607nM and excitation wavelength at 584nM) using a multifunctional microplate reader.
5. Divided the fluorescent intensity result using the value of OD600. Record the data for compare and analysis.
Result and discussion
Figure 2.2: Promoter test of PpcoA promoting induced by Cu2+. In our teams experiment, we optimized the experiment procedure based on preliminary test and we can find that the relative fluorescent intensity increases obviously with the increase of the concentration of copper ions, which indicates that the transcriptional rate is positively correlated to the concentration of copper ions.
The experimental result was in line with our expectations, so that we can ensure the circuit working normally.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," similar solutions. The disadvantages of spheroid cell cultures are the irregular arrangement of the cells, so that the final tissue structure cannot be actively controlled. Furthermore, it is only possible to use a single cell type, whereas the 3D printing method allows us to mix different cell types.
Fig. 5: Our main competitors technology is based on the hydrogel technology which might have drawbacks compared to our scaffold-free bioprinting technology.
Finally, we focus on Organovo Holdings Inc., which is a US-based company and considered our most direct competitor. Organovo’s technology is also based on a 3D printer yet uses a hydrogel to stabilize the cells which must be removed with acid in the end of the manufacturing process, which harms the cells. Based on our interviews at the Analytica, the whole process Organovo utilizes is slow and error prone. Therefore, here is much room for improvement.
5. Marketing and Sales
Our users are our customers, the pharmaceutical companies who buy and use our product. We sell it to them directly for using it in drug discovery. However, our customer is not only our user, but also our partner. Starting with one customer, they are our strategic partner. In the beginning, we are fully dependent on their orders because we start with one customer only. The most demanding actors in this market are the legal authorities like the EMA (European Medicines Agency) or the FDA (Food & Drug Administration), which are both responsible for every new drug that is delivered to and spread in the market. Since we only have one customer we sell to directly, our plan is to build our laboratory near, if not inside, their site of work to lower the costs of logistics like shipping in the beginning.
Essential for our market entry is the cooperation with one pharmaceutical company that implements our models into their process. In the course of our interviews, we obtained our potential first customer: company B, which conducts the first stage of research (2D cell culture & animal testing) for the drug discovery of other pharmaceutical firms. We see company B as our pilot customer to obtain firsthand experience and results that we can develop further. After the first fine-tuning, our customer acquisition costs are participation fees for large conferences or fairs to spread the word of our product. Furthermore, legal authorities completing standard conditions not only for laboratories but also the product itself entails high costs to convince potential customers that our product is safe and approved by, for example, the EMA (European Medicines Agency). This approval is granted after a sequence of studies and results of research.
In the context of pricing, we would like to"

Notes:
Do not use a sample of linearized plasmid backbones (PCRed) as a template
The Registry uses BBa_J04450 as a template

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," knowing what your aim is. In synthetic biology, a very concrete example (one I did a lot of litterature on), is the CRISPR/Cas system. People knew what it was, it was hype, it was fency, it was new, but we had no clue what to do with it. So people started to inactivate specific parts of the enzyme and figured out you could silence genes. That’s super cool! Then one guy coupled the protein to a polymerase and notice you could ACTIVATE any gene in the genome. And this still goes on as I’m writing this paragraph. People with a purpose in their research may use these technique and refer to the right person who is an expert in the matter. In fact, to me, he’s an artist, exactly like you ask an architect to build you something how you want it because you saw it this way once.
The question “Does the end justify the means?” is central throughout the history of philosophy. Asking: “why are we doing that?” and “is it good to do that?”, is the origin of moral philosophy, ethics and bioethics. The Nuremberg Code (1947 1 ), that states that science does not allow anything to do in its name, marks the true beginning of contemporary medical ethics. But now the trickiest part remains: we have to constantly evaluate what we are doing and if it is justified or not to achieve our goal. With modern technique, a new question has arised: do the means justify the end? With the exponential development of new technologies, in particular that of biotechnologies, we start searching what we could do with these techniques. Innovations are no more related to needs.
Team discussion
I agree: The further technique gets, the more things we have to learn to master it. Then, technique eventually reaches a point where classic education is not enough to understand every subtility of the technique. At this precise moment, people would start to specialize, use tools and learning shortcuts, thus not always fully understanding the means nor the end, and “become the means for technique to achieve itself”.
Some philosophers, in particular in the Frankfurt School, claimed that this reversal was a major source of disasters 2 .For them this way of thinking is extremely dangerous because it is exclusively rational. Everything is a potential tool, which leads the world to its own complete instrumentalization: it means that the world, and hence human beings too, is (and are) perceived as means and no more also as an end. This is the core of the technical alienation theory: technique (op"

The running of the study
To analyse the timing of plasmid expression in the DU-145 cell line, we realized a kinetic monitoring of the apoptosis induction by making an annexin V assay every 6 hours for 48 hours after the plasmid electroporation. By coupling apoptosis rate of the population control (blank electroporation) and the population assay (electroporation with plasmid) with their respective growth rate, we will be able to determine the p53wt impact on apoptosis induction. We use a control without the plasmid pcDNA3 CMV+p53wt to quatify the level of death cells causes by the electroporation and by the culture transfert.
Because we had not a continuous access to the cytometer, we grouped the all 48h analyses in 2 cytometry runs. Each time slot of the study is represented by a distinct cell population. So, we realized 14 electroporations corresponding to the 7 time slots: +6h, +12h, +18h, +24h, +30h, +36h and +48h (two by slot: population assay+ population control).
Here is the allocation planning of electroporations:
Three cell populations were respectively electropored 12h, 24h et 36h before the first cytometry run (in red, at 9 a.m, day 3), four others 6h, 18h, 30h and 48h before the second run (in green, at 4 p.m, day 3).
The first cytometric analyze allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +12h, +24h and +36h, while the second one, allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +6h, 18h, +30h and +48h.
By coupling all these data, we obtain a monitoring on 48h of the apoptosis induction after p53wt electroporation.

SUIS_Shanghai,2018,Team:SUIS Shanghai#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," knowing where and when to use engineering and design in their curriculum, we developed a tool called “Biodesign Launchpad” that educators can use to filter through their curriculum student learning objectives per topic and learn of which objectives that can use our lesson plans or indeed begin to design their own incorporated engineering and design lessons.  We sincerely hope that this project could be a long-term approach to help the iGEM foundation advance synthetic biology education. Our team, along with our school organization, would like to continue to further develop this toolkit and research for the foreseeable future.
Use of Social Media
Our team also engaged our local community about our project and its relevance to their lives and China’s future green economy. It is well known that China is entering a new age, where environmental issues are more to the fore and the general public are becoming increasingly aware of sustainability and each individuals role in the global community with respects to preserving our natural resources and environment for the next generation. Through our research we found that China is well placed for exploiting the abundant opportunities that exist in sustainable microalgae culturing. Furthermore we learned that the health food product market is growing rapidly in China, driven by the demand of infant formula and supplements for elderly, but that the general public are not aware of the impact products like that can have on global fish stocks or that they can use algae as a safe and renewable source.
We hoped to make more people aware of this by utilizing our very large educational organization to reach a vast audience in Shanghai. Chinese social media outlets attached to our school campus and central organization were utilized to push our articles about iGEM, synthetic biology, microalgae and sustainability.  By working hand in hand with our school and central organization leaders as well as the media team employed by our school, we were able to post multiple articles through the course of our studies. We feel it was very successful, with an average “viewings” of over 1,500 for each article from wechat alone. We are continuing to work with our organization to ensure we will continue to have an outlet for the advancement of synthetic biology education and help engage the public in these important issues in sustainability.

An Investigation into the Potential Risks and Limitations of Genetic Kill Switches
In our project, we have designed a programmable genetic system that allows the gene expressed in E. coli to change after every generation. Further applying the system, we can potentially create a genetic system that can kill the host cell after a desired number of divisions. In order to better design our genetic kill switch as well as to be aware of the potential problems of our kill switch applied in the environment, in this section of the human practices, we have investigated and evaluated the potential risk and limitations of genetic kill switches.  The detailed design of the kill switch application is described in the applications page.
The principal problem on the release of genetically modified organism (GMO) is associated with the preservation of biodiversity as is mentioned in Cartagena Protocol. This time we designed a programmable genetical system which works on E. coli and can kill the host cell after any times of division. Our project introduces the possibility to consistently solute the problem; utilizing the advantage of genetical modulation with few damage on environment. To put this idea into practice, we must discuss about possible risks on handling GM microorganisms with our kill switch system in natural environment.
There are several lethal gene known to kill E. coli by internal expression. Kill switch utilizes such lethal genes for killing the host cell on desired condition. If E. coli naively express lethal gene without control, it wouldn’t be a useful tool. With our kill switch system, it is possible to ensure sufficient time before expressing lethal gene. For example, we can actuate kill switch after 105 generations by inserting 3-, 5- ,and 7-generational loop system (as 105 is a multiple of 3, 5, and 7). Beneficially, E. coli with such kill systems dies endogenously without any chemical or other external stimuli.
Let’s consider the effect to the environment when we release the GM bacteria, which are triggered kill switches after 105 generations, to decontaminate the environment.
If we release the bacteria to the polluted soil, they would rapidly degrade the pollutant using their efficient enzymes acquired from genetic engineering. Every cell division means the step to their death. They could neutralize enormous amount of pollutant by the moment when the"

Also, both of participants are studying on engineering; especially Swedish ones. (Probably, Turkey is facing GMO foods much more than Sweden. So, it leads to having more people who are studying in different areas heard GMO at least once.)
Almost all the participants from Turkey and Sweden know what GMO stands for, Turkish population get to know this abbreviation from TV news mostly.
Interestingly, Swedish participants have a positive opinion about GMO, while Turkish participants have negative opinion on GMO. Actually it may be related with the education level in Turkey and also advertisements about GMO. Most of the Turkish people do not know that insulin also includes GMO idea while it is really useful for example. And this lack of knowledge that GMO’s help us in the field of medicine is stem from education problems in Turkey. They mostly know the GMO in foods and they think GMO products leads to cancer so they think GMO is a really bad thing which makes most of the people cancer.
Swedish participants mostly use education as a source of information on GMO, while Turkish participants are using scientific publications. So, it may be related with the education system differences between these two countries.  Turkish education system is not that good as Swedish one, so people must search for scientific publication to get to know more about GMO in Turkey.
Also, most Swedish participants think that these information sources on GMO are sufficient, while Turkish participants think similar but not that much as Swedish participants. It may be related with the question above. Swedish people are educated already about GMO but Turks are not so they do not think the information that they gained from scientific publications are as sufficient as Swedish people.
Economy of Turkey depends on agriculture substantially so interference of agricultural field engage attention of citizens. According to Turkish participants, GMO is quite similar as hormone-injected food and it causes unnatural diseases that are based on chemicals. Thus, Turkish participants might think that Fruit juice may have lots of GMO products. Also almost all Turkish ones prefer to label GMO product because of that reason. GMO production is not included in the Turkish education system. Maybe this issue should be given more space in textbooks.

Bacteria were cultured at 37C with aeration and RK13 cells were cultured at 37C in 5.0% CO2. Appropriate antibiotics were added according to the resistance marker on each plasmid (25 ug/mL of chloramphenicol and 15 ug/mL of tetracycline).

Model for control of effector translocation by the SPI-2 T3SS. (i) Following uptake into host cells, acidification of the vacuole lumen induces assembly of 9 the  secretion apparatus.  (ii) Membrane-associated SsaL/SsaM/SsaB (Fig.3)  regulatory complex  (in purple, black  and blue,  respectively) prevents premature  secretion of  effectors  (in brown). Translocon proteins (in green), connected to the T3SS apparatus, form a pore in the vacuolar membrane.  (iii) The pore enables a component(s) of  the T3SS  to sense  the elevated pH of the  host  cell  cytosol,  and  a  signal  is  transduced  to  the  SsaL/SsaM/SsaB  complex, which dissociates. (iv) Relief of effector secretion suppression enables their translocation [10] .
   As mentioned before the T3SS encoded in SPI-2 naturally function inside of the phagosome of the target cell [8] . So, it requires acidic pH to be assembled functionally [7] . However, if the T3 apparatus is assembled successfully under low pH(pH=5.0) condition, only the translocator proteins are secreted through T3SS but effector proteins are not. And it was reported in 2010 that the translocator complex assembles a pore on the phagosome membrane of the host cell enabling the T3SS to sense the neutral pH condition of the cytosol, and this pH elevation switches the function of the T3SS to start secretion of effectors (Fig.6) ["

With the presence of extracellular Gln, membrane amino acid antiporter GadC[16] could transport Gln into the cell, and glutaminase A can transform Gln and water into Glu and ammonium(Figure 1.). Gaseous ammonium will consume H+ proton and increase intracellular pH, while Glu can anticipate in decarboxylation process led by decarboxylases GadA(链接), and the latter process will also consume H+ proton. More details about GadA wil be discussed in fine-regulation subsystem(做链接).
Design
Our project chose glsA as function gene for acid-resistance device which can regulate intracellular environment and protect E.coli from extreme acidic environment(Figure 2.). J23119 is a constitutive promoter and control transcription of glsA. When environment become acidic, GlsA will be activated and function with the anticipation of glutamine(Gln). When environmental pH return neutral, activity of GlsA will be repressed[18].
Experiment Results
Construction of standard part
We constructed J23119 promoter, B0034 with function gene glsA standard part on plasmid PSB1C3. J23119 promoter and B0034 sequences were gained from iGEM Registry.
We firstly applied PCR to clone glsA gene from genome of K12 strain. As J23119 promoter and B0034 are short(small) fragments, we straightly designed these sequences on upstream primer. And we designed SpeI and PstI restriction enzyme cutting sites on downstream primer for further experiments. Then, because EcoRI and Xba restriction sites are too long for upstream primer, we needed to perform a second time PCR. This time, EcoRI and Xba restriction sites were designed on upstream primer. Eventually, J23119+B0034+glsA with four restriction sites were inserted into PSB1C3 plasmid.
cPCR was performed to verify whether these sequences were successfully inserted into plasmid. Figure 2. shows that No.10 and No.13 were ideal results. We cultivated these two bacterial colony, preserved these bacterium and extracted plasmid. The final step is to record the base sequence and compare with standard sequences.

Not only it inhibited the cell growth but it started out with a negative growth, until the cells stabilized themselves and grew a little. This concentration we then set as our far maximum concentration for tocopherol presence in the growth medium.
With the intent of confirmation that a single result was not a fluke and that tocopherol is indeed toxic in higher concentrations, we over exaggerated a few values as it follows: 250uL, 300uL, 400uL, 500uL and 1000uL. These values are transcribed into mol/L in the graphics.

This time the situation is much more critic. All relative cell growth were absolutely negative. In this trial, the 0.11M test did not end up growing, like the previous one. This can be considered normal, having in mind that both tests showed starting negative growth, but the latter one probably was not able to deal with the elevated concentration as well and ended up having a final negative growth.
It is also noteworthy that all curves have a similar pattern. It starts with a huge negative growth, then, the cells seem to start growing until they stumble and fall again. All curves, even if very small, had a resistance glimpse in the hours 3 and 4. This might indicate the cell's ability to deal with the exogenous susbstance, but inevitably failing to do so. This first graphic may also show a success of this theory, by having the 250uL sample to end up growing.
Just like tocopherol we needed to determine viable concentrations of oleic acid to be added into the medium, so we started with that quantities we found on Okai, et.al., which were relatively small and would easily dissolve in our medium, so were directly added. They were: 0uL, 0.5uL, 1uL, 1.5uL, 2uL and 3uL.

The graphic shows very similar relative cell growth and does not have any specific order for the relations of concentration to higher curves. The only exception noted is the 0.00032M sample, whereas it had a significantly increased growth rate. We can also note the control sample being the one with the lowest growth rate. This reflects the usage of the oleic acid by the cell's metabolism, therefore, the samples with the presence of oil had a bigger"
