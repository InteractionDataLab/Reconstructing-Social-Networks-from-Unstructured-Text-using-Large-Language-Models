1. How warriors kill enemies:
    AHL1 in warrior I excretes AHL1. AHL1 goes into its enemies and forms a complex with the protein AHL1R. This complex activates the promoter Pahl1, thus activating the expression of LacI. The expression of LacI inhibits the promoter Plac, thus inhibiting the expression of cmR. Because we culture our E. coli in medium containing chloramphenicol, warrior I kills its enemies. As AHL1 does not form a complex with protein AHL2R inside E. coli from warrior I’s group, thus we fulfill our desire that warrior I just kill the enemies but not bacteria from it own group. Warrior Il works in a similar way.
2. How farmers provide nutrients:
    RafD encodes invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose. The signal peptide of HlyA ligated to RafD can help the invertase be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence. This is our new part. Besides, combining with extrinsic HlyB, HlyD and intrinsic TolC from the nucleoid in E. coli together form the transporter which helps the invertase to be secreted.
    This whole part is designed to produce a secretory invertase. As our E. coli can use glucose but not sucrose as its carbon source, farmers fulfill the role of providing nutrients.
    However, from our Orthogonality"

The Model
We model the behaviour of our system with 6 differential equations. The first two are concerned with the production of protein cI, which represses killing. The next two tells us the production of restriction enzymes. Equation (5) describes the cell population, while equation (6) tells us the total number of dead cells. This will allow us to relate our model to the live and dead cells assay performed.
In this model, the effects of Dam methylase are not included.

SCUT,2015,Team:SCUT-China#hospitalInterview_-_-_TEXT.html," more negative concerns and doubts, but we still don’t give up and try our best to achieve our dream, because your project is not only your own research but also the one that connects the people in need, surroundings and even the world who care about your project. It may really ease patients’ pain, relief the burdens of medical staff, and make a little difference to the world.
That is enough for us to be excited and encouraged.
A.Interview Reports (With Medical Staff)
(We are at Cardiology Unit2 )
a.Interview Summary of Doctors
According to our findings, medical staff in basic hospitals of small towns are not familiar with synthetic biology, let alone gene therapy, because of lack of higher medical education and research.
However, after we came to the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, a super major hospital in Guangzhou and had dialogues with Dr. Guo, a young and outstanding woman, twice, we realized that there was a long way to go to put our innovative idea and method into clinical research. She thinks our project has a significant meaning and can be a challenging project to try. She really hopes that we can make some differences to the current cardiovascular therapies.
To tell the details, she says that although modern medicine has a variety of methods and a large armory of drugs for the treatment of myocardial ischemia, there still remains some technical bottlenecks that are difficult to break. For instance, for patients with multiple coronary stegnotic lesions or disease in multiple vessels, percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical coronary revascularization procedures cannot cure the disease and often end with repeated procedures. Although the intervention is minimally invasive compared with the surgery, it has many limitations and cannot replace the surgical operation. It actually depends on placing a stent on the stegnotic position like the surgery. The surgery is more risky and it also cannot cure the disease. Its effect usually keeps at most 10 years, which has only 60% possibilities. Patients have to take more medicines after the stents don’t work. While if we use lentiviral vectors as a tool to deliver the packaged target gene into the cardiovascular tissues cells may provide a relatively permanent mechanism to regulate NO-sGC-cGMP pathway so that it may cure the disease to a certain extend. More significant, it can be considered as a prototype of gene therapy. And it provides a new idea based on synthetic biology for researchers who are trying to break the difficulty, a proud hope for those who are struggling mightily, stubbornly doing battle with the disease even the fate every day.
She suggests that"

Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

Selecting Genes
In designing our minimal nif cluster plasmids, we considered each of the 23 genes on the PSL2397 nif plasmid, derived from Cyanotdece 51142, and selected 14 tdat we believe may be essential for nitrogenase activity.
We used literature on the creation of other minimal nif clusters and took into account a few factors:
function of the gene, if established
homology with genes in other minimal nif clusters
homology with genes in E. Coli’s genome

Munich sent us their system and we printed the additional parts on our own. This is exactly how they imagine their system. We tested it and gave them feedback on their design and possible challenges, so they can improve their design. For us it was useful to test the multi purpose of our robot and how easy it is to add new parts and features. Also the syringe pump design is different and we had a good chance to evaluate our design and compare it to the one of Munich. We derived useful information within this collaboration and are interested in working closer together in the technical part of the iGEM project. Especially if Munich decides to go on focusing on the do-it-yourself sector, Darmstadt is the right team to talk to! We like to thank the iGEM team of Munich for this opportunity and wish them success with their project. Keep on working!
Collaboration with iGEM Düsseldorf
When we heard about iGEM team Düsseldorf’s collaboration idea, we knew right away that we wanted to be a part of it. As we have mentioned and experienced in our human practices approach as well, the synthetic biology’s reputation in many parts of the german society is not too good. By participating in this project, we wanted to try to change this together with the other german iGEM Teams. The postcards were supposed to have a nice and appealing picture in the front, which moreover fits the respective team’s project. On the back of the postcards, a short text should inform the reader about one small part among the field of synthetic biology.
First of all, we had a lot of fun designing our postcards and doing the photoshoot for it. On our postcard, we wrote about the opportunity of producing medications in a cheaper and more sustainable manner.
A great part of this collaboration was receiving the other teams’ postcards. It was the highlight of our day each time!  After we received all the different postcards, we allocated them all over Darmstadt and our university. We gave them to people or just left them on the tables of our students’ café so that students could look at them while having a cup of coffee. By doing so, the public is informed about the possibilities of synthetic biology in a nice and subtle way.
So thanks to all the iGEM teams that participated in this great project! And of course a huge thanks to the iGEM Team of Düsseldorf ! You have done a great job in creating and initiating this project.

Growth curve of yeast in blood serum
In order to certify the feasibility of yeast maintaining its previous cell activity while reacting with histamine in blood serum, rather than become incompetent or being precipitated by antigens such as IgG in the environment, we carried out a series of experiment by culturing modified yeast in different ratio of blood serum. The ability of proliferation as well as cell activity are revealed by determination of growth curve in different groups.
One thing worth mentioning is that the blood serum (BS) we use is derived from mice with no immunogenicity. After extracted from mice, the product simply went through the procedure of precipitation and bottled without heat inactivation. Control group was set by filter sterilized half of the blood serum (FBS) to remove large protein and potential bacteria (. This procedure aims to judge whether the complement protein would influence the growth of yeast.
The experiment is designed as follows.
Table 3. The sample loading form
Due to the fact that normally yeast would enter logarithmic growth phase in 4 to 8 hours, we choose 1~7 h as the 1st stage measure point and 18~19h as the 2nd stage measure point to judge whether the yeast has entered plateau phase. The density of yeast is measured by OD600.
Fig.9 The growth curve of yeast cultured in YPD
E: 10% BS+YPD  F: 10% FBS+YPD  I: 1% BS+YPD  J: 1% FBS+YPD
As can be seen from Fig.9, the addition of blood serum didn’t influence the growth of yeast significantly.
Fig.10 The growth curve of yeast cultured in water
C: 10% BS+ water  D: 10% FBS+ water  G: 1% BS+ water  H: 1% FBS+ water
On the contrast, the addition of blood serum did enhance the proliferation of yeast when comparing the curve of H and G with C and D. What’s more, comparing the curve of adding the original blood serum or sterilized one, we can see that the original blood help yeast to grow better without any precipitation.
Fig.11 The growth curve of yeast cultured in pure blood serum
A: 100% BS  B: 100% FBS
Compared the curve of original blood serum culturing and the sterilized one, it is obvious that the yeast cultured in original product outgrew the sterilized group in the first few hours. Though the two group reach the same"

Neptune: Accessible microfluidics for all
In our Silver Medal Human Practices page, we outlined our public outreach and industry visits. These experiences drew our team to focus on accessibility in synthetic biology as a theme moving forward with our human practice contributions. For Silver HP, we contributed a set of informational blog posts on the history of intellectual property, and IP in software and in synthetic biology today. We welcome you to read these at our WordPress site.
WORDPRESS BLOG
Moving forward with the development of Neptune, we decided that we would extend our silver medal HP theme of accessibility in synthetic biology. Indeed, we were developing a complete, end-to-end microfluidic development workflow. Having seen how inaccessible and prohibitively costly microfluidics are for researchers, and also having studied the virtues of open source tools for synthetic biology, we decided to integrate accessibility into our implementation of Neptune.
In this page, we cover 3 ways in which we expand on and integrate the theme of accessibility to our final product, Neptune.
we made it a project criteria that Neptune must interface with low cost, open and readily available tools and hardware to create microfluidics
we partnered with the NONA Research Foundation, an organization dedicated to increasing access, collaboration, and building a community around synthetic biology software tools
we offer our team as a point of contact to other iGEM teams that have created software solutions and would like to have these tools protected and stored on NONA
Neptune: Low cost, easy to use, accessible
As we developed Neptune, we were faced with design choices that would have a large impact on how our workflow integrates with the synthetic biology community. In light of our Silver HP discoveries, we decided the most important design choice would be to make our workflow accessible to all: we want a workflow so easy to use that researchers in synthetic biology will be excited to make microfluidic chips. We want a workflow that interfaces with fabrication protocols that are low"

INTRODUCTION
A core principle of the Biobrick foundation is to bring standardisation in a field that is constantly changing and evolving. Standardising biological parts and their assembly allows for projects to focus less on assembly of genetic constructs and more   on design and testing.
LovTAP is a DNA binding fusion protein between a Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV2) domain from Avena sativa and tryptophan repressor (TrpR) common in E. coli developed and improved in 2008[1],[2]. The LovTAP fusion protein was initially submitted to   the registry by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne 2009 iGEM team[3]. The LovTAP fusion protein acts as a photoswitch allowing selective DNA binding through the TrpR domain regulated by the asLOV2 domain. The asLOV2 domain sensitive to photoexitation   at 470 nm exists in two conformational; a dark state and light state. Photoexcitation at 470 nm of the LOV domain results in the conformational change of the trpR domain allowing DNA binding, DNA disassociation occurs when the LOV domain returns to   the inactive dark state causing the conformation to revert.
IMPROVEMENTS
The original Biobrick BBa_K191006 is only compatible with a single assembly method (RFC 21), limiting availability on the registry and hence hindering further future work. Redesigning   of the original brick and optimising the coding sequence for the iGEM registry would result in extended compatibility, facilitating future work and characterisation. Our aim is to create a variation"

June
Week 1
Looked at the correlations of the different parameters in the system. This was done to see which parameter has the biggest influence on the system and which parameters could be changed to create subpopulations. I also fixed bugs in the system with help of Ronald.
Week 2
With changing the parameters with the biggest correlation, different populations can be generated. The LuxR production rate is changed to do so. However, this does not correlate to reality yet. Subpopulations are simulated, but further research is needed to create a system that can be tested in the lab.

Week 3
Expand the old quorum sensing model to 100,000 parameter sets. This needed to run on the server because it took too long on a single computer. The server did not save the work properly it needed to be done a few times. So it took a full week to get results.
Week 4
Make the subpopulation system, write the equations and try to get the best parameter sets by searching for a statistical method that does so 7 . For the quorum sensing system.  look at the quorum sensing system with and without feedback.
August
Week 1
Test changes in highest parameter from the quorum sensing system to see if there is a change in GFP production. This is done for both systems with and without negative feedback.
Week 2
Set up the subpopulation system and run it with a few parameter sets. When it worked I changed the concentrations in arabinose and glucose in the system. Had some bugs with putting different arabinose and glucose concentrations in the system. Remco helped me solve this.
Week 3
To set up a normal distribution for the quorum sensing part different methods are tried. fixing bugs when making the normal distributions. Plot the amount of GFP vs time. The subpopulation system ran on the server for a couple of days with 100,000 parameter sets. There is searched for the parameter set with the highest RFP, and also for the set with the lowest RFP.

ETH_Zurich,2016,Team:ETH Zurich#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," srongly depends on the $DEsaR_{AHL}$ / $AHL$ ratio, and displays an unexpected not so repressive behavior for a specific range of EsaR production rate.
Nevertheless, a careful analysis of the system based on estimated paramters from the data, demonstrate that this EsaR repression problem can be solved by changing the constitutive promoter preceding the EsaR gene.
For further details, do not hesitate to consults our AHL sensor model page .
Conclusion
After careful evaluation, we picked one variant to be the main AND gate of our system. After tuning the EsaR concentration, this AND gate demonstrated the                 best behaviour within the range of AHL and NO concentrations we wanted to detect. Below you can see a surface plot (Figure 6) generated through experimental data (black dots) and interpolation (surface). This describes the AND gate behaviour before tuning EsaR concentrations. Figure 7 shows that after tuning the AND gate responds to ranges indicated by the white dashes on the surface plot (Figure 6), which marks the desired area.
We have a collection of AND gates characterised experimentally and with a detailed model that could be used by future     iGEM teams.

Our first visit to the hospital was to the outpatient clinic during which we spoke with Jan Harris, one of the nurses on the ward. Jan explained to us the current treatment of UTIs. The protocol for treatment is to first take a urine sample to test for the presence of bacterial colonies. If the dip test comes back as positive, the patient is treated with a wide spectrum antibiotic, after which an antibiotic treatment specific to the type of bacteria identified may be given. Whether or not a catheter is fitted with prophylactic antibiotic treatment is the doctor’s decision.
Up to this point, we weren’t fully aware of the potential seriousness of UTIs. Jan told us about a case of a person getting septicaemia as a result of a UTI. The patient had received antibiotics for seven days and had come back for a check up. Their urine sample was clear and but, despite this, the patient rapidly went into septic shock. This life threatening infection is caused by the uro pathogen ic bacteria rising up the ureter to the kidney. If a patient becomes septic the catheter has to be removed or CAUTI can be fatal. This shocking example made our project feel very relevant and we took a lot from this initial conversation. We went on to investigate the pros and cons of the current methods of CAUTI treatment, and compare these to what our solution could offer. Following this meeting, the design of the catheter became an integral part of our project.
Laura Evans, from the Adams Ward (geriatric) in the John Radcliffe Hospital, also talked to us about the current treatment of UTIs, informing us that the use of antibiotics is often ineffective and therefore infections are recurrent. We asked Laura the following questions.
What happens when a catheterised patient tests positive for a UTI?
“Whether or not the catheter is removed if a patient tests positive for a UTI depends largely on the reason that the catheter has been fitted. In most cases, the catheter remains fitted and the patient is treated with a large dose of antibiotics.”
Is antibiotic resistance a problem?
“Yes, particularly on this ward. As we treat elderly patients with recurring infections, the uropathogens they succumb to are often resistant to antibiotic treatment. As a result, we have to try different combinations of antibiotics, but in many cases this does not stop recurrences of the infection.”

In collaboration with Oxford University Scientific Society, we organised a public talk “ Biofilm s: role in health and disease, recalcitrance and in vitro model ling"

3. The receptors (mPR Danio rerio, mPR Xenopus laevis) and mig1 were initially ligated into pRS vectors and transformed into E. coli TOP10. But no colonies grew on the agar-plates.
4. A scaled up restriction digest and preparative gel electrophoresis of the parts 3 and 8 was executed to prepare them for later ligation into pRS.
Week 8  (8/27 - 9/02)
evaluating sequences via BLAST
1. Part 5 was ligated into pGEM vector and transformed into E. coli TOP10 afterwards. After performing a restriction digest it was obvious that the insert did not have the correct length and therefore had to be discarded.
2. Second ligation of mPR Danio rerio, mPR Xenopus laevis and mig1 into pRS vectors and transformation into E. coli TOP10 was executed. Some colonies grew on the agar-plates. Therefore a mini-prep and a restriction digest with XbaI and SpeI with a following gel electrophoresis was conducted. But there was only ligation of the insert into pGEM, not into pRS. The hypothesis was that the pGEM constructs were contamination.
3. Ligation of the parts 3 and 4 in pRS vectors with following transformation into E. coli TOP10 was performed. But it was not successful.

Reporter
'MelA. The gene (melA) codes for a tyrosinase which produces a dark brown pigment from L-tyrosine. Production of the pigment requires the addition of copper and L-tyrosine supplements (the copper acts as a cofactor for the gene product) but no other precursors. The BioBrick sequence includes the native ribosome binding site.
1844bp
In order to do so, we had to remove forbidden restriction sites within the gene using primers and the in-fusion PCR technique. Primers were ordered as shown by the image below, to add the prefix and suffix and change the PstI restriction site from CTGCAG to CTGCAA:
The PCR's will be done in the following steps, in order to remove both sites and prepare the gene as a biobrick:

BGIC-Union,2017,Team:BGIC-Union#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," mortality rate for female experienced a slightly decrease to just below 0.01% in 2011. From the graphs above, lung cancer can be seen as one of the biggest threat to Chinese people’s health, with both high incidence and mortality rate. Only minor differences can be found between the incidence and mortality rate for both males and females indicate that lung cancer is still a life-taking disease with a low chance to be cured in individuals. One of the reason for this is lung cancer always can only be detected and diagnosed when it is already developed into stage 3 or 4. At this stage, cancer has spread into rest of the body which causes the difficulty to cure. Our product can provide a simple, low cost, and efficient way to carry out early lung cancer detection. It is also easy to use which individuals can detect their ctDNA for lung cancer by themselves before going to hospital for a more detailed check.

6.Age-Standardized (Segi Standard Population) Mortality Rates for All Cancers Combined and Estimated Deaths (Thousands) for Selected Cancers in China, 2015, by Geographic Location (partial)
Both tables show a huge proportion of lung cancer patients is found in the rural areas in China. Those areas may have their limitation in public health care and medical services. Our product can provide a cheaper and easier way to detect ctDNA which can helps the early diagnosis of lung cancer.
2.Health check market in China
According to statistic data from ministry of public health,  Chinese health market account for 373 million person-time in 2014. It had increased 62.17% compare to 230 million person-time in 2009. However, Chinese still has a relatively low percentage,27.27%, of people having health check each year as the population accounts for 1.368 billion people in China.
The number of people have health check each year from 2009 to 2014 (ten thousand)
Chinese professional health check market capacity is 1.6 billion yuan in 2015. It is predicted that the CAGR of the capacity of health check market will be 25% between 2016 and 2020. Health check market capacity is projected to reach 5.2 billion yuan in 2020. As people are more concern about their health, the health check market has a bright prospect.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA extraction. After explaining the concept of it, we divided them into six groups, and chose a leader from our team members for every group. Most of the students had never used pipette before, which made them tense but eager to try. After all, what we students usually use are always droppers, beakers…and so on. 
Highlight :
Based on the reference from the WHO, the amount of calorie we consume from refined sugar should not exceed 10% of daily sugar intake.
Refined sugar added in items that can be called “heath food” should not exceed 25 grams, which is half of daily sugar intake for adults. Also, items with more than 50/3 grams of refined sugar should be labeled.
If a product is only to be positioned to a kind of common food, it won’t be required to pass any examination procedures. But, if it is to be a health food warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients.
The list of food additions that could be used is now available on the internet. Manufactures are required to hand in their examination result themselves.
The reason why GMO products do not prevail in Taiwan is not related to the regulations. Governing ministries will only require GMO products to be labeled because some people is still suspicious about the safety problems. 
If after 5 years, a new regulation is enacted, and the standard is adjusted, we will examine the product with the new standard again.
Before commercializing, a product could go through either human clinical trial or animal study. 
There is something needed if a product are to be commercialized:
(a.)    The effect of the product must be testified
(b.)    Descriptive data about:
- The bacterial strain used
- How it was grown and preserved 
- How its DNA strand in reconstructed 
- Whether any toxic or allergic reaction is found
Conclusion
As students being unfamiliar with the procedure of law, we understood the inspection standard of laws about health food and GM food after interviewing the section manager, Mr. Chou, which gave us a new angle of sight to reexamine the position of our product.

In this summit, we shared our research with each other and developed a further understanding of the great importance and multiple applications of synthetic biology. Thanks to iGEM, we became close friends with each other and we would work together to improve the world with biosynthesis technology!
Public Education
Our team made several public speeches about our project in schools and at the corner of Xidan road in Beijing. Our main goal was to let the public know about synthetic biology and its various applications which could improve our living standards and environments. We also hoped to provide an idea, which was to use new technology to improve the world we are living in, to the public and let them pay more attention to the relationship between diseases from mosquitoes and public health. Moreover, we were sincerely expecting more people to join us so we could work together to make the world a better place with biosynthesis technology.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"  After being in an ice bath for about an hour and a half they were put back into the -80 in their respective tubes.  Hopefully they are still viable.  A test of their viability using a simply positive control (3x flag plasmid) should have occurred tonight, but can be done tomorrow instead.  The rest of the cells were all in the ice bath for 30-40 minutes.  They were heat shocked in pairs, starting with the first to have their plasmids added and progressing towards those whose plasmids had been added last.  The heat shock was placement in a water bath at roughly 45 degrees C for 40-50 seconds.  After heating, each pair was placed in ice bath.  After three heat shockings, the first ones to be heat shocked had been in the ice bath for an estimated 2-5 minutes, so LB was added to them and they were placed in a tube holder at room temperature.  After LB had been added to all tubes, they were placed in the incubator for 2 hours.  In this fashion, it was possible to adhere rather closely to the transformation protocol despite the larger numbers of transformations.  The cells were plated as described previously and placed in the incubator around 11:50 pm.  Should check up on them around 1:50 pm tomorrow.

Met with Suzanne today.  Spent some time catching her up on the system and began to discuss ways to observe individual protein concentrations and to further model and analyze the system.
Took plates out of incubator around 2:35 pm.  They had been in the incubator for 14 hr and 42 min.  There were good colonies on all plates except Z0279 and Z0842, which were placed back into the incubator along with the controls to make sure that colonies could grow if they were present.  Note that these two parts are the LexA activator and the LexA activator reporter, respectively.
Began ligation between J63001 and J63002.  For ligation, use 1:3 ratio of vector to insert.  This should be in relative amounts, which corresponds to the weight of DNA present in the volume (in ng) normalized by the length of each DNA strand.  Prefer to have more insert than vector.  Thus, try using 8 uL water, 1 uL vector, 3 uL insert, 1.5 uL 10x ligase buffer, and 1.5 uL T4 DNA ligase"

1. The Problem
Measuring the growth of cells is a vital task in any biology lab across the world. Thousands of dollars are spent on spectrophotometers and analysers to measure the optical densities of cell cultures. More importantly, hundreds of researcher-hours are spent taking samples, diluting them and measuring the optical density, again and again, through the long nights of running growth curves.
There do exist automatic devices that can measure OD, such as the Bioscreen C, but their prohibitive cost (in the tens of thousands of dollars), low volume capacity, and inability to handle high ODs make them non-viable as a substitute for manual pipetting in most experimental scenarios.
Other machines simply lack the capabilities to ...
There has to be a better way. That way is GCODe.
GCODe (Growth Curve and Optical DEnsity) is an optical density measurement device that will not only take readings at pre-programmed intervals or continuously, but will also aerate and dilute the culture as required. It can even send you a message when the OD reaches a particular level, just in time to you to start the next stage of your experiment. Fundamentally, it automates the grunt work of growth curves, in a manner that allows you to walk away from the lab, secure in the knowledge that you will be alerted when your cells are ready for you.
Our work stemmed from our own frustrations running growth curves night after night, and was also inspired by the OD meter built by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team. We worked incrementally, starting with a rudimentary box of wiring, designing version after version in response to feedback from the iGEM wetlab team, as they trialled our device, and other labs and professors from across IISc.
We currently have two versions of GCODe manufactured, tested and fully documented.
They are:

ECUST
Lambert iGEM sent a summary of this year’s project to ECUST. The word restriction encouraged the team to formulate a concise and clear description - a crucial factor to consider when writing an abstract. Additionally, by simplifying the project description, we made it more accessible to the general public.
Uppsala
Lambert iGEM recognizes that synthetic biology requires a lot of hard work and can often result in high stress levels. This can cause extremely dedicated members to feel discouraged or “burned out”. Team Uppsala created a survey addressing this issue. The survey allowed iGEM members to recognize and to address their issues with iGEM-related stress.
Exeter
Since both Lambert’s and Exeter’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. Exeter iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States. Researching this topic allowed Lambert iGEM to reevaluate this issue in the community, focusing in from the worldwide issue of clean water shortage.
Dalhousie
Since both Lambert’s and Dalhousie’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. Dalhousie iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States. Researching this topic allowed Lambert iGEM to reevaluate this issue in the community, focusing in from the worldwide issue of clean water shortage.
IIT Kanpur
IIT Kanpur’s project emphasizes the lack of clean water around the world, a major focus of Lambert iGEM’s project. This collaboration about water pollution allowed Lambert iGEM to recognize the presence and application of the project within the local community as well as worldwide.
HAFS
Since both Lambert’s and HAFS’s 2018 iGEM project are based on water quality, the collaboration between both iGEM teams allowed members to investigate the source of the cause of poor water quality. HAFS iGEM asked for specific water quality reports in the United States.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," everyone can purchase, our product will be prescription medicines for assistant purpose. Whether patients can take it to help control their weight or blood sugar depends on doctors’ judgment. The customer base we set as target is mostly those who need to lose weight. By doing so, our product won’t be the permit to the heaven of sugar.   
So we come to the third question. In fact, this situation won’t happen no matter whether our product is prescription medicines for assistant purpose. That is because the sugar nowadays we use is mostly Corn syrup. The growth of corn is all mechanized and at area of large scale of land, which is as they are like apples and oranges when it comes to sucrose farmers exploitation. That’s why most news about farmer exploitation focuses on cocoa beans or coffee beans instead of sucrose.  
There are always two sides to one coin. Everything has its own defect no matter how perfect it is. Facing the fault, what we should do is manage to solve it in preference to leaving it to the unsure factors in the future. Thank The Mingdao Voice for helping us passionately. It is this bilateral communication between science and humanities and social science that makes our project more specific and more mature to be closer to come true.

The notebook describes two processes which occur simultaneously: The experiment in the laboratory and social process. Each month we have described the activity for these two areas separately.
February 
The decision on participation in the competition 
The decision in participating in the competition was brought forward to the class. After a long and thorough discussion of the pros and cons we decided to enter the contest as a team, despite the difficulty in managing a large group.
One of the main difficulties was: lack of complete knowledge of genetic engineering, that's why we started to study with Maggie the subject of genetic engineering as part of classroom lessons.
Crash course in genetic engineering
Despite the enthusiasm and excitement of the experience before us we began to understand the knowledge gap we need to overcome before entering the laboratory. The topic itself is fascinating to us as students, we suddenly realized just how limitless the world and science has become an almost unlimited field.
Activity beginning
Meeting with Associate Professor Roy Amit (synthetic biology assistant professor, Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering and Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute) from the Technion.
Received an explanation of the IGEM competition.
LAB : No activity 
march
Forming the Team
forming the Team began in March, already then we began to talk of bonding the major and turning into a Team competing in an international competition called Igem held in Boston.
Excitement was in the air, a new product development that does not exist in the market and the flight abroad with the major of
biotechnology would sound like a fantasy. In those moments we did not know and did not understand the meaning of the IGEM entry experience.
Exposing the idea to the Team
All members of the Team gathered to be exposed to the idea upon which we were going to work over the coming months, at the meeting we met the Advisor Dr. Yadid and we started to discuss the development of the product the best we could, students suggestions were accepted and we were able to combine our ideas with Dr. Yadid's.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Modeling#dsf_-_-_TEXT.html," manA promoter was active in our engineered system and hence GFP expression upregulated.
Like the BDSF pathway, the DSF system contains a phosphorelay system.  Our first hypothesis, therefore was that the expression of GFP was dependent on signal-independent phosphorylation of RpfG.
Using the parameter values in Table 1, the model (Fig 1) predicted that increasing the level of phosphorylated RpfG would have no significant effect on the production of GFP in our engineered cells.
Our second hypothesis was that enhanced inhibition of Clp by elevated levels of c-di-GMP could repress GFP expression. However, on setting c-di-GMP levels in the model to a high level, GFP was still expressed (albeit at a lower low level), Fig 2. This can be explained by Clp having a higher binding affinity for the promoter than c-di-GMP.  Since both these reactions are reversible, there will still be sufficient Clp free in the cytoplasm to activate GFP expression.
The model predictions so far still did not explain the high expression levels reported by the wet team. Thus bringing us to our third hypothesis - our cells were over-expressing Clp.
An analysis of our model for the DSF system revealed that the steady state levels of free Clp and c-di-GMP are only dependent on their (constitutive) rate of production and degradation (and not dependent on the Clp - c-di-GMP binding affinities nor the promoter binding affinity).  As shown in Fig 3 we see that the model predict that an over-expression of Clp results in a corresponding high level of GFP production.
Conclusion
Our models were used to test different plausible hypotheses for the DFS-signal independent expression of GFP in our engineered cells. We conclude that over-expression of Clp could be responsible for the experimental observations.

Grass stains are really hard to remove and so we felt like incorporating this enzyme could potentially increase the effectiveness of grass stain removal.
What is a stain?
Stains are those are subtle patches of mustard or dirt that leave a black hole for the attention of anyone who talks to you. So why don’t those stains just come off when we wash them with water in the bathroom after lunch? Well, for the same reason we sometimes get dirt under our fingers. The fabric in our clothes and many other materials can absorb liquid, which is then trapped inside the fabric, unable to leave. These are mechanical stains, where just some water and agitation may remove the stain from inside the fabric. Other stains however, involve some chemical reactions. Severe stains can change the chemistry of the fabric by bonding to it, leaving that lovely grape juice stain, even after washing. In order to reverse the bonding that has taken place, a detergent must be used.
What is a detergent?
Well first of all, is detergent just another name for soap? Although they perform similar jobs, a soap doesn’t always do what detergent can do. To explain more about detergent, let’s first talk about soap.
Before soap, there was water. Water is an amazing cleaning agent. Water is made of Oxygen and Hydrogen, elements that are combined together to form a molecule. What makes elements unique and different from each other are combinations of small charged particles called protons. When one proton is all by itself, we call that Hydrogen. When 8 protons gather together, we call that Oxygen. Protons aren’t the only charged particles; there are oppositely charged electrons that are attracted to protons. Groups of protons have to stay together, their numbers don’t change, but electrons move from group to group fairly easily. This whole dance of protons and electrons is what causes every muscle in your body to move and every plant to grow.
So back to water, how does water dissolve things? A water molecule doesn’t share its electrons very well. One side of a water molecule has a large group of protons, while the other side has 2 pairs of weaker protons. This imbalance causes water to be polar, one side being positively charged the other side more negative. If we want to wash anything with water, it will only be cleaned off if that substance is polar too. Well what if we need to wash something off like oil and dirt? Oil and other stains are made of non-polar molecules where the electrons are spread out"

The lactate concentration of the collected samples can be determined using the L-Lactate Kit according to its instructions. In order to get good results with this kit, it is essential to use medium free of serum and phenol red.
Bacteria and mammalian cells
Overview
A rather uncommon thing in mammalian cell culture is the central part of our system: the coculture with bacteria. To anticipate unexpected side effects of such a coculture in our final setup, we performed initial experiments combining mammalian cells and E. coli. In a next step, we tested the funcionality of our engineered cells in respect to binding to apoptotic cells. The results we achieved from these tests were obtained applying the following protocols.
Coculture
Since it is a rather unusual experimental setup wanting to combine mammalian cells with bacteria, we performed preliminary tests to find out if anything undesired would happen if we mixed our bacteria with mammalian cells.
Introduce mammalian cells of interest into the wells of a 12-well plate. Adherent cells must be allowed to settle for 2 hours previous to any experiment.
Add 500 µL of a bacterial preculture to the mammalian cells. For analysis using microscopy it is best to use bacteria expressing a fluorophore.
Incubate for 4 hours. Do not incubate in a mammalian cell incubator to avoid contamination of neighbouring cultures!
Analyze samples using a microscope. Check for colocalization or possible internalization of bacteria by mammalian cells, as well as viability of mammalian cells with or without bacteria.
Binding assay
Our engineered bacteria are designed to bind to apoptotic mammalian cells. To verify this interaction we performed the following experiment.
Apoptosis can be induced in sTRAIL susceptible cells as described elsewhere using the optimal incubation time with sTRAIL using the optimal concentration of this agent.
Detection of apoptotic cells can be performed by applying 50 µL of INP-Annexin V and RFP expressing E. coli at an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8 to the samples followed by 30 min incubation.
Analyse samples by flow cytometry.
Variations of the conditions, for example incubation temperature or Calcium content of the buffer were adjusted to find the best setup. We found that incubation on ice at a Calcium concentration of 2.5 mM is optimal.

11 August - 17 August
 
The PCR on the BioBrick of the combined genes NisR and NisK was repeated because the yield of this product was very low after the PCR in the week of 4 - 10 August. The mixture of the previous PCR reaction was used as the template. The PCR was performed under standard conditions, with an annealing temperature of 64 °C and 1 μl, 2μl and 3 μl template. No product was obtained with this PCR. So the PCR was once again repeated, this time using diluted template. The mixture was diluted 50x, 300x, 1500x and 15000x. The PCR was repeated using 1 μl and 2 μl of each of the dilutions. This way, product was obtained for all reactions.
 
The PCR products of the genes NisA, NisB, NisC, NisRK, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were purified using the GeneJET purification kit. Then 1 μg of each purified product was restricted with EcoRI and PstI, together with 1 μg of the pSB1C3 plasmid. The restriction enzymes were then inactivated by heating the samples at 80 °C for 20 minutes. Ligated 6 μl of the restricted PCR products to 2 μl restricted pSB1C3. Inactivated the ligase by incubating at 65 °C for 10 minutes. Mixed 5 μl of the ligation mixture with 25 μl electrocompetent Escherichia coli DH5α. The transformants were grown on LB with 10 μg/ml  chloramphenicol, see figure 4. The white colonies were tested on insertsize with a colony PCR with the VF2 and VR primers. For every gene transformants were found that contained pSB1C3 with a correctly sized insert, except for NisB and NisRK.
 
 
Figure 4: E. coli containing pSB1C3 with a mRFP construct (pink colonies) and with another insert than mRFP, possibly a correct BioBrick (white colonies).
 
 
The E. coli that contained the pSB1C3 plasmid with a correctly  sized insert were grown as a liquid culture and the plasmid was isolated using the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit.

As expected, when our model is fitted with experimental data, it predicts that during the night both the growth and fumarate production rates drop drastically. From this simulation, it appears that deleting the fumC gene is not enough for stable nighttime production.  So in order to get a higher nighttime production rate, the first thing we had to ask ourselves was, why?
Examining our model under simulated night, it became apparent that the majority of the flux from glycogen was passing through the Pentose Phosphate pathway (PPP). As explained here , diverting flux away from the PPP and towards the TCA cycle could increase the nighttime fumarate production. However, since the PPP consists of many reactions involved in both day and nighttime metabolism, we needed to find a gene (or genes) which when removed would not only silence the PPP during the night, but also not affect the growth rate, and thus fumarate production, during the day. Using both literature [14] and our model, we were able to determine that the zwf gene was just the gene we were looking for. In fact, when silencing the reactions associated with the zwf gene on the Δ fumC background ( Δ zwf Δ fumC ) in our model during the night, the Y p/x on fumarate jumps up from 0.848 to 3.17 mmol gDW -1 . During the day, knocking out zwf is predicted to have no effect. This is exactly what we were looking for and so we tested it experimentally . (Spoiler alert: IT WORKS!)
Modeling beyond the native metabolism to further increase stable fumarate production
The double deletion strain Δ fumC Δ zwf produces fumarate around the clock, which is quite an achievement, but still we wanted to try to improve it further. In this strain, during the night, the deletion of the zwf blocks the PPP forcing the carbon flux towards the TCA cycle. However, the fumC deletion suppresses the cyclic nature of the TCA. This means that the maximum stoichiometry that we could hope to achieve is to produce one fumarate per glucose catabolized. In order to achieve any further improvement, we now knew that we would have to shift somehow this stoichiometry. Only way to do that is to rewire the network. We looked into nature for inspiration.
Many organisms possess a glyoxylate shunt. This pathway, consisting of is"

Then, If we raise the temperature up to 42℃ directly, the PVA would be catalyzed to Deoxychromoviridans by VioC. At the same time, our Ec.oli will turn into dark purple. On the other hand, if we raise the temperature up to 37℃ first, we would obtain dark green product called Protoviolaceinic acid (catalyzed by VioD). And if we put the E.coli in 42℃ after placing in 37℃ for a while , the resulting product we obtain is Violacein(catalyzed by VioC) which shows violet(Figure 9).
The circuits we design explicate our concept of pathway commander, of which we can stop and direct the mechanism as we wish.

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock"

Choosing the parameters in this way meant that each time the program was run we would sometimes achieve a combination of parameters that allowed bistability, and sometimes not.
The program was run 100 times and the number of times bistability was achieved was output to the screen as a percentage.
We then decided to run the program for various different parameter ranges. We cannot change individual parameters specifically, but in the lab it is possible to vary the order of magnitude of a parameter. We wanted to know, if we varied our parameters and Hill coefficients, what is the best percentage we can possibly get? These results are shown in scenarios 2-4.
Scenario 1 – unmodified parameters
These parameters were taken from, or derived from, the information contained within various sources of literature [1]-[13] . The parameters were converted from concentrations to numbers of molecules.
We did not know what concentration of galactose and methionine was optimal, so we ran various tests and found the value for which the percentages were maximised. We found that the optimal percentages occurred if we have 100000 times more galactose than methionine. See figure 1a and 1b.

Figure 1. a) The percentage of parameter combinations tested that will give us bistability for various combinations of Hill coefficients. n2 is the Hill coefficient for the GFP rate-reaction equation and n4 is the Hill coefficient for the CFP rate-reaction equation. b) Graphical representation of 1a.
Here we can see that if n4=1, then the best scenario we can hope for is that n2=5. In this situation, 3.29% of the parameter combinations tested will give bistability and the possibility of switching. However, with n2 estimated to be between 1 and 3, we can say that at most 2.03% of the parameter combinations tested gave bistability.
Scenario 2 – modified parameters 1
Percentages are maximised if we have 100000 times more galactose than methionine. See figure 2a and 2b.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to precipitate silica when reacted with silicic acid. This provided us with an additional route to test for the presence of Si4 on cell surfaces, i.e. via mineralization assays using silicic acid as a mineral precursor.
Phase II
Phase II takes the products of Phase I to the next level, and begins to look at integration of the INP-displayed Si4 binding peptide and Device 1 to give a new device; Device 2.
Device 2
Device 2 brings together on the same plasmid the genes that code for (1) the CpxP promoter controlling GFP expression and (2) the INP-displayed Si4 binding domain. The effect of this is that when the Si4 binding domain binds to the silica target, surface stress propagated through the INP protein will activate the pCpxR promoter through the Cpx signaling pathway. This will cause GFP to be produced and thereby act as a visible signal that the 'pathogen' has been detected.
This is the final MircoBeagle device and has the potential to be made into many different pathogen detectors. This can easily be done by swapping out the gene coding for the binding moiety next to the INP gene. Once Device 2 has been suitably characterised and all bugs fixed, the next step will be to swap the silca binding domain for a binding domain that binds to a particular pathogen.
We note that given the conceptual modularity of our MicroBeagle strategy, in principle any of the key device elements--surface-displayed binding domain, transmembrane scaffold protein, stress-activated promoter, and/or fluorescent or colorimetric report--can be optimized or exchanged for new specific elements that exhibit the intended component function. In the future, performance of the device components should be amenable to evolutionary improvement, either individually or in tandem. In fact, the binding domain element would benefit from a plethora of evolutionary screens that have already been conducted in biomedical and biotechnological labs worldwide to identify protein and peptide binders to a wide range of both biological and non-biological targets.
The Cpx Pathway
This project is highly dependent upon a naturally occuring pathway in E.Coli called the Cpx pathway. It is associated with the regulation of periplasmic membrane stress and the misfolding of surface proteins. We may need to fine tune MicroBeagle for different applications, so by understanding the way the pathway is regulated, we stand a better chance of controlling the exact response we want. This may be done in a number of ways, from utilisation of an off-switch regulator,"

Summary
Milk samples from cows that have mastitis but are not cured by certain antibiotics are not always sent to the lab for test, because it costs time and money (2-3 days). Sometimes farmers thus already register other antibiotics not knowing if it might work. When the milk sample goes to the lab, the untreated milk is plated on different agar plates. When colonies have grown, the microorganisms are often colored and examined through the microscope. Also, biochemical tests are done to see which compounds the bacteria can convert. When a cow has clinical mastitis (visible symptoms), it is most likely that one type of bacterium is the cause. There are 6 types of known, common pathogens for mastitis. Engeline tells us that farmers would like a on site test for which antibiotic can or can not be administered. She thinks that within several years whole genome sequencing will be the golden standard.
We asked Engeline what is the most appropriate sample for detecting antibiotic resistance. She tells us that feces contains too many bacteria, blood is supposed to be"

From the perspective of convenience, we improved several of these parts:
Constitutively Expressed Red Light Sensor Operon(BBa_K1026005)
Constitutively Expressed Blue Light Sensor Operon(BBa_K1026011)
Constitutively Expressed pcyA Operon(BBa_K1026014)
When we use green light sensing system we find that green light upregulated genes downstream the promoter, and we would like to construct 3 downregulated systems. After studying the mechanism and structure characteristics of this system, we designed another promoter. The regulatory factor will bind to the G-box thus blocking the way of RNA Polymerase. As a result, we get the wanted promoter part: A rationally designed promoter negative regulated by CcaR (BBa_K1026009)
After combining 2 systems together, we get the following parts that have direct relationship of light-controlled CRISPRi system:
A gRNA targeting mRFP, negatively regulated by Red Light Sensor(BBa_K1026004)
A gRNA targeting mRFP, negatively regulated by Green Light Sensor(BBa_K1026007)
A gRNA targeting mRFP, negatively regulated by Blue Light Sensor(BBa_K1026010)
With these parts we can use this light-controlled CRISPRi system as a universal gene regulating tools and it is very easy to control.
Correct Combination makes Suitable Solution. We believe this system will bring about plenty of new applications.

Do you think that production of yeast extract enriched with MAA would be a valuable combination?
Certainly.
What can be the possible difficulties in producing MAA in yeast? What do you think how we can overcome them?
Even if the introduction of the 4 genes is successful, one concern is their expression and its efficiency.          I am no an expert on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but my first question is about what is known on the         presence of solar radiation receptors that are probably needed to trigger the induction of MAA synthesis.         What about the genes Ava_3858 and Ava_3857 that encode demethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) synthase         and O-methyltransferase (O-MT), respectively, to form 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG), the core structure of mycosporines?
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
Well, this is related to my previous answer. Another suggestion is to use a nitrogen-enriched cultivation medium.
How do you think, is the combination of Shinorine and Porphyra-334 reasonable for sunscreens?
If you get both, they have a wide window of UV radiation screening. Myc-gly would made the combination perfect.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," Leachate treatment in China is a more promising alternative. China generates a larger amount of leachate compared to many other countries(""Leachate treatment in China: Technologies and Import Opportunities"", 2015). Additionally, the COD content in Hong Kong, China ranges from 15,700 to 50,000 mg/L for young landfills (""Leachate treatment in China: Technologies and Import Opportunities"", 2015), which is 8 to 25 times greater than in Calgary. We estimated that about 900,000 - 3,000,000 kg of PHB can be produced per year in Hong Kong depending on COD content and using PHA yield of 0.11 kg of PHA per kg of COD. PHB production from leachate was also considered for Vancouver, which generates 2,225,978 cubic meters of leachate per year (Vancouver landfill 2016 annual report, 2017). Based on our estimates, about 3,100,000 kg of PHB can be produced per year assuming the COD content of about 13,000 mg/L (Tao, Hall & Masbough, 2005)
For the wastewater treatment plant, we estimated 28,100,000 kg of PHB produced per year. The Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Calgary processes about 1 million cubic meters of waste per day. The COD content and PHA yield were assumed to be 1000 mg/L and 0.11 kg of PHA per kg of COD, respectively, for the calculations.
In developing countries, we envisioned PHB production incorporated into scaled-down wastewater treatment systems in small communities that lacked established treatment methods. Selling PHB would provide a monetary incentive to construct a wastewater treatment system, which, in turn, will reduce diseases due to poor sanitation. Additionally, we wanted to compare PHB production between genetically engineered bacteria and natural bacterial communities in sludge, which have been previously used to feasibly produce PHB. Assuming a community size of 2000 people, solid waste generation of 3.113 x 10-3 m3 /day/person (Palanivel & Sulaiman, 2014), COD content of 601 mg/L [14], COD to PHB conversion of 0.11 for mixed cultures and 0.88 for pure cultures  (Rhu, Lee, Kim & Choi, 2003) and a price of $5 per kg of PHB (Choi & Lee, 1997), we found that using pure cultures results in additional $2,000 in revenues."
BCCS-Bristol,2010,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Wetlab#Part Design#Components#Promoters_-_-_TEXT.html," blocked and any genes downstream of PyeaR are then expressed - in our case the GFP reporter.
Why did we choose it?
There are several different Nitrate sensitive promoters that we could have used and we thought carefully before making our choice, however, PyeaR has several key advantages.
The first is that PyeaR is native to E. coli, meaning all the necessary proteins involved in its control (such as NsrR) are already in our chassis. This reduced the amount we would have to manipulate our bacteria, cutting down both on time and the number of factors that could potentially go wrong.
PyeaR is also advantageous because its action does not depend on the metabolic state of the E. coli. As most of the genes normally controlled by Nitrate sensitive promoters are involved in respiration in the absence of oxygen, most of these promoters can only be ‘switched on’ in an anaerobic environment. In contrast, PyeaR regulation works well in an aerobic environment, meaning we don’t have to worry about the metabolic state of our bacteria.
Finally, PyeaR was already available in the parts registry. This meant we could quickly pursue the more ambitious areas of our project, without getting held back having to develop new promoter BioBricks.
Background
NsrR was first identified in Nitrosomonas europaea, a lithoautotropic bacterium. N. europaea is capable of acquiring free energy via the aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, as well as using nitrate and nitrite as alternative electron acceptors in an anaerobic environment. NsrR was reported as being a nitrite sensitive repressor of the nitrite reductase NirK, it is thought to protect N. europaea against the toxic affects of <math>NO_2</math> produced during nitriﬁcation [1]. There is also evidence from the human pathogen Neisseris meningitidis that NsrR reacts to nitric oxide [2].
NsrR is a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors, this is a family of transcription factors mostly involved in nitrate and iron metabolism, and nitric oxide detoxiﬁcation. NsrR has been shown to regulate the response of E. coli to reactive nitrogen species [3], speciﬁcally to nitrite and nitric oxide [4], [5]. It regulates the response by both repressing and activating operons. Filenko et al. [3] reported 20 repressed genes and 24 activated genes.

First of all the finances relies on investments from nongovernmental organizations, benefactors or both. The motive for this comes from the minimal output that is associated with relief aids, which is not beneficial  from the perspectives of the industrial world. Secondly, there is a risk of violating the right of the individual to choose when the alternatives to GMOs are limited. The fact that the people in focus do not have alternatives to begin with could on the contrary support the application of GMOs.
Unlike starving populations, the ethical concern of offering GMOs to malnourished societies is not whether it is unfair  to offer this without alternative nutritional choices. In  this context, it is decisive to aim at integrating the GMOs in the gastronomy that already exists, as the two  nutrition experts also states in an expert opnion. But, will the population of developing countries necessarily have a positive view on an initiative such as this coming from the developed countries?
Is it an ethical issue to eat genetically modified bacteria?
One question in our questionnaire was: Would you eat GMO or food produced by GMOs? The optional answers given were yes, no, maybe, I don’t think so, and I don’t know. We received a total number of 259 completed questionnaires where the answers were as follow; 43.66 % yes, 8.11 % no,  33.98 % maybe, 8.11 % I don’t think so and 6.18 % I don’t know.
As mentioned above, GMOs are organisms where the DNA has been modified; some people might even  claim that it has been tampered with. It is important to note, that many people are unfamiliar with the  procedure of genetical modification. This perhaps leads to skepticism or the development of fear for the  unknown. The distribution of answers to the question Would it be an ethical issue to offer GMO as  relief aid for hunger-stricken countries? showed that 16.22% of all participants answered yes or maybe. But  is it only the ignorance, which means that people are hostile towards GMOs?
Or could it be the opposite case, namely that people with knowledge of GMOs are afraid of the risks and  hazards that genetically modification brings? Furthermore, could those people be brought to change their  minds if they were guaranteed a safe system for humans and the environment?

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html," it from the idea of priceless progress, making its rise “spectacular” for the analyst : that society rests on “consent”. It is now admitted, encouraged and normalized to expose difficulties and risks linked to technological society, to admit that technological progress is not exempt from negative effects. That element will be important in our approach, because it culturally built up a new objective of the ethical perspective, adding to the objective of prevention (regarding established risks) an objective of precaution (adding the “probable” risks to its concerns). The new aspect of “consent” in our technological society regarding crisis, risks and the global consensus about the necessity to exit lead to the creation of a new people, composed of manufacturers, scientists, politicians, and citizens keeping their differences of opinion in order to create “social pact” to answer the new social and environmental imperatives. The risks associated with emerging technologies could reconfigure the social world, putting the promises, responsibilities and expertise of science and scientists at its center. The ethical questions in sciences and the new relations that it “imposes” between social actors can have some large effect and reconfigurations on the social world and democracy.
We have to take into consideration those uninitiated in the social debates, controversies and polemics nowadays about the technical and scientific decisions facing risks (nuclear waste, GMOs, infected blood). Controversies are special moments and situations where both uncertainty and divergences between actors are perceptible. These situations call scientists' monopoly into questions about what is the best way to resolve the “local” problem, leading to a more “global and conceptual challenge” by reopening the question of the “neutrality of science”. The legitimacy of the scientific decision about risks, and so the technical choice of politics usually based on these scientific decisions, are now disputed. Scientific and social controversies are a way to put into light the democratic aspects of the scientific decision-making process , focused on the question of the good way to “live together” (including the environmental question), that new social pact, where ethical perspective is at the center. We can also notice, referring to the work of Callon, Lascoumes and Barthe's (see [7] ), that controversies are also regarded as a new way to practice a “dialogical democracy” in the decision making process, in some new “open spaces where groups can mobilize themselves to debate technical choices in which the public is involved”. As already proposed, the question of governementality, the scientific decision making process and democratic experimentation have to be considered in our reflexion.

We worked with Virginia State Senator Monty Mason to improve networking with the school district and find out how to best get our resources to the people who wanted them.
We did general publicity of our research and the synthetic biology research at our college, since this field is still relatively new and not very well known.
Lastly, we created the Outreach Database , a compilation of the approximately 1500 outreach projects done by gold medal teams in 2016 and 2015. This database organizes projects into categories and is a searchable tool for future iGEM teams to analyze past outreach and for teachers who want to find synthetic biology educational activities.
While some of our outreach to our community was short-term, we worked closely with our community partners to ensure that our impact does not end with this project.

Neptune is a design tool that implements the research done by many mentors and graduate student. Before us, other students developed single, abstract software tools toward microfluidic design. These tools saw limited to no use because they failed to integrate into a bigger system. We created the software for the Neptune user interface that wraps these different projects, and we created the hardware control infrastructure for the microfluidics that are generated from this workflow. We have also contributed to the algorithmic libraries of Neptune by developing a tool called Mushroom Mapper, which allows for a higher level of abstraction when specifying microfluidic chip designs. Here we attribute the different components behind Neptune, the ones created by other students and mentors.

Sixth meeting - Artificiality
Our inquiry of artificiality showed that we ought not to use the adjective ‘artificial’ as an honorary title.  Due to the existing continuum between the natural and the artificial (e.g. [17]), we cannot argue that something is simply natural or simply artificial. A bioengineering product is less artificial than Venter’s Synthia, which is respectively less artificial than a product of the protocell approach. All the products of synthetic biology are not simply ‘artificial life’: a bioengineering product has ‘artificial parts’, a synthetic genomics product an ‘artificial genome’ and, according to our argumentation, only the bottom-up protocell approach might be capable of producing entities, which could be meaningfully called as a whole ‘artificial life’ or ‘synthetic life’. Thus, all references to biological systems with the adjectives ‘artificial’ or ‘synthetic’ not being marked as a metaphor or as a future aim are therefore not warranted.
Publications we worked with:
[17] Sandler R (2012): Is artefactualness a value-relevant property of living beings? Synthese 185: 89-102
Seventh meeting - Technical functionality: the overdetermination problem
The further necessary property we examined was the technical functionality, because machines are not only made by humans, they are also supposed to have a useful function: a machine needs to be constructed with the intention to be a helpful mean for some human end.  Although many of the scholars who worked on the products of the synthetic biology accepted almost unproblematic that the synthetic entities have technical functions (e.g. [10],[11],[18]), we wanted to examine in detail the idea of a synthetic biological product following a human-settled goal. For this, we decided to study the relation between technical functions and biological functions, as the concept of a ‘living machine’ seems to have both of them.  Generally, referring to a function supposes to explain why its correspondent function bearer occurs and why it is there [19]. For example: if someone asks what a knife is, then we usually appeal to its function as cutting and stabbing tool and if someone asks what a heart is, then we answer referring to its function of pumping blood. Hence, functions are good for causal explanations. However, regarding the products of the synthetic biology we have an overdetermination problem, because we can explain what a trait is referring to both, technical functions and biological functions. Imagine following situation:

Our project constructed a mir-21 sponge containing marker gene of GFP for the detection and inhibition mir-21 in cell lines, and offers a non-invasive and highly sensitive approach for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer in the future.
miRNA sponge, which contains multiple target sites complementary to a miRNA of interest, is used to be a inhibitor of miRNA. Here, we proposed miRNA sponge could be a monitor to detect the change of miRNA expression in cells. After transfection of the miR-21 sponge, sponge RNAs can attract miR-21, inhibiting the expression of eGFP reporter. The expression of miR-21 should be monitored by measuring the expression of eGFP reporter (Fig.1).
Fig.1. Model for the effect of miR-21 sponge in cells.
In the absence of sponge treatment, lots of miR-21 existed in cells. After introduction of the sponge transgene, sponge RNAs are expressed at a high level and attract miR-21, inhibiting the expression of eGFP reporter. The expression of miR-21 should be identified by their eGFP reporter expression.
Pervious studies indicated sponges containing bulged sites that are mispaired opposite miRNA are more effective (Ebert MS et al. Nat Methods. 2007 4:721-6.). Typical sponge constructs contain 2 to 10 binding sites separated by a few nucleotides each. Here, we designed two different mir-21 sponges with different binding sits to test the efficiency of sponges for detecting miRNA. One mir-21 sponge contains two miR-21 binding sites with 3-nt spacers for bulged sites (pEGFP-mir-21-sponge-2s). Another one mir-21 sponge contains six miR-21 binding"

1. Extraction of plasmids.
2. PCR.
3. DNA agarose gel electrophoresis.
4. DNA restriction endonuclease reaction.
5. Recycle of DNA.
As most of us are from the School of Life Science and have already had the experience of these experiments, we expect we would have a good start and get into the best condition soon.
7.30(B)
After 10 days of pre-experiments, we decided to start our experiments officially tomorrow.  We have basically determined our project.  Firstly, we hope to extract the plasmids from the bacteria strains from iGEM that might contain anaerobic promoters we want.  And for the plasmids we searched out from documents, we decided to get them through PCR.  Secondly is specific enzyme digestion at EX or SP site.  Following is adding report genes into EX or SP site.  The final step is to transfer the plasmids into VNP through electric transformation and cultivate the bacteria anaerobically.  Then examine the expression intensity of report genes to determine the property of the anaerobic promoters and to find out the best one.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of g"

We had this Instagram account one week during the summer and will be occupying it again the week of the jamboree in Boston. This has been a fantastic way for us to reach out to more students at our university and to get the interest of iGEM to rise.

Within all these different methods, they have one thing in common—various stress are induced during the dehydration process, examples like shear stress [4,8] , oxidative stress [5,8] , heat stress [6,8] , chemical stress and osmotic stress [7,8] . Cell membrane in particular, appears to be damaged and significantly affect cells viability. Its fluid bilayer structure was originally stabilised via Van der Waals forces and hydration repulsion, which is severely weakened by lose of water [7] .Package default will occur during rehydration process because the regular arrangement of phospholipids is disrupted during dehydration, and this cause leakage of cellular components [9] . Dehydration brought severe decrease in viability of the cells after rehydration and cells’ resilience seems to be a major concern.
Protection by adding protective agent
Three main protective strategies can be envisaged to maintain their Viability after dehydration:
Change the process parameters, like lowering the temperature, or pressure within certain range [10]
Pre-stressing the cell prior to drying, which induces their own protective stress responses [11]
Add protective agents.
Saccharides(e.g. Sucrose, lactose, trehalose) [12,13] is one of the most commonly used protectant and was proved to be efficient in improving resilience of cells, several correlated mechanisms have been proposed. Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide of glucose, have been widely accepted as a long-time protectant. However, cost of production is significantly increased by artificially adding trehalose, and we are hoping to find a suitable substituent for it.

After this cooperation, we have established a deep friendship with XJTU-China. We often discuss some problems encountered in Golden Gate assembly. We also discuss some questions about modeling.
Here is the link to the wiki of XJTU-China.
6.ShanghaiTech
This year, we cooperated with Shanghai Tech. They helped us measure heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). CFPS is the production of protein using biological machinery in a cell-free system, that is, without the use of living cells. According to recent article reported, cell-free system is more sensitive to detect RNA behavior than traditional measurement method. With the help of CFPS, we can get more precise experimental results in vitro.
For cell-free measurement, we constructed a new measurement device with T7 promoter. Then we sent ten sets of  plasmids to them. They expressed the ten samples in cell-free system under three temperatures: 29°, 37°and 42°. Then they measured the relative fluorescence intensity by microplate reader. Finally, we received their data and computed the fold-change of the response in the given temperatures.
Figure 11. Fold change of the heat-inducible RNA-based theromsensors. Each plot represents an individual theromsensor. The purple horizontal represents the fold change of positive control. The purple vertical represents the normalized fluorescence of negative control.
As these results show, the heat-inducible RNA-based thermosensors we designed can work in CFPS. The fluorescence value increases with temperature elevated. Besides, the difference in fluorescence intensity and the rate of increase points to the diversity in thermosensor response.
We appreciate ShanghaiTech to help us measure the heat-inducible RNA-based theromsensos. Hoping that we can maintain the long-time friendship and collaborate with each other in the future.

High school Presentation
Objectives
One of our major objectives for this presentation was to show to students the biology from                 a new point of view and to speak with them about the fun, the goals, the perspectives and the                 limits of this science. Moreover, we wanted to do a presentation to high schooler to help                 them discover a new domain of application of biology, the synthetic biology with concretes examples                 of its application. Also, it was a great occasion for us to present our project softer shock and the IGEM competition.
Our presentation
Our presentation was cut into three different parts, the first one is to help them discover               what is synthetic biology with example of its applications and concretes examples of modified organism               for each application. In a second time, we warned them about the limits of the synthetic biology for the               human health, on the biodiversity, ethics, and what the law permits us to do. In the other hand, we also               spoke about the perspectives of synthetic biology. Finally, we present the iGEM competition and our project.               To stimulate them, we also challenged them with question about their general knowledge on biology and their logic               on synthetic biology.
The card game
To help students have a better understanding of synthetic biology, we created a card game with simple rules:
Make teams of 4-6 members.
Pick 3 green cards representing organisms.
Pick 3 yellow cards representing DNA vector.
Finally pick 1 red card representing problem"

Perspectives for GoldenBricks and the PartsRegistry
When the complete protocols will be established, our team will submit a BBF RFC request for the registry. If the RFC get accepted and if the tenant of the PartsRegistry thinks this is a valuable format, we can think of migrating the registry to this new format. This can be done in two complementary ways: the first one is to ask every user to submit their new part in the new GoldeBrick format, and the second is to take advantage of the huge community working on the PartsRegistry and especially the iGEM competition. In order to migrate the already existing parts faster, we can add in the requirements for the gold medal to resubmit already exsiting parts in the new format. With an average of 200 teams in the years to come and asking each of them to resubmit two goldenbricked parts, we can cover the 2000 most useful parts within two or three years, because the teams will GoldenBrick the parts they are interested in for their assembly, so they will probably always re-submit more than two.
We believe that implementing such a method in the partsregistry will speed up the assembly process and give a new shine to this database that severely suffers from the gene synthesis and PCR based methods competition. This will leave more time for researchers and iGEMers for characterizing the parts, and the partregistry will also benefits from an increase of parts characterization, which is very beneficial to the community. Overhall, the idea of standardized parts that tends to loose its strength with the time will gain again in interest in the long run.

Figure 1: Fluorescence trend for cells at 3 different temperatures (degrees celsius) with a negative and positive control
From figure 1, no immediate trend is apparent.  However, if we study figure 2 more closely without looking at the controls, we can see that as temperature is increased, fluorescence count increases too.
However, there are several artefacts in the data.
Figure 2: Fluorescence trend for cells at 3 different temperatures (degrees celsius)
Conclusion: When temperature increases, the repression of the Harvard promoter is lifted and genome deletion by thermoinduction can take place. This can be observed by a higher fluorescence measure when the temperature rises.

Secondly, the thymidine nucleotide at the zero repeat is very important to the binding affinity of the TALE (Meckler et al., 2013). Thirdly, the binding affinity of TALE varies based on the types of the nucleotides present in its target site. The relative affinities are: NG (1) > NN (0.18) > HD (0.16) > NI (0.0016) > NK (0.00016) (Meckler et al., 2013). All of these points must be carefully considered while designing the TALE to maximize its binding affinity and specificity.
The three TALEs designed by Slovenia 2012 iGEM team, were ordered from the registry (TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ), TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) and TALE D ( BBa_K782005 )). Primers were designed to incorporate the the target sequences of TALE A and TALE B ([A] and [B]) in the RFP generator. This plasmid will be used as a target sequence. Primers were also designed that incorporate selected point mutations of [A] ( BBa_K1189004 ) and [B] ( BBa_K1189005 ) into a biobrick. Once these plasmids are made they will be used to determine how the TALEs affinity is altered by mutations. In addition, two other TALEs were ordered from the the authors of the Meckler et al. (2013) paper.
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
We continued our literature search for a unique and stable pathogenic E. coli marker for the TALEs to bind to. Potential pathogenic O157:H7 E. coli markers: stx1, stx2 (Yoshitomi et al., 2012), uidA (Yoshitomi et al., 2003 and Feng et al., 1994), eaeA, hly, rbfE (Fortin et al., 2001), and Z3276 (Li & Chen, 2012). However, BLAST searches determined that the use of only one 18 bp sequence is not sufficiently specific and sensitive to detect pathogenic markers. Should we continue to search for only one marker or more than one or expand the detection to any toxic Shiga producing strains?
In addition to searching for a pathogenic E. coli marker, we also started"

Duplicate J23117+I13504 samples were then tested using standard set-up and the non-standard set-up, but the brightness was insufficient to image the fluorescence. This confirms the reduced fluorescence intensity of the J23117+I13504 samples compared to the J23106+I13504 samples.
Glasgow Team
We can see how you fluoresce
Collaboration with the Glasgow iGEM Team was also based on fluorescence imaging: as part of their project, the Glasgow team are characterising different fluorescence constructs expressing RFP and GFP. It was therefore beneficial for them to have an independent group analyse the bacterial expression of their constructs, and for us to have some living fluorescent samples to image. Specifically, the bacterial transformants they supplied were reported to have the following phenotypes:
DH5α - No antibiotic resistance, no fluorescence (control)
DH5α - Kanamycin resistance, GFP and RFP fluorescence (in the same cell)
DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, RFP fluorescence
DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, GFP fluorescence
DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, mostly GFP fluorescence with a small proportion of cells on the plate expressing RFP
Our objective was therefore twofold: firstly to test the capabilities of OpenScope in analysing bacterial samples for GFP and RFP fluorescence, and secondly to report back to Glasgow with our phenotypic analysis of their bacterial strains.
Results:
After preliminary testing using the RFP epi-cube, it was decided that imaging of RFP at this stage would not be possible. Hence only bacterial strains expressing GFP (as confirmed earlier) were tested against the control.
Testing using the commercial fluorescence microscope confirmed that the samples had phenotypes as reported by Glasgow. From tube 5, a small proportion of the cells were expressing RFP and the majority expressed GFP as predicted.
Results from preliminary testing of DH5α cells with p126.1 and p56.1 (confirmed: GFP expression only) using the standard set-up indicated illumination brightness was insufficient to detect GFP. The non-standard set-up (with a brighter LED) was used, and GFP expression was confirmed in p126.1, p126.+p56.1 and p126.1+p80.1 cells as expected (Fig. 3a-d). The images display an artefact of the square shape of the LED used, as there is an area of increased fluorescence in the outline of a square at the centre of the images ("
