2.       Rationale for beta-hairpins removal
The shape of α-subunit of Ag43 resembles letter L (Fig.2). It consists of a 'β-helix domain [which forms] the stem of the letter L, followed by three rungs flanked by four β-hairpin motifs that bend the protein by about 110° and a C-terminal (...) parallel β-helix domain [which forms] the bottom of the letter L' (Heras et. al., 2014). It has been indicated that this unique shape plays a crucial role in cell-to-cell aggregation via velcro-like mechanism, in which α-subunits form a dimer by coling around each other. This interaction is strengthened by Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges facilitated by the L-shape (Heras et. al., 2014). Recent research demonstrates that disruption of the bend and straightening of the shape by removal of two β-hairpin sequences eliminates self-association of Ag43 proteins (Heras et. al., 2014). Removal of β-hairpins does not interfere with protein translocation to the cell surface membrane.

BioBrick Bba_K1352002 is a modified version of the Bba_K1352001 BioBrick. It is composed of an Ag43 coding sequence with an in-frame FLAG epitope tag flanked by BglII and HindIII multiple cloning sites inserted within"

This is a caption. Let's see what it looks like.
Finite Difference Models
For finite difference models, we set up a grid of positions that we want to solve our equations at, separated by some fixed difference \(dx\) and at time steps separated by time \(dt\). Subscripts of our concentration P represent the spacial co-ordinates of the grid-point, while superscript represents the location in time. We define a constant \(r=\dfrac{dt}{(dx)^{2}}\) which must be less than 0.5 for the scheme to be convergent.
The 1D formula to iterate over for the finite difference model of diffusion is
\[P_{j}^{n+1}=(1-2r)P_{j}^{n}+r(P_{j-1}^{n}+P_{j+1}^{n})\]
The 2D formula to iterate over is
\[P_{i,j}^{n+1}=(1-4r)P_{i,j}^{n}+r(P_{i,j-1}^{n}+P_{i,j+1}^{n}+P_{i-1,j}^{n}+P_{i+1,j}^{n})\]
Similarly, for 3D:
\[P_{i,j,k}^{n+1}=(1-6r)P_{i,j,k}^{n}+r(P_{i,j-1,k}^{n}+P_{i,j+1,k}^{n}+P_{i-1,j,k}^{n}+P_{i+1,j,k}^{n}+P_{i,j,k-1}^{n}+P_{i,j,k+1}^{n})\]
we (arbitrarily) choose our boundary conditions to be continuous at the boundary.

Determining if expression of glycogen branching and debranching enzymes affect E. coli glycogen content
AIM:
To analyse the effect of GlgX (glycogen debranching enzyme) and GlgB (glycogen branching enzyme) expression on glycogen content in E. coli. We initially set out to investigate this by looking at the staining of whole-cell extracts with Lugol’s solution. The iodine in the Lugol’s solution intercalates in the glucan chains to give a coloured complex. Comparison between the colours observed can give an indication of the amount and branching structure of the glycogen within the sample 1 .
METHOD:
Competent E. coli were transformed with Biobricks expressing GlgX or GlgB under the control"

""The greatest team the University of Michigan has produced since the Fab Five""
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan. Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.
Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.
I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.
Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.
Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.
Hi, I'm Ali Hammoud. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in biochemistry and computer science. I spend a lot of my time studying for classes and working in a clinical research lab, but in my spare time I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.

Although we only had a single shot to test our kill switch in Physcomitrella patens, we have discussed this system far more than the other parts of our project that worked very well in first experiments. During these discussions on our kill switch we learnt a lot about this system and we described these findings in order to help subsequent iGEM teams who aim to design a reliable and safe kill switch.
Implementation
Figure 3: Remediation rafts in front of the MIT
Projects in iGEM must not stop at the lab door and therefore it is immensely important to think about technical solutions to implement the transgenic organisms in order to show highest efficacy and safety. For this reason we convinced experts like Prof. Dr. Posten to join our advisory board and have evaluated different cultivation methods for moss such as closed tube reactors, open pond reactors and floating remediation rafts. We came to the conclusion that in the case of immobilized effector proteins an open pond or closed tube reactor will be the superior technology as the degradation requires a large area of contact between the moss and the pollutant to be degraded. As a second possibility we evaluated the secretion of effector proteins such as the laccase, which would then be implemented best on floating remediation rafts which are cheap to produce, mobile and could also be applied in third world countries with highly contaminated waters. PhyscoFilter moss could be grown on these rafts and would secrete recombinant protein into the water to degrade pollutants in the environment. For all these cultivation methods we built model reactors, tried the cultivation of moss within them and tested the flow characteristics of the systems. For the triangular remediation raft we constructed a life-size prototype which costed only US$ 50. Additionally we developed a measurement device based on an Arduino microcontroller which measures environmental parameters, sends the data via WiFi to a webserver from where the actual data can be monitored with any smart phone or computer at any place in the world. To get an idea how such remediation rafts could look like on our rivers, we talked to architects and also rendered an 3D-CAD-model in front of the MIT (see figure 3).
Supporting the iGEM Community
It is really amazing to see how the iGEM community advanced over the last years. We can proudly say that we invested efforts to take the iGEM community to another level. We created a software tool which translates protein coding BioBricks"

Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Bioabsorbent_-_-_TEXT.html," the toxicity, exist in eukaryote and prokaryote. Most of them are metallothioneins[4] with cysteines acting as the binding sites. MerR family transcription factors are among of them. As was discussed, MerR family is a group of transcriptional activators that can bind different metal (or drug) specifically at extremely low concentration. The overall structure of the family is a combination of the N-terminal DNA binding domain and C-terminal metal binding domain; and homodimer is their active form[5]. It should be noticed that MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at the C-terminal metal binding domain (Fig. 1), which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-protein complex structure.
Figure 1. Structure based sequence similarity of various metal responsive regulators of MerR family. CadR: cadmium, CueR: copper, ZntR: zinc, MerR: mercury, PbrR:lead. Those amino acids showed in bold are metal binding sites according to solved crystal structures [6] or mutagenesis analysis [7]. The metal binding site of CadR or PbrR can be speculated based on the high similarity of MerR family and the geometry of ligand field of metal ions.
    Grounded on this concept, we conducted a 3D structure modeling for MerR according the structure data of CueR, a homolog of MerR (Fig.2). Results demonstrated that the metal binding domain and DNA binding domain were probably modular for each other, which means that metal binding was independent of DNA binding. We directly tandemed two metal binding domain of MerR including dimerization helix and metal binding loop together, to make a mercury metal binding peptide ( MBP ) (fig. 3).
Figure 2. The results of 3D structure modeling for MerR based on data of CueR. (A) Crystal structure of CueR[ ], which represent the overall structure of the MerR family. The ribbon diagram depicts one monomer in color and the other in gray, with DNA-binding domain in blue, the dimerization helix in red, the metal binding domain in purple and the metal ion in cyan. (B) The predicted three dimensional conformation of Hg(II) bound MerR structure by our 3D modeling. Two monomers are indicated in green and cyan, respectively.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
As a research fellow at the institute of biochemistry, biotechnology and bioinformatics I am usually in charge of research projects in the field of antibody selection. The work and mentoring for this years iGEM team is an interesting diversion from the daily routine in the lab. It´s a lot of fun to work out an ambitious project with highly motivated students and help them with words and deeds in the lab. Particularly the combination of students from all semesters renders the work especially interesting.

Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
In contrast to the routine I am used to in the course of my curriculum where I am mostly exposed to established experiments with forseeable results, iGEM offers the possibility to plan and carry out an own research project with a team –including all the accompaniments and imponderabilities. Thus, by being part of this year’s iGEM team, I expect to get a taste of the thrill hopefully awaiting me in my future work life.

Similarly to P, PT is able to infect all   populations of bacteria, from which only XS can be turned into XL. Although all lytic phage genomes carry protospacers that can be cut by the CRISPR-Cas9 system carried by the temperate phage,   we argue that upon superinfection of XI with PT, in most cases there will not be enough time for the temperate phage genes, including CRISPR-Cas9 system, to be translated and produce a significant enough   number of protein molecules to completely stop or divert the lytic cycle to a lysogenic one.

pPSX sequence ID FJ422118
vio gene cluster complete cds AB032799 and AF172851.
Action plan of our team
Our action plan is as follows:
1. Test for violacein pigment production
2. Synthesize the violacein operon without any forbidden restriction sites. The finished gene will be BioBrick compatible and will have restriction sites around the vioC and vioD to remove these genes and form new colours.
3. Attach to the promoters of the processing system
Design
The Vio operon had numerous forbidden restriction sites.  We thus had to synthesize it, removing these restriction sites and optimizing codon usage for E. coli, to create the following biobrick:
As DNA2.0 very generously agreed to synthesise the entire operon for us, we designed it to include all the five genes, each preceded by a ribosome binding site, and flanked by the prefix and suffix. All forbidden restriction sites were removed from the operon. The final plan for the inserted operon is shown below:
This will be held under a repressible promoter on the pJexpress cloning cassette from DNA2.0. The restriction sites will allow us to easily remove the vioC and vioD which are the genes responsible for chaging pigment colour.
Creating colours
Once the violacein biobrick arrived we expressed in in TOP10 E. coli to create the purple pigment. We then carried out two more digests to see if we could create further colours:
BamHI and BglII = removed vioC and produced a dark green pigment
BglII and BclI = removed vioD and produced a light green pigment
Both of these new pigments were entered into the registry, along with the whole violacein operon for the purple pigment.
Characterisation
Proof of pigment production
Successful Pigment Production
We transformed Top10 with pPSX-Vio+.  After three colour eventually appeared, as shown below.  Interestingly, the pigment appears to remain within the bacteria, with little or no bleeding into the media. We took the violacein pigment bacteria (right plate in photo) out of the fridge to find that the purple colour had started"

Great work is done by joint hands. This year USTC had extensive collaborations with iGEM teams worldwide. We cooperated with BIT, USTC-Software, HFUT-China, SCU and UCAS, and took part in meet-up held by NCTU-Formosa and Peking University, and send newsletters to Amoy. During these cooperation, we learned novel idea from other teams as well as helped them with their works.
USTC and BIT both focus on measurement and hardware this year. Thus we face the same challenges. We are really glad that we can have collaborations in experiment, hardware and modeling.
Process
We got in touch with BIT in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July and both of us are interested in each other’s projects. In Beijing during CCiC conference, we deeply exchanged our projects and opinions on each other's project. In this meeting, we determined that we can cooperate in the aspects of experiment, hardware and modeling. After that, we assist each other though Internet and made great progress.
Figure 1. Collaboration with BIT
Result
Ultimately, USTC helped BIT building a better model while BIT assisted USTC with bacteria freeze-drying. As both of us built hardware, we shared our opinions and advice which worked in our benefits.
Modeling
For years, USTC is famous for advantage in math. When BIT met difficulty in build a mathematic model for a competitive biochemical reaction, we proved them with a solution and helped them found proper variables.
Bacteria freeze-drying
Bacteria is hard to transport, but with freeze-drying technique, plasmids can travel far away. So we hope we can freeze-dry bacteria. Important as this experiment is, we really appreciate that BIT helped us with this.

iGEM competition
iGEM is the highly successful yearly international competition for Genetically Engineered Machines. Interdisciplinary teams of highly motivated and bright undergraduate students design and build  biological nanomachines during the summer. These nanomachines are tailored to carry out tasks in, medical diagnostics, removal of pollutants or biofuel production. During the final jamboree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, the best projects are awarded.
Since 2003, over 400 projects have been presented. Last year 124 teams competed at the Jamboree in Boston, and iGEM is still growing, worldwide. To accommodate the spectacular growth in the number of participating teams, iGEM Headquarters have initiated regional iGEM competitions for 2011. America, Asia and Europe will select the best teams for the upcoming iGEM worldchampionship in Boston. Universities in the Netherlands were selected to organize the first European Jamboree in Amsterdam in October 2011.
Jamboree
The iGEM Jamboree attracts a large number of senior and young scientists; For the Europe regional event we expect about 500 students and 100 supervisors and judges. This is a significant opportunity for your organization to create visibility and collaborate with the current and future European leaders in the new field of Synthetic Biology. You will support science and education in a motivating manner - iGEM has been growing every year due to its highly inspiring educational and scientific concepts. iGEM headquarters is a non-profit organization.
The teams
Since 2003, the iGEM competition encourages undergraduate teams from all over the world to develop a project that intertwines the principles of Molecular Biology and Engineering. During summer the project is designed and taken into function in the lab. Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary approach – methods from molecular biology, systems biology, control theory, engineering and biotechnology are integrated. In practice, teams work on plasmid construction, assay development and modelling and construction of genetic circuits, metabolic and signal transduction pathways. Because of the expected impact of Synthetic Biology in fields like sustainable bioproducts, new biofuels, medical treatments and environmental technologies the teams also evaluate the social, economic and environmental impact of their project. The teams inform the general public about these technologies in workshops, videos and information in the web. The societal value of projects is therefore not solely based on scientific merit"
UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," the situation was fully understood. The outside world that we so reproached with their fancy vacuum cleaners and such was coming crashing down, and we, we were the chosen ones. God had smiled down upon us. At least that's how we saw it at first.
Then everything changed for us. Someone from the outside figured out that we were the solution. Our blood. The immunity, the cure, ran through our veins. Through an injection of just a small amount of of one of our people's blood, immunity could be transferred to another person. One liter of our blood could cure almost a thousand of the afflicted. Like a tidal wave had crashed down on us, our community was forever changed. We were at the center of the world. We had to give our blood to the children, they were the most precious. No, we should give it to the politicians and leaders, they were the ones that could rebuild society. A community once so quiet and isolated, had to make decisions that would affect the future of man. Division started to arise. We all agreed initially that the community had to act as one. Any decision we made had to be the decision of the group. It would not be so easy. Some advocated selling our precious resource to the highest bidders. The money could sustain us for endless generations to come. Everyone had their own idea of what was right, a different vision of how to shape the future. Humanity was ours for the molding. It was never said, but it was at the back of all of our minds. Until we made a decision, however, not one drop of our blood would be given to anyone. Then Tevya disappeared.  He was just a boy of 14. No one goes missing in the community. It just did not happen. This had to be something else. Then Job, then Jakob. Then Tsaitl was taken, my own daughter. Fear swallowed all of us. We finally gave in. We surrendered ourselves to the will of the Republic of South Africa in return for protection.  The bombs fell next. The other nations would not sit by and be eradicated. They demanded their own share of our blood. It seemed the greatest war in the history of mankind is about to begin. That is where I find myself. Locked in my cell in South Africa as I hear the bombs fall around me.

Synthetic miRNA Kit
miTuner - a kit for microRNA based gene expression tuning in mammalian cells
With the synthetic miRNA kit, we provide a comprehensive mean
to plan, conduct and evaluate experiments dealing with miBricks
(i. e. microRNA related Biobricks) as key regulators in mammalian cells.
Abstract
Regulation of any gene of interest has never been as easy as with our miRNA-based expression tuning kit miTuner. Rational design of synthetic miRNA binding sites according to our recommendations enables fine-tuning of gene expression in a range between 5% and 100%. Additionally, we offer Off- and On-targeting switches which effect GOI expression in only one or all but one tissue depending on endogenously occurring miRNAs.
Figure 1: Three modes of gene regulation accomplished by miTuner. a)fine-tuning of gene expression. b) and c) Off- and On-targeting for tissue specific expression of a therapeutic gene
The tuning application is based on a dual promoter construct that expresses a GOI controlled by a synthetic miRNA which is expressed from either the same or a second construct (figure 1a). Differing miRNA-binding site interaction efficiencies caused by binding sites of different sequence properties are used to distinctly adjust expression strength of the GOI.
For Off-targeting, the GOI is under control of miRNAs that are found in tissue where gene expression is thereupon silenced while the GOI can still be expressed in other tissues as visualized in figure 1b.
On-targeting is based on the expression of the GOI from a promoter containing a Tet Operator (Tet02) that negatively regulates gene expression in the presence of a Tet Repressor (figure 1c). If the Tet Repressor tagged with binding sites for an endogenous miRNA, that is specifically expressed in the target cells/tissue. In consequence, the TetR is knocked down, releasing the promoter and enabling specific GOI expression"

Step 2: Obliteration of the Illegal Restriction Sites in the Gene
It is necessary to add standard restriction enzyme sites-EcoRI/XbaI/SpeI/PstI to both terminals of each gene. However, the sequence of ompC contains EcoRI, SpeI and PstI restriction site. So we obliterated the restriction sites by site-directed mutagenesis based on overlap extension PCR. Briefly, target mutation (GAATTC→GAGTTC, ACTAGT→GCTAGT , CTGCAG→CTCCAA, ) was introduced into primers (ompC-m-A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H in table 5-2), and the four previous PCR products(ompC-AB, ompC-CD, ompC-EF, ompC-GH) were used as template for the second PCR, and the two previous PCR products(ompC-AD, ompC-EH) were used as template for the third PCR. The final PCR segment with target mutation sites was then cloned into pMD18-T vector for sequencing. The three PCR systems were listed in table 5-4, 5-5, 5-6.

Today the ligated PCR1/3 and PCR2/3 was purified by running them through a gel. The concentration of the purified constructs were measured by nano drop:
PCR1/3 = 2.8 ng/µL
PCR2/3 = 2.9 ng/µL
In order to create ""sticky ends"" on PCR1/3 and PCR2/3, the parts were fast digested. Also pSB1C3 was fast digested, so that it could be used as a backbone. The different fast digested parts were gel purified. PCR1/3 was then ligated to the backbone (pSB1C3) and PCR2/3 was ligated to the backbone (pSB1C3).
Colony PCR was performed on a colony from the yesterday transformation of the lacP promoter (BBa_R0010) and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840). Because the results showed that the sequences consisted of more base pairs than they theoretically should, a new colony PCR was performed on a different colony. The results from the new colony PCR were the same as before, with the weight of GFP just above 1000 bp and the weight of lacP promoter just around 500 bp.

This week we spent a night at an outreach event ""Beakerhead"" downtown where we helped the public draw with fluorescent bacteria. We spent the weekend with the team at aGEM, where we gave a presentation of our project and received helpful feedback on it. During the meeting on Sunday, we took on the task of biobricking our 20 synthesized constructs so that they can be submitted to the registry. Below is a table that we made which we will update at the end of each coming week so that we can keep track of what parts get to what step, which ones succeed and also when some fail (which we all know they will) that we will know where they failed and then can begin taking it back a step (or two) to see if we can get it to work on a second try. We have given each part in the ""synthesized construct"" column a shortened name: easy to identify the full name if you go to the Benchling account and look under ""Assembled Constructs"". Some synthesized parts have not been able to be successfully transformed yet into E.coli. I am going to start with the ones that have and once I am through the process once I will go back and attempt to transform them again.
Week 16: Sept 8 - 12
Blood PCR has shown to work wonderfully, with PCR products formed at a blood concentration of 20% v/v; the KAPA blood PCR kit used claimed to have optimal efficiency up to 10% blood v/v. The blood-compatibility is conferred by a second-generation Taq polymerase, engineered via directed-evolution, that is resistant to polymerase inhibitors typically found in blood. For comparison, PCR with typical first-generation Taq showed drastically reduced efficiency of amplification at blood concentration of 1% v/v.
The next step was to show that isothermal PCR (RPA), supplemented with the blood-compatible Taq polymerase, would work efficiently even in the presence of blood. 25, 50, or 75% of the volume of the isothermal PCR reaction (i.e. the buffer and water) was substituted with the KAPA blood PCR mix. Results showed that indeed the blood PCR kit supplement allowed isothermal PCR to work in the presence of up to 10% v/v of blood, when 25% of the volume was by the blood PCR mix. Unfortunately at 50% and 75% substitution, the reaction did not work at all, this is most likely due to a lack of ATP - the isothermal PCR buffer contains ATP"

INTRODUCTION
In the past iGEM competitions, human practice was always the vital and indispensable element.As a group of creators, we devoted ourselves to producing a practical and effective Bio machine.To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society which will be our target consumer and real beneficiary.Therefore, we took some actions .we designed the questionary and gave them out on the website and different communities to see whether people were interested in our project.To find out the existing questions among the sweeteners found already and to improve our project, we interview some relevant authoritative experts.Besides, market demand and trading policy are also significant for us to know about and that’s why we went and discussed with Sixin Wang, the chief engineer of SdicZhongluFruitJuiceCo., Ltd(the NO.1 company that focuses on producing concentrated apple juice) and some of the bosses in the COFCO (the one of the top 500 corporations and the most advanced food suppliers in China ) right after we finished our original plan.In the later period, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to have a large scale conference to popularize iGEM and collected the critical advice so that we can be improved.On the final stage, we met the bosses of COFCO again and we were proudly encouraged by them and they believed that we were likely to be successful in the future market.
QUESTIONARY
During we were sending out the questionaries on the website and communities, we realized that different people prefer various flavors, but most of them still were the fans of sweetness which make people feel happy and warm. According to what we found,  there is an excellent opportunity  for us to research the sweet food.Prior to we design the specific plan, it is necessary for us to learn about the existing questions relevant to the sweeteners that have been observed already.

:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and other microscopic organisms that can multiply. compound contains small molecules like IPTG and other compounds. PlasmidBackbone contains plasmid backbones come from PartsRegistry or defined by users. Substituent contains substitutes for template modeling.
:: Species: This container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set"

BRET is similar to FRET in that donor/acceptor pair is required, but BRET need not external source, rather it is powered by oxidation of substrates (Pfleger and Eidne, 2006). It seems that for our purposes FRET and BRET are too complicated and doesn't offer good enough signal to noise ratio in our application to justify the use of them. Instead we should focus on simple biochemical reporters, i.e. those enzymes mentioned above.
I have started working on the kinetics of those reporter enzymes.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
The focus of this week has been the kinetics of those enzyme based reporter genes. There are two approaches to their kinetics, one based on chemical kinetics uses coupled ODEs and another using the results of enzyme kinetics reporting values such as Km and V. I was not trained in enzyme kinetics so I found a textbook by Cornish-Bowden to learn the techniques (Cornish-Bowden, 2012). This took up most of the week.
The kinetics of horseradish peroxidase in the context of being used for waste water treatment can be found by the work of Carvalho et al. (2006). Even though we intend to use horseradish peroxidase in the context of reporter gene, but we believe the catalytic activities will be the same, so the reaction pathways for pehnols in that paper can be readily adopted for our use. On the other hand the kinetics of fluorescence of β-galactosidase has been studied by Huang (1991). However the kinetics presented is very simple compared to work done by Metelkin et al. (2009). We need to decide whatever the detailed model will give us better results to justify their complexity.
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
In this week four models of enzyme kinetics have been built in Mathematica for the study of β-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase. By using the built-in function Manipulate, we can inspect the impact of substrate/enzyme concentration on the time course of the product of interest. In special cases, such as one model for horseradish peroxidase, even temperature can be varied as well.
It was noticed that some models predict negative concentrations of enzyme intermediate even though the"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," hand, the poor results may also be due to the fact that no official, uniform definitions for Dual Use and DURC exist. Different organizations come up with different definitions leading to confusion and different understandings.
Conclusion: Interpretation of the Surveys - what can we learn from them?
Major Problems
We used the survey results to identify crucial problems in the DURC area and tackle them accordingly. We isolated following major problems:
Most scientists do not know the definitions of Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern
Education about Dual Use, Dual Use Research of Concern issues and their science communication is not part of the university education
Scientists do not know the existence of the responsible committees and who to contact for questions
There are no international and uniform definitions of the terms Dual Use and Dual Use Research of Concern
Problems entail Risks
The insufficient education of scientists on DURC issues harbors three major risks:
Loss of public trust in scientists due to poor science communication
Strict regulation of scientific research in response to unconsidered publications with DURC content
Unwitting publication of critical content due to a lack of education and contact persons
These mentioned risks will always be present if the education on DURC issues and science communication does not improve!
5. Step: How can we avoid it? Long-Term Prevention!
""The goal must be to confront every bioscientist with the dual-use problem and biorisk management from the beginning of his career and to achieve that a bioscientist is not satisfied with the compliance with the legal regulations but recognize and accomplish this special ethical responsibility."" – Dr. Carsten Roller, VBIO Department Manager Training and Career
Our goal is to integrate DURC issues and their communication firmly into university education worldwide. Only through long-term integration into the curriculum can an effective sense of responsibility be established. For this reason, we have taken some steps to achieve these goals.
Prevention measures: Let’s avoid Incidents in the Future
1.Let’s start at our university: Expansion of the Library Selection
As we would like to provide comprehensive information about Dual Use Research of Concern we think books about this topic are a great way to inform yourself. Given that, we were even more surprised that we could not find any literature at our university library about these highly relevant topics. We think this is not acceptable and miss these important issues in the inventory of our library. Therefore, we initiated and achieved the purchase of current literature about DURC, which can also be integrated into educational courses. We are proud to announce that these three books are now included in our university library

This can simply be attributed to the higher density of cells in the  2nd flask of the WT that led to an overall lesser quantity of photons passing through to the 4th and 5th flasks in the WT experiment and likely resulting in heterotrophic growth (though this will need to be confirmed with a ""dark control"" experiment that should be completed in time for the Jamboree).   This decrease in available photons for the WT can be seen by viewing the absolute irradiance data (incident light intensity at a given wavelength) after the third culture for the WT (figure 5a and 5c).   This decrease in irradiance is the most pronounced for the LH2 absorption bands at 800 and 850 nm, as was expected.  Our synthetic regulation system for pucB/A was designed with the intention of allowing greater penetration of light through the first couple of flasks at the LH2 wavelengths, as expression of pucB/A is inversely correlated to incident light intensity.
Overall, the cumulative culture growth of the WT exceeded that of DBCOmega (figure 3) due to the performance of the second tissue flask of the WT relative to that of DBCOmega (figure 1b) despite the photodamage that occurred in tissue flask 1 for the WT.  This cumulative culture growth can be considered photosynthetic productivty and is proportional to the amount of energy/desired product that can be obtained from these cultures.
It is an interesting exercise to model how our mutant system would perform under these same conditions.  To do so, the LH2 saturation curve for the WT (figure 6) and the relative contribution of LH1/LH2 light absorbance to growth was derived from our empirical data and applied to a model that took into account incident light and gave the relative growth in terms of optical density as an output.  In this model, our synthetic regulation system of pucB/A allowed our mutant to outperform the wild type species (figure 7).  This was  due to the performance of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th tissue flask relative to those of the wild type (see figure 7 layers 1,2 vs 1-5).  The reason for this is that the wild type LH2 light saturation curve does not vary with changes in incident light intensity as the wild type expresses pucB/A at a uniform level under low oxygen conditions.  As a result, the first two layers of Wild Type bioreactors absorb nearly all the available light and"

Metallothioneins (MTs) form a class of cysteine-rich polypeptides that are capable of binding a large number of metal ions.
LlMT is a kind of metallothioneins from the snail Littorina littorea and is capable of binding 9 Zn2+ or 9 Cd2+ ions. we obtained it from gene synthesis company after codon optimization.
Characterization
As an essential part in our heavy metal project, LIMT gene is expressed in our yeast after switching. To characterize the effect of LIMT gene , strains of S. cerevisiae SynV containing this gene is accumulated in YPD Medium without cadmuim ions.Then,cadmuim ions is added into the culture medium so that the concentration of cadmuim ions in the environment is 8mg/L. Atomic absorption spectroscopy is used to measure the concentration of cadmuim ions in the supernatant at equal intervals. The results are plotted as the adsorption curve in the figure.
Fig.8 the concentration curve of cadmuim ions.
The figure clearly shows the change of the concentration of cadmuim ions in the supernatant. The concentration of cadmuim ions declines over time and S.C-Cd(genetically-engineered yeast) is more capable of binding cadmium ions than control group(BY4741).

Design
This is a shortened CUP1 promoter, improved from BBa_K2165004 (
BBa_K2165004
). This promoter is designed to be deleted with a few bases on the two ends. We retained 5 ACE1/CUP1 binding sites, 2 TATA boxes, and one initiation element in the promoter. The complex of ACE1 and copper ions will bind the promoter, which causes the activation of CUP1 promoter with TATA boxes' help. In this way, this promoter played its key role with less bases.

Motivation
Team Chalmers Gothenburg suggested us to participate in their GMO survey. We asked 63 biologists and 50 respondents from general public to fill in the survey. Same thing was done in Sweden. Thanks to that we have the opportunity to compare GMO knowledge in Sweden and Czech Republic. Big thanks belongs to team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of all data.
Survey
We are pleased that we were able to collect 113 surveys. 63 from biologist - medical students of Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, specialist on chemistry and biology from Faculty of Science Charles University in Prague, medical experts from Biomedical Center of the Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen and specialist on synthetic biology. 50 from general public - people on the streets, our colleges from The Department of Cybernetics of the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the University of West Bohemia and our families and friends.
We received the English version of the survey and translated it into Czech. Each respondent got his own copy. We filled the survey with everyone individually to see the immediate reaction and to answer potential questions. In case that someone had not known what the GMO stands for we told them to enable them to fill in the rest of the survey.
Most participants answered our questions willingly. Many of them even show interest in knowing more about GMO, synthetic biology and also our project.
Results
We sent all answers to our Swedish colleagues. They statistically processed data and evaluate the results. See their wiki for more information
As we expected the biologist are more positive in the attitude towards GMO both in the Czech Republic and Sweden. This is mostly because they have more information and therefore can weigh up pros and cons. Differences in the attitude between genders in Czech Republic are not significant. However Swedish men seems to be more open to GMO them women.
People have received information from many different sources. Media is very frequent in both the Swedish and the Czech answers within all ages as well as within the academic world. The internet (mostly younger people) and friends are also common answers. School and social media seem to be a more common source of information, especially for younger people, in Sweden than in the Czech Republic. Scientific articles dominates in the academic field however quite a few people in the public have also gained information about GMO from articles. Most people of the public agree that they have not"

These colonies survived in the presence of kanamycin and chloramphenicol, because this template plasmid is propagated and harbors intact and functional chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance expression cassettes.
Figure 16. Effect of incubation time on chromogenic in vivo assays. These LB+Cam+Kan+X-gal+IPTG plates demonstrate growth of BL21DE3+pACYCdxCas9Tn5gRNA strains that are electroporated with donor DNA. (A) 1 day after electroporation with linear ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette, blue colony formation was observed, whereas (B) a week later red phenotype has developed strongly. (C) 1 day after transformation with ME flanked kanamycin resistance cassette in a plasmid, blue colony formation was observed, whereas (D) a week later purple phenotype has developed strongly.
Evaluation of colonies by several genomic PCRs have demonstrated that integration did not take place near the desired target site. The negative control used for these genomic PCRs was purified isolated gDNA of the BL21DE3 parent strain. Even transformation of donor DNA into a competent strain harboring only Tn5 did not result in colonies, suggesting a problem related to the transposase effector function of the fusion construct.
The experimental results demonstrate that the used kanamycin cassette is functional, judging from the control results. The RFP remains unchanged and functional too, allowing for identification of false positives. Furthermore, we have shown that strain BL21DE3 contains a functional lacZ copy, based on chromogenic conversion of X-gal.
Although we have shown that MEs are present and intact on the donor DNA sequence, we were not able to show that the MEs were recognized and that the donor DNA was integrated.  We would have expected either targeted or non-targeted integration, but neither occured. Even when we try out the setup with just Tn5 and donor sequence, this yielded no integration.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) verified the ability of fusion protein to load DNA adapter and sgRNA, and form complex with the target DNA (EPO).

BACKGROUND
What is ROS?
Fig. 1 Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) refers to substances that have strong oxidative properties in                         living organisms. ROS are mainly divided into four categories: hydrogen peroxide(H2O2),                         superoxide anion(O2-), hydroxyl radicals(OH-), and single-line                         oxygen(1[O2]). [1]
The harm of the ROS
Fig. 2 ROS can cause oxidative damage
The overproduction of ROS in body organisms could lead to the damage to nucleic acids, lipids                         and proteins, impede normal cellular metabolism, worse more, those oxidized substances can                         attack bodies too. The accumulation of oxidative damage will eventually induce kinds of                         diseases, such as aging, initiate cancer, arteriosclerosis and heart disease. [2]
What are antioxidants?
Fig. 3 Glutathione, one of Antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation.
Antioxidants can scavenge the excess ROS in the organisms. The antioxidants mentioned here is                         not antioxidants for food preservation, nor reductants, but working in organisms. [3]
The classification of antioxidants
To better study the performance of antioxidants in the market, we divide them into two                         categories: direct antioxidants and indirect antioxidants, according to the mechanism of                         antioxidant action. Direct antioxidants exert antioxidant effects by redox reaction to                         scavenging or inhibiting free radicals, such as vitamin C, vitamins E and proanthocyanidins.                         And indirect antioxidants achieve antioxidant activity by regulating gene expression and                         intracellular metabolism in cell endogenous antioxidant system, such as the natural                         antioxidants oleuropein, [4]quercetin, and the synthetic antioxidant probucol. The                         antioxidants that are commonly found in cosmetics and health products on the market today are                         vitamin C, vitamin E, tea polyphenols"

Question 8
Do you pay attention to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and promote low carbon life in your daily life?
你在日常生活中会注意减少自身二氧化碳排放，倡导低碳生活吗？
CO2 is a type of warming gases, its uncontrolled emissions may result in climate change. We wanted to remain people of reducing the emissions of CO2 in their daily life. We found that people would like to enjoy green lifestyle such as riding bicycle, but they need more guide lines.
Question 9
Is it safe or not to display the process of global warming on our biothermomap? Please state your opinion.
你认为在实验室中用我们的生物地图表现全球变暖过程是否安全？
Two thirds of people thought our project is safe, while the rest of them were worried about safety issue. They argued that biology students may have operation mistakes so that these bacteria could separate into environment and cause danger. We explained that we had a serious trainning to prevent any mistake during experiments. Furthermore, any biomaterial in lab must be treated before it enters the environment.
GMOs are popular in US, they usually have better properties. However, more and more people concern about the safety of genetically modified food, though some authentic organization such as FDA or WHO announced GM foods are absolutely safe. We wanted to find Chinese people’s views on GM foods, thus we ask them question 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Question 10
Which foods do you think are genetically modified? Please choose one or more.>
你认为哪种/哪些食品是转基因食品？请选择一个或多个选项。
We listed many genetically modified foods, which were obtained from internet. Results were that the majority of people know the soybean was GMO as well as anti-virus pimento. While, less than half of people considered that cherry tomato, which means many people still did not it is genetically modified. Particularly, only a few people thought the potato with smooth surface as GMO, but most of people did not know. In conclusion, we thought Chinese people could distinguish some common GMOs, however some they could not. Therefore, more information about genetically modified foods should be provided to public.

Fig.3 Relationship between antigen fixation time and result gray                                 value
It can be concluded that the reaction can be stopped in certain stage of the reaction, because it                         is uneconomical to continue the reaction. At the same time, for the initial antigen                         concentration change, the initial large reaction starts to be fast, while the initial value is                         small, the reaction rate starts to be small; at the same time, the optimum reaction time for the                         different concentrations of the added antigen is about the same, and has little relationship                         with the concentration. Finally, there is a clear relationship between the fixed time of the                         antigen and the gray value.
Adding antigen concentration and adding antibody concentration ratio relationship
In order to the final result was as expected by making the solubility of the configured                         antigen-antibody immobilization solution. It is necessary to optimize the concentration                         ratio for them.
After fixing the antigen. For immobilized antibodies, there is a reaction \(β\) and the pattern                         diagram ω2:
$$A'+R_T\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}R_TA' \tag{ β }$$
Fig.ω2 Fixed antibody pattern
If \(θ_2\) is defined, it represents the effect that is desired to be achieved when immobilizing                         the antibody, and typically the antibody concentration can destroy the grayscale percentage of                         the liquid crystal to a defined full brightness. At this time, there is another relationship                         (6):
$$[R_T]=C_2exp[Qt]+P\tag{6}$$
When the reaction is sufficient, it is assumed to be \(t_0\). For the relationship between the                         reaction \(\beta\):
$$K_a(1-\theta_2)[R_T]=K_d\theta_2$$

It seems that 6-mer amplification is somewhat successful. There is the desired band present, although there are also non-specific bands present.
9-mer amplification seems to be inefficient. The desired band is present, but is very weak intensity compared to 6-mer. In addition, non-specific bands are present.
We don't know is the accessory bands are an artifact from ICA, or an artifact from PCR. One way to verify would be to excise the band corresponding to the desired product, gel-extract, then use as template for a subsequent PCR. If the accessory bands reappear, then the problem lies with non-specific primers. If the bands are no longer present, then the artifact bands arise from a problem with ICA."

No colonies on the select agar plate. Could have some reasons: Phosphroylation could be in-successful; expanding the time, or phosphorylating the primers before doing the PCR could be done. Also could be added to the mix since it has a positive effect on the phosporylation efficiency .

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," teachers were amazed by the bright prospects of synthetic biology, but also concerned about the risks of it. Although our presentation was not able to reply to all questions and concerns, we still evoked lively interest in synthetic biology and promoted further thoughts. We would like to thank the students and teachers for the active listening and animated participation in the discussions!
2.2.2 Practical training in our lab
In addition to our presentation in the Merian-school and the Freiburg-Seminar, we invited high school students to have a work experience in our lab. We wanted to give them the opportunity get to know how our everydays work in synthetic biology. The students had the possibility to work with us full time a whole week and learn important methods such as PCR, gel electrophoresis and cell transformation. It was an excellent experience for us to teach these fresh minds the methods of molecular life sciences and it was as a matter of fact even helpful for our own project.
2.2.3 Synthetic biology and society
Around 30 highschool students from an iniciative called Netwerk Bioethik came to visit us the 12th October to learn the basics of synthetic biology and the main aspects of our project. They were preparing themselves for the international conference Synthetic Biology and Society , which was organised by the Institute of Ethics and the History of Medicine of the University of Freiburg and took place the 13th of October. We really enjoyed to speak with these students, because of their huge interest in this topic and sharp questioning!
2.3 Undergraduates – Compact Seminar: ‘Theories of the Living’
In an interdisciplinary compact course (7th-8th July 2012) of the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg called ‘Theories of the Living’ (ger. ‘Theorien des Lebendigen’) we invited students from different disciplines to work on the writings of classical philosophers (Immanuel Kant, Friederich W. J. von Schelling and Hans Jonas) regarding their notion of teleology and natural purposes. With this theoretical framework, we inquired the fact that the products of synthetic biology seems to have both, an intrinsic (natural) purposiveness – because they are a good in itself – and a relative (artificial) purposiveness – because they are being used as means to an end. Equally, we examined the relationship of an ‘intrinsic value’ and an ‘instrumental value’ in the products of synthetic biology. It was an extremely interesting and fruitful work, because the novel entities of the synthetic biology present new philosophical challenges, which are"

Section
Sections are where the content is stored. These can be edited either in the page editor or separately in the section editor. The secition content is written in a CKEDITOR frame, which allows you to write HTML as you would write a page in Word. This makes editing easier and allows users without knowledge of HTML and CSS to generate appealing content. Sections, like pages, can be assigned an image, template, position, and name.
T​he image is a setting that themes can use for section specific images.
T​he template determines which and how the content is rendered.
​The position determines the order of the sections on a page, and
T​he name is used for section headers. Themes can use the name to create links to sections.
Entities
Besides keeping track of your pages, the Wiki Wizard can also store your teams members, advisors, sponsors, and etc, as ""Entities"". Section templates can be designed to show (some of) these, thus adding members to your members section can be done with a few clicks. The entities can be edited in a CKEDITOR frame (see above) and they are associated with some settings. These settings are: image, position name, role, and link.
I​mages can be used, for example member section images.
Position determines the order of entities.
​Role is used to filter entities; e​.g. by splitting up​ members in team members and advisors.
​Name is the name of the entity.
L​ink can be used to make links to for example sponsor websites.
Menu
The menu can be used to create a nested menu or add external links to the menu. Each item in the menu can have page, parent, position, name url, and children, associated with it.
​Page is used to make a link to a page.
​Position determines the order of menu items.
​Name and url can be used to make external links. These are ignored if page is assigned. ​Parent/Children can be used to create dropdowns. Items associated with a parent will be listed under the parent and children are the items listed under the current item. The number of levels of the menu may be limited by the selected theme.

Modelling Workshop at the UK meet up
Overview
On Friday the 12th of July our team was at UCL for the iGEM UK meet up. We delivered a workshop about Mathematical modelling and using the rule-based modelling language BioNetGen. We believe the workshop presentation and handouts we developed are a great resource for those new to biological modelling.
We first gave a presentation covering the following areas:
What is modelling?
The benefits of rule-based modelling.
The difference between deterministic and stochastic modelling.
How to build a Michaelis-Menten model with BioNetGen.
NB. Information about modelling the Subtilin system is included in our lecture slides on our wiki for the extra keen but was not covered in our talk.
We then ran a practice session in which we helped people get to grips with the BioNetGen language and the software required to produce models ( RuleBender ). We provided a hand-out guiding people in how to build a Michaelis-Menten model and a simplified Lac operon model. This workshop also introduced Team:Leeds to BioNetGen which they then used in their project.

He strongly suggested that we approach Oil Sands Companies for sponsorship.
aGEM
The Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines competition (aGEM) is an Alberta-wide competition held every year since 2007. During aGEM, the Alberta teams (Universities of Calgary, Alberta, and Lethbridge) present their projects in front of respected and qualified judges who provide feedback and meet the teams one-on-one to suggest future improvement before iGEM comes around. This year, team Calgary met with ex-iGEMer Justin Pahara and was helped with their presentation in general. Other judges such as Andrew Hessel also provided valuable feedback on the team’s website, presentation and future direction. Thank you Alberta Innovates Technology Futures, for such a great opportunity.

Team:Queens/Project
From 2009.igem.org
Overview
The QGEM project centres on the treatment of atherosclerosis by targeted drug delivery from E.coli. The project is broken down into three major components. The first, and the main, component is the cell membrane protein that allows E.coli to bind to the site of atherosclerotic plaque. The second component is the inducible effector system that produces factors to treat the plaque. The last component is the terminator system that detaches E.coli from the plaque and inhibits proliferation of E.coli in the blood stream.
Part One: Binding System
Part Two: Effector System
Part Three: Cleavage and Termination
Part One: Binding System
In order to target E.coli cells to atherosclerotic plaques, we selected the VLA-4/VCAM-1 binding system. VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) is a specific marker that is commonly found at sites of damaged endothelium, such as the site of an atherosclerotic plaque. VLA-4 (Integrin α4β1 or very late antigen-4) is normally expressed on leukocyte membranes, and it directs the leukocytes to damaged sites in the vascular system. Studies have shown that the ITGA-4 chain of VLA-4 antigen can sufficient bind to VCAM-1.
Our goal is to express a fragment of ITGA-4 on the surface of the E.coli plasma membrane. To do this, we have modified the attachment system previously explored by NYMU-Taipei team 2008. Below is a schematic diagram of the binding construct.
Pconst – RBS – LppOmpA – linker - TEV cleavage site X2 – linker – VLA-4 – STOP
The Lpp (Lipoprotein signal peptide) and OmpA (Outer membrane protein A) fusion results in presentation of the protein at the outer membrane of E.coli.  Two cleavage sites for Tobacco-Etch Virus (TEV) protease are inserted between two linker regions. The TEV protease is a part of the terminator system that detaches E.coli from the endothelial cells. The length of the linker sequence between TEV cut site and VLA-4 can be adjusted in order to optimize binding efficiency.
Part Two: Effector System
Ideally, our effector system should only begin to produce the"
Korea_U_Seoul,2011,Team:Korea U Seoul#Human Practice#Ownership Innovation_-_-_TEXT.html," acid(RCOOH) to aldehyde(RCHO). If luxA and luxB(luciferase) exist, reverse pathway could be worked and the whole pathway would be rotated spontaneously.
figure.2 Design of our project
According to the [figure2], which was designed by our team, we can get fatty acyl-ACP from glucose without any alteration. In the E. coli mechanism, however, there was no fatty acid reductase pathway to get aldehyde, which is necessary to obtain alkane. So we eliminate luxAB to get a fatty acid reductase pathway. If there was no luxAB in the lux pathway, we could get aldehyde efficiently. As a result, we can get alkane as synthetic fuel. Above of all things, what we want to emphasize is that we use lux pathway, which was just used for luminescence, to get synthetic fuel.
Innovation
Tetradecanoic acid is more efficiently used as substrate for LuxC than other carbon chain carboxylic acid in vivo system of V. harveyi. In the luminescence system, V. harveyi emit a different wave length light when the substrate is changed. This system is intact in all of V. harveyi. So, If we use this system to alkane synthesis cycle, we can manipulate the alkane's carbon length that is what we want. Also, We used the luminescence system with a few alterations which is commonly functioned in Vibrio species. Before we invented our innovative procedure producing tridecane, there is no the other process to obtain tridecane in the previous research. We can produce a length 13 carbon named tridecane. There are the aspects that our product is used in the aviation industry(Jet Fuel), the synfuel like biodisel that is alternative energy. According to the Kyoto protocol, Every country all round world must reduce their emission of carbon gas. Because the carbon dioxide is a major cause of global warming, we need to reduce  at proper level. Our re-designed micro-organism can uptake wasted materials and produce alkane which is a fuel for transportation vehicle. Otherwise, our gene part is beneficial to all humankind.  Our team strongly believe it could be a innovative pioneer.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," tagged biomolecules can be observed. For an efficient FRET to occur, there must be a substantial overlap between the donor fluorescence emission spectrum and the acceptor fluorescence excitation (or absorption) spectrum ( Broussard et al., 2013 ), as described in the figure below.
FRET betweeen donor and acceptor
On the left: Jablonski diagram showing the transfer of energy between donor and acceptor; on the right: For successful FRET, the emission spectrum of of the donor has to overlap with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor.
However, fluorescence is not an essential requirement for FRET. This type of energy transfer can also be observed between donors that are capable of other forms of radiation, such as phosphorescence, bioluminescence or chemiluminescence. Acceptor chromophores do not necessarily emit the energy in form of light, and can lead to quenching instead. Thus, this kind of acceptors are also referred to as dark quenchers. In our project, we use a FRET system with a dark quencher, namely our REACh construct.
REACh Proteins - Dark Quenchers of GFP
256px
Homology model of REACh.
This homology model was created with SWISS-MODEL. We used Chimera to prepare and export a scene that was then rendered into an animation with POV-Ray.
In 2006, Ganesan et al. were the first to present a previously undescribed FRET acceptor, a non-fluorescent yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mutant called REACh (Resonance Energy-Accepting Chromoprotein). YFP can be used as a FRET acceptor in combination with GFP as the donor in FRET microscopy and miscellaneous assays in molecular biology. The ideal FRET couple should possess a large spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption - as illustrated in previous section - but have separated emission spectra to allow their selective imaging.
To optimize the spectral overlap of this FRET pair, the group obtained a genetically modified YFP acceptor. Mutations of amino acid residues that stabilize the excited state of the chromophore in enhanced YFP (EYFP) resulted in a non-fluorescent chromoprotein.

Why host a Nordic iGEM Conference?
When starting our new team this year, we discovered that there were no meetups  to which we were invited. Since our team is very international, we were eager to have an opportunity to meet other igem teams.  In collaboration with the Uppsala iGEM team , we decided that we would organize a Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC). We wanted NiC to be an annual event that would be hosted by a different team every year. To make the conference affordable for everyone we planned the sleeping arrangements and food for all attendees.
We were happy to welcome 60 students from eight out of ten Nordic iGEM teams. Teams present at the Nordic iGEM Conference were Oslo, SDU Danmark, Aalto Helsinki, Linkoping, Copenhagen, Gothenbug as well as Uppsala and us, Stockholm. We also had the pleasure to have Randy Rettberg, presedent of the iGEM foundation, in our company for the conference.
The aim of the conference was to get to know other iGEM enthusiasts and discuss our projects. One of the highlights in this year’s NiC was the competition in the Nordic iGEM Jamboree. This small Jamboree was a fun test run for all Nordic iGEM to prepare for the Giant Jamboree in September. This was a preparation for each attending team to practice their presentation skills in a competition setting.  The judging was thus performed according to iGEM Giant Jamboree Standards.
The aim of NiC was also to be able to have some time to meet other devoted iGEM participants, share our interests and have some fun together. On the first day, we organized a barbecue so we could meet the other students in a relaxed environment. On the second night, we held a traditional Swedish student dinner, with singing. On the last day, we also  offered the teams a guided tour of the city of Uppsala.
Workshop sessions
Later in the day, some workshops were organized. Participants got the opportunity to choose to attend two workshops from a list of five. The workshops were the following:

Is there a technical problem you have solved that might benefit others? If you plan to attend this workshop this might be good to discuss with you team and think about this question before the conference.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," healing, but may lead to other bacteria becoming more dominant in the wound flora. We propose to combine the expansion of our secretion system with sensing-based regulation to optimize the efficacy and minimize the chances of developing resistance against one or more of the bacteriocins.
Besides S. aureus, Pseudomonas and Enterococcus faecalis are generally reported as common bacteria on wounds (8). The Dutch experts we interacted with reported Pseudomonas as an important second bacterial strain, and one mentioned Streptococci. Other bacteria found on wounds are Proteus spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria. Most ulcers are infected by more than one species (37).
We already designed a BioBrick to target P. aeruginosa. Pyocin S5 has been shown to be effective against mural lung infections (38,39). Ultimately, we will also equip E. coli with bacteriocins against Streptococcus and other pathogens. To target Streptococci, we may use a BioBrick from the registry. Mutacin III inhibits a range of gram-positive bacteria and has known effectivity against Streptococci. Gram-negative bacteria are immune, meaning that mutacin III is suitable for production by E. coli (40). Team UCL 2016 even developed an entire biosynthetic BioBrick for the production of mutacin III.
Integrated quorum sensor
Compared to common antibiotics, few examples of resistance against bacteriocins have been reported. The resistance frequencies differ greatly per bacteriocin (16). Importantly, resistance against lysostaphin is not often seen and there are indications that it comes with reduced fitness and increased susceptibility to other antibiotics (20). A murine study showed that pyocin S5 remained effective against P. aeruginosa, without the occurrence of resistance. However, one isolate became more tolerant to pyocin S5, indicating that the development of pyocin resistance is not completely unlikely (38). To decrease the chance of developing bacteriocin-immunity, we plan on regulating bacteriocin secretion with a sensing system. This avoids the needless use of bacteriocins.
Reducing the risk of resistance is not the only argument for a sensing system. The experts and stakeholders we interacted with provide two additional reasons: adaptation to a changing wound flora and ensuring that the correct medication is delivered from the start of the treatment onwards. Dr. Peters from the VU medical center expects that as soon as the dominating bacterial strain is exterminated, other bacteria may become dominant. Thus"

Conclusion
It was an event that few people could attend, due to the conditions explained above, but from which the attendees took much advantage. Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it. As it provides a series of very useful tools for the presentation of Boston."

     Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive bacterium, considered a model organism which has been studied over the last 50 years. In this study we provided the microbiological bases to the right working of our device. In addition, we summarized the information we got so other teams can use our page as a basis to their work.
Who is it?
     When we began to outline our project, we first decided to use Escherichia coli as a chassis. However, looking at Bacillus subtilis more closely we concluded it would be a much better choice to what we aimed.
     More than a thousand years ago humans started working with B. subtilis. Japaneses discovered that fermented soybeans could be delicious at breakfast, and for centuries Bacillus subtilis has been used to produce natto1. Nowadays, Bacillus subtilis is also used as a biological factory, to produce enzymes and fine biochemicals. It’s also an interesting host for heterologous protein expression. These Gram positive bacteria can produce and secrete large amounts of protein to the cell culture medium. In addition, the genre Bacillus is noticeable by its high capacity of adsorbing and uptaking exogenous DNA2. This is one of the main reasons it has been extensively used in applied and fundamental research in the past decades.
     As a model organism, there is available a lot of detailed data about it. Bacillus subtilis was the first Gram-positive bacteria to have its entire genome sequenced and annotated (strain 168)3. Following this project, all essential genes were identified4. Currently, large-scale data such as transcriptome5, proteome6, secretome7 and metabolome8 are available.
     Furthermore, its use is promoted mainly due to the non-pathogenic nature of this organism"
NUS_Singapore-Sci,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-Sci#Project#Reporter System_-_-_TEXT.html," and a mCherry gene (Fig 1). Here, mCherry is expressed constitutively and used as a marker for transfection efficiency and the overall fusion protein expression level. The EGFP gene is modified such that the start codon of eGFP is mutated (ATG→ ACG), resulting in a truncated  GFP that is non-functional (Fig 1). Since the minimal fluorescence region for EGFP is from amino acid 7-229 (Li et al., 1997), this truncation mutation will cause the production of non-functional EGFP protein, while mCherry expression is not affected. However, when this mutation (ACG→ ATG)  is corrected by our Cas13b-APOBEC system, the normal expression of EGFP is restored and can be visualised either on a fluorescence microscope or the flow cytometry.
Both the mcherry and the EGFP fusion protein is linked by a self-cleavage peptide, T2A. T2A is a self-cleavage peptide where the ribosome will fall off from the mRNA once when it reaches the T2A oligopeptide and translation be restarted for the next fluorescence gene. We chose T2A among the 2A family peptides as it has the highest cleavage efficiency (Liu et al., 2017). This is to ensure that expression of EGFP and mCherry are under the control of the same promoter, such that the level of mCherry fluorescence is linearly correlated to the level of EGFP fluorescent. In this way, the mCherry expression would be a useful indicator to normalise the expression of the dual reporter system between individual cells in a transient transfection experiment.
The relative number of editing events can be quantified by the percentage of dual-colored cells transfected with mutant ACG reporter as compared to cells transfected with the WT reporter, or relative green fluorescence intensity after normalizing to the red fluorescence intensity. We will be testing our reporter system in both E. coli and transfected HEK 293T cells.
A further modification to original EGFP and mCherry sequence is a 6 amino truncation at N terminal of EGFP and 7 amino acid truncation at C terminal of mCherry. Since EGFP and mCherry have same nucleotide sequence for first 22 and last 23 nucleotides, such truncation makes cloning easier. Moreover, since bacteria like E.coli can utilize alternative start codon GUG up to 13% of times (Hecht et al., 2017), and the first 18"
BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," autoclave cycles, so the autoclave would be run less frequently. Tracking the number of autoclave cycles we consolidated was one way in which we sought to quantify our impact. In addition to consolidating autoclave cycles, we practiced meticulous sterile technique. After a mostly-full liter bottle of media was badly contaminated early in the summer, we recognized that contaminated media results in running more autoclave cycles. To reduce the impact of contamination, we made 50mL aliquots of media so that if contamination occurred, we wouldn't lose a full liter of media. Thus, practicing robust sterile technique and aliquoting media allowed us to use less energy and water to autoclave media.
Experimental Design & eVOLVER
Our conscious efforts to be more sustainable in the lab guided every decision we made regarding experimental design. The Khalil Lab's culturing platform, eVOLVER, was an excellent tool that allowed us to exert control over an array of parameters while maintaining high throughput of data. In addition, the eVOLVER was designed such that all of its vials and sensors are reusable, eliminating a significant source of waste. However, preparing the eVOLVER is a highly involved protocol that involves bleaching and flushing fluidic lines, autoclaving vials, and making about 3 liters of media. Thus, it was clear to us that minimizing the environmental impact of our use of the eVOLVER would require careful planning of experiments.
Since the eVOLVER preparation involved using a lot of energy and resources, we wanted to make sure that any colonies we tested in the eVOLVER were inducing properly. In order to test our colonies, we grew them overnight in a reusable 24-well culture block in 2mL of media in our shaking incubator, then used a photography lamp with a colored bulb to induce for 8 hours. Including 60:40 cells:media dilutions every hour, these experiments used approximately 205 mLs of media at maximum - less than 15-fold of the media required for an eVOLVER experiment.
Once we verified that our colonies worked, we restruck plates with the best colonies so we wouldn't need to keep testing new ones for future experiments. Then, we used our verified colonies in eVOLVER experiments to gather robust characterization data. The Khalil Lab uses a Google Calendar to coordinate eVOLVER experiments, making it very easy for us to plan out dates for our eVOLVER experiments. To further minimize our energy consumption, we scheduled eVOLVER experiments in pairs when possible, so"

Controversy around biodegradation
While reading about PLA, we noticed there was diversity of opinions on its biodegradability. We decided to take an skeptical point of view and we performed a little experiment to empirically observe what happens in daily conditions.
Project insights
We carried out our PLA system development and its experiments before and during the human practices procedure, which made it difficult to apply on the wet-lab investigated issues. However, we stopped to think about how could we help on bioplastic society impact.
High prices of PLA products compared with petroleum-based equivalents hinders the consumption of this bioplastic. As those prices are related with low yields of PLA production, we decided to work on efficient ways of production through conceiving a DIY efficient bioreactor.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Press_-_-_TEXT.html," zu wenig Spenderorgane. Allein in Deutschland sterben Tausende schwerkranke Patienten, während sie auf ein Organ warten. Studierende aus München haben nun eine Lösung gefunden. Sie drucken die Organe einfach aus. Okay, ganz soweit sind sie noch nicht, aber sie machen erste Schritte in diese Richtung.
""Wir versuchen letztendlich Zellen, also Gewebe, mit einem 3D-Drucker zu drucken. Dazu haben wir einen konventionellen Plastik-3D-Drucker umgebaut zu einem 3D-Bioprinter."" Luisa Krumwiede, Studentin an der TU München In Boston haben die Studierenden von TU und LMU München mit ihrem 3D-Biodrucker den großen Preis der Biokonstrukteure gewonnen - als bestes von über 300 Teams aus der ganzen Welt.
Gedruckte Gewebeschichten Um Gewebe zu drucken, geben sie Stamm- oder Bindegewebszellen in das Gerät. Die Zellen sind genetisch so verändert, dass sie Rezeptoren auf der Oberfläche haben. Damit können sie an andere Zellen andocken. Dann kommt noch eine Art Biotinte dazu. Die wirkt wie Klebstoff und bindet sich an den Rezeptor. Am Ende kommen aus dem Drucker dann miteinander vernetzte Zellen, die durch die Biotinte zusammengehalten werden. Bisher können die Studierenden mithilfe dieses Verfahrens nur dünne Gewebeschichten ausdrucken. Von einsatzfähigen Organen sind sie noch weit entfernt.
Das Verfahren der Münchener Studenten unterscheidet sich von anderen Versuchen, künstliches Gewebe herzustellen. Bisher hatten Forscher mit einer Art Gerüst aus Hydrogel - das an Wackelpudding erinnert - gearbeitet. In das können die Zellen vom Drucker eingesetzt werden. Bei diesem Verfahren nehmen die Zellen dann selbstständig Kontakt miteinander auf. Das Problem: Die Hydrogel-Methode ist aufwändig und teuer. Außerdem muss das Gel später wieder entfernt werden.

In the schools
We made presentations introducing genetic engineering to students of class 11 and 12 (equivalent to high school sophomores and seniors respectively) in 5 different schools across 3 different cities.
Broadly, the presentations had 3 parts:
a. Definitions of some basic terms used in genetic engineering such as gene, promoter, operator, inducer, reporter etc and how to put together these modular components in constructing genetic circuits.
b. A simple, binary framework for quantitatively analyzing the outputs of simple genetic circuits.
c. Introduction to iGEM, our project and some previous years’ projects.

TCU_Taiwan,2014,Team:TCU Taiwan#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," a control system, and predict a chaotic time series, all yielding remarkable results. Comparisons with artificial neural networks and earlier work on fuzzy modeling are listed and discussed.
 
3.Building the Model
To build the model,we created, trained, and tested Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System   (ANFIS).We performed the following tasks:
1.Data pre-processing
2.Loading the Data
3.Generating  the Initial ANFIS Structure
4.Training the ANFIS
5.Validating the Trained ANFIS
 
1.Data pre-processing
We generated 70 data from our experiment and then picked $1\over 5$ of them randomly as Training Data. The other $4\over 5$ is treated as Testing Data.
Because our results are too large (at least 108), we divided them by 1 x 106. This can help us analyzed these results more quickly.
2.Loading the Data
To train the ANFIS, we must begin by loading a Training data set that contains the desired input/output data of the system to be modeled. Any data set we load must be an array with the data arranged as column vectors, and the output data in the last column.We also loaded Testing data.
 
3.Generating the Initial ANFIS Structure
Before we start the ANFIS training, we specify an initial ANFIS model structure as below:
 
Fig3.1  Initial ANFIS Model Structure
The branches in this graph are color coded. Color coding of branches characterize the rules and indicate whether or not and, not, or or are used in the rules. The input is represented by the left-most node and the output by the right-most node. The node represents a normalization factor for the rules.
 
4.Training the ANFIS
After loading the training data and generating the initial ANFIS structure, we started training the ANFIS. The number of training Epochs(Epochs means number of iterations) is over 2500.
During training we can see how Training error develops as below:
Fig3.2  Training Error
 
5.Validating the Trained ANFIS
Finally,we had to test our data against the trained ANFIS.After the ANFIS is trained, validate the model using a Testing data that differs from the one we used to train the ANFIS.
When we test the testing data against the ANFIS, it looks satisfactory.

Zhang Hao, or Trumpet, is a sophomore in Physics. YES, his English name is Trumpet, because his Chinese name has the similar sound with the trumpet.he loves cats, and he is simply the most artless person in the whole team. Sometimes, He even labels himself as a 'cat'.
Si-Yuan Zhuang, majoring in Computer Science, having mastery of programming and bug-fixing,   contributes a lot to improving the quality of the code and designing the cache system. He often  has fun with others (e.g. hacking Zhang Hao's server). Though once a platform developed by him  for our software was deprecated, he did not feel depressed.
Tianyi Cui, known as little Cui, is the leader of the backend of our project. He has a bad eyesight but he seldom take his glasses. He is an outcome boy in the team, always filling with novel ideas in his mind. He could play a little ping-pong ball but he never wins Zhi Li.
Cui Yanxuan, or E-Neo (His screen name) is a jonior majoring in Geophysics (seems nothing to do with biology?). He is interested in computer and crazy about opensource software.

TU_Eindhoven,2014,Team:TU Eindhoven#Safety#Kill Switch_-_-_TEXT.html,". Therefore it is hard to implement this system in E. coli. Another issue is that our plasmids are IPTG induced just like this kill switch, which means that that the timer would start as soon as we introduce IPTG for protein expression.
When implementing the zwitterionic antifouling protein, gene transfer could occur which could be an issue and therefore we thought about an existing kill switch idea that is more probable. The idea is the Gene Guard system (iGEM Imperial College London 2011) which prevents horizontal gene transfer and therefore prevent the exchange of genetic material. A plasmid contains a gene that codes for holin that attaches to the inner membrane and a gene that code for endolysin which causes cell lysis. Antiholin will be integrated in our plasmid and will inhibit holin. This will cause no pores formation in the inner membrane and the endolysin cannot enter the periplasm to break down the outer membrane. This means that the bacteria always need the plasmid with antiholin sequence and the plasmid that encodes for endolysin and holin or else cell lysis occurs in case of plasmid exchange.

Synthetic Peptides
Two of the previously described protein tags (SpyTag and Intein) can be used with synthetic peptides for covalent immobilization. First the peptides need to be bound to a matrix. In a second step they interact specifically with their corresponding protein-tag, thereby forming a covalent bond. Afterwards, the matrix can be loaded onto columns in order to modify solutions passing it. The covalent binding of tag and peptide ensures that the protein can not be washed from the column and is essential for systems, where the immobilized protein should not be detectable in the product solution.
The peptides consist of a tag-specific and an immobilization region. The tag-specific region is specific for the reactivity of the peptide with its corresponding protein tag.
The synthetic intein consists of 6 amino acids (GVFVHN) and was for purposes of better steric accessibility extended at the C-terminus by the two amino acids G and A generating the desired active GVFVHNGA peptide of the intein. This synthetic peptide interacts with the intein part of our fusion proteins which leads to an event similar to splicing. For a detailed mechanism visit the wiki-page concerning Protein-Tags .
The synthetic SpyTag consists of 13 amino acids. The sequence did not require additional modification since it was proven by Zakeri et al. in 2011 to be suitable for our needs. The resulting functional sequence of the SpyTag is therefore AHIVMVDAYKPTK. The reactivity of this part is mediated by the aspartic acid at position 7, which forms an iso-peptide-bond with a corresponding lysine residue in the"

Negative control test
Purpose: Contamination appears to be rampant in everyone’s PCR products. This will test our reagents used in PCR master mix and help determine where the contamination is coming from.
Protocol: 3 samples were made: the negative control PCR product from yesterday (already amplified); new master mix with old water; and new master mix with new water. A PCR with pTaq DNA polymerase was conducted in accordance with the procedure outlined on the protocol page.
Results: These are shown below. All of the purportedly negative controls are contaminated, including the new master mix made with new ddHOH. This implies that the communal reagents used in the master mix are also contaminated with a sequence that is specific to LuxO primers.
