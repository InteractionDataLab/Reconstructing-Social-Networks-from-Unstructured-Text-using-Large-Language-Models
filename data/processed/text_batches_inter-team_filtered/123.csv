Future work: What’s next for Synthetic Palm Oil?
Whilst our iGEM Project is over, we looked at a variety of ways to build onto our project in the future.
Beta-Carotene Enhanced Palm Oil
It may be possible to optimise the palm oil produced to provide a healthier alternative to traditionally produced palm oil. One such example of this would be the introduction of beta-carotene into the palm oil component mix.
Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for a variety of health aspects – from eyesight to a strengthened immune system. Vitamin A can prove toxic at high levels, which is why introducing beta-carotene would be a safe alternative. The human body only converts sufficient beta-carotene to reach optimum vitamin A levels – preventing a potentially toxic excess of vitamin A.
This idea could potentially make use of the work of Uppsala iGEM 2013 , who have been working on genetically engineering beta-carotene as part of their project this year.
Implications for the taste and appearance of this optimised palm oil alternative may however make this goal hard to achieve. Many food production companies would be keen to derive the benefits of beta-carotene enhanced palm oil but would be unlikely to implement such a product if changes to appearance and taste occurred as a result of using beta-carotene enhanced palm oil.
Waste paper/agricultural materials as a source of Glucose
After attending the 2013 YSB 1.0 London conference and speaking to the UCL Academy team we were really interested in how we might find an alternative feed stock to glucose. Achieving this would dramatically decrease the running costs of any palm oil production plant, as glucose is one of the major cost factors in starting materials for production of our synthetic palm oil. The UCL Academy team worked to produce a cellulase BioBrick (due to be submitted to the registry in 2014) which would break down particular cellulose fibres in paper structure, producing glucose. We would also be interested in exploring the application of this biobrick in terms of the use of cellulose from agricultural waste, such as rice husks, as a feed stock. Not only would this reduce the cost of producing our palm oil, but would also aid in the disposal of waste.

Threshold Regulation
Threshold limitation
In the early days of radio, AM transmitters were vulnerable to overload by an input signal of too great a magnitude.  To protect the transmitter from damage, a limiter circuit was employed to attenuate signal peaks while allowing all subthreshold signal to pass through unchanged.  We have designed a genetic circuit that behaves similarly.  Our gene network reacts to the level of transcription of a gene of interest, limiting it to levels above or below a user-defined threshold.  In our proof-of-concept, we use synthetic transcription factors to limit the expression of an inducible reporter.  In practice, these modular transcription factors can be used to regulate any endogenous gene with a known promoter and transcription factor DNA-binding domain.  Extremes of gene expression can damage living systems, while normal expression is healthy.  Our limiter could react to the level of a gene's expression within individual cells, correcting problems only where and when they occur.

CAB Extraction vs. Hydraulic Fracturing CAB Extraction Survey Lethbridge iGEM Human Practices
CAB Extraction vs. Hydraulic Fracturing
The University of Lethbridge 2012 iGEM team has proposed a modified microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) method for the extraction of unconventional carbonate oil deposits. CAB (CO2, acetic acid, and biosurfactant) extraction will utilize the natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars needed to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. These products will be pumped down into carbonate oil deposits where the acetic acid will react with the rock to increase the pore sizes and help to pressurize the well site, and the biosurfactant will help reduce viscosity to further enhance extraction yields. In order to develop CAB extraction into a sustainable method for unconventional oil recovery, a comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts and technological feasibility will have to be performed. The University of Lethbridge 2012 team is aware that our proposed method for CAB extraction would use similar methods for accessing unconventional resources as hydraulic fracturing, and we would like to address some of the issues that have been identified with this technology.
With operations starting as far back as 1949, hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a well stimulation process used in the oil and gas industry to enhance underground resource extraction.1,2 The process involves high-pressure injection of fluids into buried geological formations to open and enlarge fractures in the rock, creating pathways for trapped hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore at higher rates.2,3 The hydraulic fracturing fluids are a composition of water, sand, and various chemicals added to protect the integrity of the wellbore, create and maintain the fractures, and enhance the flow of natural gas.2 Today, computer programs are available that can predict fracture geometry and model fluid movement through the fractures to assist in determining fracturing fluid compositions.4 After fracturing is complete, the injected fluids rise to the surface through the wellbore and are stored in tanks, pits, or underground reservoirs before disposal or recycling.3 Hydraulic fracturing has been criticized by a variety of groups for its negative impact on"

Introduction
Discovery of GANs
Goals
Introducton
The computational content we present in these software sections are directly responsible for the motivation and creation of CAT-Seq!
Just as the iGEM year has started and our Team was formed, we readily acknowledged the main “big picture” problem we want to solve in synthetic biology - the difficulty of creating novel, synthetic parts. In particular we were interest in synthetic catalytic biomolecules.
Catalytic biomolecules are a cleaner and greener substitute to chemical catalyzers used all over the world. The catalytic biomolecules offer an enormous 17 orders of magnitude chemical reaction acceleration as well as excellent stereo-, chemo- and regio-selectivity in aqueous environments. Yet, one of the main drawbacks of using enzymes is that for many important chemical reactions, efficient enzymes have not yet been discovered or engineered.
That said, identifying enzyme amino acid sequence with the required novel or optimized reaction is a challenging task because the sequence space is incomprehensibly large.
The discovery of Generative Adversarial Networks
While exploring the possible ways of solving the previously described problem we have stumbled upon an article describing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As we were not familiar with these relatively new neural networks at that time, we have studied the examples of what it has already achieved. The main idea of GANs is that it can learn the patterns of a given data input in order to generate examples as if they were from a given dataset. For example, if shown enough cat images, it will not start to generate an exact, specific cat image from the dataset, but it will learn how a cat should look in general. That results in a GAN that may produce cat images which do not have analogs in the dataset. A completely new cat!
We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer drug molecules"

Background
The ability to reproduce results in biological systems is difficult due to the stochastic nature of living cells and inconsistent laboratory practices [1]. Comparing quantitative results between experiments is often difficult with many variables impacting the results. These may include:
The various instruments used and their different calibrations
Variation in laboratory practices/protocols
Systematic variability e.g. differences in strains used, physical laboratory conditions
Variation in interpreting and communicating results
Macquarie Australia’s iGEM team is very excited to be a part of the 2016 Interlab study [2]. This study builds on previous years attempts to compare results between multiple iGEM teams at an international level.
Aim
Macquarie University iGEM team is participating in the 'Third International Interlaboratory Measurement Study' for the first time, which aims to better understand the measuring of fluorescence using a standardised protocol to quantify the variability across different laboratories.
Participating iGEM teams measured fluorescence exhibited from the green fluorescent protein (GFP) across three test devices that have different promoters and ribosome binding sequences (RBS). This was to calculate expression levels of five different reporter constructs using fluorescence/OD600. At Macquarie, we used a spectrophotometer and a plate reader to measure fluorescence, following standard iGEM protocols. We hope that in the future the scientific community can better compare and communicate results with each other. This collaborative effort is a small but meaningful step towards that goal.

Started new dialysis on 2 silk samples (10 mL of LiBr silk, each)
START: 10:10 AM
Change 1: 11:10 AM
Change 2: 3:07 PM
Removed the silk from the concentration dialysis that was started yesterday at 900 AM
that is around 19 hrs, 20 minutes on the concentration
managed to only get around ~300 uL back from the cassette
4 mg in 20 uL = 200 mg/mL = 20g/100mL = 20% w/v.
I don't know how this managed to get so concentrated in less than 20 hrs.
I think concentration dialysis is to difficult and wasteful (20 hr dialysis to obtain less than 1 mL of silk)
going forward, HFIP is probably easier to work with
If we do do concentration, it will have to be for less than 19 hrs.

Para-Aminobenzoic acid
Para-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a substance which is commonly used in sunscreen [Sambandan2011]. It is able to absorb UV-B light in the range of 290-320 nm. It has been shown that PABA reduces UV damage [EC2006]. Recent studies have been shown that PABA is an allergen. In our case this will not be a problem, since PABA does not leave the cell. Also we plan to culture the cells in beads which will also be a barrier in chase the cells are dying.
E.coli is producing PABA as a intermediate in the folate pathway [Wegkamp2007].To achieve an overproduction of PABA we are overexpressing the enzymes which are responsible for the formation of PABA (pabA, pabB, pabC) (see Figure 1). Studies have characterized these enzymes and indicate that by overexpressing them PABA is overproduced.
The overproduction of PABA will increase the UV resistance of our bacteria and therefore we can use them to absorb dangerous UV light on our skin.

E.coil: Our responsibility to save the world!
With great power comes great responsibility. E.coil has the responsibility to produce fatty acids and save the world!
Since the mankind found the oil, our life has changed a lot. For example, we can fly in the sky like superman and we can move really heavy things just like superman. In short, oil is the essential chemical for multiple uses.
Q: Now that the oil is rather important, why we need fatty acid? I mean, why not sugar? What is Fatty acid?
A: Fatty acid = Oil!
Fatty acids with different carbon chain length and saturation levels can be widely applied to industry, food, medicine and many other aspects. Most importantly, it is a very promising feedstock for the production of eco-friendly biodiesel. And this could be the potential power source to compensate for dwindling fossil energy.
Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, however, the processes of FFA production are restricted by seasonal, regional and many other factors. Besides that, the cost of producing is so high that it cannot be intensively industrialized. Given that, our super-E.coli emerges at this significant moment and take its obligation to save our world from energy crisis.
So, let’s give it up for E.COIL!

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia and presented the prototype of our project to them. Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the"

Baltimore_BioCrew,2018,Team:Baltimore BioCrew#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". For all of the constructs, we codon optimized for E.coli. One construct included a His-tag for nickel column purification and a LacI promoter for tighter regulation and inducibility. The second construct included a His-tag while as the third was just the codon optimized construct. We named these constructs “Cerastocytin” after not being able to pronounce Lethbridge’s construct.
After being interested in the possibility of using snake venom to coagulate blood, we looked into other possible enzymes that could be incorporated into other constructs. We researched multiple different snake serum proteases, such as Batroxobin and Russell’s Viper Venom. However, we ultimately decided on Russell’s Viper Venom since Batroxobin has carbohydrates that would not work well with E.coli. Also, Russell’s Viper Venom has been tested in numerous laboratories and has been able to speedily and effectively coagulate mammalian blood.
We decided to design our constructs similar to how we created our Cerastocytin constructs. We created three constructs and codon optimized all three of them. The three differing constructs were the exact same as the Cerastocytin constructs, except that instead of having the Cerastotin enzyme, we replaced it with the Russell’s Viper Venom serine protease.
Although the most commonly talked about cause of death in Baltimore are shootings, the clot breaking team decided to focus on the actual most common cause of death in Baltimore: heart disease. More specifically, diseases that were caused by clot formation, such as strokes or heart attacks.
Finding a method of decoagulation was not difficult, as the clot breakers researched what the human body naturally uses, as well as what is clinically used, to decoagulate blood: tPA. Potential issues were brought up with the folding of the tPA, and as such, the clot breakers sought out to find another more consistent option. Ironically following the trend of the project being related to snakes, the clot breakers found a relative of tPA (reptilase) that is shorter with fewer disulfides, and thus was more likely to fold correctly. These two genes were used to design two constructs. On top of that, the clot breakers added a T7 promoter to both genes to better regulate their expression (though a construct was designed using a standard constituent promoter for a variation of the standard tPA construct).
To test our constructs efficiency, we planned to transform our constructs into DH5∝ E.coli cells, run a colony PCR screening, send them off for sequencing, and run protein gels."
Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," process. The majority of gene regulation happens at the post-transcriptional level, with factors changing the shape of mRNA’s 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) in response to a range of factors including light conditions, and nuclear signals indicating conditions such as the point in a C. reinhardtii cell’s circadian rhythm [7]. This results in extremely dynamic mRNA degradation and translation rates, making gene expression very hard to model accurately. Further complicating the matter is a reasonably noticeable lack of data on absolute gene expression levels in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast.
After a considerable literature review, no absolute, dynamic data on mRNA levels in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts was found. This meant that the only way to accurately parameterise the gene expression portion of the model would be to perform wet lab experiments – however, our part library took sufficiently long to assemble to prohibit the running of these experiments in the allotted time. Thus, our parameters are likely to only give rough, order of magnitude solutions.
The transcription rates, katpA and kpsaA (for genes expressed under the atpA and psaA promoters respectively), are likely to be tied to be strongly tied to promoter strength. However, in lieu of any data on the strength of these two promoters, we used the simple order-of-magnitude transcription rate formula proposed by the NTU-Singapore iGEM team in 2008 [8]:
Eqn 9
This formula has been used by several iGEM teams since, with reasonable accuracy reflected in the results. The psaA promoter is used to express the 20 nucleotide gRNA + 455 nucleotide gRNA scaffold (for 475 nucleotides total), and the atpA promoter used to express the 4196 nucleotide Cas9 mRNA. It should also be noted that these promoters were chosen based on personal correspondence with Prof. Saul Purton, and could be changed to different promoters if experiments show them to be superior, further validating our decision to use a more general estimate of transcription rates.
RNA degradation rates vary considerably throughout the C. reinhardtii cell cycle, responding to factors mentioned above. Regulation happens primarily through formation of stem loop structures, mediated by the UTRs which are attached to the promoters, altering the RNA stability [9]. However, while the mRNA for Cas9 is expressed with the 3’ and 5’ UTRs for the atpA gene cluster, gRNA is not expressed with any UTRs for proper interaction with Cas9. This leads to a large number of unknown factors in"

While the positive control did show an increase of fluorescence to a maximum of ca. 20000 relative fluorescence units, there appeared to be something wrong with the pSBX expression strains. We did not have the time to check what exactly was wrong with the cells, but it's not because of the vectors, because we successfully used the pSBX1A3 to express our K1319020 fusion protein.

Our goal was to explain them what is iGEM, so they would be                         even more                         interested in synthetic biology and that in some future decide to join this great iGEM                         community. We gave them                         the whole panorama of what is required to participate in the competition. Another thing we                         achieved by                         explaining the basis of our project ""Tec Tissue"" was to raise awareness about the problem we                         are facing through                         and with this they would be more interested in these lines of research. At the end of the                         conference the                         students were really interested IN participating in the next iGEM competitions and to learn                         more about our                         project.

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," educts were dissolved in ionic liquid, rhamnolipid-rhamnolipid in ionic liquid. Bottom left to right: chitosan+divinyladipate-chitosan and divinyladipate were dissolved, chitosan+rhamnolipid-chitosan and rhamnolipid in ionic liquid, rhamnolipid+divinyladipate-rhamnolipid and divinyladipate were dissolved in ionic liquid.
Figure L.1 indicates that a solid compound only precipitated if all educts were added to the reaction. In the control approaches no solid precipitated. Following, the reaction was successful when all educts where mixed.
In order to find the ideal molecular ratios between the educts we tried different amounts of the substances. After diverse approaches we concluded that a ratio of one part AGU (anhydro glucose unit) chitosan per two molecules of rhamnolipid and divinyladipate (1:2:2) resulted in an optimal surface. This  ratio is equivalent to 1 % (w/v) chitosan and 0.93 mM of rhamnolipid and divinyladipate. The resulting surface showed the best properties regarding precipitation and antimicrobial effect. This surface was used for antimicrobial tests and ""Demonstrate"" .
Enzymatic linkage
For enzymatic linkage of nisin to chitosan we used a tyrosinase. This enzyme is described in diverse publications to link proteins to chitosan ( [L.2] , [L.3] ).
Prior to further experiments the activity of the tyrosinase was tested. Figure L.2 shows the activity of the substrate turnover of different tyrosine concentrations by tyrosinase.
Figure L.2: Enzyme activity of tyrosinase EC(1.14.18.1). The absorbance 280 nm was plotted over time in minutes. Different tyrosine concentrations were diluted in phosphate buffer. The reaction was started by adding 1 Unit tyrosinase.
In Figure L.2 you can see the increase of absorbance at 280 nm in time indicating the oxidization of tyrosine. By oxidization of tyrosine the electron system of the aromatic ring is changed leading to a shift in the absorbance. The graph shows a sigmoidal curve which is typical for an enzyme reaction. The higher the tyrosine concentration the higher the"

ODEs
In the genetic circuit of Dual-feedback oscillator, the three promoters are the same hybrid promoter composed of an activation site and a repression site. They can be activated by the araC protein in the presence of arabinose and repressed by the LacI protein in the absence of IPTG. The mechanism of dual-feedback makes oscillatory behaviour stable and adjustable.
There are four states of promoter: original promoter without inducer, bound with araC dimers (
), bound with lacI tetramers (
), bound with araC and lacI tetramers together.

We assume that araC dimers and lacI tetramers combine with promoter separately without interference. So it means that
AraC dimers and lacI tetramers are generated through their monomeric versions.

We also tested the filters over a period of 72 hours and measured the copper concentrations at the end in each of the three experimental trials. The filter was able to bind nearly all of the copper in solution to almost undetectable levels, and the plain mycelial material displayed remarkable properties as well.
Figure 8: Cu (µM) remaining in solution for n = 3 samples after incubation for 72 hours while undergoing tangential flow on a flatbed shaker (figure design credits: Jesica Urbina). Experimental conditions were maintained as described previously.
Summary and Conclusion
We were able to rationally design, produce, prototype, and extensively characterize our vision for a mycelial water filtration and biomining system that is fueled by synthetic biology and protein engineering. We created tangible filter strips to demonstrate how our methodology could feasibly be applied in actuality, going beyond just a proof-of-concept phase. These prototypes were able to bind >92% of copper in solution (at >300 μM Cu concentration) within 30 minutes. They are relatively inexpensive, completely biodegradable with ease of metal extraction, and require low, less complex upmass in comparison to bacterial or cellulose-based filters (which require complex sugars for sustenance). A patent disclosure was submitted to NASA on 10/16/18. Our results demonstrate the utility of our end-to-end filtration system in solving water and biomining-related challenges both on earth and in space.
Mission Architecture
Using 425 ml of Anabaena liquid culture (@ end, OD600 is 1.449; OD750 is 1.035), oxygen production went from .8% to ~5% in 60 seconds. Then, oxygen gained 2.7% in 73,560 seconds (with an almost perfectly linear increase).
Given the empirically established rate, it will take ~92 hours (4 days) to achieve 20% oxygen, mimicking Earth's atmosphere. This time-frame is certainly reasonable in the context of our mission architecture. Therefore, we have empirically quantified oxygen production for mycelial growth and astronaut sustenance, demonstrating promising results from cyanob"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Fostering relationships within their synthetic biology community is  a crucial component to the iGEM journey. By collaborating with other teams, we were able to aid our peers across the world while getting to know them a little better. Team VesiCure collaborated with iGEM teams by answering surveys, exchanging protocols, planning experiments and participating in an international effort to spread awareness and make synthetic biology more popular.
Oxford University collaboration
The University of Oxford iGEM team also spent the summer working with outer membrane vesicles and constructing fusion proteins. By Skyping with their team, we had the opportunity to discuss different OMV purification protocols and exchange ideas about mathematical modeling translocation pathways, protein size considerations for export and periplasmic targeting.
UIUC Collaboration
In our project we have used signal sequences to direct a large protein (saCas9) to the bacterial periplasm. We have used Gibson assembly multiple times to switch between different signal sequences. UIUC is working on developing a cheaper, but equally effective, Gibson assembly method. We collaborated with UIUC and prepared a cloning experiment swapping signal sequences to test their new protocol.
Postcard campaign
Our team also participated in an international effort to make synthetic biology more popular by exchanging postcards with different teams. We received hundreds of postcards from the US and Europe, which we shared with the Synthetic biology club at Northwestern (GeneMods) and used to decorate our lab space. Our very own postcard can be seen below. Thanks Cologne Duesseldorf for this great initiative!"

The podcast was promoted by various outreach organisations in Oxford, as well as on our own social media accounts. Our podcast can be listened to here:
Oxford Sparks is an online resource dedicated to advertising Oxford’s scientific research and encouraging young people to consider a career in STEM subjects. Their website contains a range of resources to support teachers to make science engaging for students, as well as showing an insight into the lives of researchers. We collaborated with Oxford Sparks to promote careers in synthetic biology to young people, including running a ‘iGEM Twitter Takeover’. During the Takeover, we tweeted photos of our work during the day, including the lab work, online research and outreach events. Through this, we hope to have promoted our research in an accessible way, as well as demonstrating the collaborative and diverse nature of scientific research.
In addition to the online educational resources aimed at school students, we engaged in work to promote our project and genetic engineering to adult audiences. The Oxford Scientist Blog is aimed at university students, staff and the general public to address current ideas in the science field as well as research that is being undertaken at the university. We wrote an article for the blog to explain our project and how genetically engineered probiotics may have applications in modern medicine. The blog article can be viewed: here
Additionally, we wrote an article that featured in Phenotype Journal - a science magazine produced by Oxford University Biochemical Society - to explain our project and our involvement in the UK iGEM Meet Up.
Long-term Education Plan
Based on our outreach work, it was clear that the general public has an insufficient understanding of genetic engineering and are therefore unable to make truly informed decisions about using genetically engineered medical products. Informed consent is a complex ethical concept that plays an important role in the research and clinical practice, describing the fact that a patient must be fully informed about the treatment and its associated benefits and risks before opting whether to take the medication. Since the information about both probiotics and genetic engineering is commonly misunderstood by the general public, the production and use of our treatment should be accompanied by a drive to educate the public about these issues.
We believe that assessing the problems associated with public acceptance of GM foods, where the introduction of GM foods into Europe “prompted major conflict”, is vital to the development of effective strategies to ensure public acceptance of genetically engineered probiotics. The European introduction of GM foods has been heavily criticised due to the failure of researchers, industry and public authorities to “address concerns prevailing among the general public”.

d-AuNPs Generation
In order to generate dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles, first a gold chloride (HAuCl4.H2O) stock solution of 50 mL was prepared by dissolving 393.8 mg of HAuCl4.H2O in 50 mL of distilled sterile water. After preparation, this solution was stored at 4 °C covered in aluminium foil.
Secondly, a 10% sterile sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution was prepared by dissolving 4.985 g Na2CO3 in 50 mL MilliQ water, after which the solution was filter sterilized.
Then, 200 mL distilled sterile water was be adjusted to pH 9 by carefully adding 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drops of 20 uL at a time, while keeping the solution sterile under a flame.
Subsequently, 25 mL of dextrin solution was prepared by dissolving 625 mg of dextrin powder in 25 mL of sterile MilliQ water to obtain a concentration of 25 g/L. This solution was then added to a sterile 250 mL flask.
Then, 5 mL of the gold chloride stock solution was added to the 250 mL flask and the pH was adjusted to 9 with the sterile 10% sodium carbonate solution, while working sterile.
Lastly, the reaction volume was completed to 50 mL by adding 20 mL distilled water (pH = 9).
For the actual generation of the d-AuNPs the flask was then incubated at 50 °C, covered in aluminium foil with continuous shaking for 3 to 8 hours. After 3 to 8 hours shaking, a reddish colour was observed on the solution that is characteristic for the correct size nanoparticle formation. The solution was observed every 30 minutes to check for red color formation.
Transmission Electron Microscope analysis was performed to check the size and size distribution of the d-AuNPs. the suspension of d-AuNPs in distilled water (ratio 1:4) and sonicate it for 5 min. Then, after plasma treatment this solution was be transferred to a copper grid for imaging. The correct size of the d-AuNPs be in the order of 10 nm.
We observed d-AuNPs in a relatively low concentrations. Also, the sizes varied unequally around 100 nm, which is an indication of aggregation as the expected sizes are around 10 nm. Therefore, a new batch"

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.

For reasons of simplification, in the following we will refer to the genomic levels of LldR without overexpression from a plasmid as ""no lldR"".
Results
Initial experiments with all nine promoters showed a clear bias of functionality towards the three versions resembling the architecture of the natural lldR-promoter (data not shown). For further experiments we therefore focussed on these versions:
natural version for reference BBa_K822000
engineered PlldR with high promoter strength BBa_K1847007
engineered PlldR with medium promoter strength BBa_K1847009
engineered PlldR with low promoter strength BBa_K1847008
We were lucky to establish a collaboration with Stockholm, where they offered to characterize the less favorable designs for us. In the following we will only focus on the four most promising versions.
We continued to characterize our reduced set of promoters by recording dose response curves amongst a broad range of lactate concentrations. The first thing to test was whether or not our promoters actually respond to lldR as we expected them to, i.e. if GFP intensity would be properly repressed in the presence of lldR. The resulting data is shown in Figure 4.

A is BBa_K1847009 (low), B is BBa_K1847007 (high) and C is BBa_K1847008 (medium). The dose-response curves for our synthetically designed LldR-promoters over a four orders of magnitude range of lactate concentration (1 uM to 335 mM) was determined 7 hours after induction.

5.13 Determining E coli Concentration With Spectrophotometer
I) Purpose
To determine if OD600 can be used to determine E coli concentration
According to reference The number of cells in a bacterial culture can be estimated by reading the absorbance at 600nm (OD600). For E. coli cells, an OD600 of 1.0 ≈ 5E8 cells/ml
II) Expected Outcome
linear relationship between absorption and 1/dilution factor
III) Reagants Used
E. Coli BL21 overnight from 5.12; LB prepared by TA in 100mL flask
IV) Actual Procedure
1. Dilution series
Label 6 tubes 1 through 6, to each of the test tubes add 2mL of LB.
5mL of E coli overnight (21 hours) was to test tube 1. The content was then pipetted up and down to mix well.
Performing dilution series by transforming 5mL from tube n to tube n+1 in order of n=1,2,3,4,5. The dilution factor is thus 7/5
2. Measurements using spectrophotometer
Spectrophotometer was warmed up and set to take measurements at 600nm.
Pure LB was used to as blank
Before each measurement, the cuvette was rinsed with 1mL of distilled water and 1mL of E coli solution to be measured.
1mL of E coli solution at various concentration was pipetted into each cu"

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Aspects#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," come to Scotland if it weren’t part of the UK?
JE: I think that people want to do good, high quality research, and those opportunities exist in Scotland. It is necessary to ensure that the universities are funded properly, and that would be a priority of the Scottish government, but provided that’s done, the universities will continue to survive and thrive under independence, I’ve absolutely no doubt about that.
J: From our discussions with academics, we felt that they were not certain about their position post-independence.
JE: The concerns are absolutely legitimate, I’m absolutely confident that the Scottish government will be able to provide the reassurance that the people seek, because it’s in our interest to do that. At the end of the day, if you’ve got the fiscal levers, if you’re in control of your own finances then you can then determine what your priorities are, and there’s absolutely no question that higher education would be a priority for Scotland, and life sciences research within that. We would find the resources to match the current funding, and I think over time to exceed the level of funding. Because that’s where our comparative advantage as a country is going to be, in key sectors such as Life Sciences. One of the things that’s great is that we’re attracting some of the best brains from across the world to come and study in Scotland and then to go on and work in important research.
J: Yes, our entire academic group in our School of Biological Sciences is very international; researchers are coming from all over the world to work here.
JE: The links that have been built up over many years within the UK, those will continue, professional cross fertilization of ideas and research is something everybody wants. Scotland and England and other countries within the UK will continue to cooperate, what we are seeking to do is to create a new institutional framework, so the MPs from Scotland who currently go to Westminster would withdraw, and the Scottish parliament would have responsibility over the areas that are currently reserved for Westminster parliament. That’s not to say that the governments would not work together, and we’ve already got an embryonic system, if you think back to the Northern Ireland peace process, one of the things that came out of that was the Council of the Isles, or the British-Irish council, which has it’s secretariat in Edinburgh. It brings together the UK Government, the Republic of Ireland, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the crown dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man, which have very small populations, yet sit at the table with the devolved administrations and"

We first fused split luciferase to either N or C terminus of dCas9 (Figure 5a) to see its influence. Then, provided that initial binding of dCas9 depends on the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, a short 3’ motif adjacent to target sequence) [11], four sets of sgRNA orientation settings were also tested (Figure 5b). One set placed two PAM sequences distal from the spacer sequence between the sgRNA pair, with the 5' end of the sgRNA adjacent to the spacer (PAM-out) while another set put both PAM sequences adjacent to the spacer (PAM-in). PAM-direct 1 and PAM-direct 2 combine both sgRNA orientations with one PAM sequence adjacent to and another distal from the spacer (Figure 5b).
In total, 16 pairs of split luciferase-dCas9:sgRNA complexes were constructed and tested (Figure 5c). Most of these pairs worked very well.  Among them we selected Nluc-dCas9/Cluc-dCas9, the most robust protein construct with minimal intergroup difference, and PAM-out, the sgRNA orientation exhibiting the strongest luminescence, for the following study.
Figure 5. Construction and optimization of PC Reporter system. (a) 4 different split luciferase-dCas9 fusion strategies. (b) 4 different sgRNA orientation settings. In orientation PAM-out, the pair of PAM sequences are distal from the spacer sequence, with the 5' end of the sgRNA adjacent to the spacer; in orientation PAM-in, the pair of PAM sequences are adjacent to the spacer sequence, with the 3' end of the sgRNA in proximity to the spacer; in orientation PAM-direct 1 and PAM-direct 2, one PAM sequence is adjacent to and another distal from the spacer. (c) The experimental results of PC Reporter systems using 16 different (4 different constructs X 4 different sgRNA orientation settings) configurations.
As the reconstitution of enzymatic activity was constrained by the distance between Nluc and Cluc [11], we varied the spacer length from 5 bp to 107 bp (Figure 6) to find how it affects the performance of our PC Reporter system. Results showed that the PC Reporter system worked with a preference for spacer length of about 21 bp when two fusion proteins bind at the same side of the"

Unfortunately, we found we can achieve the same result of PCR whatever the template is if we use the same pare of primers. In contrast, we can't find there is any similarity between template and primers. We are really confused about that. It means that we can't test the success of co-transformation by PCR.

KAIST-Korea,2010,Team:KAIST-Korea#Notebook#Memo#Idea_-_-_TEXT.html," this we can use this. If we make this, we can make a flip flop which is basic component of memory system. problem If we use chemical as input and output we have to control chemical level. We have to make a system threshold to differentiate 0 or 1.
Yeastgrapher
This idea is making a photographer with yeast. We are making a photographer with RGB cone cell and fluorescence. There are already exists a study about cone cell receptors. We are thinking that we make RGB ratio as 40:20:1 like human retina. Film would be yeast. Therefore it can grow infinitely. problem film is not copiable. We have to be careful not to get light on film after taking a picture. It is not a matter of sensing but processing the images on brain. Therefore we are not sure that it would work.
Copyteria
We make a system as a copier. We put dye or degrader in e.coli. it would be important to design threshold. We have to make bacteria to be alive during the coping process and loose its color after the coping process. So we are making bacteria ink. problem We don't know the threshold for the light to be copied. And we might have to do this in dark room. Since the idea is getting the image from the reflected image we don't know how this reflected image would be copied.
Oscillator
There are memory network that remembers. And with that we can combine this with telomere. We can later use this protocol.
Sound
Using vibration maybe we can make bacteria make sound.
RBC trap virus
RBC can trap virus because virus can't replicate in RBC. But this system need to use fake cell only to delay. And only has probability to trap. Therefore it is not perfect system. Maybe Since it is making delay, we can use it at rabies because its infection timing is faster than recovering timing.
Mammalian cell replication tool
There are many steps in mammalian cell replication if we make a mammalian cell replicatable in vitro, it would be very convenient in laboratory life. Maybe we can work on mammalian cell replication tool or DDS that works on respiratory system. So we decided to look for that information.

Queens_Canada,2018,Team:Queens Canada#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Rendezvous provided an opportunity to expose children of various ages to what our team does, and better explore the topic of DNA and cell biology, we were      thrilled to partner up with Science Quest at Queen’s University for a more focused session. Science Quest is a not for profit science, technology, engineering and mathematics      (STEM) based program that operates at Queen’s University. Fortunately, we were able to lead a short mentorship program for a group of students in grades 6-8 to teach them all      about DNA. Our lesson plan consisted of a short presentation outlining what DNA is, how is is transcribed into RNA, followed by the translation process to produce proteins.      We started by doing a helix-building exercise to teach about the structure of DNA and how the base pairing between nucleotides works. To do this, we utilized licorice,      toothpicks and mini coloured marshmallows for an informative (and yummy) experiment. The second part of our lesson plan was to teach the basics about how DNA codes for      different amino acids. By providing them with both the DNA and mRNA sequences, as well as a codon chart and list of amino acids, we created a “DNA code breaker” game for them      to play. By using the mRNA, they were able to determine which amino acid it was coding for, and then use the one-letter code to spell out our secret messages. We ended our      session with some fun cell biology and DNA trivia.

SynBio Club
QGEM has always had a focus to provide a high-quality research experience to its students and others in the Queen’s University community. During the school semester,      QGEM typically runs a SynBio Club to casually discuss novel ideas and showcase research being done at Queen’s by inviting professors to speak. We believe it is      essential to create a better understanding of the diverse range of applications synthetic biology has in research, medicine, agriculture, and the environment to      truly encompass and express its importance to society.
This year, we extended the club to the summer months, extending our invitation to those within the Kingston community. We created a new series of synthetic biology      presentations, each followed by a structured open discussion period. Each hour-long session highlighted a different synthetic biology application and focused on a      specific example from a recent scientific publication.

Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Biobricks, and their associated web based resources (such as the registry of standard parts) were introduced to the team. Additionally, the goals that we as a team should be working towards were presented, with an emphasis upon human practices and how they could be used to create a better project from the outset.

Week 12
February 2018
After the discussion session with Karolis, we have decided we want to use microfluidic technologies as the base for our system, as it seemed to be an extremely efficient starting point - the high-throughput is already there, we just need to enable it. Also, this discussion has led us to discover the main concept of the problem we wanted to solve with our project – the barrier to high-throughput sequence to function information acquisition is the loss of that information once all of the microfluidic droplets are broken.
.
Week 13
After a short while we have determined the main goal of our journey – creating a method that enables the high-throughput biomolecule activity and sequence recording inside of each of the billion droplets and then quickly and accurately retrieving that information.
Designing the solution
Week 16
The first question we asked was - what is the object that we can write the activity information into? After hosting a discussion together with Vilnius University students and later analysing the current workflows of various microfluidic techniques we have quickly came to conclusion, that such object should be a thing that already contains half of the information we wanted to record - biomolecule DNA sequence.
.
Week 17
We have presented our earliest form of the idea to the researchers in the Life Science Center - the problems we’re currently facing in synthetic biology, the solutions we have right now and our idea of how we can solve those problems by building a new method based on droplet microfluidics.
More
We have received extremely positive comments about the idea we wanted to achieve. The comments were based on the future promise of what such system of activity recording could bring to the field of synthetic biology and multidisciplinary research. During the discussion, researchers have also shared some of their ideas on how it would be possible to record the activity into the DNA sequence. One of those we liked in particular - recording the activity into the DNA in the form of DNA modifications.

Week 19
After the discussion with the LSC researchers, we have explored literature and brainstormed the possible ways activity could be linked to DNA modification.In addition we have met with Justas Vaitekūnas that has in depth expertise with DNA modification research. Justas has told us about various of techniques which he uses to DNA molecules during his research. As we discussed the possibilities of this approach we have all came to conclusion, that even though we could modify DNA in some way, we still did not have the link mechanism between biom"

To chose the most appropriate backbone we made a complete study of the different Origin of Replication (Ori) of the iGEM standard backbones becasue our team members was experiencing problems in finding an actual low copy number plasmid in the registry. Results indicated that the only real low copy number plasmid is pSB3K3, which contains the p15A Ori (clik here for detailed results). Also different resistance marker was required to select for two plasmids in the same cell, being chloramphenicol and ampicillin.
Separating toxins and antitoxins.
Once having obtained the toxins cloned in pSB3K3, our aim was to separate the toxins and antitoxins using agarose gel electrophoresis and showing that toxins and antitoxins sequences were completely separated.
For more specific details about the materials and methods used in our project, please, go our journal and protocols section.
Results and discussion
Cloning the T-A systems in pSB1C3
Building BioBricks for the double interdependent T-A system was a challenging task because the toxins, as the name implies, are toxic to the cell. Colonies were obtained both for toxins and antitoxins, but when verified by restriction digestion, only the antitoxins were obtained in both types of cells E. coli DH5a and JM109 (Figure 2). The most probable reason for this results is that the LacI promoter is leaky and that even without a promoter the toxins are transcribed and translated being toxic for the cell, causing the cloned DNA to rearrange and lose the toxin coding part. Kis and Epsilon antitoxins, can be found in the registry under the code BBa_K1493602 and BBa_K1493603 .

built around the male world
. For example, presentations. She had observed many male tutees stand up and be naturally confident in their ability to talk in front of a crowd, however, she noted that it is more intimidating for the female tutees. Consequently, we have to consider if universities are doing enough to promote confidence in all students.
There was a statistic, highlighted by Dr Lewis, that if men and women were applying for the same job, the male candidates would tend to apply if they met 5 out of the 10 criteria whereas the female candidates would only apply if they had met 9 or all 10 criteria. Considering this, it seems that higher institutions are not doing enough to inspire confidence in all their students and there is this bias towards one gender.
It is the unconscious bias that is holding people back now
The unconscious bias is a well-established concept which states that our brains make quick assessments and judgements about people, places and concepts without us being aware of it. Shaking the unconscious bias would potentially spell the end to ‘accidental’ inequality and sexism, in that people would no longer be unaware of certain actions that are offensive towards others. Dr Lewis argued that
a lot of sexism in science is due to the unconscious bias
but because of it, women
have to work harder to be taken seriously and it’s really difficult to do anything about
. Both Dr Santos and Dr Griffiths talked about the need for a massive social and structural change in science and in society for there a reversal of gender inequality and lack of diversity and this idea of the need to eradicate the unconscious bias compounds these thoughts.
When we spoke to the students asking their opinions on gender inequality in science, many commented on their observations of fewer women at higher levels of academia and how they didn’t know why the distribution was like this.
It really kicks in PhD/postdoc level when you’re asked to talk a lot more and it becomes much more part of how people perceive how good you are
Dr Lewis indicated that a reason why fewer women stay in science at higher levels might be because of how they are perceived by peers and how they are judged for what they do. She said
at undergraduate level...people can hide behind their computers
however at more senior levels, more is weighted on how you present your data and thus you cannot hide in an anonymous essay. She said at the Aurora Leadership programme, she was surrounded by incredibly intelligent and important female scientists however
every single one of them said they suffered from imposter syndrome at some point during their career.
We therefore again have to question why there is this"

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cells’ enhanced growth rates because polyamines are indispensable for cellular growth, which may at least partially explain why cancer patients with increased polyamine levels have a poorer prognosis. [3]
Polyamines synthesized by cancer tissues are transferred to the blood circulation and kidney, where they are excreted into the urine.
Polyamines are also produced in other parts of the body and can be transported to various organs and tissues such as the intestinal lumen where polyamines are absorbed quickly to increase portal vein polyamine concentrations. The majority of spermine and spermidine in the intestinal lumen is absorbed in their original forms because there is no apparent enzymatic activity present to catalyze their degradation. [3]
Patients with increased polyamine levels either in the blood or urine are reported to have more advanced disease and worse prognosis compared to those with low levels, regardless of the type of malignancy. [3]
Polyamines and colorectal cancer
Polyamines are involved in almost all steps of colonic tumorigenesis, their roles in hyperproliferation.
Regarding all described roles of polyamines in colonic tumorigenesis, it seems likely that polyamine deprivation, modulations of the polyamine metabolic pathway, as well as impairment of polyamine uptake into neoplastic cells in the colon, can be a logical though not specific way of chemoprevention and chemotherapy of colorectal cancer. [2]
Polyamines and their metabolizing enzymes could be, above all, reliable intermediate markers of neoplastic proliferation in the colon, and clinically relevant parameters of follow-up in colon cancer chemoprevention trials.
Specific inhibition of polyamine-synthesizing enzymes, and ODC in particular, has been long considered as a desired goal in chemoprevention and chemotherapy for hyperproliferative diseases, including cancer. [2]
The results of these trials are eagerly awaited, and will be most helpful in estimating a true value of the concept that depletion of colonic mucosal polyamines can prevent the development of colorectal cancer. [2]
Polyamines as tumor markers
N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine (DiAcSpd) are minor components of human urinary polyamine that have been associated to tumor markers in urine. [5]
Diacetylated polyamine derivatives, N1,N8-diacetylspermidine (DiAcSpd) and N1,N12- diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm), are derivatives of spermidine and spermine, respectively,"
Valencia_Biocampus,2014,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," cells had reached the stationary phase, the output obtained could be more homogeneous. We are currently testing that.
In any case, with the results we obtained, we have to conclude that Biobrick parts do not behave in a standard way even whitin strains of the same bacterial species.
Orthogonality results
In Synthetic Biology, two constructions can be considered orthogonal when they only interact at specific and predictable interphases, and do not disturb                each other. We have studied this desirable feature of Biobrick parts by combining two constructions in the same cell and comparing this output with the one                produced by simple transformations. To do this, we used both standard fluorimetry assays and flow cytometry, which allowed to get information at the cell level. Then, we wanted to go one step further: what is the effect of a simple transformation (a plasmid with a Biobrick part) into the cell architecture? To get some insights about this, we performed a proteomic analysis in which the whole proteome of an E. coli strain transformed with a Biobrick part was                compared to that of the non-transformed, control strain. Last, but not least, a detailed set of equations modeling the behavior of cells carrying two Biobrick parts was developed.
1. Standard Fluorimetry assays
We performed experiments with two different combinations of Biobrick parts containing a fluorescent protein under the control of a promoter sequence from                Anderson’s promoter collection: Bb1 (GFP with strong promoter J23104) + Bb2 (RFP with strong promoter J23104) and Bb2 + Bb3 (GFP with less strong promoter                J23110). In all cases, several controls were used: wild type (non-transformed) cells, simple transformations with either the biobrick or an empty plasmid,                and co-transformations of the biobricks and the empty plasmids. It has to be noted that there was a high background emission of red fluorescence by the cells in all cases. Our results are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
General protocol(1)
Strike the desired strains on LB plates with the appropriate antibiotic. Allow to grow by incubating at 37°C at least 24 hours.
Gather a large amount of bacteria with an inoculation loop and transfer to 1 mL of LB. Incubate during 20 minutes at room temperature.
Inoculate 100 µL of bacterial suspension in a tube containing 3 mL of LB with antibiotic. Perform three biological replicas of each combination of Biobrick                   parts.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Patrick_-_-_TEXT.html," in the field of Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM Team for the TUM and their stories stunned my very much and I wanted to join a team by myself. I worked for my Bachelor's Thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at the Faculty of Life Science at the TUM, were I had a lot to work on my own and plan my work. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM project.
Jan Kampf
Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" at the Georg-August University of Goettingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Goettingen as well. For my bachelor  thesis ""Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response"" I  worked at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen. During  my time as a bachelor's student in the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry   I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries   raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated   me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning   experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking   forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of   young students as well  as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a   multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM   project of the other teams.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," (18°C) in dry air carton boxes. Within the      Groningen Archives the air composition and quality paper is      controlled by a system in the building because the presence of      acid in paper, that can come either from air or plastic, is the      most common reason of disruption of the stored paper. We found      out that if it is true that on the one hand, even with the right conditions the low      quality paper (for example from newspapers) cannot be stored      for a long time (a few decades), it is also true that by      taking right and strict controlled conditions some high quality      papers can be stored for even hundred of years.
Bacteria could replace paper as storage media in a future… It seems possible…
This is why, for 20 years the Groningen Archives has been preparing    for the change from analogous data storage to digital data storage.
“Two things are important: the storability and the    accessibility” - Jan Jaap Hoogstins
“DNA in spores is a considerable option (for the    storing of information)  if the information does not change through    mutations” - Jan Jaap Hoogstins
According to Jan Jaap Hoogstins, collection manager from the Groninger Archieven, the nature of the medium used for the storing does not matter as long as it is insured that the stored information is completely preserved. For him, “DNA in spores is a considerable option if the information does not change through mutations”
As result of this interview we found out that our system can be used for such Institutions for the long-term storing of information, according to Jan Jaap Hoogstins, “there is no system yet that stores information forever in an entirely preserved manner”
However, Jan Jaap Hoogstins insisted that the bacteria must not present mutations…
In order to consider this problem CryptoGErM has done some research and modelling about it!
We found out that it is unlikely that there are mutations in the message stored in our system. For more details and full description please go here .

Alkaloid isorhy against Parkinson's
- It is rumoured to be a potential treatment for Parkinson's and it would make a good project if this were to be produced by bacteria
- On further research it turns out that the evidence for this drug as a treatment is weak and there is no information available about the gene or genes that encode it, so the idea was dropped. (Text by Frank)

Vampiric bacteria
-The aspect of a Vampiric bacteria that is designed to get rid of blood clots produced by trauma induced clotting or during complex medical procedures is intriguing.
-Expression of Hirudin is possible in systems such as E. coli. In 2007 Berkeley produced a chassis for a E. coli that could be introduced into the blood stream after inactivation. -However, it is difficult to have the non-viable cell lysis occur in the correct location and therefore an anticoagulant could just as well be injected into the patient. -For this to work, we would require an expression system that is able to express Hirudin (produced usually by leech salivary glands and has been successfully expressed in E. coli [1]), express anti-angiotensin (it is possible to express Fab fragments in E. coli [2]) and targeting the fibrin (can be done by expressing Tissue plasminogen activator). -The idea would be to have the chassis recognize a blood clot or an area of damage and prevent clotting and/or clear clots. A method for having the system recognize when to secrete hirudin would be by having the bacteria sense trauma related chemokines and have the chassis secrete the protein only when it senses above a certain threshold of these chemokines or we could try to express protease-activated receptors (GPCR) that are cleaved by activated thrombin (the target of hirudin). Direct application would only benefit over the use of leeches in that the chassis is more aseptic then a leech bite. The biggest issue remains the fact that for this to work we would have to inject the patient with living E. coli that can evade the human immune system.

Result
The strategy for the function testing of engineered CEN.PK2-1C stains △far1 +△sst2, △sst and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 were divided into the following parts;
(1). Test of the inhibitive effects on the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C whose cellular period can be stopped at the G1 stage by  α factor.
(2). Expression and identification of Pfus+RFP+cyc1t+PRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2.
Zone of inhibition
Plan and method
The growth of CEN.PK2-1C can be inhibited by α factor, we want to  test the function of △sst2, △far1+△sst2 and △far1+△sst2+△ste2 by comparing with CEN.PK2-1C .
(1) Explore the influence of the growth of each strains cultured with different concentrations of α factor in the solid plate medium.
(2) Observe the growth situation of these strains and compare the differences among them. Analyze the functions of these strains cultured with different concentrations of α factor in the solid plate medium.
Results and discussion
(1) The strain CEN.PK2-1C stops growing at the phase G1 due to the effects of the α factor and zone of inhibition appears in the solid plate medium.
Fig.1 inhibition zone of CEN.PK2-1C
(2) The strain △sst2 is more sensitive to α factor. Meanwhile the larger zone of inhibition will appear when the concentration of α factor increased.
Fig.2 inhibition zone of △sst2
(3)The far1 of △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 is knocked out successfully, and these strains will still keep growing under the effects"

Macrophages, as part of the innate immune system, produce NO to kill off the tumour. Research by Xu et al., shows that NO has greater activity when the tumour is less differentiated and hence a higher grade.
Using NO as a chemoattractant, the low and high levels of NO produced by cancer cells and macrophages, respectively can be perceived by the sensor which can target drugs directly to the tumour. An alternative method is to use oxygen as a chemorepellent so modified cells can specifically target hypoxic cells. Specificity can be increased through the use of targeting using specific peptide sequences which home onto receptors or glycoproteins which are specific to tumour cells such as the NGR peptide (Pasqualini, R. et al. 2000).
Diagnostics
This image is from the Cambridge E.chromi project, showing the coloured faecal matter as a form of diagnostic which has potential for identifying damage to the gut.
NO is produced throughout the mammalian body in a range of cells, including endothelial cells (Bedioi.F .et al., 2002). NO has a range of functions within the body, from being a secondary messenger within signalling pathways to being a relaxing factor within the cardiovascular system (Pang,J. et al.,2003). Abnormal levels of NO can be an indication of diseases and disorders such as hypertension, impotence and obesity (Bedioui.F .et al.,2002). A NO sensor can be used to aid diagnosis and treatment of a range of diseases and disorders. For example, measuring the NO level of externally exhaled air can be an important and non-invasive diagnostic for airways inflammation. This is due to endothelial cells producing NO synthase (eNOS), both constitutive and inducible (iNOS). The iNOS is induced by pro inflammatory cytokines, as well as there being an increase in enzyme expression after exposure to oxidants. Therefore, measuring the NO level produced by eNOS has led to finding that there are higher levels of epithelial nitric oxide when asthma is untreated, and that there is a fall after anti-inflammatory treatment (Narang ,et al., 2002).

2013 -Project title: To drink or not to drink
Abstract: Our project is focused on developing a biosensor specific for certain water pollutants, with a modular and scalable approach. This approach would make it easy to adapt the response for the detection of different substances. In contrast to other iGEM biosensors, it does not rely on expensive equipment or qualified people to interpret the results. Being aware that most of the populations affected by consumption of contaminated groundwater don’t have scientific or technical training, we intend the device to be cheap and easily distributed. We have designed it in a way that any user could easily determine the presence and level of the contaminant on drinking water, using image-based instructions. The project will focus on measuring a primary pollutant: arsenic. However, its modular and scalable design provides an easy way to measure various contaminants such as nitrate/nitrite among others.
BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS
Argentina has around 120 biotech-related companies involved in different areas, among them the production of drugs for human and animal health care, seed production and micro propagation, animal management and assisted reproduction. The companies earn billions annually 3,140 pesos (about 1.0 billion U.S. dollars), exporting approximately ¼ of what they produce and generate employment for about 3,000 people.
Out of the 120 companies that make up the framework of biotechnology in Argentina, 98% are nationals. Only those related to the production of seeds, inoculants and industrial inputs feature multinational companies. The picture is completed with the presence of nearly a dozen joint ventures (both private domestic capital as public). Argentina features 58 micro-enterprises, 52 medium-sized companies and only 10 companies are classified as large. In relation to its billing, micro firms represent 48% of the bill and a little over 7% of the total. In opposition, a dozen major companies (less than 10% of total firms) covers almost half of the total turnover.
The difference of  capital origin is only in its innovative billing and conduct. While foreign companies tend to centralize their development at their headquarters, allocating fewer resources to local development, local companies invest  less than 10% of its sales in Innovation and Local Development.
Regarding the synthetic biology, there is no specific companies in this area. Companies that produce genetically modified organisms are related to seeds, human health, animal health, industrial supplies, etc.
The biotechnology sector is group composed of several national and international companies. We include in the Argentine panorama BASF, Bayer"

Background
Phase-field modeling overview
Phase-field models are mathematical models used for solving interfacial problems. They are based on the             generalized free-energy functional approach (lattice Boltzmann), meaning that the system evolution is             driven by the minimisation of free energy. Important thing to note is that sharp fluid interfaces in the             models are replaced by a thin transition region where the interfacial forces are distributed in a smooth             manner. This provides model an easy treatment of topological variations at the interface1. In order to             describe phases in numerical form, equations use phase variables ϕ. In three-phase systems, phase variables             are described as ϕi , where i = A, B, C, and the variable is equal to 1 in the phase i and 0 outside.
Typically used phase-field models for two and three phase fluid systems couple fourth order nonlinear             advection-diffusion equations, called Cahn-Hilliard equations, which represent the evolution of the phase             variables with the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid motion2 . Equations (1), (2) and (3) form the             traditional Cahn-Hilliard equation, and Eq. (4) is Navier-Stokes equation - both of them are used in our             calculations on COMSOL
M0 is the mobility tuning parameter that determines the relaxation time of interface and the time scale of             diffusion in C-H equation. It should be noted, that interfacial diffusion (the Gibbs-Thomson effect) is             inevitable in phase phase field method because the diffusion term is used in the right side of Eq. (1). Due             to this, prolonged simulations of our system result in spheres diffusing and constantly changing their size             (Fig. 1). Because of that, we have chosen to analyze only the first few spheres formed in every simulation             as their"

Meeting with Javier Yugueros Marcos (Biomérieux), cf report.
Having some fun with a stepper motor that does not rotate… What I and Thomas noticed is that the stabilised alimentation is limited in current. We expected to provide 2 A but we only have 0.04 A. The Arduino might be the reason but that would mean that alimentation is directly connected to the Arduino, that is to say that the H bridge is invisible in the circuit whereas it is a new one… However, for sure something in the circuit limits in current.  Still working on it tomorrow.
05/24/2018
Alright I am a “little” late on this notebook, so I’ll try to summarize what I’ve done since 5/17.
→ the motor finally worked, a little resistance had to be put off the circuit, as it did limit the current.
→ I wrote my first weekly wiki, I am not sure that everything is useful for the website but whatever
→ The fluorescence unit changed. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence requires an absorbance measurement to normalise fluorescence, as different concentration of bacteria might give the same fluorescence. So that means that a light detector should be placed under the sample with an excitation filter to get rid of fluorescence and only detect the transmitted light. However, according to Lucas, absorbance is relevant to be measured when light diffusion can be neglected which is not our case, so this is to be thought on.
→ Anyway I found better filters for each case (fluorescence and absorbance) and better LEDs with high power.
→ I wrote a few protocols about fluorescence and the impact of different parameters. I expect to work in the lab next week, probably on tuesday
→ We succeed with Thomas to create a magnetic field from a home-made coil, as we attracted a metallic screw.

SAFETY
Our project is not expected to raise any safety issues in terms of researcher, public or environmental safety. The health risks associated with the organisms used and the work completed could be classified as very low to moderate. None of the biobricks we submitted raise any safety concerns. In terms of biosafety rules to be followed, we would consider Biosafety Level 2 to be a sufficient indicator of safety requirements. This stems from the fact that the organisms involved are Escherichia coli and Staphilococcus aureus. However, in practical use (e.g., hospital setting), level 3 facilities would be required. This is to account for several factors, including the increased potential for highly pathogenic strains in the vicinity, as well as the very unlikely possibility of a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli obtaining the AIP sensing characteristics of our StaphiScope model.  In terms of biosafety issues which could be useful for future iGEM competitions, the appearance of a desired biobrick into a pathogenic strain of bacteria would be the biggest concern. The potential for such an occurrence would be limited by Biosafety Level 2 rules, as described below.
Facilities, equipment, and procedures which are required to contain risk group 2 organisms at Level 2 have been met:
1.Laboratory separated from other activities
2.Biohazard sign
3.Room surfaces impervious and readily cleanable.
4.Equipment includes an autoclave

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," answers lead us to notice that the group above 35 years old has a tendency to refuse GMOs and to accept more easily living bacteria and chemicals in their products.  On the contrary, the youngest ones are more reluctant about chemicals in their foods, and less cautious on what is put in their cosmetics.
Through this survey, we notice the public is ready to accept the use of bacteria in cleaning processes but they seem to be a little bit afraid of GMO's. We have to consider the current French controversy on GMO's which badly influences public opinion. Our meetings with the public showed us that when you take time to really explain how bacterial GMO's are conceived and how they are used, people often change their mind about it. Thanks to these results, we even feel an inducement in our search to limit the use of chemicals and a public approbation of our Biofilm Killer solution.

Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," binding to lipopolysaccharides on the host cell membrane and injecting its DNA. The T7 genome rapidly makes accommodations to replicate itself, turning off host genes for restriction enzymes, inhibiting nucleases and native polymerases, and redirecting metabolic resources toward its own use. The genome then undergoes replication and concatemerization, and produces about hundred progeny before the host cell is lysed in under half an hour (Qimron, 2010).
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin
Human chorionic gonadotropin is a naturally occurring glycoprotein in the human body, produced in the placenta during pregnancy. It has an alpha and a beta subunit, which are 92 and 145 amino acids long, respectively.  In vivo,  the large amount of oligosaccharide chains are highly glycosylated, and this highly glycosylated version of the protein is in a great proportion to unmodified hCG in early pregnancy because it is produced by cytotrophoblast cells at implantation of the egg (Cole, 2003)(Cole, 2006). The primary physiological function of the unmodified protein is known to stimulate progesterone manufacture by the corpus luteal cells (Cole, 2003), whereas data on the glycosylated version suggests that it functions in signaling the growth of cytotrophoblast cells and placental implantation (Cole, 2010).

Pregnancy Tests
The pregnancy test is an immunoassay, first developed in 1989 and has since expanded to production by 40 different producers, including several large companies such as INSIGHT pharmaceuticals and Procter & Gamble’s ClearBlue (Cole, 2003)(Canfield, 1989). Like in the first immunoassay developed, most pregnancy tests consists of an antibody against the beta-subunit of the dimer hCG that is immobilized on the test by a secondary antibody. When solution containing the beta-subunit of hCG is dropped onto the test, it is wicked through the immunoassay and causes a chemical change to indicate the presence or absence of the protein.

A Well Characterised New BioBrick
Our new BioBrick ( BBa_K381001 ) causes GFP expression in the presence of nitrates.
Elegant Solution to Signal Calibration
By using constitutive RFP expression as a baseline, we have found a reliable and accurate way of quantifying nitrate levels in soil.
Novel Use of Cell Encapsulation
By encapsulating our bacteria in gellan beads, we can keep our bacteria contained and concentrated. This improves visibility on soil, and enhances the environmental safety of our device.
Characterising a Pre-Existing BioBrick
To better inform our own work, and to add knowledge to the BioBrick Registry, we have characterised Edinburgh 2009’s PyeaR BioBrick ( BBa_ K216009 ).

BSim Environmental Interactions
We have extended BSim, our agent-based modelling framework, to model interactions between bacteria and their environment. We have added 3-Dimensional mesh structures to our simulations, and added an adaptive chemical field routine that can solve partial differential equations in an arbitrary 3-D space without any risk of numerical instability.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," osmotic peptides, and culture caco-2 cells on transwell membrane. After the cells have grown into a dense layer, DMEM culture medium containing urate oxidase with osmotic peptide is added to the membrane to determine the content of uric acid oxidase below the membrane, so as to judge the effect of different osmotic peptides.
Among the four selected cytoosmotic peptides, cyclopeptides were found in reference 5 to deliver phages from the intestines of mice to the blood of mice.
Microbial population control system:
In order to prevent the excessive growth of our Nissle escherichia coli in patients' intestines, disrupt the balance of intestinal flora in patients and affect the physical health of patients, we decided to set up the quantity control system of bacteria flora. We refer to the 2016 imperial flora control system, using lasR induced e. coli secretion of N - acetyl homoserine lactone, when the concentration of N - acetyl homoserine lactone after more than a threshold, Las lasR activates expression promoter downstream genes. We designed Gp2 in the downstream gene. Gp2 is an RNA polymerase inhibitory protein that inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, so as to control the quantity of Nissle escherichia coli in the intestinal tract.
Figure 2 We use lasR and Las promoter to control the expression of Gp2, when N - acetyl homoserine lactone concentrations below the threshold of the system, and PLas is in closed state, not express Gp2; When the concentration of n-acetyl hyperserine lactone was higher than the threshold value, lasR activated PLas, leaving PLas in an open state, and the system expressed Gp2 normally.
Lethal system:
In order to prevent the loss of our Nissle escherichia coli to the external environment, compete with the dominant local strains, and disrupt the normal ecological balance of the environment, we decided to set up in vitro lethal system. Since we were involved in more sequences, we decided to design two plasmids and introduce them into one bacterium at the same time. Therefore, we also set up the plasmids loss killing system.
We designed two systems.
System 1:

<Q＆A>
Q．ahpCプロモーターとsufAプロモーターで、過酸化水素を付加しないとき場合に違いが生じるのはどうしてか？
A．非過酸化水素ストレス下においても、大腸菌自体の呼吸によって生じる活性酸素の影響を受けていると考察される。従って、微量な活性酸素に対して各プロモーターが反応し、プロモーターの性質の違いにより差が生じたと考えられる。
Q.大腸菌の致死濃度である1mMで、プロモーターが機能するのはなぜか？
A．生存曲線は、過酸化水素処理後のコロニー形成数に基づいて作成しており、E.coli Penで使用するような液体条件下とは、致死濃度が完全に一致しないと考えられる。また、蛍光強度測定の際の過酸化水素処理時間と生存曲線作成の際の処理時間とでは後者が圧倒的に長いことも影響していると考えられる。

Unlike asconoid and syconoid sponges, which are basically built around their spongocoels and oscula, a leuconoid sponge has a complex, irregularly-shaped body that may have several oscula. It allows a leuconoid sponge to grow to larger size.
It also provides them with powerful filtration capacity (approximately 1200 times its volume per day) which makes it a perfect host for our system. But as mentioned earlier our aim is to engineer an epibiont and not the sponge itself.
Following this introduction, we will both describe  what Pseudovibrio denitrificans exactly is and how we turned it into a transformable/selectable-ready chassis.

Diese Bausteine stehen allen Teilnehmern des Wettbewerbs zur Verfügung.
Die Teams arbeiten während der Sommersemesterferien an ihren Projekten. Anfang November werden beim Finale in Boston die Ergebnisse präsentiert und mehrere Preise in den einzelnen Kategorien vergeben. Der Wettbewerb wurde ursprünglich ins Leben gerufen, um die in den Sommermonaten oft leerstehenden Laborräume der Universitäten zu nutzen und den Studenten in einer sehr frühen Phase ihres Studiums die Möglichkeit zu eigenständiger Projektarbeit zu geben.
Im Heidelberger iGEM-Team arbeiten 15 Studenten der Universität Heidelberg und eine Studentin der TU Darmstadt aus den Bereichen Molekulare Biotechnologie, Biologie und Mathematik zusammen. Sie werden unterstützt von Betreuern aus der Arbeitsgruppe von Victor Sourjik im ZMBH der Universität Heidelberg und aus der Abteilung von Roland Eils (Universität Heidelberg und Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum). Die Arbeiten selbst werden am Bioquant, dem erst 2007 ins Leben gerufenen neuen Zentrum für quantitative Analy-se molekularer und zellulärer Biologischer Systeme, durchgeführt.
Das Heidelberger Team plant eine biologische Maschine, die Krankheitserreger oder auch Tumorzellen erkennen und spezifisch abtöten kann. Als Modell dafür entwickeln die Studenten ein künstliches System aus zwei Stämmen des Darmbakteriums E. coli: einem „Beutestamm“, der die Krankheitserreger repräsentiert, und einem „Killerstamm“. Dazu modifizieren die Nach-wuchswissenschaftler die genetischen Informationen der Bakterien.
Das Heidelberger Team muss zwei zentrale Probleme lösen: Zum einen sollen die Killerbakterien ihre Beute erkennen und sich zielgerichtet darauf zu bewegen können. Dazu wird das natürliche Wahrnehmungs- und Bewegungssystem der E. coli-Bakterien, das in der Natur zum Beispiel zum Auf"

Alberta Innovates Technology Fund Summer Workshop at University of Lethbridge, Day 1
Today, we drove down to the University of Lethbridge for the conference hosted by Alberta Innovates Technology Funds. We had workshops hosted by Joey Hundert on how to attract investors and sponsorships and by Erin Prefontaine on how to publicize our projects through the media. Bob Cooney, the Lethbridge media director, also gave us some tips on how to speak with the media. We were provided dinner in the form of a prime rib buffet at the Paradise Canyon Golf Resort.
