Turning off the bistable
Here we obtained an interesting behavior. The system firstly behaves right, turning off. But around second 6000 we can see that, due to stochastic oscillations, the concentration of repressor 2 decreases sharply and the repressor 1 takes the control of the system. This was not the response that we wanted to obtain.

We wanted to expand our dyeing method to other materials than cotton. For this purpose, we found the keratin-binding domain KBD-C. KBD is one of the three keratin-binding domains from human desmoplakin which have been shown to bind to epithelial cytokeratins and vimentin1. The structures of cytokeratin and for example hair keratin are similar, which is why KBD of desmoplakin is expected to bind also to hair2.
In our experiments, we tested how the chromoprotein with KBD would bind to human hair, which would further expand the applications for which we could use our dyeing method.

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#KillingImprovements_-_-_TEXT.html," Later, we used microscopic counting to determine the exact binding ratio. The maximum number of E. coli cells bound to one M. aeruginosa is 4, so we counted the amount of M. aeruginosa cells with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 E. coli cells bound. All of the cyanobacteria included in the 18 views were counted, and the result is shown in Fig. 10.
The contrast of binding proportion between the experiment group and control group is notably different. In addition, the difference is even greater when the binding amount reaches 3 or 4, when the random binding is less possible. This result does prove that our design really works and that we can successfully bind our E. coli to M. aeruginosa.
Figure 10. Quantitative binding effect of E. coli to M. aeruginosa.
Gas vesicles
We succeeded to bind E. coli cells to M. aeruginosa cells, and this will improve our killing effect remarkably as our model indicates. However, it is often mentioned in papers that cyanobacteria are appearing as floating colonies in the field when algal bloom bursts. [1] Also, during our field investigation to Taihu Lake, we observed that cyanobacteria were actually floating in fresh water examples (see Fig. 11). Because of this, floating E. coli is essential for our project, which was a part of the project that the OUC-China iGEM team did in 2012 ( https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/GVP/GasandBackground ).
Figure 11. Cyanobacteria are floating in the fresh water example. This picture is taken from the NIGLAS (Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences).
Two proteins, GvpA and GvpC are needed to form a protein complex to help the E.coli cells float. GvpA, a 70 aa hydrophobic protein consisting, is assembled as the framework of the protein complex, which is later stabilized by the hydrophilic protein GvpC, a larger protein consisting of 162 aa. [4] GvpA and GvpC can assemble into a low-density protein cylinder in assistance of floating (see Fig. 12(a)). Gas fills space inside the protein complex by diffusion while water is rejected outside.
We communicated with the OUC-China iGEM team this year, and they helped us confirm the availability of the gas vesicle design. The bacteria did float during the repeated trial and the result"

Inoculating L-forms into Chinese Cabbage
Aim and Methods:
We checked the seeds we planted on August 12th and observed that the chinese cabbage seeds had begun to germinate. This meant that they were ready to absorb L-forms. We soaked 20 cabbage seeds for 3 hours in 5ml of L-form solution and another 20 seeds in 5%(w/v) mannitol solution to act as a control.  We also created another control by soaking 20 seeds in B. subtilis rod cells. The seeds were then washed with distilled water (to lyse extracellular L-forms) and replated on Murishage and Skoog agar plates. This was done following the Production of L-form containing Plants protocol from stage five onwards.

Part:BBa_K1315006 (manA)
This is the manA gene promoter taken from Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. It is activated by the transcriptional activator Clp (BBa_K1315005).
Usage and Biology
The DSF-RpfC (BBa_K1315002)-RpfG (BBa_K1315003) sensory system, in all Xanthomonads, activates the production of the manA gene, which codes for endo-mannanase. It has been shown that the transcriptional regulator Clp (BBa_K1315005), when activated binds to the promoter of manA and turns on its synthesis. Clp is usually inactive by cyclic di-GMP molecules that hinder the ability of the transcriptional factor to bind to DNA.

Part:BBa_K1315007 (BCAM0228)
This is the coding sequence of the BCAM0228 two-component regulator of the BDSF sensory BCAM0227-BCAM0228 system. This system is found in Burkholderia cenocepacia. It is suggested that it activates the cblD promoter (BBa_K1315008).
Usage and Biology
The Burkholderia diffusible signal factor (BDSF/cis-2-dodecenoic acid) is a signalling molecule that regulates virulence in Burkholderia cenocepacia. BDSF belongs to the DSF family which was first described in Xanthomonas campestris. BCAM0227 has been identified as a sensor kinase of the BCAM0227-BCAM0228 system that picks up BDSF. However, the confirmed BDSF signalling pathway only goes as far as BCAM0227. It has been proposed that the next steps involve the BCAM0228 regulator protein. The BCAM0228 regulator though is more similar to the OmpR two-component response regulator rather the RpfG (BBa_K1315003) one. Thus, BCAM0228 is the hypothetical regulator of the BCAM0227-BCAM0228 system.

Today Lukas, Sylvie, Sander and Tina had a meeting with Tim Beliën and Dany Bylemans from pcfruit. Pcfruit is a station for research and advisory services of fruit growing, situated on three locations in Limburg ,a province of Belgium. They deal with a range of research activities concerning the most productive varieties of cherries, strawberries, apples or pears, biological fruit growing, the realisation of high quality fruit with a minimum of spraying, the art of attracting birds of prey, predatory mites and bugs and so on. We were warmly welcomed, and got to taste some fresh apple juice while we presented our project.

●
We have a new idea for DNA visualization (""borrowed"" from Kosuke at Ames): After running the gel, we'll use GelRed to stain a lane with the DNA ladder + a lane with a small DNA sample.  We'll then line up the stained gel against the unstained gel, and we'll use the stained gel as a template to approximate the location of the desired DNA band.  We'll then mark the gel and extract the parts we want.
●
Afterwards, we can stain the non-extracted gel to confirm that we extracted the bands we meant to extract.
Thursday, 9/15

We ran a gel: one ladder, 2 lanes with 1uL PCR product (stained/unstained), 2 lanes with 10uL PCR product (stained/unstained)
●
After staining, we imaged the gel using a UV filter, and we could see two distinct bands:

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Project#Xenobiology_-_-_TEXT.html," knock out using the crispr technique
CRISPR Knock Outs
The CRISPR technique is based on the bacterial ability to cut out or replace viral DNA that has been inserted into it’s plasmids. We now can now utilise the Cas9 protein with a target sequence to do cut out of any gene within a plasmid.
The Cas9 protein is expressed with gRNA that is complimentary for the target sequence within the DNA you wish to cut out with a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) sequence downstream of the target. The PAM sequence in e-coli must be an NGG sequence (N representing any base)
To design our gRNA we used the target sequence online design tool DNA 2.0: https://www.dna20.com/eCommerce/cas9/input
Our gRNA target sequences were as follows:
Despite our plans there was not sufficient time to complete a knockout using CRISPR and that will be our next step beyond the competition.

Also, check out the chapter “The Importance of Authenticity in Organization” from the guidebook written by iGEM Lund’s 2018 team.  They have also been focusing on improving the work environment, but instead of more general stress management techniques their guidebook is directed towards hands-on approaches for increasing efficiency through organization of work.
Our hope is that we will encourage people not to overlook the importance of their well-being, and to have a healthier relationship with their work. We hope to give back to the iGEM community for all the wonderful experiences that we’ve had, and we hope that future iGEM teams especially will take note of the advice in “Understanding your Limits - a Burnout Guidebook”.  iGEM is a giving platform for young brilliant people to do truly amazing things.
Since brilliant people (usually) don't retire after participating in iGEM, it’s important to take care of yourselves.  The world needs you.

SURVEY
Statistical analysis was done based on the survey data that was collected to determine the acceptance of genetically modified products in various fields (environment and medical) from individuals with different knowledge of biology ranging from negligible to a more advanced level. Our survey result from approximately one hundred people demonstrates that most people including those with base level knowledge of biology were very much interested in using genetically modified organisms in various fields like food, environment and medicine. In addition to this, people were also eager to use synthetic biology in the cure of cancer since our project was mainly focused on the application of synthetic biology in cancer therapy. Although this was the first year for our university to initiate creating awareness about synthetic biology to the public, we were very surprised to know that currently in the 21st century there is decreasing number of people without some knowledge of biology. We hope to fill these gap in the future via iGEM.
The survey questions and the graphical representations of their answers are shown below:
1. Do you think biology is interesting?
2. What level of scientific or biology education do you have?
3. How would you classify bacteria?
4. The human body is composed of a larger number of bacterial cells than human cells?
5. Do you know products like bread, beer and many medications are made using microorganisms?
6. Imagine a certain breed of panda is becoming extinct. Scientists have genetically modified some of the genes in these pandas to allow them to survive, even under harsh conditions, thus preventing their extinction. Do you feel this is a justifiable use of genetic modification?
7. A nuclear explosion in Japan has caused a lot of devastation and radiation debris. An iGEM team from the University of Osaka has created an organism that can de-toxify this debris. Do you feel this is a justifiable use of genetic modification?
8. Imagine that your relative is severely ill with cancer. The doctor tells you the treatment options are either regular cancer medicine, eg chemotherapy or a new genetically modified medicine. If the regular medicine had a 40% chance of working, while the genetically modified drug had a 60% success rate. Which would you prefer?
9. Do you think genetically modified products like the products from three previous questions are ethically right if they benefit society?

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-3_-_-_TEXT.html," for all five genes but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes. We discovered that the master-mix concentration was too high for all of the reactions we had performed, so we changed the amount of master-mix in each reaction to ensure the concentration was 1X rather than 2X. After changing the master-mix concentration, we ran more OE PCR reactions without primers and selected certain reactions with the least amount of nonspecific bands for templates in our regular PCR reactions.
Our over-the-weekend cultures had little growth after 24 hours, but showed adequate growth come Monday morning. After discussing this with other teammates, we found it was most likely due to improper aeration of our samples, which were stored upright with a tight cap in the incubator. We then performed a plasmid isolation followed by a restriction digest to test the identity of our isolated plasmid. Our first digest was unsuccessful, which we hypothesized was because of the age of our enzyme sample. Our next digest, performed with our most recently acquired enzyme, showed the expected band pattern after altering the contrast on the gel image. We also attempted a PCR linearization of our amplified plasmid which was unsuccessful. Through these experiments we learned how to better analyze gel images by increasing exposure, brightness, and contrast, as well as proper incubation practices for liquid cultures. We also ran into several issues with budgeting time correctly in lab, which prompted us to change how we schedule our lab procedures to create as little “dead space” as possible.
For our third attempt to amplify out ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica, we instead did a serial dilution to ensure that we were not using too many cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Again, no amplification was observed.

Each year, the UCSC iGEM team presents to the Bioethics class during the second Summer Session. A few team members diligently prepared a presentation about our questionnaires and project for that purpose. Several of us attended the presentation, and afterwards broke into small groups with students in the class to ask and answer questions about our ethics. Because of this presentation, we learned about the IRB at UCSC and how we needed to get our questionnaires approved, since we were technically working with “human subjects” if we sent it out.
Another small group designed a poster to be displayed at the Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. This poster included details about"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

Alberta Genetically Engineered Machine Conference Day 2
Chris
Today, we spent time with various different Alberta Innovates Technology Futures people who also gave us more insight into our projects and the possible directions it could go. We talked with Chris Dambrowitz, Candice Berezan, Lori Sheremeta, Justin Pahara, Wayne Materi, and Andrew Hessel about different areas where we could go with our project. They were very helpful and we will look to implementing these when we get back to Calgary. Special thanks to Alberta Innovates Technology Futures for funding, as well as hosting this great conference!

LabSurfing: Couchsurfing for iGEMers
At the jamboree you get to know a lot of interesting people from all over the world. But according to our experience of the last years it is hard to keep in touch with other iGEMers after the jamboree. Therefor we created a platform for all teams and their members to be able to stay in contact with this community after finishing the annual project. The second main advantage is the opportunity for iGEM teams to get to know each other in an early stage of the competition. This facilitates meetups and collaborations right from the beginning.
 
With our interdisiplinary team we created this website that is loosely based on the idea of Couchsurfing. On our platform, everyone can create his own personal-profile with all their information including academic degree, available couches and scientific interests. The personal profiles are connected to team-profiles, where the teams can present their projects.
The project descriptions and corresponding lists of team members will be maintained after each year’s competition. This way alumni are not just registered to their team in general but also assignable to the year their participated in iGEM.
A registered member can search on the world map for his desired iGEM team or member and send a couch request. Also as a team you have the option to send requests to other teams.
Take a look here!

Ligation reaction products were transformed into E.coli cells. HyperLadder Kb was used for both agarose gels, sizes shown in bp. Agarose gel (1%) was run at 110V for 1.5h. See table 1 for gene sizes
By analysing figure 1, it was confirmed that the genes were incorporated into the BioBrick backbone. HydB N-terminal was not subjected to colony PCR analysis. However, sequencing data confirmed correct ligation into pSB1C3, which was then used in Golden Gate cloning.
Cloning FeFe, HydABC, into the pBAD expression vector
Aim
Ligate the individual FeFe genes into the pBAD expression vector using Golden Gate Cloning, which can then be used for downstream expression trials.
Method
The primers for golden gate sequencing were designed to ensure the correct order of parts when ligating into the pBAD vector. The reaction was set up using the corresponding protocol and the thermocycler used to cycle at the correct temperatures. The product was then immediately transformed into α-select E.coli competent cells purchased from Bioline. Golden Gate cloning utilises type IIS instead of type IIP restriction enzymes. Type IIS restriction enzymes are those that recognise a DNA sequence outside of the cut site. This can be customised to be non-specific, allowing for custom overhangs. This means that during ligation between the inserts and their vector, the recognition site for these enzymes will be removed, eliminating the scarring that occurs during cloning with conventional restriction enzymes. These overhangs can be made to ligate consecutive inserts together. A primer was also designed that would guide the correct ligation of the inserts. The primer would be complementary to the consecutive gene inserts, restriction site and their BsaI cut-sites (Kirchmaier and Wittbrodt, 2013). For our experiment we needed the inserts to ligate as: Fdh/HydC, HydA, and HydB C-terminus or Fdh/HydC, HydA and HydB N-terminus. When ordering the gene inserts, the BioBrick pre- and suffix were included, as well as the Golden Gate sequences that would allow for scarless ligation.

Of course, we also talked about quality management and the value of certificates. On this point transparency became a very important topic in the interview. Jürgen Marchart, the managing director of FFoQSI, explained to us how important a comprehensible workflow and in this way secured quality standards are. Certificates might never be as revealing as a transparent production policy. Furthermore, Mr. Marchart told us about the importance of marketing. We learned that it is not as important to produce the cheapest oil, if we have good quality, work transparently and environmentally friendly. In addition, we got encouraged to go on with resolving misunderstandings about the bad reputation of GMOs and the idea of certification and labels, although it will be a stony path.
Detergents
One of the main uses for palm kernel oil - and therefore a potential field of application for our synthetic alternative - is the production of detergents (1). For this reason it was important to us to get in contact with companies in this field to gain more knowledge and to know if companies would be willing to use our product. Hollu Systemhygiene GmbH is an Austrian producer of washing and cleaning products. In an interview with Benjamin Göllner of the company’s science department, we talked about the use of palm kernel oil in the production of cleaning products, GMOs, palm (kernel) oil certifications, environmentalism and our project. In his opinion, biotechnology will become more relevant in the production of detergents in the next decades and he doesn’t see a problem with the use of GMOs in this industry (as opposed to the food industry for example). However, it would have to be proven that the synthetic palm kernel oil is more environmental friendly that the natural oil.  This interview confirmed that there is a potential market for synthetic palm kernel oil and it further encouraged us in our work.

In our initial research we found that in Germany, the biggest portion of imported palm oil (45% in 2015) is used for energy. Palm Kernel Oil is hardly used in this sector however.

Our Contribution
Through Project MARS, the BostonU HW Team has provided three key contributions towards increasing ease of accessibility and use of microfluidics in the synthetic biology community.
MARS Repository
The MARS repository benefits the greater synthetic biology community through hosting the designs of nine chips that are designed to perform essential synbio procedures.
These chips are:
Fabricated using a standardized rapid prototyping system
Separated into three categories (isolation, modification and quantification) which come together to replicate complex synthetic biology protocols
Provided to the user with full documentation and usage protocols
This provides a highly accessible and relevant platform for synthetic biologists to access, fabricate, test and integrate microfluidics into their lab workflow.
While these microfluidic devices have only been tested with colored water and oil, they provide a framework that can be built upon by future iGEM teams to allow for biological testing and optimization.
Fluid Functionality
Our fluid functionality checklist allows synthetic biologists to grade microfluidic devices fabricated from the MARS archive or designed using our software workflow. Through creating and introducing a standardized method of analyzing device functionality, synthetic biologists interested in utilizing microfluidics can quantitatively and qualitatively rate their chips prior to utilizing them in laboratory procedures.
Microfluidics 101
In order to overcome the knowledge barrier that exists between synthetic biology and microfluidics, MARS hosts a variety of educational materials aimed at synbio researchers interested in using our workflow.
Microfluidics 101 focuses on:
Increasing ease of access to basic educational materials regarding microfluidics
Providing clear and relevant material regarding our continuous flow microfluidics devices
Including detailed video tutorials and written protocols outlining fabrication using Makerfluidics
All three components of MARS come together to help make microfluidics a more accessible and practical tool for synthetic biology labs.
Our End Product
After 560 hours in the lab per team member working on:
Over 100 design iterations
85 milled and tested chips
340 fluid tests
80 hours editing video and written content
We are proud to present our project MARS in its entirety. Please feel free to navigate our Wiki to learn more about each branch of the project and how it"

In the afternoon, the team went into Boston for some bonding time with BU. We spent a wonderful evening at Life Alive, and afterwards the HCI lab headed towards Veggie Galaxy for some internal lab fun. The food was delicious and I had a wonderful time!
Week 9: July 22 - July 26
Saying goodbye to our interns.
Monday, 7/22: Today Heather and I spent the bulk of the day working on our mockups since they are due tomorrow. In addition, we also spent a good chunk of time working on our poster, before we sent it to Consuelo to edit the font and overall theme. Although we didn't spend any time working on code today, we had a very productive day of design and styling.
Tuesday, 7/23: This morning, Heather and I met with Consuelo to talk about our current state and goals for the week. For me, what was most important was setting up a Twitter queue. Although not initially a functionality we had planned to implement, we've come to realize its importance due to the possibility of our users not having a twitter. Thus, that's what I spent my afternoon working on, though I did work from home since I wasn't feeling my best. It definitely took some time, but ultimately I was successful in my venture. In addition, Consuelo gave me some great advice on using color effectively, so I spent some time at night refining the mockups for Orit tomorrow as well.
Wednesday, 7/24: In the morning, Orit came to visit our team and Heather and I showed her our progress thus far. We began with the mockups we had created as possible themes. One was a clean and simple design with bursts of bright color, and the other was a very cool industrial, steampunk style. Orit liked certain aspects of both, so in the end we decided to combine the two for a new one altogether. After that, we showed her the state of our website and spent the rest of the afternoon working on some more functionality. For me, that meant adding more details to the twitter queue, such as a change in bg color on hover, and making the tweets clickable. By the end of the day, the hover was working, but I could not for the life of me get the tweets clickable. That was something I worked on until I literally couldn't keep my eyes open anymore, and had to call it quits until tomorrow.

By organizing a panel discussion, visiting schools, creating an interactive information booth, and performing a survey, we tried to interact with the public as much as possible. All of this revealed that one of the main issues is not only the detection of glyphosate but also it's accumulation in the soil and subsequent effects. Consequently, we wanted to adapt our project to the publics needs and tried to find a way to produce bacteria that can not only withstand glyphosate but that are also able to inactivate it.

Reverse: GCTAGCCCAAAAAAACGGGTATGGAG
Figure 7 - Plasmid maps describing both the original (left) and engineered (right) AraC-pBAD-containing parts, including all relevant elements. These were designed and cloned in silico on GeneDesigner.
The amplified elements were DpnI-treated following a standard procedure (New England Biolabs), and were subsequently submitted to a purification step (Qiaquick PCR clean up, Qiagen) prior to self-ligation. Three different template concentrations were tested during ligation (specifically 3 ng, 7.5 ng and 15 ng), and were incubated at room temperature for 1h+. The ligation mix was then transformed into chemically competent DH10B Escherichia coli using a standard chemical transformation protocol and plated out on Chloramphenicol-specific LB plates.
3.2 Cloning of pSB3K3-LacI-pLAC
A compatible plasmid and induction system was cloned to allow expression of the operon in two parts. The medium/strong promoter J23110 was cloned in front of the quad part inverter Q01121. The inverter has an RBS, the LacI repressor followed by a double terminator then a Lac inducible promoter. The composite part created give constitutive expression of the Lac repressor allowing for induction by IPTG. The parts were then moved into the pSB3k3 backbone to be compatible with pSB1C3.

The AcsABCD operon was designed in silico as described in the previous section. It was ordered for synthesis at GenArt in the form of four separate elements of similar sizes, named AcsA, AcsB, AcsC and AcsD, respectively. After synthesis, the constructs were directly transformed into DH10B E.coli using a standard chemical transformation protocol and plated overnight supplied with 50 ug/ml Kanamycin. 5ml LB were inoculated with a freshly growing colony and grown overnight at 37 C, under shaking conditions. Glycerol stocks were produced prior to proceeding with the assembly process.

Sebstien also mentioned that it could be a problem to try to clone the gifsy repressors into pSB1C3 which is a high copy number plamid, and as far as he understood it, the IGEM headquarter allows submission in other plasmids if you have an explanation for not using pSB1C3. So I guess we could just submit in pSB4A5. Anyways, we can talk about this tomorrow as I'll come in at 8 am.

Restreaks were made of ligation plates of L1 to L5 that can be found in the lab book dated 23rd September 2010. Over night culture media (already containing antibiotics) are ready and stored in the fridge, these will be used for the colonies obtained from the restreaks mentioned above.
The verification PCR's from friday (24/09/2010) were ran on a gel, all except for one band had the right sizes; the band corresponding to the N anti-terminator didn't fit in size so another PCR verification was performed. Another PCR of GFP+RBS was made today as well.
A PCR clean up of RBS-N(X+P) was ran on a gel in order to perform calculations required for ligations.
Along with this gel, PCR amplified plasmid backbones of pSB4A5, pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 were ran to verify that they were still present after they had a little swim on friday.

Looked at the graph, a spike at 130 is due to salts, a spike at 260 is due to DNA, a spike at 280 is due to protein. *Record the 260/230 ratio and 260/280 ratios, you want then both to be above 1, somewhere between 1-2 is good
A DNA concentration of ~1ng/ μL was measured which is extremely low, and therefor the plasmid should not be used to preform a yeast transformation.
This could be a poissible explination for the extremely low transformation efficiency of Transformation-1.
Because of this it is necessary to amplify the plasmid in E. coli.
Amplification of PMKV005
The PMKV005 was to be amplified in E. coli to increase its concentration.
Vorachek-Warren et. al. 2004 showed that PMKV005 was derived from the pAG26 plasmid which had ampicillin resistance.
The competent cells were obtained from NEB thawed on ice and transformed with the following protocol.
1. Pipette 1 μL of plasmid into the cells. Flick the tubes very gently; 2. Let them site on ice for 10 minutes; 3. heat shock at 42 degC for 45 seconds; 4. Return tubes on ice; 5. add 250 μL SOC media (LB works too but SC was used); 6. grow cells at 37 degC 225 rpm for 1 hour; Placed in incubator directly to the left of the shaker in the cohen  lab 7. Plate 50 μL on a antibiotic resistant plate (which you have warmed up with the lid slightly open for about 20  minutes); 8. incubate overnight at 37 degC.
2010/07/16
Plated a colony from the PMKV005 e. coli transformation on 7/15 into LB for an overnight culture.
2010/07/17
Conducted a Miniprep from the o/n culture of PMKV005 transformed E. coli made on 7/16.
Conducted using the Plasmid DNA Purification Using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a Microcentrifuge protcol on page 22 of the attached manual.
All places when centrifugation is between 30-60 seconds 60 seconds were used.
The 3 LB plates from the Mol. Bio. group were also examined and no colonies were observed.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,", the precursor for a drug against malaria (Ro et al.2006) .   In the old days the drug had to be isolated out of the plant Artemisia annua.   This was very inefficient because of the limitations of plant growth and low yields of artemisinic acid.   Therefore, the group of Jay Keasling engineered a metabolic pathway to produce the drug in yeast cells, which grow faster and produce a lot more artemisinic acid.   As in this example, metabolic engineering enables the production of drugs and other valuable products with an increased yield when compared to product isolation from natural sources.   Furthermore, the large variety of usable enzymes, pathways and chassis enables more flexibility in pathway design compared to chemical approaches.
Why should we accelerate metabolic engineering?
Although much progress in metabolic engineering was made in the last 20 years, there are still many drawbacks and limitations.   For instance, it is crucial to have a big set of genes as combinable parts to find the optimal pathway and they have to be predictable.   With many of them just poorly characterized, rational pathway design remains difficult.   Our understanding of the working and interactions of enzymes at the level of the metabolism is still rudimentary.  Consequently, metabolic engineering consists of much trial-and-error and researchers have to endure series of failures.   One strategy to face these issues is modeling of enzyme behavior but currently limitations in computing power prevent this from being used in high-throughput. Another strategy is to use chassis as workhorses to test  a lot of enzyme combinations and pathway variants. Here, organisms like E. coli, S. cerevisiae or C. glutamicum are often used but product formation is limited by growth rate and nutrient uptake (Stephanopoulos et al.2007) .   When a pathway is constructed and to be tested, one has to wait until the production strain has grown and then product formation is still limited by substrate uptake. Another big drawback is that screening for product often is expensive, time consuming and complicated.   Conventional methods like LC-MS need a lot of time and resources and it is hardly possible to use it in high-throughput, for instance for a whole pathway library.  To overcome these limitations and accelerate metabolic engineering, we established V. natriegens as chassis for metabolic engineering.   Its doubling time of under 10 minutes makes it the perfect organism to quickly test many pathway variants or enzyme versions.   Additionally, it has a glucose uptake rate of 3.90 g g-1h-1 while E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. glutamicum have"

If microneedles survive in the fridge, we should also test if diffusivity still works
If diffusion did not work, we have to look at pumps
Membrane/Filter test: does the drug reservoir/peptide actually go through the filter? Does it prevent the bacteria from going through?
Diffusion test: To test whether diffusion will actually work and what other problems we will face with diffusion (e.g. bacteria secretes peptides which go through the semipermeable membrane… but what about the media that goes through the membrane?
Making changes to the design
Is the drug reservoir actually contained properly in the microneedle?
Bacteria test
Monday, May 16th
Experiment to somehow test the idea:
Objective:
Tested the level of frozen H2O in microneedle as it melts into a cup of H2O (l)
Materials:
200 uL pipet tip
Distilled H2O
200 uL pipetter
Freezer
300 uL H2O
Parafilm/tape
Black sharpie
Test tube rack
Procedure:
We used a pipet to take in 150 uL of distilled water in a pipet tip and taped the bottom with parafilm/tape. We marked the water level with a black sharpie.
Put the pipet tip in freezer and let the H2O freeze (10:50 am - after lunch).
Put pipet tip (just the tip area) into test tube of 300 uL (2x the volume of water in the needle). Cap the top with parafilm.
Overtime, see whether amount of H2O (l) goes back to original height.
Results/Observation:
After putting the frozen water in the distilled H2O (l) test tube (at normal tap temperature), we put parafilm on top to mimic the microneedle being capped.
H2O melts extremely fast (this is without adding body heat) - melted within 1-2 minutes
In actual microneedle, H2O (s) will melt very fast due to body heat. Also, silicon vs. plastic tube
After melting we noticed H2O (l) level in needle is at a constant level (significantly lower than initial amount). Eg) doesn’t go back to original level
H2O did expand, but not too significantly from initial observation, we think it won’t affect/damage the needle tip

IDEA 2: Popping"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Recombination_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinase derived from the P1 bacteriophage while Dre derives from P1-like transducing phage D6 isolated from         Salmonella oranienburg. (Anastassiadis et al., 2009) (Nagy, 2000) Both of them are tyrosine family of site-specific         recombinases.
Our Design
We designed recombinase expressing genes located just downstream of our time delay module under the regulation of pPhlF.
Diagram 2. Design of recombination system for application
The application of Cre and Dre is one of our main focus in our project. Our design is to insert the lox and rox sites         into the vector plasmid that flanks the origin of replication. When there is an expression of Cre and Dre protein,         Cre and Dre will cause recombination of their corresponding target site. The Cre-lox and Dre-rox systems then induce         deletion of the origin of replication, resulting in two occasions. One is the plasmid without the origin of replication.         The other one is the plasmid with the origin of replication. The plasmid without the origin of replication cannot         carry out DNA replication. In each generation, the population will contain only half of the plasmid with the gene         of interest. After many generations, the amount of plasmid with the gene of interest will be diluted and eventually         none of the cells will contain the plasmid with the gene of interest.
The second occasion, the population will contain the plasmids with the origin of replication only (because of deletion).         However, as the cell will use its resource to replicate the plasmids with the origin of replication. The cell containing         the plasmids with the origin of replication are less competitive than the wild-type. The population containing the         plasmid flanked with origin of replication will be eventually wiped out due to selective pressure. As a result, the         population would revert to its original state before the introduction of the plasmid.
Nevertheless, lox and rox sites are not necessarily flanked around the origin of replication.

Maximizing the efficiency of our knock out switch
Our team emphasizes on the safety of construct design. That is why maximizing the efficiency of our knock out switch         is of paramount importance in our project. We have designed several measures to increase the efficiency of our knock         out switch. First"

  Jeongmin Lee : Heat releasing bacteria
      EHeat releasing bacteria used in massage were based on fermentation of bacteria. Giving sawdust as a carbon source, and adding some enzymes related to fermentation will produce heat. (enough to feel warmth)  But boiler using this method is under patent, so it is required to find other applications.
  Jihoon Jeong : Logic circuit adopting channel rhodopsin
     Searched whether the idea has been already covered by previous iGEM teams. Confirmed that no team in 2011 iGEM has dealt with the idea. Will search more in 2010, 2009 iGEM teams
  Sanghoon Han : Display system using bacteria (adopting magnetosome)
     2011 iGEM Washington team already carried out a magnetosome toolkit design. More research required and will figure out how to apply their toolkit in this idea. Confirmed using magnetosome system in E.coli is possible.
     It is still confusing how to arrange bacteria in certain direction in response to electric field, without moving bacteria distributed in 2D plate since magnetosome is for magnetotaxis, which literally refers 'taxis'.
  Hyunkee Kim : Bateria detecting herbicides
     Detection using tfa4 gene product. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid has structural similarity to IAA and therefore is used as an herbicide to a dicotyledon.  Design an operon using promoter of tfa4 gene to sense 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and use fluorescent gene as a reporter gene.
2) iGEM Asia jamboree
     Oct 5 ~ 7, at HKUST, Hongkong.
     For the experiment, we would use prokaryotic cells and yeast cells. Also we can use eukaryote's gene. But since our lab does not deal with eukaryotic cells, try to think of ideas in this boundary.

Overview
    In our system, we have three characters. Warriors attack the enemies, farmers provide nutrients for everybody, while beggars sit there doing nothing.
    To contruct our farmers, we contructed a new part invertase(BBa_K2250000/BBa_K2250001/BBa_K2250003). Our E.coli MG1655  can not utilize sucrose as its nutrients. Invertase catalyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, thus providing nutrients for all bacteria. See the intervase test for more details.
    To realize the role of the warrior, we utilized a kind of molecule called AHL([N-]acyl-homoserine lactones). There are several kinds of AHLs, which bind to different receptors with different affinity. AHL together with the receptor can bind to specific promoters and activate the corresponding gene. We want to design a gene circuit with orthogonality.In other words, we want the warrior to kill bacteria from the other group but not from its own group. To accomplish this, we did the orthogonality test to select the comparatively best pairs.
    After the construction of our warriors, we tested how the warriors really work. We have two standards to see if the warriors are fitted or not. First, the warrior must have good orthogonality. That is to say, the warrior must kill its enemies but not itself. Second, the killing ability must be neither too strong nor too weak. We carried out the killing test to test our warriors.
    From the killing test, we find that although"

Remove cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 4 degrees Celsius for 30 mins. (45000 rpm wih a 45Ti rotor, Beckman)
After centrifugation, recover the supernatant (lysate) and evenly distribute into three ependorf tubes. Discard the cell pellet. Add equivalent volume of Milli-Q water into two of the three tubes so the concentration of lysate halves. For the remaining one tube, add equivalent volume of buffer A to halve the concentration of lysate. Set up another eppendorf tube and add Milli-Q water into it so that it has same final volume of solution as the other three tubes.
Cut thin nylon 6 ropes into three small pieces and weigh each on mass balance. Carefully use a tweezer to immerse each of the three nylon pieces into three tubes containing Milli-Q water (control), lysate+Milli-Q water and lysate+buffer A. One of the four tubes does not contain a nylon 6 sample (control).
Incubate all four tubes in 30 degree incubator for 20 hours.
Take out nylon pieces, wash with Milli-Q water and let it dry overnight.
Use the same mass balance to weight the mass of three nylon piece again. Then image the three nylon samples using scanning electron microscope (SEM).

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," strategy depends on providing production of pexiganan enter the mucosa according to presence of H.pylori or not. This system is based on the penetration of our engineered E.coli under the mucosa, and production of pexiganan under the control of the AND GATE system. After the production of pexiganan under the mucose, if this peptide is toxic for mammalian cells, this cannot be used for H.pylori eradication in the gastric mucosa. Therefore, toxicity level of pexiganan for mammalian cells must be higher than the requirement of H.pylori eradication. The potential toxicity of pexiganan has been investigated systematically by measuring the peptide’s hemolytic activity in human red blood cells in other studies. The reports suggested that at least 250 μg/mL is necessary to induce 100% hemolysis. (Navon, V; Feder, R et al. 2002 and Eren,T; Som, A et al. 2008) Two phase III clinical trials have reported that no adverse side effects have been found for pexiganan.
(The Synthetic Antimicrobial Peptide Pexiganan and ItsNanoparticles (PNPs) Exhibit the Anti-Helicobacter pylori Activity in Vitro and in Vivo)
DAMP
(A Simple and Low-Cost Platform Technology forProducing Pexiganan Antimicrobial Peptide in E. Coli,Chun-Xia Zhao, Mirjana Dimitrijev Dwyer, Alice Lei Yu, Yang Wu, Sheng Fang, Anton P.J. Middelberg)
DAMP,  a four-helix bundle protein connected to Pexiganan, used to ensure pexiganan’s intracellular antimicrobial activity was prevented successfully. A design, as showed above, was used to attach DAMP to Pexiganan with a cleavage site. That cleavage site makes it possible to release Pexiganan in an exact concentration. In addition, DAMP provides high levels of solubles in recombinant bacteria. It also forms a four helix bundle structure that  has thermo stability and remains soluble at high salt levels. Finally, pexiganan embeds into DAMP and this provides limitted electrostatic of pex. It prevents damage to the cell membrane in the E. coli.

Having completed the PCR cycling parameters listed above both PCR reaction batches were mixed together and the cycling parameters listed above were once more applied.
Digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI: Addition of 1 µl DpnI to the PCR batch and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.
! Unfortunately someone turned off the heat block, so that the reaction tube was below 37 °C (approx. 25 °C) for about 45 min. After recognition (after one hour of incubation), the heat block was turned on again and the reaction tube was incubated for another 30 min.
Transformation into E.coli Xl1-Blue
melting of 100 µl Ca-competent E.coli XL1-Blue cells on ice
addition of 1 µl of the PCR product
incubation on ice for 25 min
heat shock for 5 min at 37 °C
transfer of cells to 1 ml LB-medium without antibiotics and incubation at 37°C and 180 rpm for 25 min
plating of 100 µl on an Kan-LB-plate
sedimenting the leftover in a centrifuge (30 - 60 sec, 13 000 rpm) and resuspension of the sediment in 100 µl LB-medium and plating it as well on an Kan-LB-plate

COLLABORATIONS
Collaboration with Stony Brook iGEM team
In the beginning of June Stony Brook iGEM team from New York contacted us with an         offer to participate in iGEM Photo a Day Instagram challenge. From our side we shared         interesting photo themes for their challenge! The idea of the collaboration was to share         photos featuring the project idea, supervisors and other images, which would relate to the         corresponding photo descriptions and hashtags. We enjoyed participation in this         collaboration a lot, because it united our team more and we were also happy to share our         iGEM work creatively with the whole Instagram world!
Collaboration with Tec de Monterrey iGEM team
In the beginning of July we got in touch with Tec de Monterrey iGEM team from Mexico         via a video conference and discussed our projects. Tec de Monterrey team kindly agreed         to gather information on sunscreen usage, popularity in Mexico, while we provided them         with information concerning the amount of pollutes in water in Estonia!
Collaboration with Ecuador iGEM team
In July, we also contacted an iGEM team from Ecuador via a video call and discussed         how Ecuador locals protect themselves from the sun and whether they are aware of         commercial sunscreen harmfulness. Furthermore, we exchanged project overviews and         discussed experience in collaborations with other teams. Ecuador team also shared their         experience concerning relationships inside the team, how the work has been distributed,         and gave us useful advices on how to distribute our work most effectively.
We interviewed Ecuador iGEM team members about sunscreen usage in Ecuador. From         the interview it can be concluded, that people in Ecuador are more than supposed to wear         sunscreen, because the UV index is extremely high and sunlight lasts for a long time         during the day. In addition to it being the only tool to protect themselves from the sun,         they are required to wear sunscreen throughout the year.
Most of the population does not know about the harmfulness of the sunscreens to the         environment. However, it is forbidden to use sunscreens in water on Galapagos Islands.
We have also discussed an issue of gene technology field oppression in Ecuador by         GMO-free trend supporting government. That is why we discussed the importance of         organizing seminars, lectures to school children in order for"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_K2201900 . If the cells contain this plasmid in the negative selection, they should be visible as red clones. In contrast, the clones containing the negative selection plasmid should be colorless. A picture of one round of the negative selection (Figure 5) shows that one clone is red, thus demonstrating the function of the system. The results of our selection system can be found here .
Applications
An important criteria for a composite part is the possibility to use this part in further iGEM projects. In addition to our application for this part, there are a lot of potential applications for a reporter signal enhancement. Our system provides a reliable and especially sensitive reporter, thus applications which require these could be improved by using our system. Some possible applications are shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Potential applications for the reporter signal enhancing system.
The strength of the reporter signal enhancing system lies in its strong and specific signal despite of a very weak initial gene expression. This enables usage in the analysis of weakly transcribed genes in metabolic pathway and flux analyses as well as a variety of diagnostic application which are dependent on strong, specific signals. Furthermore use of the reporter signal enhancer system in the analysis of expression in vitro and in vivo is feasible.

InterLab Study
Introduction
One of the key components to iGEM and synthetic biology in general is standardisation. For now five years, iGEM has developed a robust measurement procedure that allows iGEM teams to measure the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The InterLab aims to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology by giving all participating labs a protocol for measuring GFP fluorescence. This year’s experiment wanted to look at reducing the variability between labs in measuring fluorescence by normalising absolute cell count instead of OD600. The InterLab used eight plasmids ( BBa_R0040 , BBa_I20270 , BBa_J364000 , BBa_J364001 , BBa_J364002 , BBa_J364007 , BBa_J364008 , and BBa_J364009 ) to measure OD600 and GFP fluorescence.
Materials and Methods
Platereader we used was the FLUOstar Omega BMG Labtech. Specs:
Bandwitdth was 530/30 nm
485 nm excitation
520 emission
829 gain
It read plates from the top
Competent Escherichia coli  DH5α strain were created and transformed using iGEM’s protocols. InterLab Protocol can be found here .
Results and Discussion
Calibration 1: OD600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) and water replicates were pipetted into a plate to get an absorbance reading. These readings were used to create a ratio to convert absorbance to OD.
Table 1. LUDOX CL-X and water Replicates Absorbance at 600 nm used to create OD600/Abs600 ratio.
Calibration 2: Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
Monodisperse silica microspheres have characteristics that are similar to the size and shape of cells while also having a known amount of particles in a certain volume. A standard curve of particle concentration was created to later be used"

Interlab
Overview
This year is the 5th installment of iGEM’s interlab; a powerful joint venture undertaken by hundreds of iGEM teams to gather data with the hope to create tools to help future iGEM teams as well as the the Synthetic Biology community as a whole.
Across Synthetic Biology a commonly used method to test biological constructs is to tag them with fluorescent proteins such as GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and then measure their fluorescence on plate readers. This fluorescence can then be correlated to the rest of the construct but currently it is difficult to compare this data with other labs due to different units. It is the focus of Interlab to attempt to combat this by developing a detailed protocol that allows the measurement to be made in absolute units, therefore allowing comparison between all labs. This year, we attempt to assist in this by answering the following question:
Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
Currently, Fluorescence, being an aggregate measurement over the whole population of cells, is normalized by number of cells to find a mean.. This is done by also measuring the the absorbance or optical density of the cells at 600nm (OD600) which is then used as an approximation for the cell population size. However it is the accuracy of this measurement which causes too much variability in measurements between labs so we are looking to develop a more direct method to measure cell count, formally Colony Forming Units (CFUs).
Experiments
2 Orthogonal approaches:
Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads. Silica beads the same size and shape as E.coli cells should act in the same way when used in absorbance measurements. Hence by using known concentrations of silica beads, we can accurately convert cell OD600 measurements to cell concentrations and hence cell counts.

Lambda Red, Backbone, and Sequencing PCR
Gel run on the presence of a Lambda Red protein in the pKD46 plasmid showed that it is indeed present, so our recombination failures have not been due to an incorrect plasmid.
Gel run on the backbone of pZE21G plasmid was success and took us one step closer to obtaining all parts necessary for the three part assembly
Gel run on the pyrF and rpoZ was success
Therefore we sent the PCR products and primers to GENEWIZ for sequencing again

Figure 9. On the left: Generic interaction between a target and a gRNA for Cas9 [Reproduced from Xie and Yang, 2013 (Figure 1A)]. On the right: Predicted interaction of one subunit of the amplicon of Probe 2 with the gRNA.
We can observe how the PAM sequence (in red in the figure) is located at the very beginning of the large loop in the amplicon, whereas the gRNA binds to the whole stem part and partially to the small loop.
*Here and after, when referring to the ""amplicon sequence"", we only show one single copy of the reverse transcript of the probe. The actual amplicon, by definition of Rolling Circle Amplification, is of course made instead of                             sequential copies of this ""unitary"" sequence.
Comparison Cas9/Cas12a
We then tried to design our own probes for Cas 12a, working backwards from the gRNA.
Contrarily to Cas 9, for which the PAM must be on the 3' side of the target, for Cas12a the PAM must be on the 5’ side of the target instead. This implies that the scaffold part of the gRNA must be on the 5’ side (instead of the 3’) as well (Figure 10).
Figure 10. ""Schematic representation of Lba Cas12a nuclease sequence recognition and DNA cleavage"". [Reproduced from New England BioLabs ].
Below is shown a direct comparison of the interaction between target amplicon and gRNA for Cas 9 and Cas 12a.
Figure 11. Comparison of the interaction between target amplicon and gRNA for Cas 9 (on the left) and Cas 12a (on the right).
We therefore conclude that the template for our guide RNA for Cas 12a should be:
5’-(UAAUUUCUACUAAGUGUAGAU)NNNNNN|NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’  [gRNA template]
where the sequence in parentheses indicates the scaffold of the gRNA for LbCas12a. The sequence out of the brackets is the spacer, binding to the amplicon, and in particular the sequence in italic corresponds to the part binding on the loop of the amplicon.
The spacer is therefore 22 bases long (as let-7a-5p), 15 of which bind to the stem part of the amplicon and the remaining 7"

Protein Screening
Designer proteins , which enhance binding capacities or improve enzymatic activities, have a large potential in both research and biotechnological processes. They are usually created by constructing and screening libraries of mutated protein variants. Proteins with desired properties are selected for in functional screenings. Despite the success of the method, it is labor intensive and limited in throughput. First protein extracts need to be prepared. Second, after successful screens individual mutated proteins must be tracked back to the original strains. Our Sporobeads would eliminate the need to track protein mutants, allowing researchers to screen huge quantities of mutated proteins, only identifying and sequencing these proteins after successful screening. Figures 1 and 2 offer schematics of the process of using Sporobeads for protein screening for either enzymatic or binding affinities.

Final constructs after this cloning are; respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-HNS  and T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-HNST108I. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
As the mutant version of HNS shows us that change of even a single amino acid can be effecting protein expression, we considered His-tag(6 amino acid long) could effect their expression too. So we planned to clone them into PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, which we designed. By doing this, we will have the proteins synthesized in high amounts with the help of T7 but there won’t be any additional amino acids. We expect to have better results from our experiments.
PotB59/PomA
We aimed to increase motility and torque force of E. Coli flagella when we knock-out its natural rotator system proteins MotA and MotB and replace them with PotB59/PomA systems. As we needed these two proteins together, we combined them on the same biobrick when we ordered the gene sequences. In gene designing, we considered producing onlyone RNA for these two genes but having two different proteins when this RNA translated. In addition to this, to have a controllable system, LacI protein attachable Lac operator was added between this sequence and T7promoter sequence. We searched to find a vector which can lay down all those conditions and found out that peT-45 expression vector is useful. When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of PotB59/PomAgene sequence and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning them into peT-45. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequences and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered PotB59/PomA gene sequence into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is; respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-PotB59-RBS-PomA-S-tag. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter"

BBa_K1913015 encodes a Cry3Aa1-like protein that has a high level of toxicity towards most kinds of insects. We experimentally validated its toxicity in vitro by using brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV).
BBa_K1913025 and BBa_K1913026 are FixK2/plac hybrid promoters, which were functionally validated in combination with a light sensor generator( BBa_K1913034 ).
Considered safety in our project by implementing a optogenetic kill switch system and a synthetic amino acid system to prevent horizontal gene transfer. By implementing these systems, we will reduce the environmental impact of BeeT.
Collaborated with the TU Delft and Groningen iGEM teams.
As human practice activities, we discussed our project application scenario with Synenergene and we wrote a future scenario involving BeeT application in collaboration with them. We also organized the national Dutch iGEM conference with other iGEM teams to share our experiences.
Gold Medal Requirements:
Improved and verify several previous parts:
We improved the characterization of BBa_K546000 , a quorum sensing composite part that we tested together with BBa_K1913005 , resulting in these fluorescence graphs .
Based on the original FixK2 promoter ( BBa_K592006 made by Uppsala-Sweden_2011), we designed and provided new FixK2 promoters by adding a core control element and operons to the canonical FixJ binding sites, making them controllable by different input signals.
Integrated Human Practices:
We consulted several stakeholders and specialists such as beekeepers from the Dutch Beekeeper association and researchers from Wageningen University to get suggestions in order to make our BeeT product more feasible and acceptable. According to their suggestions, our product should fit with the hobbyist character of beekeeping and never affect honey production. We amended our project design following their suggestions.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Work conducted for the Copenhagen Team
How the collaboration was formed
In the beginning of July, we arranged a social event with the other Danish iGEM teams; Copenhagen and DTU-Denmark. The Technical University of Denmark and the University of Copenhagen are geographically located close to each other. At this event each team presented the outline of their project followed by feedback and discussions. The gathering was very rewarding and productive, and it resulted in an excellent collaboration with the team from Copenhagen University.
The project idea of the Copenhagen Team
The Copenhagen team has two interesting and ambitious project ideas.
One project focuses on removing pollutants derived from pharmaceuticals and personal care products from water. The idea is to introduce different types of membrane bound human cytochrome P450's (CYP) into E. coli and following investigate if the cytochromes have an impeding effect on the estrogen level in water.
The second project focuses on a biological system that utilizes cytochrome P450 79's from plants to produce small molecules called oximes, which inhibit mitochondrial peroxidases in fungi. The system is intended to be introduced into E. coli, which would be able to inhibit the capability of the fungi to break down the hydrogen peroxides. Thus E. coli would be able to kill the fungi.
The collaboration
As is often the case with eukaryotic gene sequences, the CYP sequences from humans and plants contained numerous illegal restriction sites according to the Standard Assembly of BioBricks.
This is generally a big problem when working with DNA sequences originating from plants, fungi and mammalian cells. The Copenhagen team had some problems with acquiring sequence information of the human CYP's, which unfortunately delayed their cool project. Furthermore, the elimination of the illegal restriction sites by site-directed mutagenesis caused a"

USTC,2016,Team:USTC-Software#Medals_-_-_TEXT.html," you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.
A2. As long as we were receiving bounteous assistance from others, we did not forget to pay back and transmit our forces as we can. Our Collaborations page elaborates on our aid to other teams.
Q3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
A3. We agreed the importance of human practices. See our Human Practices page for more details.
Gold(All Satisfied)
Q1. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
A1. It is a vain attempt of doing human practices only but not integrating the results into real work. See our Human Practices page for more details.
Q2. Improve the function OR characterization of an existing iGEM project (that your team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
A2. Our project is based on the Biopano, which is the work of the team USTC-Software in 2014. We displayed our progresses here in our Description page .
Q3. Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
A3. We give each module an example on our Proof page so as for users and viewers to comprehend the usages and functions of our software.
P.S. We eventually decided to combine our validations and proofs together in one page since we thought that it should be better to describe our work rather than a stiff split.
Q4. Bring your prototype or other work to the Giant Jamboree and demonstrate it to iGEMers and judges in your track showcase. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
A4. We will give demonstration on the Giant Jamboree with our strongest enthusiasm. You can click to our Description page to get to know about our project in advance.

Constructs
For E. coli BL21
Plan A
This construct was optimized for E.coli BL21.     Strategy A consists of producing the soluble form of the transducer gp130 (sgp130) attached to novel signal peptides, which will allow the secretion of sgp130 to the extracellular media.     In order for our strategy to work, Interleukin-6 (IL6) needs to bind to its soluble receptor (sgp80) forming a dimeric complex capable of binding to the  secreted sgp130; this is going to result in a highly stable trimer.     The trimer will kidnap IL-6, and thus, transignaling pathway will be effectively inhibited.
Composite part Plan A : BBa_K2760010
Both, the IL-6 and the soluble form of the IL-6  receptor, are presented in the human body, specifically, in the gut, where our construct will work. In general, soluble receptors for several cytokines have been detected in different body fluids, these are believed to help modulate cytokine response by binding the ligand and thereby reducing its bioavailability. Since the soluble gp130 can act as an antagonist against the cells with membrane-bound receptor (IL-6R) [1] , the Plan A strategy was developed as a first approach towards developing our psychobiotic.
The system contains  an inducible promoter regulated by nitrosative stress. When nitrosative stress is presented,  the transcription of the soluble form of gp130 will be initiated.  Additionally, a inducible pBAD promoter will be activated with arabinose in order to control the production of NsrR, the protein that blocks the transcription of the PyeaR promoter, these will be a form to control the amount of nitrosative stress needed for the PyeaR activation. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and mCherry will help us corroborate expression of both systems. iLOV will be attached to the pBAD-Nsr"

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Introduction to GA
What's GA
Genetic algorithms are powerful methods for complex optimization problems. They are essentially evolution in a computer. A population of GA population random candidate solutions is generated and scored. These solutions are allowed to mate with each other, generating offspring that are hybrids of both parental solutions. The mating frequencies are related to a boltzmann-like probability term; akin to simulated annealing, the simulation temperature required for calculating these is high early in the run, and cools down. Since the mating probability for a given candidate solution is related to its score, better solutions mate more frequently, making their components more numerous in the offspring. This new population of candidate solutions is scored, ranked, and allowed to mate.
Why GA?
Genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to identify the topology of the network. A rate term can be described as two parts: signal and function type. The former usually indicates the positive and negative interaction from reactants to products which strongly correlate with the SBGN entity relationship diagram. The later reflects the biochemical reaction type. GA searches an optimized solution by mimicking the process of evolution. Members of an initial population compete for the privilege to mate and produce offspring for successive generations. The probability of an individual mating is proportional to the fitness of the environment. The generation with better fitness will be obtained generation by generation. As the topology, the interaction forms and the parameters for each component function are all necessary in the final result, we employed a multi-level optimization. The lowest level optimization is to give the suitable parameters with the topology and the interaction forms known. For the next level, we are trying to find the interactions forms of component functions with the known topology with genetic algorithm. At last, for the upper level, the potential topologies are selected also"

Collaborations
To improve our project we collaborated with several other iGEM teams, returning the favor for them as well. These collaborations include surveys, campaigns, webinars, BioBrick testing and other laboratory partnerships. These, in turn, can roughly be divided into two categories: wet-lab collaborations and human practices collaborations. We collaborated with iGEM TUDelft, Utrecht, USP-Brazil, Uppsala and Cologne-Duesseldorf. Moreover, we had meaningful collaborations with two institutes: The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Institute.
iGEM TUDelft: Drying and storage of E. coli cells
We collaborated with iGEM TUDelft . As both projects involve a diagnostic tool in live cells, it is important to correctly and easily preserve the cells for storage and shipping, ideally without the need of a cold-chain.
Tardigrade proteins
The iGEM team of TUDelft created BioBricks containing proteins from the Tardigrade, an animal known for its tolerance to extreme environments. These proteins can help preserve and stabilize enzymes, which can be greatly beneficial when drying E. coli cells. We tested these three BioBricks:

We participated in their postcard campaign in which we designed a postcard combining the Abu Dhabi skyline and the LAMP reaction that is integral to our project. We wrote a small description of our project on the back, and the postcards were distributed to all participating teams from around the world.         Therefore, STEC-illnesses are still a major problem in countries that revolve around street food.
Groningen
They participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to build a phage detection for Lactococcus Lactis, but were having trouble with the BioBrick 3A assembly and building their device. We suggested that they try using the pJET vector for transformation and implementing a valving system in their device. For the GFP amplification issues they were facing, team Vilnius-Lithuania suggested that they express transcription factors that can bind to multiple sequences at a time to amplify their signal.
Vilnius-Lithuania
They participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to have a synthetic replicant to effectively keep different plasmids in one cell with the ability to control the copy number of each plasmid group separately. We looked into the issue of calculating copy number, while they helped us look at our microfluidic chambers.
Surveys
We participated in the microfluidics survey for Boston University Hardware. We participated in the cholera survey for INSA-UPS Toulouse. We participated in the cattle survey for University Nebraska-Lincoln. We participated in the air pollution survey for Pasteur Paris. We participated in the GM medicine survey for Cardiff University. We participated in the insulin accessibility survey for University of Sydney. We participated in the psicose survey for Evry Paris-Saclay. We participated in the diagnosis device survey for Munich.
