Based on the above-mentioned facts, we can draw the conclusion that our project has various flexible and extensive applicational prospects, due to its fundamentality. Through preliminary consideration, we believe our project can be applied to various aspects, including food processing, biofuel production, water treatment and bio-pharmaceuticals.
Schematic introduction
As mentioned in the overview, in order for the protein to bind to the plasmid–the connector, we have designed two sorts of delicat fusion proteins–the connectee. The first kind of connectee is free while the second is anchored to the cell membrane. Both of them consist of various sections, which are shown in the schematic diagrams below.
!!(插图2幅：融合蛋白的结构，可参考海报或ppt。第一幅图只包括Enzyme-FL-TAL，第二幅图包括所有的，ssDsbA-FP-HL-Lgt-FL-Enzyme-FL-TAL)
TAL protein, the transactivator-like protein. According to its special structure, the TAL protein plays a great role in DNA binding. The 2012 Freiburg iGEM team has offered us a whole set of 96 TAL-protein direpeat bioparts, with which we are supposed to build functional TAL proteins. Since each TAL protein can identify a 14-nucleotide target sequence, the first and fourteenth nucleotide being Thymin, all the 96 parts can be used to identify more than 16 million different nucleotide sequences, which makes it very convenient for us to choose a sequence for the fusion protein to bind to.
The enzyme we want to bring together. Different proteins that bind to the same plasmid contain different enzymes from the same metabolic pathway.
With these two parts combined by a flexible linker, we can obtain the first type of connectee, that is free from the cell membrane. But if we want to bind the fusion protein to it, at least two more sections are needed, which are listed below.
SsDsbA, a signal peptide at the N-terminal of the protein. It can direct the fusion protein to the preiplasm.
Lgt, a transmembrane protein whose function has been identified in previous iGEM projects. All these four sections, together with linkers,"

This week, we began to think about our thesis again. Whew. A few of us began reorganizing the information we needed to write about to make the paper more clear. We also had a meeting at the end of the week about expectations for writing during the coming week.
After finding out about the IRB, we applied for exemption. We then found out that we would have to revise our questionnaires. Appropriate changes were made and the application was submitted again (this happens several more times in the next week or so).
Some of us considered different design and selectable marker options to test integration of genes into the yeast genome. We learned that one of our steps lacks a reliable selectable marker test, but that replica plating may provide sufficient levels of certainty.
Our several lab groups worked tirelessly to make more media, to check for deletions in plasmids, and to design primers that actually work.
Now that we have lox-URA3-lox, linearized pUC19, and amplified homologous arms, we are able to begin Gibson Assembly. We did two gibsons this week. The first Gibson includes the parts mentioned above and the second is our linearized pXRL2 along with several gene fragments: ADR, FDX, Delta7H, p450SCC, and 3BH. After combining the neccessary components with the Gibson Master Mix, we put it in the PCR machine for an hour and then stored it on ice. The following day we inoculated the gibson products on high copy LB-AMP plates. The pUC19 plate grew normally but the pXRL2 plate lawned.
We then picked colonies from the pUC19 plate and transformed it in liquid cultures. We then performed colony PCR to check if our Gibson assembly was successful. It likely did not work. The gel showed very bright bands in the wrong areas but a faint band where our desired product would be. With this information, we made streak plates of the potential successful colonies in hopes to isolate what we believe to be our desired gibson product and"

We spoke to Evan about our plans for the future, including our plan to distribute portable kits to non-profits working in targeted areas. He confirmed the practicality of our project goals and our future plans.  On October 15, 2018, two Thirst Project road warriors, Erin and Kyle, came to speak to Lambert students about the water crisis and how we can take action to alleviate its devastating effects on a community.
Key Points from the Thirst Project Presentation
Waterborne diseases kill more children every single year than AIDS, Malaria, and all world violence combined.
Disease rates can drop by up to 88% virtually overnight by providing a community safe drinking water.
For a person with HIV/AIDS, even if he/she has access to medical treatment or antiretroviral medication, but is still forced to drink dirty water from contaminated sources, the diseases in the water he/she drinks will actually kill them faster than AIDS itself.
Women and children spend an average six to eight hours every day walking to fetch water, and the average distance that women and children in developing communities walk to obtain water is 3.75 miles.
The Thirst Project spoke about their commitment to provide safe, clean drinking water to the entire nation of Swaziland by 2022! This project will cost a little more than $50 million.

Summary Points
Exposure of young girls to science as a fun and accessible field
Improvement of communication skills through explanation of complex concepts to younger children
Lambert iGEM recognizes the significance of disproportionate demographics in the biotechnology and the scientific community as a whole, especially with women. This problem is largely due to lack of exposure to STEM as young girls. Lambert iGEM discovered that most lab kits or chemistry sets for children were marketed towards boys rather than girls. As a result, the team created a doll kit specifically designed for elementary-aged girls to increase exposure and interest in biotechnology. These kits include basic laboratory materials such as pipettes and beakers as well as Lambert iGEM’s very own 3DFuge. This kit allows girls to explore biotechnology as fun and accessible rather than something strictly for boys, significantly increasing interest in the science field. Placing the possibility of a successful career as a scientist in the minds of young girls has immeasurable value to the confidence of the girls themselves as well as the scientific community as a whole.

The assembly plan of the Sensing system.
Background
Communication using quorum sensing
Quorum sensing (QS) is the communication tool of bacteria. It is usually done through secretion and detection of small signal molecules or proteins. Depending on the bacterial density, these molecules can trigger a change of behaviour, i.e. invoke a function only when there are enough bacteria present in that one area. Quorum sensing can control several things, from biofilm formation to bioluminescence. The most commonly known and most explored QS system is the Lux system, which was originally isolated from Vibrio fischeri, where it controls the production of luciferase, an enzyme that aids in the production of a yellow light.
Using the pathogens own quorum sensing system to detect and track its source
When we decided that we wanted to fight pathogens it became obvious that we needed a way to detect and track them. After doing some research, we decided that this could be  done by hijacking the pathogen’s own quorum sensing. Naturally, the first thought that came to our minds was to use the Lux system from V. fischeri. However, this had been done before in 2008 by Heidelberg and it also did not provide the specificity that we wanted for our system. We decided to dig deeper and see if we could find a more unique quorum sensing system. Among some potential candidates was Yersinia enterocolitica, which uses a quorum sensing system called the Yen system.
The Yen system
As it turns out Y. enterocolitica has a homologous quorum sensing system to the famous Lux system, the Yen system. From this system we chose to steal two parts. A recognition region, the yenbox, fused together with a promoter and an activator, YenR, that can recognise and interact with the yenbox. When YenR binds to the yenbox it induces the expression level of the promoter fused to the yenbox. Later, in the presence of Y. enterocolitica, its signaling molecules, 3-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (OHHL), will start flowing into our system, interacting with YenR. When binding occurs between OHHL and YenR, YenR will lose its active shape and thereby its ability to interact with the yenbox. The induction will then be lost and the"

Hi there! I am a Biotechnologist about to start a PhD in systems biology and ""-omics""-based approaches to bioremediation.
I was trapped by iGEM (and SB in general) 3 years ago, when I was part of the iGEM 2009 Valencia  Team .      Now, I'm very happy to repeat such an amazing experience as advisor.
The thing I like the most (apart from working in the lab, of course...) is travelling and meeting people from other countries, so I hope to see you in Amsterdam and Boston!
I'm an Electronic Eng. and I'm doing my PhD in Control Systems oriented to Synthetic Biology.
I play Guitar as hobby (although I studied almost all my life) and I like      traveling, biking, swimming, rock climbing, yoga, taking pictures and many things more...!!!.
I was iGEMer in 2010, and now I'm back as Advisor, so it seems iGEM is      something good, what do you think?
but I don't have time to fight Entropy... Take a look to my iGEM2010 user page or      to my web page.

Hello everybody! I am a biologist in her last year of a Biotechnology master.
I was a member of Valencia 2009 and 2010 iGEM team and I enjoyed so much both competitions that I wanted to participate one more time.
I am eager to start my PhD next year and feel the suffering but comforting experience of making science.
My main hobbies are reading, writing,      drawing, bellydancing and when my budget lets me to do it, traveling.
Hi! I have always enjoyed abstract topics like music and mathematics. Somehow I got interested in something much more terrestrial like molecular biology and I      decided to study biochemistry as my main career. I was a member of the Valencia iGEM team in 2009"
BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#HPSilver_-_-_TEXT.html," the yeast. And the most important thing is biology safety. In our project, the laboratory strains we used are routine strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. In addition, the sweet receptor protein we used is T1R2/T1R3, it’s safe too. We communicate with Dr. Yang about the safety details of the project.
COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phase of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology. Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accepted one of them, which recommended us to set saccharose as the standard. After that running, the test would be more reasonable.
MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In September, we were interviewed by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Institute of Technology, and we had launched a website campaign on the BIT official website of synthetic biology and iGEM. In the course of the interview, we carried out scientific exchanges on the knowledge of sweet substances.
iGEM MEETING
In the late September, in order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for all the students of all majors in BIT. At the meeting, we had a total of three links, the first link was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second link was brainstorm, so that students can think about our project's innovative point and flash point with our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us any project and team related things. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is further sublimated.

At the 85th anniversary of Beijing institute of technology, we were invited to show iGEM and our project to alumni. In our display case, we prepared some small biology games, and we told students what‘s Synthetic biology. And we introduced our former projects to people. They can learn about iGEM through our past competition experiences. Meanwhile, we can improve our project through the suggestions of students. In this open-ended activity, we communicated with more than 3000 people, and got more than 500 suggestions. In the open-ended activity, we select sweet substances as our inducers better.

WHAT WE DO?
ModVision and Finding Diphthy has found their way to do collaboration in iGEM 2018. We have managed to contact one of the members of iGEM NTU via Angelysia Cardilla in the beginning of July. We offered help in gathering data about the idea and survey application of Nanopore sequencing from the perspective of Indonesian people as representatives of developing country’s citizens. Our team went to Faculty of Engineering, exactly located at college auditorium, to do intensive proposal towards nearby biotech students to be intrigued with our project about Finding Diphthy, as well as ModVision. QnA sessions and survey filling form were available for the end of each introductory explanation. This session was such a participative event between NTU and UI, since different citizens have vast range of opinion regarding biological engineering. Profound discussion in several aspects, such as socioeconomic condition, law, bioethics, etc., of ModVision and Finding Diphthy development could offer insights about their application in countries, especially developing ones. In addition, we also analyzed the result we obtained for NTU and the analysis can be seen here
Figure 1. Our team presents projects of Finding Diphthy and ModVision in collaboration within iGEM 2018 for silver medal criteria. Discussion and surveys were done by our policy and practice division member iGEM UI Ainun Rahmania and Glory Lamria.
WHAT WE ASK?
After two months of lab session starting from June, we encountered such unexpected bad events in doing PCR amplification of the HT-1 and HT-2 fragments. These fragments are meant to be ligated linearly to form single basic biobrick part of HB-EGF/Tar since IDTTM were not able to synthesize as one gBlocks. The cloning primer Fwd and Rev (personally synthesized primer) and for amplification fail to specifically anneal in the 5’ and 3’ of both fragments. The results of the PCR amplification are shown in following figure 2.

The construction of a database with well characterised genetic parts, with assigned mathematically abstracted functions that can be modelled in a software and turning electronic circuits into molecule representations via DNA synthesis could lead to a more economically and social value of what Synthetic Biology projects can offer. The currently available computational tools for the representation of genetic networks, include Antimony, Athena, BioJade, GenoCAD, OptCircuit, SynBioSS and many more software tools which were constructed to integrate all the relevant aspects of a biological system (Purnick and Weiss, 2009).

Shiga toxin 1 and 2 have 55% homology and are composed of 5 identical highly conserved B subunits that bind to the Gb3 host receptor cells and a single A subunit which enters the host target cell and cleaves rRNA. Cattle do not have Gb3, consequently, O157:H7 infected cattle are asymptomatic and difficult to detect. More than 200 serotypes of E.coli contain Stx, of these, some have LEE (locus of enterocyte) which does not directly indicate pathogenicity. Other strains of pathogenic shiga toxin producing E. coli recognized by the USDA as harmful are: O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:H8, O118:H16, O121:H19, and O145:H28 (USDA  Laboratory Guidebook, 2012). These strains are also known as the Big Six. Currently, the USDA targets both the eae and stx genes in the PCR. When these genes are being used in identification, if the sample tests positive for both eae and stx, the sample undergoes further testing. If it only has one or neither of the genes, the sample is considered safe and testing stops (USDA  Laboratory Guidebook, 2012).
Regarding our TALE construct, we compared 2 standard construction strategies for multiple DNA fragments: Golden Gate and Gibson Assembly. Gibson Assembly is a one-step isothermal reaction involving an exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase. All enzymes are put together in one reaction along with DNA fragments and the vector and incubated at 50°C for 15 to 60 min. (Gibson et al., 2009)
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
This week, we had the opportunity to tour Cargill Meat Solutions’ High River beef plant and experience firsthand the stringency and efficiency of the meat processing facility. Global prevalence of O157:H7 in cattle farms is 20% (Chase-Topping et al., 2008) and the presence of super shedders is influenced by the E. coli strain and host dependent factors (breed, sex, reproductivity, stress, movement) independent of the external farm environment (Chase-Topping et al., 2007). These few super shedders are important factors to pre-harvest contamination as"

This involved demonstrating various lab activities from basic pipetting to performing restriction digests and running gel electrophoresis. We also performed an activity which looked at the bacteria on skin before and after washing hands, the effectiveness of chemicals on killing bacteria and even gram stained these, looking under them at a microscope. A lot of the experiments were new to the students so it was essential to explain the techniques and assist throughout.
It was also an opportunity to give advice about university and share our own personal experiences.
Amandeep and Abbie also gave a lecture on iGEM, synthetic biology and ageing. Afterwards we ran a workshop and debate with regards to synthetic biology and ageing research as before to the 30 students on the stream. We really enjoy this activity due to the consideration of ethics, economics and personal experiences. Not only did we get to see how well the students were interacting and learning, but the points that were raised in the debates got the team members thinking about things that we had never thought about initially. Chris – the organiser of the summer school said that he would love to integrate iGEM into the summer school program every year because of the success this year. Some highlights have been collated in the video.
Healthy ageing in London: Interactive workshop
Friday was another day of presenting for us 3- this time to year 8 students - we gave them an insight into ageing in London and again encouraged participation. After our talk we again set up a debate in which the students represented one of the following stakeholders: 'Business person wanting to build a gym', 'scientist wanting to build an ageing research institution', 'doctor wanting to build a walk-in clinic' and 'the council wanting to build a community centre'.
Again, great arguments were constructed which considered the negatives of the other parties as well as the strengths of their own. They considered the different types of job prospects, ethics and short vs long term investments. We were particularly pleased with the vote outcome in which the students favoured a research institution to be built.

But why is Kaohsiung Girls Senior High School? what makes Kaohsiung Girls Senior High School so special?
KGHS (short for Kaohsiung Girls Senior High School) was built in 1924, and it is one of the best high school in south Taiwan, despite the fact that it is a school only for girls.
Teachers in KGHS encourages the students to develop their interests in science, they spend their own time to give extra lessons to the students, therefore they always won many prizes in Taiwan National Science Fair. We want to challenge them to look more             globally, stand out of Taiwan and shine in the world.
To be honest, even in nowadays there are still some gender stereotypes in Taiwan’s culture. For example, they tend to girls to study literature or business instead of science. They don’t understand that if the girls were given same chances as the boys,             they may have even better performance. Thus, we want to break this stereotype.
Process
We went to two class to have a little sharing, and each class have around 45 students and a homeroom teacher.
Before we started to talk about the main point of our sharing, we first shared the tips to study in high school? How we manage our time? We do so is because high school students in Taiwan are under huge pressure of having good grades and entering good             university. Those extracurricular events that won’t give you better grades are often disapproved by parents. We want to prove to them that it is possible to balance school works and after school club.
The highlight is definitely when we shared our project to them. First, We introduced why we want to do this project. We talked about the problems caused by aquaculture in Taiwan, including stratum subsidence and river eutrophication. We learnt those problems             a lot in school ad media, they are something that most of the Taiwanese are familiar with, you can easily judge by their facial expression knowing that they agree with you.
Second, we shared how we built our special E. coli and the device we are going to combine with, trying to let them know that iGEM is not simply a molecular biology competition but a opportunity that you can work with incredible people in every area. In             other words, even though biology is not your passion you can still find your spot.
Last but not the least, we showed them the human practice activities we have done and what we have planned for the future. Let them understand the duty of every person who is well educated is to teach the public and the"

Procedure
For our experiment this year，there are 3 main steps:
1.Construct two expression vectors
2.Transform expression vectors into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and verify positive transformants
3.Detect Hydrogen yield
1. Construct 2 expression vector
We constructed two expression vectors for our project，they are pDb124-BD-CIB1 and pDh124-VP16-CRY2-UAS-miRNA.The vectors contains the following parts：GAL4 BD：The DNA binding domain of yeast transcription activator protein.PCR from plasmid pGBKT7.
VP16 AD: The activation domain of herpes simplex virus,which has transcriptional activation activity.We made codon optimization for the VP16 AD,according to the codon bias of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Synthesized by biological company.
UAS: Upstream activating sequence,can bind with GAL4 BD.Synthesized by biological company.
CRY2: Cryptochrome2, the blue light receptor protein.PCR form Arabidopsis thaliana's cDNA
CIB1: Blue light receptor interacting protein,combing with CRY2 under blue light.PCR form Arabidopsis thaliana's cDNA.
amiRNA-D1 and amiRNA-FNR: Designed by ourselves，exchanging some sequence of miRNA1162，can inhibit the expression of D1 and FNR. Synthesized by biological company.
The vector backbones we use in this project is the two kind of vectors we usually use in our lab——pDp124 and pDh124.
Inside the vectors，5'PsaD is the 5' sequence located before the gene coding region of PsaD，it is a constitutive promoter which can promote the two fusion protein——GAL4 DNA binding domain-CIB1 and VP16-CRY2.3' PsaD is the corresponding 3' sequence of PsaD，it plays an important role in constitutive high-expression of exogenous gene.Paro is responsible for the resistance gene of Paromomycin. Hyg is responsible for the resistance gene of Hygromycin B，we can use Paromomycin and Hygromycin B to verify positive transformants.

To prepare the knockout 5 µl CM solution (pFerritin with canamycin resistance cassette)and 500 µl culture solution were added to 5 ml LB media. For each stain two samples were determined (RV1/2 and N1/2). The samples were incubated at 37°C up to an OD600 of 0.53-0.55.                After incubation 1 ml of each culture was transferred in sterile eppi and washed for 7 min at 7000 rpm and 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml sterile H2O and washed for 7 min at 7000 rpm and 4°C and discarded the supernatant.                 The pellet of N1 was resuspended in 25 µl pRFP (c = 41 ng/µl) and 25 µl sterile H2O. The pellets of N2 and RV1/2 were resuspended in 2 µl pRFP and 50 µl sterile H2O. 50 µl of each suspension were transferred in electroporation cuvette and electroporated for a few sec (table below). Directly after this, 1 ml fresh LB media (37°C) was added, the suspension was transferred in a sterile eppi and incubated at 37°C at 600 rpm. The cultures were recovered, deleted on CM+Amp plates and incubated at 37°C ove night.

How should incorporate the work of modeling into the whole story? Imperial College London 2010 has a solution. Their presentation is a wonderful combination of wet and dry lab in the presentation.
And a piece of video of suitable timing can convey different information in a different way.
Imperial College London 2010
As for the presentation of the same college, but in the year of 2011, they have other advantages. Pellucid logic with inviting skills of introducing a project from its origin to its achievement, from problem faced to their solutions.
They have presented a perfect example of clothing on stage, relative to their subject..

What if each module contains rather professional knowledge that makes it difficult to be accomplished by one or two narrators?
The presentation of Cambridge team of 2009 would be an example to illustrate interdisciplinary cooperation and division

Defending yourself is also very important in the whole process. No one wants an anticlimax at the time of Q & A.
Here we show you one of the good examples of excellent defense, where they encountered different questions and tackled them elegantly.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," even further. When we can image every process going on in the cell, we are able to use this for our own good. We can, for example, get a better understanding of a disease, which is essential in finding a cure. An example of a disease that has been studied for years but still not fully understood, is Alzheimer’s disease (Hardy & Selkoe, 2002) . In an ideal future, if we could tag all molecules in a brain cell and image them, we might find what exactly causes the disease and hopefully develop a treatment. Also synthetic biology in general benefits from a good understanding of the cell. When we can trace all enzymes involved in a certain process, for example the alcoholic fermentation in yeast, we can more easily modify genes of interest and optimize this pathway for an improved production of biofuels.
Unfortunately, microscopy hasn’t yet advanced so far that we can track all processes in the cell. Though super-resolution microscopy is quickly developing, there are still several limitations that hinder a full visualization of the cell. At this point, the technology and knowledge of microscopy is not the biggest limit for making detailed images of the cell; it’s the cells itself. When using fluorescence microscopy, the limit of the resolution of the microscopy is the amount of photons that your sample emits. However, not all photons are observed by the detector of the microscope, simply because not all photons reach this it and get lost in its noise (Heintzmann & Ficz, 2006) . Especially in tracing low intracellular concentrations or high-speed cellular processes, the amount of photons emitted is low (Lakowicz, 2013) . We aim to improve this limit of microscopy using synthetic biology.
Figure 1: When a fluorescent cell is imaged, not all photons will reach the detector, so not all photons will be detected.
Improving microscopy using biology
The chance of a photon being observed is defined by both the chance of the photon being emitted and the photon being detected (Heintzmann & Ficz, 2006) . We have thought of two possible solutions to improve the observation of a photon. The first one is increasing the chance of a photon being emitted by the sample, which in this case, are our cells. We will do this by modifying the cells in such a way they are emitting more photons for the same amount of fluorophores. This technique is based on the working principle of a laser. Therefore, we will call these cells the Biolaser.
A second approach to increase the chance of a photon hitting the detector is by directing the photons towards it. An"
BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," part BBa_K1139151 (sequence uploaded by Tokyo-Tech 2013, sample synthesized by ourselves), a hybrid promoter which can be regulated by both lacR and λ CI repressor. The promoter reaches its highest intensity of expression when both IPTG and CI exists. At the downstream of the promoter, a GFP was connected to simplify further experiments.
For the reason that the expression of both CI and GFP in our circuit are at least partially controlled by the concentration of IPTG, merely comparing the florescence intensity of our target strain between IPTG’s present and absent is not abundant to describe the function of CI since there is a possibility that the induction effect may be caused by adding IPTG only. Considering this point, we designed another control vector which only has the hybrid promoter and GFP downstream but lacks CI. We separately transformed these two plasmids to E. coli BL21(DE3) to make the control strain and the experiment strain. Therefore, through comparing the difference between IPTG’s present and absent in each strain, and the difference between the differences (previously mentioned) of the two strains, we could thus describe the function of CI rigorously.
To state it in detail, we first obtained the florescence intensity (FI) and OD600 values of different cultures (4 in total), and calculated the single cell florescence intensity (SFI):
SFI = FI / OD600, for a certain culture
There’s no harm to define the total induction effect (IEtot) of IPTG as follows:
IEtot = SFI of the culture with IPTG present / SFI of the culture with IPTG absent, for a certain strain
According to our gene circuits, IPTG activates both GFP and CI (which further activates GFP as well) in the experiment strain. While in the control strain, IPTG only activates GFP directly. Therefore, the neat induction effect of CI (NIECI)can be simply calculated using the formula provided below:
NIECI = IEtot of the experiment strain - IEtot of the control strain
We first incubated monoclones of each strain in LB media with ampicillin overnight to obtain cultures reaching the plateau state of growth. We then dilute the culture separately to a final OD600 value of 0.1 using fresh LB media with ampicillin, and incubated them again until the OD600 value reached 0.5. IPTG was added to half of these cultures, respectively. Timing started here and this point was marked as 0h. Samples were taken every one hour (0h included) until the value of"
USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. To protect our planet, the waste of plastic, or 'White Pollution' for more exact, must be settled down.             As a synthetic biology lab, we first studied a lot about 'plastic's biology decomposition'. Though we didn't choose it as our project at last, we found synthetic biology a useful tool to deal with white pollution in the future. Then we held about 3 conferences to discuss what and how we can do to deal with plastic waste with synthetic biology. During the discussion, we came out with some practicable solution. A bright future with no more white pollution is showed in front of us.             After that, we held a environmental friendly event called 'Plastic for Plants' combined with some popularization of science. We asked college students to collect their used plastic things for about 3 months and bring them to us then. We would send these bottles to the plastic recycling center and we would give students some plants as a reward.           Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. From the recycling center, we were told that the percentage of plastic that can be fully recycled, rather than downcycled or go to waste can be increased when manufacture technique improves. On the other hand, the use of biodegradable plastics is increasing. As future synthetic biologic scientists, we are determined to green the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development in the future.
Lecture for High School Students
We invited a group of high school students to see our laboratory and tell them something about synthetic biology and our project. In this way we hope to share some knowledge of science and attract them to devote to themselves to the process of discovering mysteries of nature in the future.
A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in July. We introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.
In the beginning we introduced iGEM to students using 3 interesting iGEM projects as examples. Then we held a small class for the students: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for students to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures.
We talked about the scale, location, function, discovery and shape of DNA based on history and researches as well as knowledge of genetic engineering introduced by a project done by USTC in iGEM 2014.
We also included a brief history about the development of synthetic biology in the lecture,"
Tianjin,2014,Team:Tianjin#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," AHL was added to the medium at  first. AHL combines with the product of luxR, and they act in concert to  repress the function of promoter R0063. As a result, the MIN system cannot  work. However, AHL will be degraded by the proteins expressed by Aii gene. As  the population of E.coli grows, the concentration of AHL gradually decreases.  When it reaches a threshold value, AHL lose the ability to bind with the  product of luxR. Then the depression of MIN will be removed. MinC proteins and  MinD proteins can bind with each other to form MinCD division inhibitors. The  inhibitors can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of  cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all  the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves.
We use a classical model, density-dependent  growth model, for our population of E.coli growing simulation. Also we use some  other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR  proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
 
M
The    concentration of total MinC proteins
N
Cell    density
R
The    concentration of total proteins[LuxR]
A
The    number of AHL signal
k
Growth    constant
kA
The    binding rate between AHL and LuxR proteins
kM
Production    rate of MinC.
kR
The    production rate of LuxR proteins
d
The    death rate related with MinC proteins.
di
The    degradation rate of materials.
Then we use these equations to simulate the function  of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
 
Figure 1. The dynamic change of  cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell  stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of  LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
 
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC  proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of  E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is  removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell  division process is inhibited.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," infection of pregnant women. Pregnant women can be infected by contact with lamming sheep, because sheep are often carriers of Chlamydia abortus Chlamydia abortus is often causing lamm loss or abortions in sheep and if a pregnant woman comes in contact with lamming sheep it can happen that she gets the infection and it will have serious consequences for the pregnancy. One has to say that this zoonosis is not encountered very often and the awareness has increased, so we observe only few cases. Yet often cases are poorly documented because for some reason even if the origin of the infection may have been established they are not properly documented so we have very few cases we can talk about. Another case of zoonotic transmission is in the Trachoma area. Until some years ago Chlamydia trachomatis was considered to be the only agent of trachoma [...]. But recent studies have shown that other chlamydia species can be involved, for example Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pecorum and Chlamydia suis These other chlamydia [...] are acquired by contact with animals. People in endemic areas often live in close contact with their domestic animals. So it's easy to suggest transmission from those animals to the people. And if the proper hygiene is lacking it is easy to transfer the pathogen in your eye and get trachomatis. This is more or less the scope of the psittacosis caused by chlamydia.
Kai:
Is there an impact on the cultivation of animals? Do infections in herds result in economic damage?
Prof. Sachse:
Yes very much so and this is a factor that is underestimated worldwide. What people are aware of is the open and acute infections. Of course everybody knows that massive abortion of sheep flocks will cause economic damage and there are figures from the United Kingdom, for example showing this very dramatically. but apart from the acute infections we have a lot of endemic chlamydia with herd prevalences up to 60 % in the cattle population of Germany for example. The situation is the same in other countries and this is not noticed usually if there is no diagnosis especially undertaken. Because there are no dramatic outbreaks but the chlamydia infections persists throughout the life of the cattle from the calf until the end of the life of a dairy cow for example. We have been able to show that these persistent infections, although they are in rare cases causing open clinical signs, these persistent infections affect the performance of the animal like daily weight gain if it's feedlot cattle, so they should gain weight with"

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary"

The solvent contains the other parts and allows for the ink to be stored in liquid form as well and it will evaporate rapidly as they are volatile and will leave the resin and solvent on the substrate. If we were to ever apply our pigments to printer ink we would need to very carefully control the proportions of pigments resin and solvent as printer require a specific and controlled viscosity in order to correctly use the ink.
Proof of Concept
When we were investigating what our proof of concept should be, we talked to the business liaison at the University of Lethbridge Greg Vilk, and he proposed we do a ""simple showcase"". He explained that in order to show that our project can work as intended, we need only to prove the concept in the easiest way (for more information concerning our interview with Greg Vilk, click here ). For our proof of concept, we intend make an ink with pigments extracted from an alternate source and put them into fountain pens. We bought common supplement tablets (Lutein tablets, which contain lutein and zeaxanthin and cranberry extract tablets, which contain anthocyanin). We attempted an extraction of the pigments using either acetone or water (Figure 2). Both solvents were able to extract pigment, but they resulted in different shades and intensities of colour. (Figure 2 and 3). Guar gum was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to increase the viscosity of the ink and help it bind to surfaces. The guar gum thickened the water based inks, but precipitated in the acetone based inks (Figure 2).

We did so trying to get the result quantitively, from which we extracted values of parameters in conjugation modeling.
Adhesion test of C.crescentus
To prove the indication in papers that C.crescentus's holdfast is able to adhere to surfaces strongly, we tested the adhesion ability of C.crescentus compared with E.coli
We firstly cultivated C.crescentus and E.coli in their best growth condition. Several slide glasses were put into the media to let bacteria adhere to glass surface in enough time. After one-day's development, slide glasses were picked out and washed in a strong and stable water flow about 2 mins. Then using Gram Staining, we could detect the bacteria on the glasses surfaces. The results showed that much more C.crescentus existed on the surface than E.coli, which proved enough adhesive ability of C.crescentus. More meticulous experiments should be conducted under electromicroscopes.
Motion Control
DgrA, DgrB are used to control flagellum rotation and HfiA inhibits the synthesis of lipid which is a key component of holdfast.
The electrophoresis results is like this.
DgrA, DgrB and HfiA
The standard parts construction have been accomplished, which helps motion regulation and holdfast biosynthesis of bacteria.
Kill Switch
We constructed the plasmid with lactose operator and signal peptide, and transformed this plasmid into E.coli to test if this kill switch works. We used gradient plate method in our experiment.  As we can see in the picture, the concentration of IPTG on the left of the medium is 0.1% while the concentration on the right is zero. We can see colony only on the right of the medium, the kill switch is effective which illustrates that IPTG can induce the expression of signal peptide and LALF so as to inhibit the growth of the E.coil. Also, a decrease of OD is observed too, after we added IPTG to the liquid culture medium, which means our kill switch did work well.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today

We ran a 2% gel to isolate J23101(E-S) insert, but unfortunately we could not see any band at the expected size of 35 bp...
We planned not to perform any ligation: unlucky day for them!:(
NOTE: we did not re-try to extract J23101(E-S) because it is too small.
Our A4 ligation is composed by RBS-tetR-TT-Ptet , so it can be considered as a constitutive promoter (Ptet) with an additional ""non functional"" part (RBS-tetR-TT). So it can be easily used as an insert for assembly because of its 900 bp size, that allows it to be efficiently isolated and extracted from a gel!
For this reason, we infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 15 ul of A4 glycerol stock (X4 falcon tubes). The following day we plan to cut A4(E-S) (X2) to use it as a constitutive promoter for A3(E-X), while we plan to cut A4(X-P) (X2) to ligate it to J23100 to constitute an aTc->PoPS inducible device. We performed all the inocula X2 because we wanted to be sure to have a sufficient yield for ligations.

The Future of Malaria
Introduction
We have come far in the past century regarding treatment of malaria. With a number of therapeutic drugs available, the chances of escaping the clutches of malaria are now higher than ever before. Here, we take a look at what the future holds for malaria.
Re-thinking the global distribution
One of more chilling thoughts regarding the future of malaria is its spread beyond the areas that it currently occupies.  Malaria now predominantly occurs in countries that are at or near the equator. This includes a thick band of countries on the African continent, as well as parts of South America and countries in south and south-east Asia. These are the regions that are traditionally associated with the disease because their tropical climates help to support the mosquito populations that carry the malaria-causing parasite. Those countries that are located outside that band around the center of the globe assume themselves to be safe.
However, the Earth is getting warmer. According to NASA’s website, the global temperature has increased by about 1.4 F since 1880. As well as rising sea levels, this has the potential to lead to the spread of malaria beyond the band that it currently occupies.  This means that malaria will begin to occur in parts of Europe and North America and cause an extra risk to the health of these populations.
Funding
In order to combat malaria, we need money. The funding for the control and elimination of malaria in 2013 was 2.7 billion US dollars which is below the 5.1 billion that was estimated to be needed. 72% of that funding was supplied by WHO African Region. This seems natural because the majority of cases of malaria occur in Africa.
However, to reach the target of 5.1 billion US dollars that is needed, more regions that are at risk of malaria such as south-east Asia should provide funding and not place the burden on African countries alone. Funding should be significantly increased in the future in order to ensure that malaria is adequately controlled and possibly even eradicated forever like the smallpox virus.
Vector-Controlling Future
The last decade has seen a significant increase in the use of vector controlling methods to prevent infection with malaria. Vector control is where the"

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Functionalisation_-_-_TEXT.html," visible protein to initially fuse to our CBDs. We also designed one of our assays [insert link on 'one of our assays'] for characterising CBD binding using the sfGFP fusion constructs. sfGFP already existed in the registry ( BBa_I746916 ), detailed information on sfGFP properties is included in this part description) however since we needed to make fusion proteins with our CBDs we modified the part and submitted it in RFC[25] Freiberg fusion format ( K1321337 ). We created the following fusion parts with sfGFP:
Metal Binding Proteins
One of the contaminants we can filter out which current size-exclusion technologies can not target, are heavy metals . We have worked with four different metal binding proteins: the metallothioneins SmtA and fMT, a histidine-rich nickel binding protein (NiBP) from the bacterium Heliobacter pylori and a synthetic phytochelatin (PC) EC20.
SmtA and fMT metallothioneins
These two parts already existed in the BioBrick registry, but since we needed to use them as fusions with the CBDs we improved the parts by making them compatible with the RFC(25) Frieburg Fusion BioBrick standard.
Metallothioneins (MTs) are genetically encoded cysteine-rich peptides which serve a role in the detoxification of heavy metals in plants, animals and some prokaryotes (Cobbett, 2002). They have a similar structure and function to phytochelatins, but are produced by different mechanisms (Cobbett, 2002). SmtA is from the cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. and was used by the Tokyo-NoKoGen 2011 iGEM team (who submitted the RFC10 part originally, BBa_K519010 ) to confer cadmium (Cd2+) tolerance to E. coli cells when expressed. fMT originates from the seaweed Fucus vesiculosus and was submitted by Groningen 2009 iGEM team and detailed information can be found on the original part page ( BBa_K190019 ).
We successfully cloned the following CBD fusion constructs:
SmtA-CBD fusion parts
fMT-CBD fusion parts
Nickel binding protein (NiBP)
NiBP-CBD fusions parts
This protein is the histidine-rich nickel-binding protein from Heliobacter pylori (GenBank accession ACX98466.1), and already existed as a BioBrick in the registry ( K1151001 ). Since we"

The other-answers:
There are mainly two camps in the open-answer group. The first does not fear the possibility of synthetic biology terror because they believe that terrorists have simpler options; there are far cheaper and more effective ways of performing a terrorist attack than through synthetic biology.
The other group assumes that even if strict regulations/policies emanate, those that would like to harm others will always bend or break the rules. Even though tight regulations are needed we need to consider the fact that a possibility is that the rules would be ignored, possibly for terror purposes.
Most people acknowledge the risk of synthetic biology principles being used for terrorist purposes, but in contrast to the previous question, there are much more people that think new regulation will not be the answer, mostly because they have the feeling that if terrorist want to use synthetic biology as a means to their own ends, they will find a way of doing that anyway. Nevertheless a plurality of 46% believes that enforcing additional policies can minimize this risk.
Graph 9.
9. The naturalness of a certain system is generally explained as ""its quality of being natural or being based on natural principles"". How do you perceive the risk of human interference with nature (for example, trough new technology)?
If you cannot prove that these new technologies are safe assume they are dangerous
If you cannot prove that these new technologies are dangerous assume they are safe
If this technology really tends to get out of hand I will react, otherwise there is nothing to do about it
I minimize the risk before doing the actual research
Other:
The question focuses on how researchers approach synthetic biology research, how they deal with risks that are involved and tries to answer how a typical biological engineer perceives and manage risks before doing the actual research. In each answer there is a typical typology that captures commonly encountered types.
25% of the sample could be called egalitarian, they invoke the precautionary principle because they are generally  fearful and risk averse.
A smaller group consisting of 7% of the sample tends to focus more on the rewards of the risks in synthetic biology and could be called an individualist, approaching research optimistically and pragmatically.
The fatalist, 18% in the iGEM community, follows the principle ""to duck when if he sees something about to hit him"", meaning to stop the research only when something really tends to go (fatally) wrong.
The plurality of the group seems to act like professional risk managers. 39% would commission more research to find the right answer to"
Minnesota,2010,Team:Minnesota#Judging_-_-_TEXT.html," is inactivated by IPTG. Conversely, DH5α pro cells expressed the LacI. The conformity among the peaks for the wild-type cells suggest that LacI does not bind to the promoter sequence for GFP and it is hence constitutive. Notice the peaks associated with either cell type share similar numbers of events while the peaks from the different cells do not. The difference in events is likely due to the differential GFP expression between the two E. coli strains.
Cloning of the ethanolamine utilization microcompartment proteins relied upon the use of a vector created in the lab of our faculty mentor Dr. Claudia Schmidt-Dannert (Johnson et al, manuscript in prep). The plasmid contains a constitutively active mutant version of the E. coli Lac promoter: it has the RNA polymerase binding region, but lacks the repressor protein binding site (Schmidt-Dannert, 2000). The modified lac promoter has strong constitutive activity, and is a good candidate for consideration by other registry users. To make our modified lac promoter more attractive (and useful) to other teams, we have characterized it using the flow cytometry technique known as Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). To assay our promoter, we used 2 different E.coli strains - JM109 and DH5 alpha-pro- the latter constitutively expresses the Lac repressor protein (LacI). FACS was used to assay promoter activity in these 2 E. coli strains under varied levels of Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), a compound known to inactivate the LacI protein.  Our rationale was that as our modified lac promoter is constitutively active, neither the presence of LacI nor addition of IPTG should have any effect on the promoter output (GFP expression). The FACS data, presented in Figure 2, demonstrates that activity of the mutant lac promoter is not affected by LacI or varying levels of IPTG, and our promoter is indeed constitutively active.
Our modified lac promoter, along with downstream EGFP, has been cloned into the submission vector pSB1C3 and submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as BBa_K311002 (Figure 3). Before submission, DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence of the mutated lac promoter.
Characterization of Registry Parts submitted by other teams
For fulfilling the judging criteria, apart from our main project we decided to characterize other parts that already exist in the registry. We have picked up few parts from the registry, described in the table below. We have submitted"
Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," biology: “Synthetic biology is a field in biology where biological functions found in living systems of nature, are used as solutions to address technical issues in various areas such as health, environment, basic science or new energies.” And also explained about the production of GMO’s:”Researchers modify an organism, like a bacteria’s DNA, to give it new properties such as the ability to produce a medicine (synthesis of insulin), depollute, emit fluorescence or the ability to detect viruses.”
Further, :”GMO: A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. GMOs are used to produce many medications, genetically modified foods, to produce other goods and are widely used in scientific research.”
We then asked the participant what he thinks about synthetic biology based on what he knows or what he learnt from the definition. 73% of participants had a positive opinion while 6% had a negative opinion. This change can be interpreted in two ways: - Our definition, not very objective, biased the opinion of the participants; - Our definition allowed to associate a meaning to the word ""synthetic biology"" and thus reduced the fear of the unknown experienced by a large proportion of participants.
In order to improve the understanding of synthetic biology of the participant we gave him two examples of synthetic biology applications (two past iGEM projects).
Example 1: An example for the use of synthetic biology is iGEM Paris Bettencourt's 2015 project. They improved an Indian dish by adding vitamins and nutriments produced by living bacteria (originally obtained from the fermented food itself), to help spread those nutriments among Indian people. The bacteria are killed before the meal is consumed.
Example 2: Another application for synthetic biology is the use of genetically modified bacteria to bait and eliminate bee killing parasites.
In conclusion, this large questionnaire, which has received more than 2300 responses worldwide, has allowed us to better understand our subject, air pollution, and how a solution using synthetic biology would be received by the society. While most participants are interested in the potential of synthetic biology, many ask for safety guarantees. We identified a problem of lack of information about indoor air pollution. This questionnaire also confirmed the need for our solution and influenced our application scenario (we chose to act on a local/global scale and to add in our device an application to sensitize and inform the user about his air quality depending on features of his housing).

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Symposium_-_-_TEXT.html," the design of new tools with                 advanced research in biology. Sebastian Maerkl is internationally recognized for                 his many outstanding contributions. Particularly in combining synthetic biology                 and computational systems with microfluidics, he demonstrated that the                 expression of genes in vivo can be provided based on the binding energy profiles                 in vitro. His studies will focus on five areas: the bioengineering of                 biosystems, the engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, the                 engineering of genes and genomes, the engineering of biological systems de novo                 and the development of a new generation of diagnostic devices.

Vera van Noort, Center for Microbial and Plant Genetics
The research group led by Vera van Noort is interested in understanding                 biological systems as a whole. They try to achieve this through computational                 analysis of large-scale data generated by the ever growing number of new                 technologies that can systematically measure the behaviour of multiple cellular                 components, such as biochemical activities, biophysical properties, subcellular                 localization and interaction. They use and develop new methods to integrate,                 visualize and query the large amounts of information available and in such a way                 come to new biological discoveries. A particular focus of the group is                 proteomics and post-translational modifications.
Yves Peeters, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology
After completing his master thesis at KU Leuven, Yves obtained an IWT fellowship                 for his PhD work in the field of synthetic biology. His primary interest goes to                 DNA polymerases and their modifications towards creation of artificial nucleic                 acids.

Aug. 20 – Sep.10 Laboratory establishment: Reagent purchasing
As the first time attending iGEM as a high school team, our lab is not able to do all the experiments involved in DNA level. We bought antibiotics, extraction kits, enzymes, and even markers. At that time, we all have full hopes that our lab is the place we will have a result.
fig.1-3 Doing experiments at the Science building of Beijing National Day School
Sep. 10 – Sep. 31 Groping the whole picture of the experiment: also the taste of failure
During the first couple weeks of experiment, we are in a very relaxed mood while the new semester has just started. We went through the whole process from culturing plasmids till ligation result transformation. However, we failed at the last step. Because we didn’t do any controls and groups, we know nothing about the reason why we failed.
Due to the reason that this is the first time of failure, we are not paying enough attention.
fig.4-6 Photos taken in September
Oct. 1 – Oct. 7 the season of losing hope
October the first is the National Holiday of our country (also the birthday of our school).  In these seven days, we repeat the experiment for twice without GPA and assignment pressure.
The result was still failure. After talking with team UCAS, we discovered our deficiency of control experiments and redesigned almost all of the experiments.
fig.7 Receiving  the kit
Oct. 10- Oct. 14 No hope at all
In this week, we has repeated those experiments again and failed. It seems our digestion enzymes and T4 Ligase are not working anymore.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't"

We were unfortunately unable to create our full, composite plasmid, but we did create it in three separate parts - a sensing part, an antisense RNA part, and a TLP secretion part. Our experiments involved testing the sensing and TLP export parts individually. To do this, we created a test part that combined our sensing part with a GFP reporter and another test part of constitutively expressed TLP with a histidine tag"

Collaboration with iGEM Aachen
Since our iGEM team as well as the team of the RWTH Aachen work with an expanded genetic code via amber supression, we exchanged our knowledge on this topic. Furthermore they tested the incorporation efficiency of our orthogonal tRNA OMT-RS pair with the ""Expanded Genetic Code Measurement Kit"" . In exchange, we modeled the molecular dynamics of Subtilisin E with the nnAA O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-l-tyrosine (ONBY) at the specified position.
To elaborate the influence of ONBY on the structure of Subtilisin E we estimated paramteres for the force filed CHARMm27 in a similar way as we estimated parameters for O-methyl-l-tyrosine. Afterwards, we virtually incorporated ONBY into the wildtype structure (PDB accession number: 3WHI ). The structure was subsequently energy minimized using GROMACSS 5.0.3 in TIP3P water and after equilibration simulated over 50 ns resulting in 5001 conformations. We applied similar conditions to the wildtype protein.
The RMSD over all frames in regard to the initial conformation was computed for both structures and is displayed in figure 1.
Figure 1: RMSD of Subtilisin E wildtype (red) and the mutation variant (blue) compared to the initial conformation.
The conformation with the smallest RMSD towards the consensus structure was chosen to represent the overall conformation and is displayed in figure 2.
Figure 2: Overlay of Subtilisin E wildtype (red) and mutant variant (yellow). The mutated amino acid sidechain is displayed as blocks in PyMOL.
It is evident that there is no relevant difference between the wildtype structure and the mutant variant. Therefore we can conclude that the incorporation of ONBY at tyrosine 77 is not sufficient to significantly alter the structure. This can be traced to the fact that ONBY is introduced at a surface position.

Educative Survey
MOOC
Banning Plastics
To degrade or not
Silver
Gold
For Human Practices, we started with investigation on issues related to plastic and bioplastic consumption by two approaches: a public survey and a report on plastic legislation. This investigation made emerge questions and necessities, which led us to perform a practical part to cover them, consisting on a MOOC. We also did a degradation experiment given some controversies. They also made us rethink about our project and give further insights, on the scaling perspective, taking them into account.
Initial investigation
By getting involved on the PLA idea, we got to know more about bioplastics and we felt more involved on the plastic waste problem. We aimed to discover how much other people knew about the topic and we conducted a survey.
Besides, we noted that globally, public policies tend to gradually ban plastic consumptions. We wondered bioplastic industry could be affected by restrictive legislations directed at petroleum-based plastics.
On the need of public awareness
After conducting a survey on our project, it appeared that people would prefer resorting to bioplastics in their daily life rather than petroleum-based equivalents. Yet the consumption of bioplastics remains lower. Therefore, we decided to focus on solutions to tackle this paradox.
We first noted that people don’t know much about PLA, and even less about synthetic biology. Thus, the first step required is to carry out a pedagogic communicative approach to arise interest on synthetic biology, and then on PLA. That is why we decided to focus on MOOCs as an effective tool to spread knowledge on this topic.
Controversy around biodegradation
While reading about PLA, we noticed there was diversity of opinions on its biodegradability. We"

SWEETNESS AND US
Sweetness, a pleasurable taste associates with happiness and satisfaction.
For most animals including human, it seems innate to be addicted to sugars and some other sweeties.
When we were just babies in the warm embrace of moms, breast milk came firstly as a gift containing galactose which also survived us.
In the Victorian era, some British people ate excessive sweet food thus their tooth were decayed, which was regarded as a symbol of high status in society etcetera.
In some tribes nowadays, people still managed to get honey under the risk of being stung.
As a matter of fact, modern science has demonstrated that our love to sweetness is due to our genes.
Our brain will release serotonin when we take sugar, which makes us feel delightful.
WELL WHY?
Sugar is essential nutrient for everyone.
However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), having excessive sugar is even more harmful than smoking.
Having excessive sugar may not only cause obesity, but also trigger diseases, such as diabetes and gout.
We need to satisfy our brain with sweet things, nevertheless, metabolizable sugar with enough sweetness usually has high calories at the same time.
Therefore, the demand for seeking sweeteners containing both high sweetness and low calories is quite urgent.
To detect sweetness of substances and find new ideal sweeteners, people have done a lot.
At the very beginning, saccharometer was used to physically measure the refraction simplicity, but it is not accurate and can only work on the carbohydrate.
Then some people were hired and trained as professional tasters to tell the sweetness of each particular sugar. But it’s really costly and time consuming.
Although there are several other current methods to test how sweet the sugars are, there remains limitations from labs to society.
Thus, it is really urge for us to create a new convenient and effective way to test the sweetness and find more available sweeteners.
With the development of technology, artificial sweeteners are becoming better choices. The production technology of artificial sweeteners is becoming more mature. Meanwhile ,as a food additive, artificial sweeteners are also more widely used in the field of food production."

Business Overview
Synbiologica Ltd is a group of science students at the University of Lethbridge who plan to develop the Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR) for the highly specific detection of hormones. The company is currently comprised of four science students with varying academic backgrounds.
BEAR is a small device attached to a test subject or patient that will be able to monitor changing hormone levels in the subject bloodstream, first as an immediate point-of-care test and eventually as a real time hormone detection device. BEAR will be used primarily in research and in future diagnostics. Once the BEAR prototype has proved to be effective in a laboratory setting, Synbiologica Ltd will pursue a patent on the device. Synbiologica Ltd plans to use the licence-out business model to sell the BEAR device to biotechnology companies who are already well established and who have the resources to manufacture BEAR on a larger scale. These companies also have employees who specialize in marketing and sales of products. Synbiologica Ltd currently does not have employees skilled in these fields.
BEAR will be manufactured and sold as a two-part system. It will contain a reusable apparatus that will contain a hormone-sensitive modular component. We are unable to elaborate on the exact design of this system in order to protect our proprietary information.
Synbiologica Ltd is targeting hormone researchers as the primary market. Researchers who use animal test subjects for hormone analysis will need to purchase an appropriate number of BEAR apparatus’ to accommodate the number of test animals in the experiment. In a typical experiment, at least 5-10 test animals and an equal number of control animals will be used and enough BEAR devices will need to be purchased in order to test many subjects within a shorter period of time. BEAR is also a more efficient means of individual testing. If a test on an individual must be performed and a sample from the subject cannot be stored due to"

We were also able to improve the first primer designer page - we allowed users to create their own fusion sites (they can type in their own four-letter sequence and drag it into the visualizer) , and we created a function for the ""generate random fusion sites"" button. The primer designer is definitely coming together.
July 26: User studies at Wellesley
The lab team prepping for Wellesley User Studies
Today was one of the most stressful days so far - I conducted three user studies with three pairs of Wellesley biology students. My job was to watch the users, restart the system if needed, and take notes of everything the users were doing and saying. Before the user studies in the morning, we prepared the MoCloPlanner project by fixing last minute bugs and putting try-catches around all of our code. We had one study in the morning, and the system didn't crash at all - we discovered several errors that we could improve on. We had a special good-bye lunch for our high school intern, and then conducted two more studies in the afternoon that weren't quite as successful as the morning one. During the first user study of the afternoon, the system crashed 4 times - search was slow, and then they pressed the same button too many times and there was a memory overload. The last study of the day was not as disastrous, but they were confused a lot. Overall, it was a long day but a great learning experience.
July 27: User studies at MIT
During the MIT user study
This morning, we prepared the system to be tested with the MIT iGEM team. Again, we fixed last minute bugs and tested search several times to prevent crashes during the study. I helped the team load our Microsoft Surface (named Uppy) into the car so they could take it to MIT. Once our 3 lab mates left for MIT, Kara and I continued to work on the MoClo Planner - however, since they took the surface we usually use, we had to downgrade to a different computer that was much slower. It wasn't very efficient, but we were able to fix a few issues. At lunch we attended a computer science talk - three groups of students presented about their summer research. One was about a nano car, one was about Euclidean geometry and one was about a freshmen orientation web application. They were all very interesting, and I am impressed by how much everyone has accomplished in such a short time. After lunch, we continued to work out bugs for the rest of the day"

These problems are still challenging because these involved much more complex data storage and data extraction. If these problems are not proper-handled, RAM are vulnerable to run out of space. Therefore, we are still trying to overcome those difficulties and to update the App as soon as possible.

Modeling
As biological research studies are more and more based on both, laboratory research and mathematical computations, we decided to follow this encouraging development and, thus, build a mathematical model of our system. This abstract representation of a biological process has the purpose to understand the underlying functionality in the first place. Moreover, a variety of distinct conditions can easily be tested and arbitrarily often repeated. Once the feedback loop between model and experiment has led to a satisfying validation, the model can be applied to predict specific biological events of interest. New knowledge can be achieved very quickly.
The Model
To model the key features of our project, the selection system and the [growth model], we decided to use two models in correspondence. Thus, the development becomes more facile and transparent and the models can be used separately. In the following the workflow of our connected models is shown:
Figure 1: Workflow of the modeling process.
The interaction of the selection model (model I) and the competition model (model II) are shown. From left to right: The selection model produces a reproduction rate r - with every run. After several runs the different reproduction rates are transferred to the competition model, which translates these rates into growth curves.
First, the selection system was implemented ("

Survey
Codecheck is an app which allows everybody to gain insight in the chemical compounds of lots of different products, mostly cosmetics, and presents easy to understand explanations as well as warnings of questionable ingredients. Furthermore, the app got a news-feed, which frequently updates its users about lifestyle topics as beauty and super foods, but also about more serious things like environmental problems, recycling tips, veganism, air pollution and finally the palm oil problem. Based on this foundation, we got in contact with Franziska Grammes, head of scientific communication and Dr. Mandy Hecht, head of scientific management, and talked about our project, how we had planned things in the early stage and planned to integrate end-user’s opinions. Once again, we got told that GMOs might be piquant topic for the food and cosmetic market, and that we must ensure that no leftovers would be in the final product.
However, we also wanted to gain some insight into a special group of consumers: the conscious consumers. We knew the general tenor of the genetic engineering discussion was bad, but how about the people who dig deeper into things like the Codecheck users?
For the creation of the survey, we carried out"

Add 4.1283 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.5040 g/ml density gradient.
Add 4.9222 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.6 g/ml density gradient.
Add 5.7549 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.7 g/ml density gradient.
Layer the gradient into two centrifuge tubes, using half of the total volume created for each tube.  For example, add 2 mL of 1.3 density to one tube and the other 2 mL to another tube.
Add 4 mL of mutant phage to the top of the gradient in both tubes
Fill the remaining space in the tube with phage suspension buffer to the top.
Centrifuge at 26500 rpms (100,000 g) for 2.5 hours.
Extract using a needle and puncturing the side of the tube, placing the needle at the bottom of the tube.
Extract about 2 mL of phage at a time. Add about 1.5 to one eppendorf.
When the needle is removed place another eppendorf under the hole to catch any leaking phage and fill it with the remainder of the phage in the needle.
For Dialysis, the aliquot we chose to dialyzed was placed in dialysis tubing in 500x the concentration of phage in phage suspension buffer. Since our samples were 2 mL, this meant 1,000 mL
phage suspension buffer. The samples were left spinning in the buffer for 30 min before transferring it to a new bottle of 1,000 mL PSB. this was repeated 3 times. V) Results
The mutant phage had the strongest band that we have ever seen at the wild type location between 1.5019 and 1.5025 There was also a smaller band at 1.5003. These results are very exciting and infer that there should be a large amount of mutant phage.

3.5 Discussion On Maximum Carrying Capacity
For this discussion, consider the buoyant force FB to be a known, constant value.
 
In order for the biomass to float the net force on it must be greater than zero. By equation [6] we have the following constraint on buoyant force:           $$\begin{equation}\label{forceconstraint}         F_B \geq mg + 6\pi \eta R v(t), \ \forall t         \end{equation}$$
Equation 13.
The right side of the above inequality has strictly positive monotonicity with respect to v. v is a strictly increasing function so its max on a closed, bounded interval is at the upper bound. Let vmax = v(tf), where tf is the solution to z(tf) = h, h being the height required from the start point to the top of container, z being as given in equation [12] . The inequality in equation [13] is thus equivalent to the following:           $$\begin{equation}         F_B \geq m_{\mathrm{E. \ coli}}g + 6\pi \eta R_{\mathrm{E. \ coli}} v_{\max}         \end{equation}$$
Equation 14.
Taking mE. coli to be the approximate mass of an E. coli cell (without bound particle), RE. coli to be the approximate radius of an E. coli cell in a spherical approximation, this constraint on buoyant force influences goals in the wet lab by setting a minimum requirement for observed buoyant force"

jacarandasmile@163.com
Cyt2 is cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis BRC-LLP29. It shows specific toxicity to Culex and Aedes by bioassay.Cyt proteins have a single α-β domain which do not bind to receptors but can directly insert into the cell membrane and then form a pore causing cell death. Although Cry and Cyt proteins are two big families of δ-endotoxins, they are far related.Cyt1 and Cyt2 are two types of Cyt proteins found in Bti.. Generally, Cry proteins are believed to exert toxicity by interacting with the proteins on the brush border membrane and then insert into the membrane which takes multiple steps. At the beginning in mosquitoes' gut, the crystalline inclusions are cleaved at the disulfide bond to release the Cry pre-toxin. Then the soluble proteins are activated by being cleaved again by intestinal protease. When toxins reach to the brush border membrane microvilli, they bind to the proteins, or known as receptors on the membrane. The binding process takes two step. Firstly, the monomeric Cry toxin binds to cadherin, resulting in the formation of pre-pore oligomer

About Us
We started to prepare for 2018 iGEM a few weeks after the 2017 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short training lasting for almost one week at the beginning of winter holiday with the help of our instructors and the college. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the training. Two parts of our project, CRISPR system and indigo synthesis namely, were presented at this time. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.
Details of our winter training will also be introduced to you here.
Winter training was held a few days after Fall semester. In a training lasting for one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related to molecular biology and synthetic biology. It was our great honor to invite professor Yang Zhang to address several talks related to plant synthetic biology. Laboratory safety was also be emphasized. Considering the"

Logic
From a truth table to abstract logic circuits
In BioBLESS, a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input
Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and
then “Create”. The corresponding designed logic circuits with different
predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed
in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a
designed logic circuit, which in most cases is supposed to be a compli-
cated multi-input circuit. Besides the function above, gates list will
provide many Boolean gates, and users can drag them freely to our
canvas to design logic circuits.
Gene Network
See the detailed structure of a designed gene circuit
A simple click on “Gene network” button will lead you to
another tab where the detailed structure of your designed
gene circuit is shown. When a gene circuit consists of many
Boolean gates, it is crucial to understand the internal sub-
stances and mechanisms. In this tab, you can see how
substances react with each other clearly, such as inhibition
and activation in or between Boolean gates.

an AND gate and an OR gate, you can use our default parameters and
change initial concentration of reactants to get simulation results. If you
want to get different results, you just need to change system parameters
such as the rate of reactions, namely, to fill constants into the dialog
boxes on our canvas. What’s more, simulation time slot is necessary as well to give  concentration-time figures of the inputs and outputs of a given gene circuit.  You are free to see the concentration-time evolution of every substance in  designed gene circuits individually.
ANALYSIS
Get robustness and sensitivity analysis
While offering various functions, BioBLESS also serves as an
analysis tool for designed gene circuits. Having designed a gene
circuit, you can click the “Analysis” button to reset parameters of
initial concentrations and reaction rates. Meanwhile, BioBLESS
will set simulation"

Journal
December：We began to recruit team members to establish the 2017’s team,  and team members consulted literature and widely read wikis in previous years to have a general understanding about iGEM.
January：We held quite a few times of brainstorms to discuss the potential project.
March：After a couple of months of learning and training, 14 team members were gathered to establish the TMMU-China team. Team registration was completed. And we set our project .
April：We attended iGEM Southwest Union and had an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project.
June：The B. subtilis and L. lactis strain was constructed and the utility of it was tested.
July：We completed the optimizations of the system, and constructed the plasmid containing the transcription factor AimR and PlcR, signal peptide gene AimP and PapR. Some of the members set out to design and finish the mathematic modeling.
August：We attended the 2017 CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) held in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, receiving advice from Igem headquarter King L. CHOW and former iGEMer Zhang Haoqian.  And together with SCU-WestChina , we cooperated in helding the exhibition in Chengdu Public Library, publicizing “GMO & Human Health”.
September：We completed the construction of all the 4 Parts.
October-November：We at last perfected our preparation for presentation, poster and wiki.
Protocols
1. Bacteria and culture media
Bacteria strains used in this study are NZ9000 (L. lactis) and DH5α (E. coli). DH5α was used as the cloning host. E. coli were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (agar or broth) at 37 °C. L. lactis was cultured in M17GS (M17 broth supplemented with 0.5 % (wt/vol) glucose, 0.55 % (wt/vol) sucrose) medium at 30 °C (agar or broth). Kanamycin was used at the concentration of 50 μg/mL for E. coli. Erythrom"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Add 4.1283 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.5040 g/ml density gradient.
Add 4.9222 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.6 g/ml density gradient.
Add 5.7549 g of CsCl to 6 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.7 g/ml density gradient.
Layer the gradient into two centrifuge tubes, using half of the total volume created for each tube.  For example, add 2 mL of 1.3 density to one tube and the other 2 mL to another tube.
Add 4 mL of mutant phage to the top of the gradient in both tubes
Fill the remaining space in the tube with phage suspension buffer to the top.
Centrifuge at 26500 rpms (100,000 g) for 2.5 hours.
Extract using a needle and puncturing the side of the tube, placing the needle at the bottom of the tube.
Extract about 2 mL of phage at a time. Add about 1.5 to one eppendorf.
When the needle is removed place another eppendorf under the hole to catch any leaking phage and fill it with the remainder of the phage in the needle.
V) Results
The phage banded at 1.5003, which is where wild type may band. There was no lower band, but we extracted and purified anyways and then let the large phage group decide what to do.

Team HFUT-China
We are invited to test the front end of the project of the team HFUT-China for finding bugs and fix them.                     We found six bugs and design flaws.
We found that the wrong email domain name is passed while registering, and we were unable to log out                         after login. Besides, the error message is not obvious.
The page is unable to save the login cookies. When we logged in and open a new window, however, still                         showed no login.
Search algorithms need to be optimized. For instance, when we search the team USTC, XMU is on the top                         list, and there was even no USTC-Software.
The Brand button on the search page didn’t work.
There is no search engine in the Gene Relationship page.
In the Gene info interface, Gene Relationship button should be active (green), but it's actually red.
Team USTC
USTC has been one of our traditional collaborators.
Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, USTC, as                     potential users of our bio-hub, offered us opinions and needs in application design and homepage design.                     For example, they suggested adding an online forum named ""iGEMers' Notebook"" in which iGEMers can exchange                     important information and ideas concerning this competition .They also helped us with biological problems                     we came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis.
In return, we share them with some useful tricks. And we also help them in website making and modeling, which                     speed their work greatly. Besides, we held the annual Science and Technology Week and Science and Technology                     Exhibition, which spread the synthetic knowledge to the public.

SJTU is one iGEM team which concentrated on developing useful software for bio-brick researchers. Having                     met at Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan, we worked together for our target. During the collaboration,                     we help them removed some inaccurate parts inn bio-brick database. In return, they test our software                     Biohub 2.0 and offered some useful suggestions on safety and design.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.
