BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," gene can be substituted on the basis of production demand in the future.
INSIDE MECHANISM
Under normal circumstance, the plasmid numbers are above the threshold, the inhibitor concentration is high enough to completely repress the activity of in-promoter. Considering the effect of plasmids segregational instability, the concentration of plasmids in some cells will decline with time going on. With no intervention, these cells will gradually become slackers as well as the predominant strain among the population. In our project, when the plasmid numbers are below the threshold, the decrease of inhibitor proteins will lead to the increase of in-promoter activity. At this time, the killer gene will express and kill the cell. We define that, when the killer expressed is just able to kill the cell, the plasmid numbers is the threshold we've talked about. Based on this, we concluded that when the plasmid numbers are above the threshold, the bacteria can survive and have high working efficiency. This range is called survival range. To prevent the slackers consume a lot of nutrition, we kill it when the range removes to the dead one.
In this way, we can optimize the general population structure through plasmid-numbers-maintenance.
Fig.2 With the decrease of plasmid numbers, the concentration of repressor will reduce to a threshold. According, in-promoter activity will rise up and star the transcription of killer gene.
Threshold device
The most critical factor in our system is the inhibitor concentration since it controls the switch of our killer system. Thus we need to prove that the in-promoter will have different responses corresponding to different concentrations of inhibitor.
We combined the wet experiment results with the mathematical model to measure the final result. [know more about our model]
First Step
Since it's hard to control the plasmid numbers, we employed the arabinose induced PBAD promoter. The plasmid numbers is stable in short time. By adding different concentration of arabinose, we can simulate the production of inhibitors with different concentration. In this way, we can see the downstream in-promoter stay in the corresponding statues. RFP is used to replace the killer gene for simplifying our wet experiment. To expand the application of our system, we choose two combinations of inhibitor and in-promoter.
Goal
(1) Build two parallel circuits employing different inhibitor proteins
(2) Find the relationship between the inhibitor and in-promoter
(3) Find out the initial thresholds by measuring RFP intensity
(4) Provide experimental data for modeling part

iGEM is an international synthetic biology competition wherein student teams work, during the summer months, to build a microbe that carries out some sort of ‘programmed’ function – something that microbe would not normally be able to do. iGEM was founded in 2003 at MIT, and last year 340 teams from around the world entered the competition, creating microbes that can sense atmospheric carbon monoxide, clean up wine stains, convert sugar into biofuels or medicines, and more. These teams hailed from Pakistan, Kenya, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and dozens of other countries. This year, the competition is expanding to Iowa – we will be the first team to ever compete in this competition from the state. Teams and projects are entirely student-initiated and driven, and the tasks that students undertake gives undergraduates the chance to explore synthetic biology through independent research. The competition provides students with an opportunity to develop academic and organizational skills and promotes the values of integrity, good sportsmanship, respect, honesty, celebration, cooperation, effort, and excellence.
About Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a maturing scientific discipline that combines science and engineering to design and build novel biological functions and systems. This includes the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, as well as the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. It is a multidisciplinary field requiring expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, and mathematics.

Welcome to IGEM Göttingen
iGEM is a international competition hosted by the MIT in Boston, USA, for undergraduate students of disciplines related to molecular biology. iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. One the one hand, it targets to combine aspects of education and social collaboration among undergraduate students, on the other hand, it provides a library for standardized and interchangeable parts which can be used in living systems, particularly in model organisms like E. coli. Student groups from all over the world will receive a requested kit of biological parts, also called ""biobricks"", and work over the summer on an individual research project. Every year, the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" is upgraded with further biobricks by the participating iGEM teams. These biobricks will be accessible to the iGEM community in the following years in order to use these parts for their own projects.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each other. This year, it is the first participation of University of Goettingen, Germany. The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for students to gain and improve a multitude of skills that are necessary during a carrier as a molecular biologist. Such skills would be planning and organizing a project, including fund raising and team recruitment, coordination of lab work, designing experiments and working together as a team. Next to intensive lab work during the summer, also literature search and well-structured documentation of the experiments is crucial.
Homing Coli
Escherichia coli is a commonly used bacterial model organism. It has lots of beneficial traits like a short generation time and it can be easily manipulated. Most E. coli strains that are used in laboratories do not exhibit high motility. The crucial element for motility are the flagella which are rotated by a molecular motor within the cell wall. Consequently, these are reduced in cultivated E. coli strains.
Our goal is to create an E."

Our work in 2017 made several fundamental changes to the pheromone pathway, facilitating the                         further transformation of biosensors in their team in 2018. So we shared the stain of modified CEN.pk2-1C,                         which used it to:
1. Exclude the possibility that the pheromone pathway is affected by the native ligand                         pheromone in                         yeast: (Knock out the Ste2 receptor);
2. Exclude upstream G-protein coupled receptor signaling attenuation (desensitization) that may                         result from sustained stimulation. (Knock out Sst2, the GTPase-activating protein for Gpa1p, as                         a                         receptor-desensitizing factors.)
3. Exclude side effects on cell life cycle, cell morphology, etc. due to enhanced MAPK pathway                         signaling in the Pheromone pathway. (Knock out Far1, the cyclin-dependent protein                         serine/threonine                         kinase inhibitor.)
We also shared our original strain CEN.PK2-1C which no knockout of Ste2, Sst2, Far1 was                         performed. And the results of ligand binding response before and after gene knockout of                         pheromone                         pathway were compared to verify the significance of the modification for knocking out side                         effects.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some"

WET LAB 2:
5/25 -  Research led to the possibility of using microfluidics
Week 3
DRY LAB 3:
- Team members presented their research on assigned soil nutrients to the group.
- Looked at an app that tests soil.
- Discussed the legalities of sampling: taking samples in public is going to need more formalities. Personal spaces and community gardens will be a more realistic place to begin sampling.
- Plotted iGEM deadlines onto a calendar.
- Ordered 6 soil augers, spray bottles, tape measures, location markers, etc. for collecting samples.
- After reviewing the SDS sheets for the LaMotte kit reagents we discussed chemical hygiene and trained new team members on our lab protocol.
After realizing just how toxic the kit is, the team continued to brainstorm about non-toxic sensors. Ideally we will find biological substitutes for LaMotte soil tests - if that is not an option we can greatly decrease the amount of the substance needed for testing, by using a microchannel chip and spectrophotometer, possibly interfaced into a device for a smart phone.
Sebastian explained that exposure time for the biosensors we make would not be an instant result, like the LaMotte kit, but need at minimum a few hours to process. We also discussed how (some of) the biosensors function to change colors- once they bind the to soil sample the molecules change shape, therefore changing the way the light refracts which makes the color visible.
NEXT MEETING:
We will test out the LaMotte soil kit for the first time as a group.
Need to make a map of community gardens and draft a letter to introduce our project and ask for access. How do we encourage citizen participation? Offer participants a survey of data pertaining to their soil.

We discussed possible ways to streamline and expedite the slow drip extraction, while keeping in mind we must use individual containers and utensils for each sample to AVOID CROSS-CONTAMINATION. Miniature French presses? Centerfuge?

After 22 hours growing up, bacteria after centrifuge appear red. but not obvious like blue and green. However, the GFP seemed not influence by light stimulation, which means it was also green in the darkness.

SCUT-FSE-CHINA,2017,Team:SCUT-FSE-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," and consulted Shi Qingshan, a researcher studying on breeding and fermentation technology of industrial microbial from Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, about the problems and current solutions of bacterial contamination and phage infection in the factories. According to Shi, in practical production processes, raw material will be sterilized first while air filter and heater are also equipped to reduce pollution. Sometimes the factories will be set up at higher places in order to keep themselves more clean.
During the communication, Shi suggested that we should find a balance between the resistance function and the yield of products when employing our robust E.coli. As for this concern, we believe that any new technology need time to become mature. Our project provides a way to reduce workload for those working on the microorganisms. Perhaps it is not yet productive enough to compete with the well developed strains, we will spare no effort to develop it through practical application step by step.
Guangdong Jiujiang Distillery Co.,Ltd.
Guangdong Jiujiang Distillery is famous as the China's largest enterprise in soy sauce-type liquor production scale. Some of our team members were given a tour of their winery and facilities. We were introduced the making process of rice wine, which made us have a better understanding of the control points in industrial production. We were pleased to talk with the vice technical director Mr. Songgui He and several other managers about how our project could be applied in practical scale. They told us that they actually simultaneously made use of few microorganisms for fermentation in open culture. Therefore, rather than controlling the completely sterilized environment, they are now focusing more on how to control the population of different microorganisms in different periods during the fermentation process. Their feedback got us thinking about other promotion of our projects.
Nameide Biotechnology
Shandong Nameide Bio Technology Co., Ltd. is modern high-tech biological enterprises who is committed to bio cellulose research and development, production and promotion. We raised some questions that sent by TUST_China to workers in Nameide Biotechnology. We then got feedbacks that this company employed square shallow plate as the bioreactor but they still followed strict sterility regulations in the production. It is indicated that they invested a lot of capital in achieving 100-thousand-grade cleaning for avoiding bacterial contamination.
Biosafety
Considering biosafety issue in cell factory, we tried to do something. Since the background of our project were remarkably similar to NPU-China in fermentation. Our team organized current laws and regulations related to factory emissions, especially for gene safety-related emissions in several different countries or regions, and concluded loopholes in current laws and regulations."

How to make use of our bacteria?
    To solve this problem, we constructed a small device like this:
a normal injector with a filtering membrane front. We will culture our bacteria on the filtering         membrane anteriorly. When
used, you just need to take in some dirty water and eject them,         then you will get clean water.
Moreover, we try to design a device to clean the water discharge from factories.
As is shown in the picture, if we fix the channel 1 in the end of factories’ tube,         after a while, open the channel 3, clean water
will pour out.
How to avoid engineered bacteria hazard and gene transfer?
     Our plasmid consists more than 40 artificial fragments. To avoid hazard caused by engineered bacteria,         we construct a suicide system. Bacteria with the ""suicide system"" will perform like this:
In our lab, we will use IPTG to culture bacteria, and in the nature, bacteria will die without IPTG or Toxin.We proved that it works in our wet lab experiments.We also design some systems to stop horizontal gene transfer. Detail can be seen in our safety section.
How can we popularize iGEM and make people from deferent fields know synthetic biology?
     We establish iGEM club and have finished the new recruit. In the new recruit we attract many students from deferent departments who are interested in synthetic biology. In addition, we are planning to establish an information platform that students from all departments of Nanjing University can share the information related to iGEM. These activities are all supported by teachers of our university.         Here are some pictures in the new recruit.
In addition, we also apply for a reward about environment that our university hold.

What is the problem?
Plasmid segragational instability has been the limit step for large-scale protein production and bioremediation. Antibiotics for plasmid retention is not practical in this situation.
High copy number (HCN) plasmids are lost from population at a high rate due to the large metabolic burden and lack of nature factors for plasmid maintenance.
Our P-SLACKiller
IDEA
Equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller), and we need to select a signal which can indicate the intracellular plasmid numbers. Here we give a definition, when the bacteria containing few plasmids consume lots of nutrition but don’t work efficiently, we called them slackers. There is a basic rule: when the plasmid numbers are above a threshold, we regard the bacterium as normally-working and the P-SLACKiller won't start; however, when the plasmid numbers are below the threshold, we judge it as a slacker and the P-SLACKiller will kill these slackers, so that we can achieve the goal of increasing the plasmid maintenance. In the end, in order to kill the slackers and thus control the plasmid numbers, we selected the inhibitor protein as the signal molecular and the in-promoter repressed by inhibitor as a switch to start the killer gene.
PART DESIGN
The basic circuit is shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1 The basic circuit of P-SLACKiller.
We use the constitutive promoter to express the inhibitor protein, thus the intracellular inhibitor concentration is positively correlated with the plasmid numbers. So the inhibitor can be used as a signal indicating the plasmid numbers. The inhibitor can repress the in-promoter and control the expression of downstream killer gene. When the inhibitor concentration reduces to a threshold, the downstream killer gene will express. To avoid the unexpected leak out of killer gene caused by the constitutive promoter, we designed the gene circuit with the constitutive promoter and the in-promoter transcribing along different directions like Fig.1.
The genetic locus of functional gene can be substituted on the basis of production demand in the future.

DRY LAB JOURNAL
At the start of our project, we undertook a week of boot camp – yes, it was as intense as it sounds! With all team members coming from a range of backgrounds with different abilities, we thought that this would be a good idea to allow everyone to be on the same page with the same basic level of understanding in each component of the project. As well as this, it was a great icebreaker that helped our team of students, advisors and supervisors to get to know each other better! Following on from this, we officially began our work over the summer.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Having finally got the lab prepared, it was time to start creating some BioBricks. First up, the most basic one: ORF314, (a piece of) tail fibre protein of lambda phage. After cloning the gene into iGEM standard backbones, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent cells…
Lab 307
A prelimenary growth curve of E. coli 10β & E. coli DH5α. The culture was measured at 2 different wavelengths (395 nm & 600 nm). This was mainly to characterise the growth curve for any downstream experiments involving the exposure of bacteriophages to E. coli & characterising the negative control for the Interlab Study .
The experiment took 3 hours to reach exponential growth. The experimental procedure was adapted in order to minimise the time taken for cells to reach the exponential phase of growth.
Tuesday 14thJuly
Pinheiro Lab
One day in and time for the first disappointment! None of yesterday’s transformations worked, and an agarose gel didn’t show a hint of our DNA. So back to the start – another attempt at restriction-ligation of our gene into the standard shipping and assembly backbones, and another transformation. And then a nervous wait overnight to see if the second attempt would be successful!

Lab work was halted for 1 week.

Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Math Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," that the bacteria would re-enter stationary phase after 2.5 hours; for time-points after 3 hours, the number of number of sarA genes producing fluorescence could be assumed as constant. For this reason, we excluded time-points prior to 3 hours. We then converted from fluorescence units to number of fluorescent molecules using the quantization measurements provided by Wu & Pollard
and, using our assumption of a fixed number of active sarA genes, considered the relative change in number of molecules to be representative of the per-promoter rate.
We were interested, however, in the changes of concentration rather than the changes in the raw number of molecules. As the name suggests, Staphylococcus aureus are spherical in shape. Assuming that all S. aureus are spheres, the volume of the cell can be determined. The diameter of a USA300 S. aureus cell was previously measured as 1.1 μ•m
resulting in the overall cell volume to be calculated as 5.575•10-15 L. The number of molecules were thus converted to units of molar concentration in the cell, specifically nanomoles per litre (nM). The exponential fit used to find the rate constant is shown beside the figure from Cheung et al. above.
This resulted in a exponential model a•ebt with a b rate constant of 0.0011 nM/min.
Initial Model Results
Using these estimated parameters, we simulated our differential model of the CRISPR system. It was immediately clear that these parameters, scraped from assorted publications, did not provide an accurate system model once combined. Below are two simulations of the system dynamics using the parameters found in the literature. On the left the system is shown with CRISPR repression active and on the right is a simulation where:
or rather, the system simulated without any repression of YFP Transcription by CRISPR. Both plots use 6 as the expected final fold reduction.
The difference between the two plots is negligible. This unrealistic behavior emerges directly from the parameter values. The mRNA degradation dynamics prevent sgRNA from reaching any significant concentration, so there is never enough dCas9-sgRNA complex to influence YFP expression. However, in both plots the YFP mRNA levels plummet from the high initial concentration because the degradation rate is so much higher than the production rate.
These plots do not fit with the observations of CRISPR interference systems reported in the literature
. To ensure that our parameters were at fault, rather than the fact that we were examining CRISPR in S. aureus instead of E. coli, we consulted"

Members & Attributions
After designing red and green light controlled gene expression systems, we hope to find another one that is regulated by blue light in order to broaden the range of the application of our systems, meanwhile to avoid the overlapping effect among lights with different wavelengths.
Fortunately, we find out that there is a perfect candidate in projects of 2011 Uppsala Team. With further paper-searching work based on its reference page, we find an interesting published paper named ""From Dusk Till Dawn: One-Plasmid Systems for Light-Regulated Gene Expression"", which also provides us with lots of useful information. Therefore, we decide to select this one as our third light-controlled system.
Blue Light Sensing System
There are three parts in this blue light regulated gene expression system in total. First, YF1 protein. The histidine kinase YF1 protein is a fussion protein that employs a light-oxygen-voltage blue-light photosensor domain. Second, FixJ protein. This is a regulator and its status can be controlled by YF1. Third, FixK2 promoter. This promoter is regulated by FixJ.
Suppose that there is no light, or say, in the absence of blue light, YF1 will phosphorylate its cognate response regulator FixJ, which then drives robust gene expression from the FixK2 promoter. However, if there is blue light offered to this system, YF1 will be dephosphorylated and it will result in the dephosphorylation of FixJ, thus preventing the FixK2 promoter."

Since the ligation efficiency was 0.68%, we did an experiment comparing the survival rate of CHO-k1 cells after being transfected with linear DNA and circular DNA. After antibiotic screening, we luckily found that the former one were almost dead, while the latter one were good. Thus we could directly transfect the ligation products into cell without transformation, preventing the mutation library from decreasing.

Fig.16 The R-GECO and GFP fluorescence of wild type cells and cells transfecd with loxp site, pNFAT+GFP gene and R-GECO gene
The data was collected in the process of sorting by FACS, total cells count is 10000. Cells transfected with R-GECO gene will continually express R-GECO, because CAG promoter is a constitutive promoter. Thus, most cells have red fluorescence (Fig16. b) compare with wild type control (Fig16. a). Cells transfected with pNFAT+GFP should not express GFP because promoter NFAT need to be activated by calcium signal indirectly. However, most cells still can express GFP (Fig.16 d) compare with wild type control (Fig.16 c), which mean there is some leaky expression of promoter NFAT or background calcium activity.
2. Select the single cell colony only with one copy number of loxp by qPCR
To evaluate the efficiency of each mutated channels, single cell colony with only one copy number is required when testing, so we designed the following experiments to achieve it.
2.1 Primer design and primer efficiency test
The real-time PCR primers (Forward: TTGTCAAGACCGACCTGTCC, Reverse: TTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCA) were designed by Primer-BLAST, a tool for finding specific primers, followed by BLAST specificity check. Firstly, we selected an appropriate annealing temperature to avoid unnecessary amplification as well as improving primer efficiency by normal PCR test in wild type CHO-K1 genomes, the result indicates that 62℃ may be the most appropriate annealing temperature. In addition, we also confirmed that the amplification product was accurate at 62℃ when the target was cells genome that transfected with ne"

     Detection of cell surface cancer markers is a key diagnostic step during cancer therapy as it allows the efficiency of a therapy to be determined. Current antibody-based flow cytometric detection methods are the gold standard. For our 2010 iGEM project, we hope to develop SensorBricks as a reliable and modular system for antigen recognition, signal amplification and quantification.
We want to push the boundaries of detection in order to allow earlier diagnosis and thus improve therapeutic prognosis in cancer therapy. Initial steps of SensorBricks will focus on the detection of CD33 and other leukemic markers to increase diagnostic stringency. read more

Behind iGEM
     iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is an undergraduate competition on synthetic biology held at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA. More info
The central idea of iGEM is the application of synthetic biology, which is the combination of biological science with engineering, by introducing modifications and assembly of biological parts. The standardized biological parts (BIOBRICKS) are used to build safe and reliable biological devices to be used in several applications, either in living cells or for environmental and industrial applications. iGEM is not only restricted to using the BIOBRICKS, but it involves systematically engineering biological processes, developing the new biological parts and characterising the existing ones.
iGEM is a great opportunity for students to understand research methodology and team work. Every step in the project, starting from brainstorming, project design, experiments, troubleshooting, report writing and presentation is done by the students with the timely guidance and support from experienced supervisors.

Spring Workshop
The iGEM spring workshop was organized by iGEM headquarters on May 29-30. These workshops were organized in many different continents including Europe, North America and Asia. This year, the Canadian workshop was organized at the University of Calgary. The main purpose of the iGEM workshop was to provide new iGEM students with background about synthetic biology and iGEM in general. There were workshops that covered general concepts ranging from synthetic biology to biobricks, wiki design, using the registry of standard parts, submitting parts and the iGEM Jamboree.
Speakers included:
Tom Knight
One of the founders of synthetic biology, Tom Knight was responsible for designing the standard BioBrick system and co-pioneering the standard digestion and ligation cloning method (also known as BioBrick cloning method) that is used widely in synthetic biology and iGEM. Tom Knight presented a little bit of history of iGEM and the pioneering of standard biological parts that came about from a group of engineers, including himself and Drew Endy. Tom Knight also gave an overview of the BioBrick cloning method, including some tips and tricks that he had encountered over the years that he has been involved in the field of synthetic biology.
Megan Lizarazo
Megan Lizarazo is the iGEM Research Technician. She handles most of the shipping and receiving of parts, as well as communicating with and updating all the teams about iGEM related events. During the workshop Megan provided valuable information about how to send DNA parts to the registry.
Barry Canton
Barry Canton works in the Drew Endy Lab. He is a previous iGEM alumni. Barry Canton talked about Wiki creation, uploading parts information, and also taught us about different tips and tricks regarding the wiki.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernat"

NYU,2010,Team:NYU#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," THE pADH1 PROMOTER AND AGA2! This simple mistake prevented the MIT team last year from having a successful system so we need to watch out for this. We may want to ligate an RBS onto each of the promoters we want to use and use each of those instead so we definitely do not make this mistake.
Retransformation of the secretion tag biobricking ligation was also successful. I inoculated 6 colonies from the two plates and performed colony PCR.
Transformation of the split-GFP biobricks (N-terminal and C-terminal halves of GFP) from the iGEM initial distribution was successful – inoculated 3 colonies of each biobrick but had already started thermal cycler, so colony PCR will be done later.
Ordered second set of Nub primers as well as biobrick-compatible primers for manipulating the backbone of pCTCON.
7/26/10
Russell:
Got sequencing results from Genewiz for both of the supposed N-ub fusions we received from iGEM – neither sequence contained Nub, apparently both plasmids are void.
Instead of excising from a plasmid, we get to build the part via overlapping PCR (which, luckily, I’ve been wanting to try for awhile). So I broke the ~140bp Nub gene down into 3 overlapping sequences and ordered the appropriate oligos for the PCR.

I am trying to develop a couple of new (at least for me) protocols to use with biobricks.
The first is overlap PCR of the N-ubiquitin biobrick. This biobrick is only 140 bases long, so it is not viable to synthesize it via GeneArt (even though we still have all our basebucks) because of the much larger minimum order"

We run a SDS-PAGE gel to confirm the expression of the modified protein. The result is positive.
In order to verify the modified protein’s characteristic, Juntao Mai does the western-blot. The result is partly positive. Under equal quantity induction of arabinose (0.3%), samples under 450nm wavelength light shows a 30% GFP decay compared with samples incubated in the dark.
We detected the lov-HTH, whose HTH part is modified, by reversed transcription PCR. We‘ve done a series of RT PCR with samples induced by 0.3% arabinose during their incubation and samples incubated without arabinose at the first place. In order to get rid of the effect of light, we incubated all the cells in the dark. We can easily find lov-HTH (modified) mRNA in samples induced by arabinose.
We investigated the time course of the transcription of the arabinose-induced GFP using quantitative real-time PCR. We combined different conditions together and did a series of QRT PCR. We can get the detail in this table.
We decide to use EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay) to verify if the modified protein can be efficient binding the specific part in ptetO.
Considering the time, cost and the possibility, we give up EMSA.
With propose of testing the protein’s repression ability, we do a fluorescence intensity test. Under an arabinose induction gradient between 0 to 0.3%, we investigate the time course of the two groups of cells’ GFP fluorescence intensity and the absorbance of OD600 at the same time. One group of them is incubated in the 470nm wavelength light and the other one was incubated in the dark. The two curves of RFU per OD600 present 30% differences which is positive.

Mapping Responsible Innovation:
A First Principles Approach
Overall Project Summary
This project explores the research question, How can we act responsibly with respect to genetic engineering? Specifically, we developed an iterative concept mapping tool that prompts people to articulate the values that guide their own definitions of responsible innovation, and to consider their values in relation to other people’s. This first version focuses on values associated with genetically engineered plants, but over time, our tool will also become relevant to other emerging technologies. We developed the tool with help from the developers of The Glowing Plant , the world’s first and only crowd-funded genetically engineered organism.
Project Details
Our tool is inspired by Science and Technology Studies scholarship that demonstrates the inadequacy of defining “risk” in narrow, purely technical terms (Beck, 1992; Luhmann, 1990).  Social and cultural values guide the development and diffusion of new technologies (Pinch and Bijker, 1987; Rogers, 2003). Although the term “responsibility” is pervasive in discussions about emerging technologies, defining what it means to act responsibly is actually quite difficult, as different people have different views about what courses of action would be more or less responsible. “Responsibility” can indicate causation, suggesting that a person has made something happen, but it can also suggest legal obligation or liability, as well as moral obligation or ethical duty (Giddens, 1999, p. 8). In light of this complexity, we define Responsible Research and Innovation as “a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and social desirability” of products and the social processes that surround them (von Schomberg, 2011, p. 9).
By modeling the principles that different people associate with responsible innovation, we hope to facilitate this type of responsiveness. Much like deliberative mapping (Burgess, Stirling, Clark, Davies,"

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#outreach#interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s a really big threat. We have the precedent of the Gros Michel banana, which was virtually wiped out during the past century as a commercial crop in monoculture systems for export, although it still lives on today in mixed systems, for example, in cocoa plantations. Here, Race 1 doesn’t get the chance it gets in monoculture systems. Perhaps something like this can be a solution to reduce the problem with TR4 to something manageable.
It has also shown up recently in Jordan and Mozambique, but there are contradictory reports on the effects. Nonetheless, this is a dangerous situation: Mozambique is nearby other countries with millions of small owners of banana plantations, not only for self-consumption but also to sell in local markets. It’s a really important source for their livelihoods. We are not talking here only about big banana companies suffering losses, but also food security in a continent like Africa.
The agenda in Asia is containment, using quarantine measures and so on, while in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America… policies focus on how to delay the arrival of Panama disease as much as possible, because eventually TR4 will arrive.  Meanwhile they will have to look into a solution for the problem, like finding a resistant cultivar, which would take between 10 to 15 years, or to find a means of cultivation which would reduce the threat, for example.""
So far you have mentioned quarantine measures, multicultivation systems…but are there solutions in development that you consider promising?
""Several companies are doing research on methods to control the fungi in the soil. I know that some other fungi have been controlled through biological methods. Others have used chemical products; I’m not a specialist in the matter but that sounds like it could create problems in the long run. Such things have been done to control nematodes, and these products destroy a lot of soil life and biodiversity. It can even worsen the problem by killing the competitors of the nematodes. The soil is still very much a black box, we have to be very cautious about it.""
How long do you think it would take for TR4 to spread to Latin America?
""It’s difficult to say. It depends on our preventive measure: if someone goes from the Philippines to Latin America with dirty boots, it’s already there.  There are many factors in play, like container shipping. Each year there are 100 million container movements in the world, a great deal of them in the fruit and vegetable business, and there are really no protocols to disinfect them, so they can be vectors of transmission.

As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned functions of search engines. Researchers can easily find reports written by others after inputting some key words. They could also search information in some databases and websites directly though this engine.
For most synthetic biology workers, it is difficult for them to conduct effective communication on experimental content, so we established a synthetic biology community based on search engine and report editor. In this community, bio workers can use this to record their experimental process and comment on other scholar's reports, thereby reducing the blindness of the research.
In the future
As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve our existed functions and  provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in the future.
Improvements
It is super easy to accomplish  your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.
We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.
It is great significant  to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.
The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing  technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.
The society  is still growing. That is why chatting and communication  could be considered as an important facility in our society.
New features
Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or  plugin.
In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like Quora where biologists  can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners who share interest in a certain area.
 
If there is a matching hardware port, it could complete the experiment automatically according to the given steps and protocols. We could match the steps or protocols to the manipulator's operating instructions accurately. For this, we hope BioHub can help achieve experiment automation."

Amsterdam,2011,Team:Amsterdam#Biobricks#Basic Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," quadruple knock-out strain exhibits a cold-sensitive phenotype. Xia, Ke and Inouye not only made and characterised these knock-out strains, but went on to show the cold-sensitive phenotype can be repressed by overexpressing any of the remaining members of the Csp family, with the exception of CspD. [16] (Overexpressing CspD did, however, increase the cold resistance of the wild-type strain.) The apparent redundancy in the functioning of E. coli 's cold shock proteins suggests that they carry out a task which is key to cell survival.
Uh et al. identified a blind spot in the scientific community's understanding of cold shock proteins, stating the insights reported above are based mainly on studies of mesophilic bacteria. To fill this gap, they investigated a bacterium isolated from Arctic sea sediment (Polaribacter irgensii) and, following a homology-based selection procedure, cloned two of its genes (CspA and CspC) into E. coli. [17] They demonstrated expression of either of these genes can rescue the cold-sensitive phenotype Xia, Ke and Inouye observed in their quadruple knock-out. In addition to this, they show P. irgensii 's cold shock proteins drastically increase E. coli 's ability to survive freeze/thaw cycles. (Figure 3)

1. Overview
According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death globally. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule. One of its many complex functions is to transduce nitric-oxide (NO) and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signaling and remit myocardial dysfunctions by relaxing blood vessels. This summer, we tried to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line. We hope that our work could provide basis for a future gene therapy using synthetic biology.
NO：nitric oxide,      sGC：soluble guanylate cyclase,    PKG：protein kinase G
PDE5A：Phosphodiesterase-5A,  HIF： hypoxia inducible factor-1,   HRE：  hypoxia responsive element
Increased understanding of the molecular events operating in the NO-sGC-cGMP axis has stimulated therapeutic targeting of the pathway in human diseases. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is an enzyme that synthesizes cGMP from GTP and is found as a heterodimer of α and β subunits. BBa_K1720000 and BBa_K1720001 contain the full coding sequences of the α and β subunits of human sGC, respectively. Co-expression of the two parts increases sGC activity and cGMP synthesis in the cell. However, elevated cellular level of cGMP may lead to feed-back expression of PDE5A, a phosphodiesterase that degrades cGMP. Creation of novel circuit that consists of U6 promoter followed by PDE5A shRNA may enhance the function of our parts. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also designed a hypoxia-inducible operon, HRE, as a switch to up-regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation.

p68 was digested with AsiSI for 2 hours and afterwards nicked with Nb.BstI for 1 hour. The vector and each of the promoters were then mixed in a USER reaction. Prior to transformation of A. nidulans the plasmids were cut with NotI to obtain a linearized DNA fragment to make HR possible and thereby increase transformation efficiency. The nkuAΔ transformants containing PalcA::lacZ and the nkuAΔ transformants containing DMKP-P6::lacZ will be referred to as nkuAΔ-IS1::PalcA::lacZ::TtrpC::argB and nkuAΔ-IS1::DMKP-P6::lacZ::TtrpC::argB, respectively.
Qualitative analysis
First, the promoters were evaluated qualitatively by inoculating nkuAΔ-IS1::PalcA::lacZ::TtrpC::argB and nkuAΔ-IS1::DMKP-P6::lacZ::TtrpC::argB onto minimal media plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-D-galactoside (X-gal). A functional promoter allows the expression of the lacZ gene and thereby production of β-galactosidase, which  results in blue colonies on X-gal plates.  The blue color is produced because β-galactosidase cleaves X-gal into 5- bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl (blue) and D-galactose. Thus, blue colonies means that the transcription of the lacZ gene has occurred. It should be noted that the X-gal plates used for the PalcA transformants contained glycerol as carbon source and ethanol and threonine to induce the PalcA promoter.
The plates contain two positive controls that express lacZ from the constitutive promoters PgpdA with two different lengths, PgpdA 0.5kb and PgpdA 1.0kb (nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA 0.5kb::lacZ::TtrpC::argB and nkuAΔ-IS1::PgpdA 1.0kb::lacZ::TtrpC::argB) that are used"
Guelph,2008,Team:Guelph#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," complementary sticky ends have the benefit of decreasing the rate of background ligations; the complementary sticky ends act as 'heat seeking missiles', seeking out their complementary mates and ignoring non-complementary overhangs or blunt end. The PstI site will be conserved for future use.
Next comes Crt-I. This is done in the same way as above, as it is also flanked with XbaI and PstI with an internal SpeI site. Once again, the biobricked open reading frame is cut with XbaI and PstI, while the plasmid is cut with SpeI and PstI. Ligate.
(note: Crt-I has two PstI sites which really should be removed but don't have to if we don't have time - we have a technique we'd like to try to do this using some sort of nested PCR - there are a couple primers in the list which could be used to use to do this - in the end we just got the Biobricked gene from iGEM Edinburgh so all good)
At this point we will attempt to add other genes to the sequence, such as the fumarate reductase operon since its overexpression results in increased cell membrane, which is where lipid soluble carotenoids are stored. Here's the link the paper on fumarate reductase overexpression:
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=215469
In plants it has been shown that sink strength is a limiting factor to carotenoid accumulation, so giving bacteria more carotenoid storage space may result in much more carotenoid accumulation. Here's a discussion about engineering plant sinks for increased carotenoid accumulation:
http://www.isb.vt.edu/articles/feb0802.htm
These two complete operons (both ending in the transcriptional terminator containing GFP biobrick BBa_E0240) will then be put under control of the PSBA promoter or the arabinose inducible promoter, and the whole transcriptional cassette cut out to be inserted into broad host range plasmids like pDKS-GFPuv or pTG262 which will be electroporated into biologically relevant microbes such as probiotic lactobacilli, corn endophytic Klebsiella pneumonii 342,  or E. coli Nissle 1917 which is sold in some countries as a probiotic for intestinal health. We will then test these microbes for beta carotene production (which ever we end up being able to get to work)"
KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," system is a good way to ensure this, as you can see in the next figure.
When arabinose is added to the medium (stimulus 1), it will induce transcription from the pBAD promoter ( BBa_I13453 ), resulting in LuxR ( BBa_I0462 ) and LuxI ( BBa_C0261 ) transcripts that are translated into their respective proteins. LuxI is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of N-Acyl homoserine lactones ( AHLs ) from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)  and acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA).  These AHLs, when bound to LuxR, are able to regulate transcription through binding with a luxR binding site located in promoter regions. In our system, the LuxR-AHL complex will perform a dual task.
While it activates the pLux-CI promoter ( BBa_R0065 ), resulting in the transcriptional activation of OmpA-AFP ( BBa_K584020] )and MelA ( BBa_K193602 ) (2), it acts as a negative regulator of the pLac-Lux promoter ( BBa_K091100 ), the transcriptional regulator of stimulus 2, thereby acting as an additional safety mechanism to ensure that no INP can be produced during stimulus 1.  If we add lactose or IPTG to the medium (stimulus 2), it will activate transcription from  the pLac-Lux promoter , resulting in INP ( BBa_K584024 ), CI repressor and CrtEBI ( BBa_K274100 ) transcripts that are translated into their specific proteins. The CI repressor will repress the pLux-CI promoter and, thereby specifically inhibiting the production of AFP, while INP is being expressed.
2.a  Expression of AFP and Melanin formation
If you read how the dual inhibition works, it already will be rather clear how AFP and melanin are produced: when E.D. Frosti takes up the arabinose, it will interact with pBAD and eventually triggers the transcription of OmpA-AFP and MelA. MelA will induce melanin formation, which gives a black color to our cells. In this way we know that our pLux-CI promoter is activated and that both OmpA-AFP and MelA are being transcribed and translated. The MelA is an existing BioBrick that the Cambridge_2009 team added to the registry: BBa_K274001 . For more information about MelA you can click here .

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Notebook#Summary_-_-_TEXT.html,"A and MotB for the flagellar apparatus. A proton gradient at the inner cell membrane causes protons to flow through the stator-”channel”. This flux of protons causes the flagellum to rotate and allows the cells to swim. Each flagellum can harbor around 8-11 stator components.
References:
Chevance and Hughes (2008) Coordinating assembly of a bacterial macromolecular machine. Nat Rev Microbiol. 6: 455–465.
Fig. 4: BL21 E. coli carrying different constructs on LB swimming agar after 12h incubation at 33°C. Cells expressing motB in puc18 under the natural promoter travelled approximately 0.85cm (radius) and those expressing yhjH swam around 0.68cm. The empty vector control and motA transformed cells travelled only about 0.5cm.
These genes code for proteins that build the stator part of the bacterial flagellum which generates torque by using a proton gradient that exists across the membrane (Fig. 3). Flagellum function depends on copy number of motA and motB (Van Way et al. 2000). Therefore we chose to test these genes, hoping that the number of stator protein copies might have a positive effect on motility (Reid et al. 2006). We first tested our strains with motA and motB constructs containing the natural 3’ and 5’ regions in puc18 because a strong overexpression might have counterproductive effects. High expressed motA might thereby lead to proton leakage and disturb the metabolism of E. coli.
Results
For these two stator-genes it was very hard to get reproducible data. However, after several rounds of testing on different swimming agars and conditions we were able to conclude that overexpression of motB often had a mild positive effect on motility of BL21 E. coli (Fig. 4). However, increased expression on motA seemed to have no or even a slightly negative effect.
We did not see very strong effects after testing these two candidates. A possible explanation could be that the number of functional stator elements at one flagellum could not be increased anymore or might just not have a significant impact. Furthermore the expression of motA and motB is usually regulated in concert and if out of balance, their expression might not cause any positive effect for motility. For future projects it might be interesting to test chimeric stator proteins that could harbor higher efficiencies or use other ions for torque generation.

Samples from the growth curve assay were blotted to see if SBP is being produced at the later stages of the growth curve. A further growth curve assay was also performed which monitored cell growth until a certain OD600 was reached, at which point the cultures were induced. Purification of PotD was also continued this week.

Spinning more Tamura
Fasih prepared a pooled Tamura fraction
concentration is 1.6 mg/mL
want to spin total volume of 300 uL
Let's prepare a dope such that the Tamura:silk mass ratio is 1:500, and 15% w/v.
recipe
225 uL of 20% w/v silk dope
56.1 uL of the pooled Tamura fraction
19.4 uL of ddH2O
procedure
spun at 6uL/min into 70% v/v ethanol
spun silk was wound around tweezers
results
the spin appears to be successful
the majority of the spin ended up in a single contiguous fiber. The fiber looks and feels much more like regular silk.
the resulting thread was much more resilient than the previous spin.
visual inspection under the UV box shows that it fluoresces
the same silk sample under the UV box. Its glow is very apparent. Sample on the right is Tamura co-spin. Sample on the left is native b.mori silk. Note that this picture was taken on July 20, while the sample was co-spun on July 14. Even after a week, it' still fluorescent!
UV microscopy verified its fluorescence.
20x magnification. 100% excitation light intensity.
thoughts
The fact that the fiber was stronger and thinner during this spin could be due to a number of factors:
this spin was 15% w/v. Last time's spin was 12% w/v.
As we wound the thread around tweezers, we were stretching the thread.
This spin's fluorescence is much less than last time's spin , which was much thicker. This is despite the fact that last time's spin had a silk:tamura ratio of 4000:1, while this time's spin has a ratio of 500:1."

Spring Workshop
Almost the whole team left for the iGEM spring workshop in Évry, Paris. The drive for some of us was a bit laborious (traffic jams at the middle of the night/closed roads etc.), and others actually watched the World Cup soccer match... But in the end we all arrived at the hotel in Évry little before 2 AM, Saturday morning, and got some well deserved sleep.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"0 bp long, we decided to use upstream sequences longer than 300 bp. For TSA1 we decided take promoter region of 260 base pairs, as that was the longest we could take so that it didn’t overlap with the previous gene in yeast genome. In the case of CCP1, we decided to have a promoter region of 756 bp, as that was the same that had been used and proved to be working in our reference article (He et al., 2005). Unlike for CCP1 and TSA1, we didn’t find as clear an explanation for the length of CTT1. We only found that the reference article had done its experiment with a 479 bp upstream sequence so we decided to be sure that it was long enough and took 924 bp.
For our synthesized gene constructs, these promoters were then directly followed by the coding region of a yellow fluorescent protein. This construct was designed to replace the original promoter and multiple cloning site of our yeast plasmid. This way we could make YFP production dependent on oxidative stress. Venus yellow fluorescent protein was chosen as the visual reporter as it was supposed to be bright, stable in a variety of conditions (Shaner et al., 2015) and the sequence of codon optimized version for S. cerevisiae was available. Besides promoter + venus constructs, we decided to expressed Venus under control of one constitutive and one inducible promoter to get more reliable information about expression of Venus in yeast, and to be able to study the effect of different conditions on its expression under known promoters. The used promoters were the galactose inducible GAL1 promoter and the strong, constitutive GPD1 promoter. These constructs will serve as a control in our stress promoter tests.
The constructs were designed so that they were compatible with both Gibson assembly and yeast recombination cloning. This means that a sequence of 30 bp that is homologous with the desired cloning location from the plasmid backbone was added to each end of the promoter + Venus construct. As a plasmid backbone, we used pRS415-GAL/GPD (pRS415 plasmid with either GPD1 or GAL1 promoters), which was already available in our lab, and suitable for protein expression in S. cerevisiae . A simplified picture of all constructs is presented in figure 5.  Inserts containing homologous sites for ligation, designed promoter, and venus, were ordered from IDT.

2nd year, Telecom Sud Paris
As specialization of my last year in the engineering school Telecom SudParis, I will be doing the mSSB (master in systemic and synthetic biology). I've got useful computer science and maths skills for modeling and making the wiki. I imagine that mixing technologies and life science can lead to exciting inventions and discoveries. The iGEM seemed to me a nice opportunity to get to know the synthetic biology background and interact with students that are interested in it!
Mohamed Machat
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I am a civil engineer from Tunisia. My penchant for genetics has started since my first biology lectures in college. However, the first opportunity that I got to go into this field showed up in 2011, when I was admissible to join the ISSB master program. So I left my engineer job and have moved to France. The adventure of iGem looks to me a good step towards my career ambition: invest my mathematics and mechanics background into oncology!!

Clément Marquet
Master 2, Philosophy, Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne University
I'm completing a master of philosophy of science at Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University. I discovered synthetic biology about two years ago in a popular scientific review and was struck by the ambition of the field and the diversity of disciplines involved in it. I was seduced by the special place that laboratories such as Synberc give to social sciences and started thinking about some epistemological questions that could be raised by Feynman’s word on knowing and making or by the convergence of biology and technology. I saw in the iGEM contest an opportunity to discover scientific work from the inside and to experiment how philosophical reflections could get practical and debated inside a scientific group.

During this workshop, the speakers explained to us profound theories concerning biology in simple terms, while the experience of VR enabled us to get access to the mental world of autistic children. It is really a fantastic meeting, together with the rich offering of a delicious snack.
iii)Yax: Honestly speaking, I am not the kind of girl who is very into biology. The complicated structures and processes drove me mad from time to time. This activity, however, won the interest of mine. Unlike the traditional classes, the speakers made good use of technology while successfully getting close to our daily lives. This made all the process not hard to understand. I’d say that everything was pretty interesting when you viewed the world in a positive way. I got the precious chance of experiencing the life of children with autism under virtual reality. Every scene was so real - the desire to be noticed, fear, loneliness, loss, sadness, loneliness and Great Depression filled my mind and heart. Heart broke into pieces on the floor. I would never expect the kids to suffer from all this. Crowded parties, happy people talking with smiles on their faces, bottles striking hard, food emitting smell, and ME-in the corner of the room, alone, crying in my heart. I was so down that I was about to shout out to the people nearby, I wanted to, but I couldn’t.” That’s hopeless, but, maybe I should hopeless.
We NJU-China believe that it is possible to put forward a new method to cure more diseases with synthetic biology. Thus, through human practice, we aim to let high school students learn more about neuronal diseases and our subject and also encourage them to participate in the study of biology, especially synthetic biology and have a closer contact with iGEM. Meanwhile, we also had access to improve our project through their precious feedback in return."

<<back to notebook next week>>
5/24-5/30
The team developed a better idea of how we are to make this software thanks to the advice and guidance from Professor Bhalerao.
Donny
I spent the week brainstorming possible ideas and applications of our project as well as researching some of the considerations we might need to account for. I also looked into what software tools have been made in the past to ensure originality of our design. We made a list of ""Donny's Crazy Ideas"" for the project. After a lot of brainstorming, we decided to stick with our original idea after all, but the planning process was very beneficial because it gave some direction on how to get started.
Im not sure what Nate thinks he will get by sucking up to me, but I don't trust him for a second.
Nate
Nate learned some fun basic stuff about Python.  Also, he looked into graphical options that we hope to use in the future in conjunction with our program with help from Kanishka.  Graphviz was the main application investigated, as well as the modules that would be needed to run it via Python, such as Pydot, Pygraphviz, and Networkx.  Not sure what Donny is talking about, given that the software has yet to be written.  However, he is very thankful to have Donny ""The Ultimate Programmer"" Amfahr on the team for his infinite knowledge and wisdom about programming and such.
Palak
I read papers by Dr. Price about constraint based modeling and the factors that need to be taken into account when genome-scale models are created. I also read another paper that described a program called COBRA that is used for constraint based modeling. I began learning how to program in python.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Social Project_-_-_TEXT.html," play around with CSS and add some more eye candy in your templates to produce a nice looking wiki. Have fun and don't hesitate to try new things, you can always go back using the MediaWiki history!
Part II: How to use the iGEM MediaWiki
This part will give you a short introduction, how to use the iGEM wiki and will gibe you some advice that will save your time and your nervs. Furthermore it will give some hints, specific to a wiki created according to the above tutorial.
Login in
First of all, you always have to be login into the iGEM wiki before you can change your page. Just click the log in button on the top of this page or any other iGEM page and make sure you have your account set up.
Creating a new wiki page
There are several ways of creating a new page. The easiest way is to type the name of the new page into your browser, for example http://20xx.igem.org/Team:xxx/bane of the page you want to create.. Please note, that all names are treated in a case sensitve manner! After typing in the name, just click ""Create"" or ""Edit"" and you can add content to your newly created page. Hit ""Save"" to save the new page.
Since all iGEM teams share one common wiki, it is important that every page you create is in your namespace. In other words, all pages you create have to have your team name as a prefix. For instance, all page of our wiki are in the namespace ""Team:TU_Munich"".
One other important aspect is, that at the beginning and at the end of every wiki page, your have to link to so-called template pages that contain all your styling and layout of your wiki. Please ask your team member in charge of the wiki to add these lines to your new page, or take a look at an existing page.
Adding content to a wiki page
Before you start adding a lot of text into the wiki page please make yourself familiar with the Markup language of MediaWiki. MediaWiki offers a very intuitive way to mark headings, pictrues, etc. As the Wikipedia is also based on MediaWiki, might already be familiar with these commands. However, you still want to take a look at the Wikipedia help page or the MediaWiki documentation .
MediaWiki features a powerful history. You can undo any changed to a page or any replacement of a file. Make sure you are familiar with this feature.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," in London School [...] the question of course is sensitivity/specificity and the stability of the test. Can this test stand in field conditions? This needs to be taken into the equation. Is this test specific for serotype? And the issue of any genetically modified bacteria. [...] It needs to be thought through. [...]
Samira:
Do you think the use of GMOs for medical applications might be met with refusal?
Prof. Kalua:
In our culture, not very much. It’s a very different culture, that beliefs so much in the medical work. If there is evidence that it works, it’s much easier to convince the people. It may be that people don’t know what genes really are. The challenge is usually getting approval from the ministry or ethical board. The ones that would need to understand more. But when you go on the ground and ask people to get involved, then nobody would refuse. In general people would have no problem for this test to be done. The other issue I was going to ask is... [if it works] have you thought of this in form of a multiplex, where you test other things? [...]
Daniel C.:
The thing is, we are hoping to defeat chlamydia soon. GET2020 is somewhat optimistic but it would be really cool to have chlamydia eradicated by 2020. And then of course the company that would produce and distribute the test would have nothing else to sell. So the idea would be to diversify. I mean, it’s a new system. We already talked about that. So there is opportunity to find other markers and put the sensors for the markers – which is actually the more difficult part – in the bacteria and then it should for other markers. But they have to be specific. So that would be something that the company would have to do on the side, to keep making profit and being able to produce these tests. It’s very theoretical but it would be something that is definitely possible. [...] The work for producing the device is not that [big]. You can simply switch out the genes, we have them in modules. It would take only a few weeks. The difficult part is really just to research and to find those markers and sensors necessary. [...]
Samira:
Could you talk a bit about the financial aspect?
Prof. Kalua:
[...] We are at the endgame. When you reach the end, there is always going to be need to verify that you really wiped out chlamydia. What markers are you going to use, [to make sure] there is no chlamy"

V Analysis
    Fig. 2 tells us that when Peasants and Civilians coexist in the medium, Civilians grow more than the group in which Civilians live alone. Also, the number of Civilians becomes larger than the negative control group if the primitive fraction of peasant is larger. Contrarily, the number of Civilians does not become larger if the primitive quantity of Peasants is too big while the original number of Civilians is too small. And this is considered acceptable. Besides, as is revealed, Civilians grows fastest when the primitive ratio of Peasants and Civilians is 1.
    The results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 are also in line with expectation. Fig. 1 demonstrates that when the concentration of Arabinose is 40μM, Civilians cannot live without Peasants, which means the cells in the medium mainly live on sucrose instead of arabinose. However, Civilians can grow alone if the concentration of arabinose is up to 100 μM, which may provide extra carbon sources. This comparison tells that 40μM is an appropriate concentration which is able to ask cells to live on sucrose but not arabinose.

Summer Pathways
In much of the same spirit as in our participation in Building With Biology, our team collaborated with the BU foundational research team to host several activities for a group of high school students from areas all over New England. We taught a group of young women interested in STEM fields of study about basic principles of synthetic biology, electric circuits and microprocessors and engaged them in a discussion of engineering ethics.

Questions on transformation improved with a 25% difference between pre and post. The improvement on these three question topics corresponds to activities done with students on day two of the course, namely the gel electrophoresis and the transformation of a plasmid into E.coli. Questions that covered topics only reviewed in the lectures showed the least improvement, such as recombinant DNA (6.7% difference) and polymerase chain reaction (2.7% difference). To improve understanding of these topics in a future course, interactive activities will be designed for these topics.

HKU-HKBU,2009,Team:HKU-HKBU#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," combination of two majors - in biochemistry and computer science. Being one of the earliest members of our team, I was responsible for writing and presenting our project proposal at the beginning, some wet lab experiments in the middle, and at last, perhaps the one I enjoyed most, our wiki's build-up work. Specifically, I converted our first two framework designs into code, though not the final one. It seemed to be quite a hard job for me at first since I started out as a complete newbie, even without knowing any HTML tags but only some if and while statements in programming languages such as C. However, driven by a burning curiosity in the field of web coding, I decided to give it a try and studied some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript online tutorials myself, and then embarked on an exciting journey of constructing my very first website. And I found it never less amazing than working with those traditional programming languages!
Besides coding, I also enjoyed undergoing the entire process of a scientific project as well as learning a bunch of basic wet lab techniques. And yet the thing I treasure most is the friendship with other team mates I have harvested. It has been a really nice experience to work with people with different backgrounds and distinct characters, from both HKU and HKBU. We had such a great time together in the past couple of months. We strived together, laughed together, and faced challenges together. I will never forget the time we spent together.
ZHONG Xing Xin Nova
I am a year 2 student from the Department of Mathematics of the University of  Hong Kong.  I joined the iGEM team of HKU-BU at the beginning of this summer, and feel great honored to join in the jamboree representing HKU.  As a mathematics students, I have never entered a Biochemistry lab before but  the experience this time has enlighten me a lot. Actually, iGEM is the first time for me to touch the concept of synthetic biology.
Working together with the whole team, under the guidance of instructors, I am able to see my progress day after day.  Those creative ideas in the brainstorm, rigorous spirit of setting controlling, and the ingenious designing of experiment have impressed me and changed my mind significantly.
During the summer, I mainly worked on controlling the speed  of our bacteria-motor, and on measuring the expressing level related to a concentration gradient of the IPTG inducer, by  the method of Western Blotting. Besides, I have tried on knocking out cheZ fragment of E.coli 2443 and spent some time in making bio-brick.

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.

Characterization of <partinfo>K389421</partinfo>, <partinfo>K389422</partinfo>, <partinfo>K389423</partinfo>
By self designed PCR-Primer we excluded terminal GFP and the initial promoter pBAD/araC, for replacing our own VirB promotor and reporter gene luc (luciferase). Primers were designed for sensitivity tuner I746370 , I746380 and I746390 so that standard assembly would be possible ( Primer Design ). Assembling of PCR-products took place by Silver Assembly.
Characterization tests
Cultivation was done by induction with Acetosyringone at 50 µM. Controls were not induced Sensitivity Tuner devices as well as induced and not induced nativ system ( K389015 ; without tuning elements). Induction was done upon inoculation.  Measuring point for amplification factor calculation was OD 1.0. ( Protocols )
Results
Three sensitivity tuned Vir-Gen sensing systems were obtained: K389421 , K389422 and K389423 distinguishing by the amplification level of luc transcription.
Figure 1: Amplification factor of induced, 50 µM Acetosyringone (red) and not induced (green) modified Sensitivity Tuner K389421, K389422 and K389423, Standard deviation shown.
The amplification factor was received by apply K389015 as reference. Amplification calculation was done by normalizing relative luminescence units emitted from luciferase per OD. Output-signal amplification is in the induced contructs (red) K389422 and K389423 100 and respectively 200 fold higher than in not induced controls (green). An exception is K389422 were"
