UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," scientific curiosity, we hoped that by improving the scientific education in the largest university in Honduras that it could have a positive impact on local communities and down the line mitigate the risk of disease transmission for leishmaniasis and other diseases prevalent in Honduras.
Another potential cause for the spread of the disease is due to the lifestyle of the people in the choluteca region. The region has experienced a prolonged drought in the last two years which has limited water supply and exacerbated plagues. Subsistence farmers in particular have been affected as they lack irrigation systems and have traditionally relied on rainwater. The drought has caused the loss of up to 90% of crops (Maize and beans) which has led to chronic malnutrition in 25% of children between the ages of 6 months and 30 months. Our team had very little experience in this area but decided to investigate it further. We looked at the potential of using genetically modified crops in honduras since there are very few regulations in relation to the GMOs there. Our investigations also led us to Golden Rice, we decided to use this as a tool to educate students on the benefits of producing genetically modified crops. Drought resistant crops could be extremely useful in this region if this drought persists.
Our work in Honduras highlighted the need for a vaccine for this disease. Both researchers and regulators validated that this disease will only get worse if we do not do something in the future. They will also provided us with valuable information on how it would be best to deliver this vaccine and of possible regulatory requirements that it would have to fulfill. In addition we were informed of the under-diagnosis disease and that it is actually more prevalent than any statistic would indicate. This was revealed through our interactions with staff in the Alonso Suazo Hospital and with the doctor in Choluteca. When we visited Choluteca, we observed that the cause of the disease is multifactorial. The presence of the sand-fly alone is problematic but the nature of this problem was amplified by factors such as education, hygiene and nutrition. Therefore we felt that for treatment and prevention against leishmaniasis, it should not solely be pharmacological but also should include fostering interest in education, improvement of the water supply to the region and improving the community’s diet.

  About Restriction Enzymes
Dam methylase ( K200001 ) is constitutively produced at a low amount.  This prevents leaky expression of restriction enzymes from damaging the genome prematurely. Consequently, a balance exists between Dam methylation and restriction enzyme activity.

Results
Wet Lab
The activity of the restriction enzymes is critical to module 3.  We have tested this using a genomic digest assay.
The restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI are shown to cut genomic DNA into small fragments, shown on the right by a smear of bands.  We have further tested the restriction enzymes in DNA which have been methylated by Dam enzymes and shown that there is essentially no cleavage at low concentrations of restriction enzymes.
  About our wet lab results
Dry Lab
We have also attempted to link our restriction enzymes with cell death using a model.
The population increase is initially exponential as the restriction enzymes have a delay in production.  As the restriction enzymes accumulate in the cell, the cell growth starts to slow down.  If the lambda cI promoter is strong enough, killing rate will greatly exceed cell division rate, and there will be an exponential decrease in cell population.
  About our dry lab results
Results summary
We have shown that cells can be protected from low concentrations of the restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI by Dam methylation, and how the cell population rapidly decreases with thermoinduction of restriction enzymes.

Comparison conclusion
Background
As one of the original goals of this competition, iGEM has been dedicated to collecting biobricks. After more than a decade of efforts by iGEMers, iGEM has accumulated a large amount of parts, data and systems, which can be regarded as one of the most influential databases in the field of synthetic biology. However, according to our survey of nearly 100 synthetic biologists, iGEM still lacks joint analysis and retrieval with traditional databases (Genbank, Uniprot, GO, etc.), which is a limitation for iGEMers and researchers to explore and use iGEM big data. In addition, some iGEMers also reflect that the functions such as retrieval and interface in iGEM registry are not intelligent enough and need to be further improved.
Our Project
BioMaster is a new integrated biobricks database based on iGEM Registry, dedicated to providing synthetic biologists with the best biobricks retrieval experience. We integrated eight traditional biological research databases including Uniprot, EPD and GO, supplemented the information of functions, sites, interactions and references in the biobricks in iGEM, and visualized some information, saving the extra time needed for synthetic biologists to retrieve. At the same time, BioMaster provides four more intelligent retrieval methods to help synthetic biologists more accurately retrieve biological bricks. In addition, we also provide biological bricks predicted by the algorithm for a reference.
As a biobrick database made for synthetic biologists, BioMaster will provide you with the most comprehensive ""biobricks service"" when building genetic circuits, making biobricks, and advancing synthetic biology projects.
Comparison conclusion
Compared to other similar projects, BioMaster is a database instead of a community or platform. So，BioMaster is more focused on improving iGEM Registry. First of all, BioMaster is far superior to others in terms of information. It integrated eight traditional biological research databases and provides users with sequence, literature, interaction and"

Usages of Croton Tiglium
Besides the fact that all components of croton tiglium are poisonous, it is widely used as an herb of the traditional chinese medicine since 2000 years. There, it found its usage as an oil to treat skin diseases and  intoxications and as a laxative. However, many of these former usages were abandoned becuase of the high toxity. Further, the plant was used against cancerous diseases due to its anti-tumoric effects that were proven in 1994 (Kim et al).
Secondary Metabolism of C. Tiglium
In difference to animals, plants usually have a second metabolism that does not interact with any chemicals needed for primary functions like growth or development. However, the seondary metabolism is still connected to the primary metabolism as it uses some of the substances produces within. The products that emerge from the second metabolism offer a wide range of possible usages for humanity due to their great diversity. However, the pants mostly use them as protection against herbivores and pathogens. Some metabolites are toxic whereas others do attract parasites and predators as a protection against the herbivores. Besides from many other secondary metabolites, croton tiglium produces iso-guanosine.  In 1932, iso-guanosine was first isolated from croton tiglum (Cherbuliez et al 1932). Today, it also commercially available as crotonoside. Iso-guanosine was object of many reaearches and is found to have a lot of effects onto biological processes (see Lowry and Brown, 1952; Huang et al 1973; Vasu and David ,1985 for reference) including antitumorous effects (Kim et al 1942)  For us, one of the main aspects that is interesting on iso-guanosine is its use as an unnatural base within organisms.

Purine bases are produced de novo directly on the ribose (Berg et al., 2012). The synthesis starts with the replacement of the pyrophosphate of PRPP with an amino group, yielding phosphoribosylamine (PRA). This reaction is catalyzed by amidophosphoribosyltransferase (ATase) and also uses the ammonia from a glutamine side-chain as the donor of"

In the afternoon we attended a workshop organised by Daisy Ginsberg and James King, which explored the potential future applications and issues arising from the ability to easily produce colour from bacteria. Thia was a good introduction to thinking about issues of Human Practice in synthetic biology as they related to our project. Specifically we explored four main areas which synthetic biology and bacterial pigment production could significantly affect in the future:

Modelling and design of chamber
Introduction
The final product of PharMARSy, Protein Printer would be a device that allows for growth of bacteria in one chamber and secretion of pure protein into another. The chambers would be divided by a biomimetic membrane, which serves two purposes: it should allow for bacteria to secrete the protein through membrane into collection chamber using injectosome - a syringe-like protein structure, but at the same time it should be robust enough to prevent bacteria to crossing into lower chamber thus contaminating the protein solution.
The design of the chamber should therefore fulfill the following criteria:
Simplicity of handling: easy to open, easy to safely close
Allow for fixation of membrane without breaking it (sufficient control over applied pressure)
Prevent mixing of media from different chambers
Allow for fluidic system / stirring / sample taking
Due to popularity of 3D printing and its relative accessibility we decided to print our own prototype. But it had to be designed first.
Design of our first Bacta_tank prototype
The first design of the chamber was made before deciding on what type of membrane to use. It was therefore crucial to keep the design open for changes and later modifications.
A general concept was disk-like plastic container allowing for delicate handling of the presumably fragile membrane (fig 1).
Figure 1: First design.
It was realised that the membrane will have to be somehow held in place, to prevent leakage and to allow for stirring of the media above it. The  design was therefore improved to address that problem. One solution was to include another part that would hold the membrane in place as can be seen in figure 2 and 3.
Figure 2: Multicomponent design - Bacta_tank1 offers more yet at the cost of simplicity. It served as a template for further development, but was never printed.

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"-of-the art methods are unable to simultaneously achieve precision and repeatability, nor can they withstand changing operating culture conditions [29]. Furthermore, based on our literature review, custom optogenetic tools have only been designed for well plates, which are small-volume, high-throughput systems. These tools are inadequate for our project as our objective is to scale up to a large-volume, low-throughput bioreactor.
Our first design focus was then to create an in silico automated feedback control system, a theoretically effective and feasible strategy for overcoming current challenges in light-controlled gene expression [30] as compared to typical open-loop feedback control systems for gene expression [29]. Our second design focus was to accommodate larger-volume containers for scaled-up cell cultivation. We thus produced solutions based on these design considerations.
Hardware
We designed two complementary hardware systems. The first fulfills users’ needs to characterize their optogenetic circuit in scaled-up systems. The second enables optogenetic biomanufacturing. See our Hardware page for more on how we actualized our final designs.
PDF-LA!
Plate-Dish-Flask Light Apparatus (PDF-LA!) is a suite of three fully programmable devices compatible with standard laboratory equipment. Users design their own optogenetic circuit, and have the choice of characterizing their cells in 12-well plates, petri dishes, or Erlenmeyer flasks. The containers, placed in the corresponding devices, will be illuminated using LEDs. These LEDs can be programmed for varying intensities and durations.
The first design was a device for the 12-well plate, P-LA!. We designed P-LA! to improve on another design which had been loaned to us by a different university, and hence gain experience of creating custom tools for optogenetics research.
P-LA! is better than the previous design because it can accommodate 12-well plates from different manufacturers, whereas the other design could only fit a specific 12-well plate model. P-LA! also uses significantly less material. Fun fact: despite its name, P-LA! was printed with ABS filament rather than PLA filament! All our 3D-printed designs use ABS filament as it was made readily available to us by our university, and its material properties were deemed sufficient for our purposes.

Victor first wanted to be a doctor, but then decided to use his great wit and eloquence to be a lawyer. He always has a joke on the tip of his tongue as well as a cigarette. Although he might talk a little bit too much during presentation sessions, his subtle and sophisticated humour is essential to our team - even Claudia would agree. He's never the last to party that's for sure. Oh, and did I mentioned he's so strong he couldn't help but break a petri dish with his bare hands the first time he helped in the lab ?

The kit included five vials of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 in plasmid backbone pSB1C3. Each vial contained DNA at a different concentration: 50pg/µl, 20pg/µl, 10pg/µl, 5pg/µl, 0.5pg/µ. Transformations had to be performed  with each of these to determine how efficient our competent cells were.
We used TOP10 Escherichia coli competent cells and SOC medium from the Gibson assembly kit that we ordered separately from New England Biolabs. On the first try we got around 10 colonies overall and clearly failed. Then we tried it again with one difference in the procedure - we added plasmids into the cells during the transformation, not the other way around which was written in the iGEM protocol. Unfortunately, it didn’t work the second time either and we got similar results. Not giving up, we tried it a third time and this time we additionally used pJR18 plasmid for positive control with three concentrations - 500 pg/µl, 50 pg/µl and 5 pg/µl. Also for the antibiotic we used ampicillin instead of chloramphenicol and this time it finally worked. Although after counting the colonies it was revealed that transformation efficiency was quite low - 1.8E7 cfu/µL on average and weighted 1.6E7 cfu/µL it was good enough to proceed with the transformations and start the actual experiments. Our competency results can be found in table 1.

Week One- June 2-8
At the beginning of the first week, we gathered as a group to finalize our summer timeline. We had to give a presentation to faculty advisors on our summer readings.
We created team nitroGENIUS, and prepared a timeline for the summer as well.
Later, the team  traveled to Monstanto, one of out major sponsors, Headquarters and gave a presentation to a panel of nitrogen fixation experts on our summer project, and got a tour of the facilities. Afterwards we started lab safety training and split into our respective labs for the summer.
The Brauer team also started design of cloning for light regulation mechanism and ordered primers.
Week Two- June 9-15
Continued from Week One, the team was trained to make LB media and completed all of the basic lab procedure training in their respective labs. During the second week, the team also completed the LB plate preparation. Rebstock Team members were trained for transformation of designed plasmid to JM109, BL21(DE3), Top10, and DH5Î± was also done. Started filling preliminary Safety forms.  
Continued work on creating negative and positive controls for light regulation, in addition to the light regulation plasmid and the necessary precursor plasmid.
Website started work on web site layout design.
At the end of the week we had our first meeting with Brandon and Rajib from Penn State to see how they can help our project from a computational perspective; they looked at possibly implementing a minimal nif cluster once we have the nitrogen fixation working.
Week Three- June 16-22
Electroporation and transformation was done to all strainsâ€”plasmids are now in all selected strains. Rebstock Team started culturing experimental plates and tubes of JM109, BL21(DE3), Top10, and DH5Î± with plasmids.  Positive and Negative control are designed. Team also initiated to contact Dennis Dean and two Chinese research groups about their plasmid that can be utilized as positive control for WashU iGEM team.

Let’s dive in that waterfall in the middle of a mountain lost in the jungle? Count me in! Let’s do some sea kayaking during a crazy storm? I’ll be there!”. He has traveled to around 19 countries in 4 different continents doing crazy stuff – and he’s still working on this list. In his free time, he likes to write and his first book (a science fiction adventure) was published last year. He is also the only adviser not currently doing his PhD at the University of Sheffield – impressive stuff at just 20!
Kyle Buchan
House of Freedom
Kyle is a Microbiologist, professional science enthusiast, and a general all-round nerd. He got into this line of work when he sat down one day (around the same time he was told that the mitochondria were the powerhouse of cells) and realised that wee stuff was cool, partly because it could kill you, partly because it’s invisible and partly because there’s more of it inside you than there have ever been humans! His iGEM story started three years ago, when he was a ne’er do well Microbiology undergrad in his third year at the University of Dundee. They designed and developed a project called ‘Toximop!’ which involved E. coli engineered to soak up a common toxin in water bodies – microcystin. “Since then I have helped to start the Sheffield iGEM team, who are going to blow your minds with Iron and Blood!” he adds.
Felix Weihs
House of Thesis Panic
Felix is a 3rd year PhD student in Sheffield working on round bacteria around their roundness (actually true). To be able to cover his travel plans (he has one continent left!), he needs money and time. He thinks there is no worse plan than doing science research and if he thinks about it, he is doing something wrong. “Time to get a real job…” When asked how he got involved with iGEM, his answer was “Every team needs a German. It just works better this way.”

If you are able to produce a material with the required characteristics, the chances are good in my opinion. But as I said earlier, the price is an important criterion. But with respective promotion, you could start to establish the products with certain target groups among the customers and end-consumers.
Do you want to know more about our project?
Absolutely, especially if you succeed!
Some last advice on my part: Fats such as palm oil are rather hard to compete with from a financial point of view. Stearin, which is a product of fats obtained by saponification, is more expensive than fats. If you succeed to produce stearin, i.e. fatty acids, rather than fat with your technology, you would be more competitive.
Do you think your member companies would like to know more about us?
As soon as there are promising results and especially some material they can test for suitability in candles, they certainly will. But you should have some samples for them to test first.
Survey
To gain insight in the people’s mind we conducted two surveys among two different target groups: the conscious consumers and passers -by on an action day of our university (TU Graz StreeTech-Day). The process of creating the survey is described under “integrated human practice”.
With the help of CodeCheck, over 1000 people of all ages participated and let us get an overview about their consumption behavior. We found out, that the majority is against the current palm oil situation and hereinafter is trying to avoid it. The main reason for this, with a majority of 89.73% is the environment. But in order their attempt to avoid palm oil containing products (76,38%), ~40% declare to consume them on a regular basis, while only 11,76% claim never to consume palm oil containing products.
Additional findings are that certificates are important to them, only 17,12% never look for palm oil certificates like RSPO or bio-certificates. Also searching for alternatives, the desire for information about biosynthesis, and their disapproval of genetic engineering are very important to them.
For the demographic information, we found out that the majority of conscious consumers consist to 81,74% of women, the biggest age group is between 21 and 30 years old, 83,85% of the participants come from Germany, and more than the half have achieved their A-levels or a higher educational degree.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," could contribute to the Nona community. We had a total of 3 main meetings, with a couple smaller correspondences in between. The following conclusions were reached regarding our collaboration:
NONA would distribute Neptune, allowing Neptune to have a “home” where is can easily be found (beyond GitHub.)
NONA is dedicated to integrating all open synthetic biology software tools under one umbrella, thus building a community of researchers and developers who who will use and support these tools. Thus, NONA will be a medium through which other developers can contribute to Neptune, and NONA will be a place researchers can go to learn more about how to use Neptune, ask for help, and so forth.
Overall, by having a dedicated community and website where Neptune will always have a place, we are making it very hard for Neptune to be abandoned. Quite the opposite, with NONA will ensure Neptune is sustained for years to come, while also providing the opportunity for a community to flourish around Neptune and similar software tools.
MORE ON OUR WORK WITH NONA
Building With Biology
We will continue to discuss our partnership with Nona under the gold medal requirements for integrated human practices. For now, we will look at a handful of other “beyond the bench” activities that we did. The first of these is the Building With Biology event at the Boston Museum of Science. This Building With Biology event is part of a NSF funded effort to stimulate synthetic biology public engagement and community outreach. Indeed, there is a big gap between the general public’s perception of synthetic biology, and the perception that researchers and engineers have toward synthetic biology; the Building with Biology event is one way we are trying to bridge that gap. During this daylong event, our iGEM team, as well as a number of other iGEM teams including our sister foundational research team and the MIT team, came to join the public in a day of conversation, education and outreach.
Let us paint a picture of what this event was like, what we accomplished, and why this human practices activity is important.
The first portion of this event was centered around having us the “scientific community” host little synthetic biology activities that are geared toward a range of audiences: The activities were simple such that they could be enjoyed by kids under the age of 10 (sometimes as young as 5,) but these activities had embedded in them big synthetic biology ideas, ideas that adults could ponder, and even people with a scientific background could enjoy.

Plasmid Isolation of cl lambda and Colony PCR of LuxPQ-B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 in psB1AC3
Plasmid was isolated from an overnight culture of cl lamba using Sigma GenElute Mini Prep Kit. The concentration and purity of the isolated plasmid was then measured with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Restriction digest was performed with XbaI and PstI in React 2 (Invitrogen) buffer for 2 hours at 37ºC. Cut plasmid and uncut plasmid were then run on a 1.0% agarose gel, no bands were seen for either column. The isolated plasmid was then specked again, to verify the initial concentration, which turned out to be accurate. An overnight Restriction digest was then set up as described above; however, 600ng of DNA were used instead of 200ng.
A colony PCR was set up with colonies of the construction LuxPQ-B0015-R0040-LuxOU-B0015 in psB1AC3 as the template. Seven colonies were chosen. This PCR was performed with BBK CP F/R primers (these anneal on the BBK vector just outside the cloning site) and LuxPQ F / LuxOU R primers (these are gene specific primers). Due to the long extension time for this PCR (6min and 20 seconds) it is run overnight and then held at 4ºC upon completion. For PCR conditions, refer to PCR performed on July 27 2009. Restreaks of the seven colonies were made and overnight liquid cultures were made so that plasmid can be isolated tomorrow.

A Second Look through Lab Activities
Today was spent going through the lab activities and modifying the scripts along the way. I revised the whole PCR script so that all of it behaves like the general PCR activity and there is not a problem with locating items and the script will no longer proceed if anything is missing, which I believe happened because of a function modification since it definitely did not do that before.

To estimate the time needed for equilibration, we need to estimate the volume of the column. Expansion is   reported to be 2-3 BV, therefore an expansion of 2.5 BV was chosen for calculations. Thus the column should   be able to contain approximately 3 L. A column with a diameter of 50 [mm] is deemed to be appropriate for   this process. To transfer this flowrate to a volumetric, it is calculated how large the volume is per cm, which   is approximately 0.02[L]. This corresponds to a volumetric flowrate of 6 [L/h]. Now the time of application   can be calculated to be 2 [h] and the height of the column to be 1.5 [m]. Reference: NEB-impact

The benefit of the EBA is, that the fluidization leaves space between the beads for particulate matter to  pass through. Rendering the solid separation steps of traditional product recovery unnecessary.   This type of chromatography has been reported to be a one-step purification. Another benefit is the time reduction before the protein  is bound to the beads, further reducing the residence time.. Reference: Pharmacia. Introduction to Expanded Bed Adsorption.

The bed is fluidized by controlling the density of the beads, and thereby the downward force of   sedimentation, and the upward force created by the flow. The sedimentation velocity is controlled by the   design of the beads. In a stable bed the beads follow a Gaussian distribution. This is obtained by varying the   density of the beads. Therefore the ordinary agarose beads are fitted with inert cores of varying diameters.  An unstable bed leads to risk of turbulence or   channelling, which will say that the feed does not have sufficient contact with the beads to bind the"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#rMFC#ElectronTransfer_-_-_TEXT.html,"B::oprF strain shows no succinate export under anaerobic conditions displayed in figure 6. This demonstrates a successful knockout of the dcuB gene in the E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF strain. As positive control we got an E. coli strain from the KEIO collection with a verified knockout in the dcuB gene.
Figure 5 shows the result of the anaerobic cultivation and succinate concentration measurement of this E. coli strain. A very low succinate concetration in the culture supernatant could be observed. In comparison to the E. coli KRX wildtype there is a very low succinate export. Only traces of succinate could be measured attributed to transport of succinate by other transporters with reduced specifity.
Furthermore in Escherichia coli ΔdcuB749::kan the knockout is not over the complete dcuB gene. Insertion of kanamycin selection cassette was executed at position 749 of dcuB gene. So there could be a residual activity of DcuB because of residual expressed parts of the antiporter protein. However the knockout of the dcuB in E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF is complete and residual activity is not possible as shown in figure 7. Comparison between the E. coli wildtype and E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF is an obvious demonstration of a completely functional knockout of the C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB.
Fumarate reductase (Frd) from Escherichia coli
Upon the expression of the fumarate reductase Frd in E. coli we analyzed the metabolic behavior under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .  Successful expression of the fumarate reductase Frd ( BBa_1465102 ) could be proven via SDS-PAGE .  Activity of the fumarate reductase displayed with HPLC analysis of fumarate consumption and succinate production in anaerobic cultivation of E. coli was shown with BBa_1465102 . Furthermore we investigated the fumarate reductase activity in different E. coli strains by phenotypic MicroArray (PM) analysis with a Biolog® system .
SDS-PAGE
The fumarate reductase could be detected in purified membrane and periplasmatic protein fractions. Proteins were fractioned by cold osmotic shock of E. coli KRX at different steps after induction of protein expression.

Steps
1. Constructing gRNA plasmid and donor DNA
To construct gRNA plasmid, a set of primers were used to PCR amplify the pGRB backbone. The 20 bp spacer sequence specific for each target was synthesized in primers. The PCR product was then self-ligated using Golden Gate Assembly to obtain the desired gRNA plasmid.
Donor dsDNA usually had 300–500 bp homologous arm on each side unless otherwise noted. To construct donor dsDNA, two homologous arms and the sequence to be inserted were separately amplified and were then fused together by fusion PCR. Gel purification of the PCR products prior to electroporation is necessary. All primers, including those used as donor ssDNA, were ordered from Genewiz.
2. Genome editing procedure
Electrocompetent cells with pRedCas9 plasmid were generated previously. In brief, a single colony or 100 times diluted overnight culture was inoculated in 3 mL LB medium (or 100 mL LB for large scale preparation) and was grown at 32oC to OD∼.5. The cells were then washed twice with cold-sterile ddH2O in test tubes. One microliter of cells were finally concentrated 20-fold into 50 μL volume for each reaction. Unless otherwise noted, 100 ng donor dsDNA (or 1 μM ssDNA) and 100 ng gRNA plasmid were added in each electroporation reaction. Bio-Rad MicroPulser was used for electroporation (0.1 cm cuvette, 1.80 kV). Cells after electroporation were immediately added into 3 mL LB and recovered for 3 h prior to plating. For plasmid curing, correct colonies were inoculated in LB containing 0.2% L-arabinose and cultivated for 6–8 h or overnight.

Team Cultivation & Purification:
We got E. coli KRX with our own BioBrick BBa_K863000 in pSB1C3 like the rest.
We discussed if we did not produce anything because of the toxicity of our protein, which may reduce the plasmid stability. We searched for maximal used concentration of chloramphenicol and found out that concentrations up to 170 µg/mL were used. Therefore we decided to start a new flask cultivation with concentrations of chloramphenicol varying in 5 steps from 20 µg/mL to 170 µg/mL. Today we made the precultures of E. coli KRX with BBa_K863005 and E. coli KRX as negative control.

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Again we did the digest of our new T7 promoter part and the ligation in pSB1C3 backbone with ecol PCR products with and without HIS tag. After that we transformed the ligations in pSB1C3. Additionally we did the same with promoter J23110 instead of T7 promoter.
We did PCR on BBa_K863020 with the primers B.halo_FW and B.halo_RV for cloning the gene in pSB1C3 backbone without promoter and HIS tag.
We ligated the digested pSB1C3 plasmids with ecol and ecol_HIS with the new pT7 promoter and pSB1C3 backbone and transformed the approaches in KRX.

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture,
or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,
may obtain a patent. —US Law
  As we developed our 2015 iGEM project -- delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system via a bacterial toxin -- we came across a legal battle between Dr. Jennifer Doudna and Dr. Feng Zhang, of The Broad Institute of MIT, fighting for the intellectual property rights for the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. CRISPR and the associated Cas9 protein comprise a bacterial immune system engineered as a genome-editing platform. As our interest in the lawsuit developed, we became aware of the ethical and legal issues arising from rapid development of novel biotechnologies. By studying the current patenting issues over the general CRISPR/Cas9 lawsuit and general IP issues faced in the technological developments, we isolated some of the major patenting issues we could potentially face: the first being patent processing issues concerning competing patent claims and documentation of evidence, the second being ethical issues regarding DNA patents and claims for technology to be open source.
  We used the Doudna v. The Broad Institute of MIT, suit as case study to identify the benefits of the privatization of biological elements. Claims for ownership of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system date back to 2012, when Dr. Jennifer Doudna (UC Berkeley) and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (University of Vienna) published a paper in Science showing that CRISPR-Cas systems (a driving force in bacterial adaptive immunity) could be programmed for genome editing. In 2013, Dr. Feng Zhang (Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University) published a paper showing that the CRISPR-Cas9 system could be used to edit DNA in eukaryotic cells. One year later, the Broad Institute was granted a patent over the CRISPR-Cas9 system, listing Zhang as the inventor of the technology. Doudna is suing over the patent rights of CRISPR, claiming that she was the first to invent the technology as well"

D hardly expressed any GFP. This was both good and bad. Good because it indicates that we have a correct plasmid since GFP is present. Bad because the repressor in the GR1 construct should shut down expression 100%.

Greg worked on some of the figures and changed the layout for our poster. I worked on the wiki, changing the layout ~ essentially beautifying it and so the plan is to read through the content and figure out what needs to be edited and added and who should do it (even if it's me) ;) which means that I will probably be bossy and demand things from people, so be prepared! ;)
06-10-2010 - Patrick - Anti-Terminator group
The SPL PCR product was ran on a gel, and looked quite good having a band size just around 1kb, its actual size being 941bp, so thats pretty good, PCR clean up was then performed on it.
The ligation of pAT12 didn't seem to work, so new ligations were made today for pAT12 using different concentrations of the inserts and vector, these were then transformated and plated; they will be checked tomorrow to see if concentration was the issue.
O/N cultures were made of pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11, these need to be mini-prepd tomorrow as well as PCR verified to check if we indeed have pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11.
Competent cells will be made tomorrow, although this will be coordinated with Sebastien.
05-10-2010 - Patrick - Anti-Depressor Group: The Terminators!!
So it seems like our competing team isn't doing too well, so we will try helping them out tomorrow if they need it. :)
During the lab today, started off by running the digestions made yesterday on a gel, namely pAT08(E+S) and pSB2K3(E+P).
They looked good and so proceeded to doing a pcr clean up followed by running them on a gel again in order to determind dna concentration for calculations needed for ligations.
Restreaks were made of the ligations plated yesterday, namely pAT09, pAT10, pAT11; if all looks good tomorrow on the plates then O/N cultures will be made.
The pAT12 construct was made today by ligating the following together:

Hauke is group leader within the Applied Systems Biology group of Professor Eils at Bioquant. Due to his firm background in systems theory he is an enthusiastic fan of synthetic biology and iGEM; it is for his persevering encouragements that an iGEM team for Heidelberg could be initiated. Hauke has done his Ph. D. in non-linear dynamics at the Technical University of Darmstadt. At the DKFZ in Heidelberg he has been involved in the start-up of today's Applied Systems Biology group. He currently works on several interdisciplinary projects at Bioquant and DKFZ. His findings on the orchestration of multiple signaling pathways controlling keratinocyte migration have recently been accepted by Molecular Systems Biology. Inspired by his background in stochastic modeling he furthermore investigates transient gene expression states that are affected by random reaction kinetics due to low particle numbers, in particular in prokaryotes. He is also involved in the development of optimal experiment design tools for the parameter estimation in large ODE systems. With Jens and Victor he will coordinate and support the team during the summer. His experience with experimental biologists will help the team to find exciting connections between wet-lab biology and systems biology. back

The absence in yeast of the vast majority of p53 regulators allowed investigating its functional, post-translational modifications by Mdm2. She found that Mdm2 is necessary in yeast to recruit p53 to nuclear bodies reminiscent of human PML bodies, suggesting a possible involvement of Mdm2 in the recruitment of p53 to PML bodies in human cells.

Switch on the power, setting the voltage to 100 volts.
Leave for about 30-40 minutes.
Image 10 shows Jess pipetting the 10 microlitres of DNA + dye into the wells of the gel. Note that the pipette is pointing just above the well (not into it) and that the pipette is pointing vertically over it. Also note that there is no dispersion around the site of the wells – this is because the solution has been applied slowly!
What you should see
Image 11 - The gel after completion of electrophoresis - three bands can be seen towards the top of the photograph
Whilst the gel is running, there may be froth visible around the site of the electrodes. This sometimes happens and shouldn’t be cause for concern. If this does happen however, make sure that the temperature isn’t getting to hot
Once the electrophoresis has finished, there should be three bands which appear indicating the progress of the reaction. See image 11...
Image 11 - this is the gel once electrophoresis has finished. There are three bands visible - these serve as visible markers so that you can track how far the DNA has travelled: a cyan band (nearest the DNA wells), dark blue band and a yellow band (furthest from DNA wells)
What to do next
Image 12 - this makes the whole procedure worthwhile! A photograph of our gel with the DNA visible as bands in the lanes
Switch off the electricity and remove the gel from the solution.
In a container, take the gel to a dark room and place it under a UV light scanner.
Using dials on the scanner, focus and zoom in on the gel to make sure that the resonance and size of the image is good enough for analysis.
Either save the image onto the computer, print the image or do both.
Image 12 - This is the photograph that should be seen once the gel has been placed in a UV scanner. The DNA standard ladder can be seen in the first lane followed by our experimental DNA in the other lanes (ordered 1-10). Only lane 9's DNA didn't show up in this experiment - this is probably because the E.coli which grew in colony 9 gained resistance to the ampicillin covering the nutrient media by other means.

Five cycles were performed. 2.5 µl of 10 µM Forward and Reverse Primers, both binding to the new 5‘ of both strands were subsequently added to the first PCR mix. A second PCR was performed, with an elongation temperature calculated on the basis of the assembled fragment‘s size.
Preparative Enzymatic Digest
Buffers for two or more combinatoral enzymes were selected by NEB Double Digest Finder. In order to gain high fragment concentrations in subsequent Gel Extractions, a total volume of 50 µl was mostly chosen. Typical Preparative Digests constisted of 2-3 µg vector DNA, 5 µl 10x NEB Buffer, 0.5 µl of 100x BSA, 1 µl per enzyme and were filled up to 50µl with water. Digests were commonly performed at 37 °C for two hours.
Oligo Annealing
5 µl of 100 µM both Forward and Reverse primer solutions were diluted in 80 µl of water. 10 µl of NEB Buffer No. 2 were added. Samples were heated up to 95 °C for two minutes, whereupon the heating block was switched off. After a 2-hour step of gradual cooling down to RT, the annealed oligos were stored at -20 °C.
Ligation
In order to avoid low ligation efficiencies or undesired byproduct vectors, fragment molarities and lengths were considererd as parameters for calculational schemes. Smaller fragments were mostly added excessively within between 4-fold and 8-fold molar amounts, compared to larger backbone fragments. Volume constraint often arose low Gel Extraction yields of particular fragments, so that total DNA quantities were fixed to values at around 25 ng. 5‘ dephosphorylation of single fragments was scarcely performed for reactions with high proportions of backbone religation, using Antarctic Phosphatase. Typical ligation approaches contained 2 µl 10x T4 Buffer, 1-7 µl of each fragment, 1 µl of T4 Ligase and a water fill-up to 20 µl. A 30-minute incubation step was performed at RT, preceding subsequent transformation.

The relative free enthalpy of solvation between apolar and polar environments is an important property in many biological phenomena, including protein folding and lipid membrane formation.
System Setup and Parameters
We probed the behavior of a single DCD-1L solvated in water with 2 added Na+ counter-ions to neutralize the net negative charge of the peptide, as well as added salt (NaCl), with the salt concentrations varying from 20 mM to 500 mM. The salt simulations were carried out at 310 K. Additionally we probed the temperature dependency of DCD-1L structure by simulating a single peptide in water with 2 Na+ counter-ions at temperatures of 290 K, 300 K, 310 K and 320 K. All of the simulation trajectories were calculated using the Gromacs v.4.6.7 open-source simulation package [ 13 , 7 ].
As a starting structure for our simulations, chose the helical crystal structure of dermcidin derivative DCD-1 derived by Song et al. [15] available in the RCSB protein Data Bank (entry 2YMK). Due to the presence of missing atoms in the original model by Song et al., we constructed a homology model based on the DCD-1L sequence used in our laboratory constructs using the SWISS-MODEL automated protein structure homology-modeling server [ 3 , 10 , 2 , 6 ]. The resulting structure was then mapped to the GROMOS53A6 forcefield using the Gromacs 4.6.7 tool pdb2gmx while capping the N-terminal and C-terminal charges of the peptide.
In all simulations, the dimensions of the simulation box were cubic with a side length of 11.2 nm. The peptide was inserted and centered into the simulation box and solvated in water. For all simulations, the simple point-charge (SPC) explicit water model was used. After solvation, two of the water molecules were replaced by 2 Na+ ions to act as counter-ions and effectively neutralize the charge on the simulated system. Additionally, for simulations involving added salt, an adequate number of water molecules were replaced by an equal number of Na+ and Cl- ions to mimic the desired salt concentration of either 20 mM, 50 mM, 70 mM, 100 mM, 120 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM or 500 mM.

Contrarily, the number of Civilians does not become larger if the primitive quantity of Peasants is too big while the original number of Civilians is too small. And this is considered acceptable. Besides, as is revealed, Civilians grows fastest when the primitive ratio of Peasants and Civilians is 1.
The results in Figure 1 and Figure 3 are also in line with expectation. Figure 1 demonstrates that when the concentration of Arabinose is 40μM, Civilians cannot live without Peasants, which means the cells in the media mainly live on sucrose instead of arabinose. However, Civilians can grow alone if the concentration of arabinose is up to 100 μM. This comparison tells that 40μM is an appropriate concentration which is able to ask cells to live on sucrose but not arabinose."

The resistance to tetracycline may create a potential biohazard due to its inability to be killed with this specific antibiotic, however other types of antibiotics readily eliminate this bacteria. The ability to break down mycotoxins will benefit and not harm society.
The team has received biosafety training; all of the lab team members received independent online training created by UCSD or JCVI. It covered all of the possible issues that could arise while in the lab, ranging from using the fume hood to regulatory affairs issues.
Members of the lab team received additional official biosafety and laboratory safety training from the University of California, San Diego and J. Craig Venter Institute, and is approved by the respective Environmental Health & Safety departments. Possible hazards of microorganisms being released into the wild, methods of disaster prevention, laboratory techniques and safety precautions, and first aid measurements were all covered.

cannot cause any harm since the strain and final constructs we use are not pathogenic. Even if some sort of infection occurs, it would be minor and can be treated with a number of different antibiotics that we did not engineer resistance for in the cells. Other than possible infection, there is little risk to the environment since, as an invasive species, the cells have no special adaptations other than being resistant to tetracycline. To prevent a breach or to clean up a spill, simply treat the area with bleach or an alcohol solution. There are no security risks from malicious misuse; the bacteria again is innocuous and would not do much harm. To prevent such mistakes and containment breaches, we are sure to clean our lab stations as well as to be cautious with our mixtures and cultures.
3. Two BioBrick parts were submitted by our team this year (BBa_K2090000 and BBa_K2090001).
4. Some of our ideas about how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions include…
In order to prevent accidental spread of possible pathogenic or environmentally harmful strains of organisms, the organism could be engineered to become an auxotrophic organism; the bacteria would be largely unable to spread beyond the petri dish. This, however, might be disabled by evolutionary mechanisms, i.e. bacteria becoming able to resynthesize whatever amino acid they were engineered not to synthesize. Engineering an auxotrophic form of E. Coli might also be useful in reducing use of antibiotic resistance genes. The gene coding for an amino acid could be substituted for the antibiotic resistance gene,"

We aim to transfer the outcomes attained in laboratories to our daily lives by implementing it on a larger scale and alterations of organisms whether genetical or epigenetical is one way to do this. However this is not always possible as we cannot predict how an altered organism will adapt to the natural environment and what it’s effects on the ecosystem will be. Hence, safety and security occupy a great space of importance when it comes to devising projects for iGEM; risks must be lowered at a maximal level.
‘Two heads are better than one’ is the best saying to depict our approach on safety.  This year, we read the abstracts and e-mailed most European iGEM teams to question and discuss the safety of their projects. Scroll down to view the answers of Grenoble-EMSE-LSU and METU-Turkey. Besides collaborating, we tried to increase each teams safety by preparing them for the obvious that can be questioned. With the support of iGEM, our aim is to form a biosafety congress in the future years because synthetic biology is like a potential limitless world source to anything that can be imagined by us. If Synthetic Biology is used for the right purposes then it  serves possibilities from treating the untreatable illnesses to erasing the word poverty from our dictionaries via feeding the hungry. Yet, it can also result in mass slaughter or the production of dangerous weapons such as atomic bombs or even worse. Hence, strict rules and regulations of safety is a must in this field and ATOMS-Turkiye decided to take the first step with SynSafe to raise awareness of its importance once again.
Our mail to Grenoble IGEM team
Dear Grenoble İGEM team,
With a great project comes a great responsibility of finding the best solution  to the safety issues we encounter and most oftenly, figuring the main safety areas that needs concentrating on can be pretty difficult. This year iGEM  has introduced strict rules and regulations for safety which is a clear  indication of how much effort and importance they are expecting us to show!
So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety"

IPTG induction on IgG protease-troubleshooting
I have had trouble overexpressing IgG protease (ideS), thus I ran two coomassie gels on IPTG treated BL21 samples. The gels were prepared according to our SDS-PAGE mixtures under protocol.
The IPTG treatment was carried out as once before. As a positive control I treated bFGF in its original vector with IPTG, since I knew it has been overexpressed previously. In addition I had each sample in two versions, such as one with and one without sonication. This was to investigate if the results would have any effect of the sonication. However, I don't recommend not sonicating samples since I observed they get very viscous when loading on to gels.
Arrangement on gels:

For companies like NCOC, the elemental sulfur produced after the treatment of hydrogen sulfide is sold to overseas companies. We proposed a different solution. NCOC re-injects 80% of sour gas back into the reservoir. If this is treated with cyanobacteria and they are burned after they have carried out hydrogen sulfide reduction, then these can be turned into nanomaterials. The acid gas (hydrogen sulfide with carbon dioxide) re-injected back into the reservoir poses serious environmental problems in the future, as the widespread release of hydrogen sulfide due to the leakage of wellbores is a possibility to be considered [2]. According to NCOC’s report, their air quality monitoring stations registered a number of instances where the hydrogen sulfide concentrations exceeded the Maximum Permissible Concentrations in the Atyrau region due to leaks [3].
NCOC’s real-life applications questions helped to improve our project because many aspects of the project were discussed as if it was going to be applied in their production processes. This led us to examine the parts of the project that needed to be well thought out not only for laboratory conditions but also how it could be practiced in mass production at different conditions. Overall, this meeting with NCOC gave us valuable feedback and they look forward to collaborating with us, as they invited us to intern at their laboratories where they have all the samples we need to further assay the viability of our cyanobacteria. We also look forward to continuing this project with NCOC after the Giant Jamboree, because the possibility to decrease the environmental risks of hydrogen sulfide in our country is our priority.
EmbaMunayGas JSC (EMG)
In 1922, the company was developed for geological exploration, development of oil and gas fields as well as oil and gas production and treatment. The company exports oil along with selling it in the domestic market. Their produced gas is sold through the national gas supplying company. In June 2017, EMG launched a project for a treatment unit that will produce commodity gas and commercial granular sulfur [4]. EMG uses the LO-CAT Merichem technology for the production of elemental sulfur. LO-CAT Merichem is a system that converts hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur with the use of a chelated iron in special containers and it guarantees hydrogen sulfide removal [5]. EMG allocates funds for projects to clean historically contaminated areas for the oil sludge treatments. They use the Finnish Kalottikone Unit for the soil recycling that is later used in construction and repair of roads. The Kalott"

According to Jeffrey M. Brake et al, we found that the change of long chain phospholipid                         molecular arrangement induced the change of liquid crystal arrangement when the copper net with                         liquid crystal was covered by phospholipid molecules. According to the commonly used inducers of                         liquid crystal molecules, such as DMOAP, polyimide and other molecules, they are long chain                         structures. Therefore, we speculate that long chain molecules may affect the alignment of liquid                         crystal molecules. Therefore, we designed to increase the sensitivity of liquid crystal                         detection by modifying long chain molecules on ordinary nano-antibodies.

Based on the above principles and designs, we can construct a liquid crystal biosensor. Using a                         competitive immunoassay, we can induce the vertical homogeneous orientation of liquid crystal                         molecules by modifying self-assembled monolayers on the glass substrate to observe the changes                         of color and brightness of the liquid crystal film before and after the binding of β2-MG                         nano-antibodies to β2-MG, and design the liquid crystal through modeling. A non-labeled, highly                         sensitive and specific liquid crystal detector for β2-MG was constructed based on the                         relationship between the color and brightness of the membrane and the concentration of                         β2-MG.

The binding buffer for UnaG contains 10 mM imidazole, the washing buffer (to remove the excess protein from the column) contains 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer contains 350 mM imidazole. The column is equilibrated with 5 CV of binding buffer, afterward 25 ml of the binding buffer is mixed with the UnaG lysate and loaded onto the column. Afterwards 5 CV of wash buffer is pumped through to remove of all the excess protein still in the column. Finally the elution buffer is used and fractions are collected.

All of the fractions were then tested for the target protein using SDS-PAGE.  L - PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder, 10 to 180 kDa; 1-7 Fractions collected from IMAC Samples were boiled with 2x Laemmli Sample Buffer with DTT and 10 µL loaded on each start. The protein ladder was 5 µL, not boiled. After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destaining, the band corresponding to UnaG’s expected size (15.6 kDa) was not observed anywhere. In addition, none of the fractions fluoresced when bilirubin was added. Since sequencing confirmed that there are no mutations, and we previously managed to obtain impure functioning UnaG during the small-scale experiments of UnaG, the conclusion was that the IPTG solution was faulty and did not manage to induce the T7 promoter driven UnaG expression.

The resolution of this gel is somewhat too low to accurately size bands. We will run on a higher percentage gel later.
Elution products show nothing, but there are products after PCR amplification.
The presence of multiple bands may indicate non-specific amplification, or improper ICA.
Plan on doing temperature testing, and more troubleshooting.
Extension time was a bit short for a 9-mer."

The assembly method is the sequential addition of BabbleBricks onto a growing chain anchored by a magnetic bead. Alternating AB and BA overhangs ensures only one BabbleBrick is added on per ligation step. The anchor has a polyT tail, which base pairs with the anchor’s polyA tail. This anchor has an A overhang which allows addition of the first AB Coding BabbleBrick. Sequential addition of BabbleBricks occurs until a terminator is added. Between each addition a washing step occurs. The bead is held in place with a magnetic rack.
Once construct is compete, the DNA is meted off the magnetic bead. This can be stored as is, or digested and ligated into a phytobrick compatible plasmid:
A polyagarose gel was used to ensure the correct product has been made. Here, we can see BabbleBlocks of varying lengths corresponding to the number of BabbleBricks added together.
This can be done because BabbleBricks are defined regular lengths, so we observe regular step-wise differences.
DNA-to-Data Software
To read the stored data the DNA is sequenced. In Edinburgh we have been using Sanger sequencing because our DNA constructs have repetitive sequences. These would be difficult to assemble using short read lengths of many next generation methods. Ideally however, we would want to use nanopore technology. The MiniION has long read lengths, and can be plugged into a USB port to be used with our software with the highest convenience for the end user.
The sequence is then read by the decoding software (link again). This identified and reads the data coding regions to return the stored information.
This software can check and correct errors that may have occurred by sequencing or mutations. To demonstrate its ability, tests in silico using sequences containing a variety of possible errors were done to assess the correction rate.
In collaboration with Exeter iGEM we have explored the correcting ability of our system. We observe the potential of our error correcting mechanism facing worst case scenario sequence errors. However, as the magnitude of error increases the likelihood of it occurring decreases.

These components can be bought from any distributor, allowing  teams from across the world to build their own.
In a real-world environment using generic components would reduce production costs due to lower shipping costs by sourcing them from a nearby manufacturer and there is more competition amongst generic components. As such we can’t give direct purchasing links but you should be able to find them online easily.

Software
To minimize costs, we didn’t use a display and instead built software to interpret the results. It gives a live readout, processes results and acts as a datalogger, exporting results to a spreadsheet for further analysis. The software can be run on any computer, tablet or smartphone.
The Digispark pretends to be a keyboard, that types the results extremely quickly into the computer it’s plugged into. The interpreter software can intercept this"

Visit from Forensic Biologist Dr. Mark Benecke
Dr. Mark Benecke , a known forensic biologist not only in Germany but also worldwide, did not only work for the FBI, but also became a forensic expert for biological traces after moving back to Germany. Therefore he plays an important role in solving problems related to crime in our country.
Dr. Benecke immediately caught our attention when he gave a talk at the March for Science in Cologne, as he is an open-minded and interesting person. His research field, his profession and especially the way he teaches people about science encouraged us to invite him to our university to present our work and our lab.
Luckily, he accepted our invitation and visited us on August 27. We had a very extensive and captivating conversation with him, receiving great advice regarding our story, our project and our way of presenting ourselves. By encouraging, us he motivated us to make it to Boston and made us even more enthusiastic about iGEM. We had a lot of fun, especially when recording a video about synthetic biology and our project for the public. This way we created a funny, informative and an internationally accessible brief description of our “Trinity”.
Since Dr. Benecke is an influencer known worldwide, we hoped that synthetic biology will receive a broader public reach and engagement due to his visit to our laboratory.
Our successful meeting with Mark Benecke can be seen on the social media platform of our university and is also visible on Mark Benecke's facebook page , ensuring that synthetic biology, the idea behind iGEM and our “"

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#collaboration#podcast_-_-_TEXT.html," technological advancement has enabled us to manipulate naturally occurring systems into workhorses of great benefit to modern society. By openly discussing the issues that arise dealing with GMO we hope to remove the stigma that has surrounded the field for a long time and try to dispel any prejudices that people might have. We want to achieve this by showing the world what scientists think about the issues regarding genetic manipulation.
The Video
The video will focus on the way humans have taken advantage of the fact that microbes behave as small molecular machines. We will take a look at what makes these machines “alive” by interviewing Martin Hanczyc who is a specialist on fundamental living systems. In our interview with Martin Hanczyc we will focus on what it means that something is alive and how life is “simply” a set of chemical reactions happening under thermodynamically favourable conditions. One can not deny that the biotechnology industry is big and ever growing. One of the key players on the market is Novo Nordisk who produce insulin for diabetes patients using genetically modified organisms. We wanted to hear what a global company like Novo Nordisk has to say when faced with the ethical dilemmas that arise on the field of synthetic biology. We believe it is important to show that companies like Novo Nordisk are not just out to generate money, but are actually striving to better the lives of people around the world. We had the chance to interview Esper Boel who is vice president of the biotechnology group at Novo Nordisk and have more than 30 years of experience in the field. From our interview with Esper we learned that the people working at Novo Nordisk are dedicated and hard working on making peoples lives better. You can see the short documentary below. Enjoy.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," This means that the number of solar panels has to be increased enormously or the efficiency of the solar panels has to be improved (Wezel, 2015) .
Germany is the world's leader of photovoltaic capacity since 2005. With a total capacity of more than 35 GW, the photovoltaics contribute almost 6% to the national electricity demands. The government is planning to increase this percentage even more (Statistiek, 2015) .
Worldwide growth of the use of solar panels varies strongly by country. By the end of 2014, cumulative photovoltaic capacity increased by more than 40 GW and reached at least 178 GW. Currently, the total worldwide consumption of energy is equal to 18,400 TWh. This means that the total photovoltaic capacity is sufficient to supply 1% of the world's total electricity consumption (IEA, 2016) .
In conclusion, the solar energy market is a dynamic and growing market. There is an increasing demand for environmental friendly and renewable energy sources. It is expected that the total demand for solar panels will increase even further in coming years therefore.
Unique selling point
The unique selling point of the microlens array encapsulation layer is to offer the solar panel industry a whole new and unique method to increase the efficiency of their solar panels with at least 20%. The microlens array can be produced in an environmentally friendly way and is furthermore also expected to be cheaper than regular microlenses. Next, by using bacteria to produce microlenses, very small microlenses can be produced, which will make the arrays even more efficient.
Competitors and Substitutes
Currently the use of microlens arrays for solar panels is still in the research phase and in the solar panel industry, microlens arrays will be new and revolutionary. This means that there are no companies operating in this industry that already sell microlens arrays. However, there are still multiple possible competitors and substitutes. We distingue 3 different types of competitors, respectively the use of regular fossil fuels, solar panels with regular encapsulation layers and chemically produced microlens arrays. Alternative sustainable sources, for example wind energy and biofuels, are disregarded, because we believe that the degree of threat of these resources is limited for us.
Regular fossil fuels
Coal, oil and gas are examples of fossil fuels. These are currently the most used energy sources. For example, we use around 80.000 barrels of oil in the world per day (Index Mundi, 2015) . As described, this is very"
Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Day page, event’s final discussion proved to us that we needed to develop a software which would ease the implementation of our project goals and would also be useful for other scientists in the field. Notably, our this year’s project is extremely complex and time-consuming. Not only experiments, but also preparation for them requires outstanding precision. One of the examples of such preparations is coating of microfluidic devices. Efficient coating is not only a challenge that we faced, but rather a common limitation in microfluidic’s work. Thus previous discussion and the appropriate setting of the BioHackathon encouraged us to create LipoVision - a software tool for precise device-coating. 48 hours of coding and consultations with mentors proficient in visual recognition, laid the foundations of our software which was finished considerably shortly after the BioHackathon. It helped us save a great amount of time and what is even more impressive - LipoVision is currently being tested in our research centre, Microfluidic’s lab.
Not only did the integrated human practices help us come up with a software for our project, but also helped other iGEM and BioHackathon teams to create tools and programmes, that we and they could apply in daily laboratory work. After BioHackathon, we have spent more than a month upgrading LipoVision and only then we were able to use this tool in our daily practice. Team iGEM Lund created a search-engine which made online navigation among iGEM projects easier and immensely simplified finding of necessary BioBricks. It undoubtedly helped us a lot while doing the analysis about available and unavailable BioBricks for our project. Team „Skrebulai“ has designed a computerized system for visual recognition and analysis of DNA electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE gels. We immediately applied this tool because it demonstrated great potential to help save time. Due to all these reasons we strongly believe that these inventions will easily find many users not only among iGEMers, but also students and scientists all around different laboratories.
Even though our BioHackathon was the very first Life Sciences Hackathon organised in Lithuania, a lively interest in this event became a perfect evidence that there was a great demand for more events of this type in Lithuania.

Carbon intake is increased to 130%, we believe our system require more energy to compensate redox export (see note below).
Is there a toxic effect derived from Hydrogen production?
The Objective Function remained virtually un-altered, therefore the chassis' fitness is virtually unaffected. While it has a less efficient carbon metabolism, it is a more effective nitrogen fixator.
In fact, our chassis remains quite similar to the wild type chassis (at least metabolically speaking...), to the point where there are only around 20 different reactions between the two (16 without the 4 reactions that make up the H2 pathway). These 16 reactions for the TransGenic are beyond one order of magnitude different from their WildType counterparts. As a side note, when we used a >1% difference decision threshold, we found over 105 reactions. However, we believe that the order of magnitude logic is more relevant to a biological context of metabolic reactions. Therefore, our final networks looks like this:
Our synthetic pathway appears in the top left section. The center holds carbon metabolism, and the periphery has some miscellaneous reactions...
Note: We believe thus due to the results of our different models. While the Main model produced maximal hydrogen and maximal OF, the rest of the submodels produced markedly less hydrogen and OF. The only way to restore maximal efficiency was to re-introduce the H2 sink, that is to remove H2 from the system. The key point in this is the removal of something from the chassis. Since H2 is made up of 2 protons and 2 electrons (or reduced H+) that species had to be either protons or electrons. Since Nitrogen fixation remained very high, and said reaction consumes protons, the mystery species had to be electrons. In other words, redox potentials.

UCSF,2010,Team:UCSF#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," joined iGEM because I knew it would be a great chance to actually do some real lab work before college, and also because I really liked the basic idea for the project that got pitched to us in May.  As of right now a four year degree from Davis is all that I am certain about; as for medical school or graduate school, I'd certainly like to go but you never know what will happen in the future.  I played football for three years in high school but currently have no plans to play in college.  I'm looking forward to presenting at the Jamboree and hope to learn a lot while I'm there.
Crystal Liu
Hello! I'm Crystal Liu, and I am currently an undergraduate at UC Davis majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I first heard about the UCSF iGEM team as a freshman in high school, and decided that it was an experience I really wanted to be a part of at the end of my senior year. Four years later, I made it onto the team! I definitely had one of the best summers of my life. Working in a lab really opened my eyes to the world of research and helped me understand firsthand why progress and results aren't immediate. In addition to labwork, I am extremely grateful to have met all the amazing people from the Lim Lab & CPL, as well as everyone else who contributed their impressive skills and knowledge to the 2010 UCSF iGEM team. :) On a side note, I love expensive chocolate.
Sam Zorn
Although am still a senior at Abraham Lincoln High School, I am an active participant on the iGEM team. Lab work has been my passion for the last few years of my life. When I was picked for the iGEM team, I was ecstatic. Since that day I have been committed to working as hard as I could to make our project successful.  iGEM has given me a real world career experience that has helped me decide on my academic path. The field of synthetic biology has appealed to me greatly, and this summer that I spent at iGEM has more than fulfilled my expectations. I hope that my summer here will not only help me get into college, but also help kick start my career as a bench researcher. When i'm neither working in the labs nor at school, I enjoy getting out and being active. My favorite sports are soccer, and parkour, although I also like to run track, swim, and spar in various martial arts.

Operational sequence:
The supernatants (~1l in total) of the two previous experiments were pooled and put into a rotary evaporater in order to acquire a concentrate of approximately 100ml.
The settings of the rotary evaporater: ~160 millibars, waterbath temperature of 25-30°C
Furthermore, there were measures to be taken to protect the solution from direct sunlight: blinds down, aluminum foil wrapped around the waterbath
Afterwards we transfered the Methanol solution into a separating funnel and added another 100ml of aqua dest..
By means of adding chloroform we created two phases. The lower (chloroform) phase with the solved Phycocyanobilin was separated and put into another rotary evaporater flask. This step was repeated three times in order to get all the Phycocanobilin into the next step
Then the chloroform was completely removed in the rotary evaporater (same settings as before), the pure (?) Phycocyanobilin in the flask was solved in 60 ml DMSO, transfered into a new flask and frozen at -20 °C.
Picking of transformated (pGADT7 and pGBKT7) E.coli cells on antibiotic selection plates
Investigator: Jeff
Aim of the experiment: pGADT7 and pGBKT7 are plasmids containing the transcriptional activation domain or the DNA binding domain of the transcription activator Gal4. pGADT7 contains the transcriptional activation domain of gal4; we want to clone the the first 100 residues of Pif3 (BBa_K365000) into this plasmid. As a result we have a fusion contruct of Gal4 and Pif3, which is nescassary for the light-switchable promoter system. pGBKT7 is for backup, if the ordered biobricks are not working.
Operational sequence:
A E. coli colony was picked for each plasmid and was transferred in a tube containing 4 ml of LB-medium containing antibiotics (Amp for pGADT7 and Kan for pGBKT7).

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," is a question of understanding the evolution of the high frequency component of the signal during the superposition of action potentials. Finally, the extracellular action potential will be estimated using the homogeneous and isotropic model.
Figure 10: Histology of a nerve [8]
Figure 11: Random model of complete nerve with one elliptic fascicle[4].
It can be observed that the fascicles are roughly elliptical. Our nerve model is therefore based on an assembly of elliptical fascicles. The shape (round, rectangular, etc.), the dimensions of the nerve and the number of fascicles being determined, the forms and positions of the fascicles inside the nerve are fixed randomly. A fascicle is itself built by placing many fibers close to each other, positions and types of these fibers are also generated randomly (according to a uniform law).
Figure 12: Example of spatial extracellular action potential along a fascicle. For two distances: ρ0=200 μm (solid line) and ρ0=500 μm (dotted line)[9].
The extracellular action potentials for the configuration described in figure 11 are presented in figure 12 for observation sites (M1 and M2). One being close to the fascicle (ρ0=200 μm), and the other being further away (ρ0=500 μm).
We can verify some similarities with the study done on a single fiber. We can first see the existence of high spatial frequency components for small distances (ρ0 = 200 μm). Then at greater distances (ρ0=500 μm), these variations are substantially attenuated, and to a lesser extent the low frequency component of the action potential. This observation validates our proposal to observe the effect of Ranvier nodes for action potentials of fascicles. We can see that the peak-to-peak amplitude of the HSF component of this signal is of the order of 10 μV (noted VppHF in figure 12). These considerations lead us to believe that this HSF component, a consequence of the activity of the fascicles, will be measurable on the surface of the nerve.
VI. Neural information:
The neural information is coded by the frequency of the impulses of the action potentials and the number of fibers recruited. The shape and amplitude of the action potentials collected do not convey any neural information but only information on the distance where the nerve fiber is located in the nerve.
In the same nerve, several types of information transit. The nerve carries efferent neuronal signals, from the central nervous system to the peripheral nervous system, which regulates and control the body's natural"
