Scientists Move Closer to Inventing Artificial Life
科学家真的做出了人造生命？
It is reported that an international team has inserted a man-made chromosome into brewer's yeast, producing a life form that thrives and successfully passes the designer genes on to its off spring.
据报道，一支由各国科学家组成的科研队伍近日将人造染色体成功导入啤酒酵母（我们常喝的青岛啤酒、珠江啤酒都是由靠这种重要的可食用菌发酵产生的哦!!!）内，创造出了可以独立健康成长并可将改造后的基因传给子孙后代的一种生命体形式。这一实验结果意味着人类在创造生命的路途上迈出了重要的第一步。下面我们就来具体看看这一全新生命体是如何被创造出来的。
Chromosomes are the packages for genes. In plants, animals, and fungi like yeast, they are contained within a cell nucleus, which simpler microbes like bacteria do not have. People have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and yeasts have 16. Best known for their role in baking bread and brewing beer, yeasts share about a third of their genes with people.
染色体是基因的集中体。在植物、动物和真菌等真核生物中，染色体存在于细胞核中；而在简单低等的原核生物如细菌，染色体和细胞核都是不存在的。相对于人类的23对染色体，用于酿酒和制作面包的酵母只有16对，并且酵母基因的三分之一都是人类基因中可以找到的。

Explore HUMAN PRACTICES
Overview
Problem Identification
Idea Generation
Designing the System
Prototype Building
The building of CAT-Seq characterization system was a highly dynamic process in which our team and selected stakeholders engaged in a year long dialog, which has allowed us to precisely identify the most vital obstacles holding back the field of synthetic biology, helped us to ask the right questions which led to the idea of CAT-Seq and enabled the constant iteration and improvement of the system design throughout the year.
That is why we see the Human Practices as the most important part of our engineering process and overall project. Therefore, as You travel along the Human Practices timeline you will find different sections that correspond to the different engineering stages our project was at that time.
We strongly suggest to read the design section first, as it will help to fully appreciate the story of how the final design came to be.

This personal research conducted on the site [www.ebay.com] demonstrated.
Although in most cases the bio-pirates have no intent to defraud, some persons pursue less noble goals:
Many conferences on biosafety have highlighted the need to develop new techniques to reduce the risk of bio-terror.
The first is simply to give a sense of responsibility to companies delivering genes by command. They have to verify the recipient of synthesized genes and also the type of genes required (compared with the genomes of known viruses and their toxins). However this cannot be set up in SMEs because it requires great financial resources that reduce the net profits of the company.
The second is the research of defense strategies to fight against bio-terrorism.
A final technique would also list all machines that can help to synthesize new genes, even if it is costly in time and financial resources.

Conclusion
In society today, many people are favorable to reduce and regulate the practice of synthetic biology until all risks are identified and excluded in accordance with the principle of precaution. However the application of this principle highlights a paradox, which harms innovation:
To use the techniques of synthetic biology, all risks must be known and controlled. But these risks cannot be determined if we do not progress by practicing synthetic biology. This is what the precautionary principle refuses because synthetic biology is not yet reliable.
The precautionary principle refuses innovation, as long as there is the slightest risk.
Conversely, the principle of responsibility can focus its work on the most serious risk after having considered all the risks. It is a conceivable solution to establish regulations; it allows pursuing researches despite uncontrolled risks.

Mycobacterium avium subtype avium
Mycobacterium avium subtype avium is rarely responsible for serious infections in humans. As Willy Rozenbaum (co discoverer of HIV) said at our ethical debate, ""is a bacterium that is very ubiquitous, it is found in faucet water, we are almost all contaminated.
Mycobacterium avium is ""safe"" for the environment and also for healthy people. Indeed, if there is an infection, it is localized in the organism. Conversely, infection is more global for immunodepressed patients (due to HIV for example). The effects of infection are, of course, to analyze in different phenotypes (healthy, tumor, immunodepressed) to investigate the benefit / risk balance for the patient.
Moreover, our Mycobacterium does not subsist in the organism."

Piotr is a very nice guy, full of energy but he currently betrayed us and moved to Edinburgh for Masters in the department of Infectious diseases. He is passionate about some quality wine and jazz chilled nights. But what he really enjoys is some long hiking trips in the middle of nowhere. He knows everything and always dresses smart even in pyjamas. He is very ambitious and am looking forward to sit next to him when he will get his Nobel Prize.

Harindi’s a wonderful microbiologist who genuinely enjoys human practices research (except where Piotr’s involved). She enjoys socialising with the group and if you ask her really nicely, she’ll bring you some of her fantastic cooking (which she’d weirdly rather not eat herself). She’s from Sri Lanka and is one of the most patient people we know (except when Piotr leads her to put coffee in her water bottle).

ACSE students can be quite timid sometimes, but I am trying to improve my social skills, so if you see me at the Jamboree, don’t be afraid to give me a big ol’ hug and help me get over my fear of human contact. If I’m not at library, I am probably out with my iGEM friends or shooting some pictures with my very expensive camera, or maybe even playing some jams on my guitar.

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," active sites of E1 and E2, thus preventing the intermediate from diffusing away. The intermediate is then turned into a product.
There are also two diverse types of intermediate channeling in a two-step metabolic pathway next to direct channeling: proximity channeling and enzyme clustering. For proximity channeling two enzymes are needed, that are positioned close to each other. The intermediate product of the first enzyme is processed by a second enzyme before it can escape due to its drift by diffusion. Proximity channeling therefore occurs when enzymes are colocalized on a scaffold. The processing of a diffusing substrate only becomes likely in the case that the substrate approaches the catalytic site of an enzyme within a radius of about 0.1 - 1 nm. This can be problematic, because the intermediate that is produced by the first member of an enzyme pair is unlikely to be processed by the second member even if the active sites of the two enzymes are just as much as about 10 nm apart.
Figure 2: The mechanism of proximity channeling. E1 and E2 are positioned near enough to each other such that the intermediate produced by E1 is processed by E2 before it can escape by diffusion. No actual channel is needed. Close proximity of the enzymes is crucial for proximity channeling.
An alternative way to achieve metabolic channeling is the assembly of multiple copies of both upstream and downstream enzymes into a functional cocluster (‘agglomerate’). The probability that the intermediate will be processed by one of the many downstream enzymes in the agglomerate can be very high. For example, there could be two consecutive enzymes in a pathway present at high concentration in the same region of space, leading to a high processing probability. This way coclustering of multiple enzymes into compact agglomerates accelerates the processing of intermediates, yielding the same efficiency benefits as direct channeling.
Figure 3: The mechanism of enzyme clustering. Once E1 produces an intermediate molecule, even though the probability of the intermediate being processed by any individual E2 enzyme is low, the probability that the intermediate will be processed by one of the many E2 enzymes in the agglomerate can be high.
Another attempt to increase the effective concentration of the components of a pathway of interest could be the construction of synthetic protein scaffolds which spatially recruit metabolic enzymes in a designable manner.
On the scaffold the interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins are localized, recruiting the pathway enzymes specifically. These enzymes are tagged with their related peptide ligands. This increases the effective concentrations of metabolic intermediates, while preventing their accumulation to toxic levels."

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," also continued exploring and researching the Arduino Uno's functions as well as continuing to look into different designs of a device and how we would improve production to produce a low cost but effective device.  Potential ideas have suggested to have a device that uses disposable strips for individual tests to reduce costs, while other models suggest effective technology such as microfluidics.  In coming weeks we plan to continue research and talking to professors about the benefits and drawbacks of these potential prototypes.  Using quantitative modelling in the future we will be able to effectively design such a device so that it operates at its greatest potential.  Additionally we want to look into what our system will use as a reporter, and how we will determine a threshold for the signal of the device
Week 4: May 26th - May 30th
This week was primarily focused on the use of Autodesk Maya and learning the functions of the program.  Initially Maya 2015 was downloaded, however due to compatibility issues 2013 will downloaded in the coming weeks to work effectively with the various plugins.  Tutorials were performed to learn the basic functions of modelling and animation of the program.  Using this knowledge we would be able to eventually use this programming to model the proteins of the project.  Additionally we continued to look into potential sensors that could be compatible with the Arduino Uno and what other designs could be used for a device.  As all team members are familiar with using Maya for modelling, we are planning on using the animation features to visually illustrate the biological processes that are occurring within the device when it is in use.  This will help to better explain the project through visual aspects and can cause a greater curiosity and interest in the device.  This shows the melding of biology and engineering and can communicate our system to viewers from all backgrounds with different levels of knowledge and perspective.  Learning all of the skills of Maya will be an ongoing process throughout the summer, however a focus was placed on developing basic skills this week as there is a large learning curve.
Week 5: June 2nd - June 6th
This week we continued using Maya for modelling and animation purposes.  We also began to explore and refresh our memories using Autodesk AutoCad and Inventor for design purposes, as well as downloading matlab for quantitative modelling.  Although we currently don’t have all of the necessary data for some of the proposed models, we are currently examining the software to see how we would create these models when the data becomes available.  We are continuing to gain more knowledge of Maya, Autocad and Matlab we will be prepared to create quantitative and visual models. This week"

Solution
In order to combat excess fluoridation of water in third world countries, we envision solutions that utilize the recently discovered fluoride riboswitch, a structured piece of RNA that kind interact with fluoride and regulate the expression of a downstream gene. We envision technologies utilizing fluoride riboswitches that can be used to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in water. We think these strategies can be used in cell-free and cell based systems. However, before we can work on developing these technologies we first needed to better characterize the responsiveness of fluoride riboswitches and develop a way to select for riboswitches with a higher responsiveness to fluoride.
Introduction
The Impacts of Excess Fluoride:
Fluoride is present in all bodies of water. Within the oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater, the mineral is existent and the extent to which fluoride is present depends on the amount of sediments or volcanic rocks being eroded in the area. It is when fluoride concentrations are at the toxic level when health concerns can arise. The FDA recommends that fluoride concentrations in water do not exceed 0.7mg/mL, while the World Health Organization (WHO) limit is 1.5mg/L, and the Environmental Protection Agency designation for contaminated water is 4 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations at or above 1 mg/kg of body weight are deemed poisonous. Ingesting this amount in one sitting requires immediate medical attention. While constantly being exposed to 10 mg/L to 6 mg of fluoride everyday can lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis, in which the teeth and bones decay and deform. More severely, doses above 4.5 mg/kg body weight can cause developmental and reproductive concerns. Therefore fluoride concentrations can affect the growth and the IQ of people. In countries like China, India, and Sri Lanka, water sources are decentralized and residents in some areas experience concentrations of fluoride as high as 30 mg/L (Figure 1).

In July 1999, Dr. Jacob joined the   Department of Computer Science (Faculty of Science) at the University   of Calgary. Since August 2003, he also holds a joint appointment with   the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Faculty of   Medicine), where he is the Director of Bioinformatics in the Bachelor   of Health Sciences Program.
Dr. Jacob leads the Evolutionary & Swarm Design (E&SD) research group   of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and is currently   establishing a Unit for Computational Modeling, Experimental Design & Analysis within the Faculty of Medicine.
Dr. Jacob and his research group are investigating how to apply   evolutionary, swarm and collective intelligence techniques in various   application domains. So far, the E&SD research group has built   mathematical models, computer simulations and visualizations of   traffic systems, army ants, neuron growth, biomolecular systems, and   gene regulatory systems. Some of the projects are described in detail   at the ESD website: http://www.swarm-design.org .
Dr. Jacob has written two books on evolutionary computing and natural   programming paradigms: Principia Evolvica (dpunkt, Heidelberg, 1997;   in German) and Illustrating Evolutionary Computation with Mathematica   (Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 2001).
This is the third year that Dr. Jacob is an iGEM  supervisor at the University of Calgary.
Dr. Anders Nygren
I am an Assistant Professor in the Centre for Bioengienering Research & Education and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. This is the first summer I have been involved in iGEM and I think it is fair to say that I have learned more from the process than anyone has learned from me! I am already looking forward to next year, hoping that we can get more Biomedical Engineering students involved in iGEM at the U of C. The Biomedical Engineering Program here is only a few years old, but we already have a great momentum going with lots of great students.
Outside work? What else would you do around Calgary than spend time in the Rockies hiking, skiing, paddling, cycling, and just enjoying life?

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
The model should impact your project design in a meaningful way. Modeling may include, but is not limited to, deterministic, exploratory, molecular dynamic, and stochastic models. Teams may also explore the physical modeling of a single component within a system or utilize mathematical modeling for predicting function of a more complex device.
Please see the 2018  Medals Page for more information.

INSIDE MECHANISM
Under normal circumstance, the plasmid numbers are above the threshold, the inhibitor concentration is high enough to completely repress the activity of in-promoter. Considering the effect of plasmids segregational instability, the concentration of plasmids in some cells will decline with time going on. With no intervention, these cells will gradually become slackers as well as the predominant strain among the population. In our project, when the plasmid numbers are below the threshold, the decrease of inhibitor proteins will lead to the increase of in-promoter activity. At this time, the killer gene will express and kill the cell. We define that, when the killer expressed is just able to kill the cell, the plasmid numbers is the threshold we've talked about. Based on this, we concluded that when the plasmid numbers are above the threshold, the bacteria can survive and have high working efficiency. This range is called survival range. To prevent the slackers consume a lot of nutrition, we kill it when the range removes to the dead one.
In this way, we can optimize the general population structure through plasmid-numbers-maintenance.
Fig.2 With the decrease of plasmid numbers, the concentration of repressor will reduce to a threshold. According, in-promoter activity will rise up and star the transcription of killer gene.
Threshold device
The most critical factor in our system is the inhibitor concentration since it controls the switch of our killer system. Thus we need to prove that the in-promoter will have different responses corresponding to different concentrations of inhibitor.
We combined the wet experiment results with the mathematical model to measure the final result. [know more about our model]
First Step
Since it's hard to control the plasmid numbers, we employed the arabinose induced PBAD promoter. The plasmid numbers is stable in short time. By adding different concentration of arabinose, we can simulate the production of inhibitors with different concentration. In this way, we can see the downstream in-promoter stay in the corresponding statues. RFP is used to replace the killer gene for simplifying our wet experiment. To expand the application of our system, we choose two combinations of inhibitor and in-promoter.
Goal
(1) Build two parallel circuits employing different inhibitor proteins
(2) Find the relationship between the inhibitor and in-promoter
(3) Find out the initial thresholds by measuring RFP intensity
(4) Provide experimental data for modeling part

As a Visual Designer , the most of my work is , well, design. However, design is not only making fancy stuff, but also playing an important role to convey ideas. iGEM provides me opportunities to communicate with people from different fields. On the other hand, it promote our creativity on synthetic biology. In my opinion, all of us are designer, we design better product for the future.

I join in this team when I was a freshman because of the curiosity about synthetic biology and iGEM. Although I major in computer science and don't have any biology background, I will never retreat. This is a huge challenge to me, but the secret of synthetic biology quite attract me this is the power that made me conquer the difficulty on the way."
Lambert_GA,2015,Team:Lambert GA#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," large engineered proteins have difficulty folding properly in the periplasm so we needed to address the issue using different placement of promoters.
The first design we call the bicistronic construct. We engineered the pelB tag and CDA under TetR promotion and the GFP under a lac inducible promoter. Having only the pelB tag and CDA in the periplasm would hopefully eliminate the difficulty with a 2000bp gene folding properly in the space. The GFP as a reporter would just let us know our transformations were successful and we could choose colonies for colony PCR using the color selection. The introduction of two independent genes however could have been a drain on the cell leading to early cell death.
The second design of the bidirectional is a way to use just a repressible promoter of TetR, but have the transcription of the two genes occur independently in opposite directions. There are several commercial plasmids that use bidirectional promoters to accomplish multi gene expression. This construct proved very problematic as we were ordering the gBlocks from IDT. Because the back to back promoter sequences were likely to form hairpin structures we had to order this in two parts using a multiple cloning site as a linker between the two TetR promoters.
The last construct of our project was a fusion protein consisting pf the pelB leader sequence, CDA and GFP all under the promotion of one TetR promoter. The benefit we aimed for with this sequence would be the ability to visualize the GFP in the periplasm of the cells. The large size though of the protein could lead to folding difficulties and then a complete loss of expression of either genes; CDA or GFP.
Our project, if successful, could lead to two significant advances, the first being a more environmentally friendly way to produce chitosan. Using engineered E.coli cells, we named Chitinite, to create to useful products of chitosan and acetic acid from waste shrimp shells would help save coastal ecosystems. A second significant contribution to science is our Biobricked bidirectional promoter system. This can help scientists with dual gene expression.
Another highlight of our efforts was a Discovery Dialogue held in partnership with the Atlanta Science Festival. We brought together on one stage, in an open forum; a legislator, ethicist, immunologist, FBI agent and scientist. The public was invited to ask questions and the concluding polls showed both an increase in the positive perception of synthetic biology, but also a request to hold another session this coming year.

InterLab
Reproducibility is the ability to recompute data, by following the exact same protocol and analysis methods of an experiment. The replicability or repeatability of a study is the chance that an independent experiment targeting the same scientific question will produce consistent results. Consistent findings from independent investigators and laboratories are the primary means by which scientific evidence accumulates for or against a hypothesis (Leek and Peng 2015). To maintain the integrity of scientific research and the public's trust in science, the scientific community must ensure reproducibility and replicability by engaging in wide-range interlaboratory studies. One such study is the International InterLab measurement study organized by Jacob Beal et al.
The InterLab study has been a part of the iGEM competition for four years, with 2017 being the fourth year, where teams participating in the competition can join in the effort to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole. The aim of this study is to develop a robust measurement procedure for the quantification of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and thereby provide researchers with a detailed protocol and data analysis form which yields absolute and interlaboratory - comparable units for GFP measurement.
This year, the fourth International InterLab Measurement Study aims to establish a standard GFP measurement protocol based on engineering principles that any lab with a plate reader can use. The procedure involves the measurement of GFP expressed by E.coli DH5α which has been transformed"

Thus, it is not warranted to say that the synthetic entities follow a ‘human aim’. Moreover, this analysis allows a clear distinction between machines and living beings, making the expression ‘living machine’ necessarily a metaphor.

Ninth meeting - Conclusion and ethics
Finally, we discussed in our last meeting about the implications of our epistemological analysis for the synthetic biology and for society. In addition we studied different ethical approaches and tried to apply them to the products of synthetic biology ([16],[17],[24],[25]). Many of the approaches failed to justify if the synthesised entities have a moral status or not, revealing the necessity of novel bioethical theories. Some of our team members sympathises with Sune Holm’s biocentric view, because he also refers to the organisational account of biological functions for the foundation of his position ([17],[25]). Some other team members believe that the notion of a ‘natural purpose’ and the naturalisation of teleology and normativity (as the organisational account does) need further examination.

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," no one has ever tried to explore its potential in the context of synthetic biology  before. Although this makes the project very challenging, in the sense that we have very little groundwork in the literature to build on, the potential applications - including use in real-time response biosensors and structurally coloured commercial display screens - could be groundbreaking. The openness of the field also gives us an opportunity to delve into the unknown and even participate in primary research. We think it's worth the risk!

SYSU-China,2013,Team:SYSU-China#Safety#Human practice_-_-_TEXT.html," spreading."" The program is designed to give communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level.
TEDxSYSU was authorize by TED, and has held many TEDx talks in the campus of Sun Yat-sen University. In order to spread the concept of synthetic biology and share some of our ideas, our wet lab team and SYSU software team decided to held a TEDx talk with the assistance of TEDxSYSU.
>Overview
This activity is not only a TEDxSYSU talk, but also a Salon about synthetic biology. It was held right before the start of the new semester in a comfortable meeting room, which can accommodate about 40 people. There were three speakers who gave 18 minutes talk respectively. We talked about synthetic biology and its safety concern. We also talk about non-coding RNA, which is a hot topic and important issue in biology. The audiences and the speakers shared their ideas about synthetic biology. Not only is it a good chance to spread the concepts of synthetic biology and iGEM, but also provided us a way to get to know what people think about synthetic biology and iGEM.
>More details
1.before the speakers gave the talks
We showed a TED speech from John Craig Venter in order to inspire the audience. Then we begin our TEDx activity. What the host said about synthetic biology made the audience lost in thought. She said: ""Will synthetic biology be positive to the development of our society or will it be the Pandora box that we should not open?"" With a question like that, we begin our interesting journey of exploring synthetic biology.
2. non-coding RNA will become an important tool
The first speaker Zheng Lingling is a lecturer of our university. She introduced knowledge of non-coding RNA to the audience. As we know, ncRNA is a hotspot in scientific research nowadays. People found that ncRNA play an important role in regulating gene expression. Because ncRNA is the regulator of a living system, we can use them to regulate the artificial system we designed. As the mechanism of ncRNA gradually revealed, the way of applying ncRNA in synthetic biology will become more diversified.
3. An introduction about synthetic biology
The second speaker is our team leader Sun Mengyi, who gave us an enthusiastic speech about molecular biology and synthetic biology. At the beginning of the speech, he talked about some interesting story in the history of molecular biology. After that, he gave a brief introduction about synthetic biology and showed some examples about it.

Due to safety concerns, we were unable to use Pgt in the lab and engineered S. cerevisiae EBY100 to also produce AvrSr35 which would normally come from the fungus to be detected and the Sr35 and AvrSr35 interaction occurs within one cell. When our engineered yeast are used in the field, AvrSr35 will be unable to enter the inside of the cell, so Sr35 will need to be expressed on the cell wall. To do this, we propose a construct that combines our Aga2 and Sr35 parts. With this design, the AvrSr35 can interact with Sr35 on the cell surface and produce a fluorescent signal.
Wild-type avirulence factors found in Pgt will not contain the nYFP tag, introducing limitations to this step of our project. In order to be used in the field, the system must be able to produce a fluorescent signal without a component on the avirulence factor and hopefully, with increased research, Sr35 could be modified differently to produce a signal when activated without tagging AvrSr35.
Currently, our project is only capable of determining the virulence of the race of Pgt present to Sr35. We hope that as more resistance protein’s genes are sequenced and the interactions with their corresponding avirulence factors are studied, the concepts of our project and our device can be expanded to other common resistance genes.

IPTG effect on growth
Absorbance calibration
Aim
To produce a calibration curve to aid in the normalising of absorbance values.  The relation of absorbance reading to number of cells varies with different cell strains. We are therefore doing one for Top-10.
Assay
Cultures of the E.coli with the relevant vector are grown to various cell densities. A sample of these cultures are taken and a dilution plate is carried out to work out approximate colony forming units per ml of culture. This data set is then combined with absorbance readings to create a graph relating the number of colony forming cells per ml to their absorbance measurements.
This curve then allows us to convert absorbance of a known volume of culture to colony forming units within the culture sample.
Aims
Measure growth rates at 28 degrees Celsius on minimal growth media so that subsequent testing timings etc. can be streamlined
Determine the effect of IPTG toxicity on growth w/o any protein production complications
Assay
Normal cells (without any constructs) will be grown on M9 media until OD=0.7.
IPTG of various concentrations will then be added, and the OD of the cells will be followed over time
Equipment
Multi-plate reader
15ml falcon tubes

To improve the ferritins capability to direct metal ions to its inside and to increase its ability to form gold and silver nanoparticles, we constructed a mutated version of the human ferritin heavy chain (HUHF) ( BBa_K2638999 ). Following Christopher A. Butts et al. (2008) we removed reactive cysteine and histidine residues from exterior of the HUHF and added additional cysteine residues at the interior. This way the production of nanoparticles at the exterior surface is prevented or at least decreased.
Figure 2: Alignment of the protein sequences of the wild-type and the mutated human ferritin heavy chain. The Alignment was produced with Clustal Omega (Goujon et al., 2010, Sievers et al., 2011).
In Figure 2 the amino acid sequence alignment of the wild type human ferritin and the mutated human ferritin is shown. The exterior residues C91R, C103A, C131S, H14D and H106Q, and the interior residues E65C, E141C, E148C, K87Q and K144C were mutated. The mutations have no influence on the structure of the ferritin as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Protein structures of the wild-type human ferritin (A, RCSB ID 4oYN) and the mutated human ferritin (B, RCSB ID 3ES3). Despite the mutations of ten amino acids the ferritin retains its shape. The protein structeres were generated with Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004).

WEEK 21
Oct 24 2013 - Oct 30 2013
Goals:
Our main goal is to finalize Wiki for World Jamboree and to collect data for any major experiments we still need to wrap up. We also need to begin our poster for the Jamboree and work on our presentation. At the same time, there is a ton of wetlab and experiments that we have planned, all of which are unlikely to get done in the next couple weeks, but that won't stop us from trying. We have several presentations with various labs at Penn, including the epigenetics department this week.
Achievements:
This week we finished the Wiki for World Competition. Additionally, we began our last set of experiments, for which the data will be revealed at the World Jamboree.

Collaborations
We created a magazine called iGEM LATAM with the collaboration of the Latin american teams: TecCEM, TecMonterrey_GDL, iGEM Ecuador, iGEM Tec Chihuahua 2018, iGEM Tec-Monterrey, USP-EEL-Brazil and ColegioFDR_Peru. Inside the magazine there is information about the teams, the projects that were developed by them during the year and the difficulties that arose as well as tourist information and many other interesting things about the participating countries. This was the second edition of iGEM LATAM, since our first one was published last year in our wiki. From our first edition, we learned many things and we also found some things that could be improved. During a meeting with Karina and Regina from the ColegioFDR_Peru team, in which we exchanged information about our projects to seek for a possible collaboration, the subject of our magazine came up and we asked them if their team would be interested in participating to which they agreed to. They also let us know that they wanted to write and publish a magazine called “Journal of FDR Science”. When they told us about this idea, we were very excited and gave them tips and advice on how to design the magazine for it to be more aesthetically pleasing (keeping in mind what the final reader of the magazine would like to see), considering if the final language of the magazine should be english or spanish and if it was going to be a digital version or a printed one. We also made corrections of the drafts they shared with us that provided information about their project, the health effects resulting from mercury contamination and lab safety.
Additionally we collaborated with the Hong_Kong-CUHK team because we realized that they were working with an aptamer and lyophilization in their project called “RAPID”. We exchanged information about our projects and the Hong"

Once the bacteria escape the closed bioreactor, the biosensor will turn on the suicide gene and destroy the engineered bacteria.
Besides the above effort mentioned, their participants are also well trained and their experimental procedure are safely conducted as well. The iGEM 2012 Calgary team is required to attend biosafety courses and Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) training sessions. Their bacterial strains and samples all follow biosafety regulation and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). They all use safe, non-pathogenic bacterial strain of E. coli for gene-characterizing and gene-testing, which is commonly used in lab worldwide.
2012 Paris Bettencourt
The main goal of Paris Bettencourt iGEM 2012 team is trying to overcome the safety concern on horizontal gene transfer. Many iGEM team had promote ingenious ideas among various fields of synthetic biology application, however many projects also face the problem of horizontal gene transfer if applying to the real world.
Therefore, Paris Bettencourt 2012 team come up with a project, bWARE, to tackle with the risk of horizontal gene transfer. Their design consists of three major mechanism in order to deal with this obstacle; and they chose AgrEcoli, a nitrate biosensor, as their hypothetical case study material.
The first part of their safety design is a physical container called alginate capsules, a type of polymer gel. It aims to totally entrap the bacteria within it, so there will be no iGEM designed bacteria released to the environment. The second design is a semantic containment, which prevents gene expression in wild type bacteria. Paris Bettencourt iGEM 2012 team used an amber codon embedded in protein genes to prevent their expression in wild type bacteria and an amber suppressor system in their genetically engineered bacteria to maintain its targeted function. The third part of it is a delayed population-level suicide system through a complete genome degradation of the whole population. They coupled their toxin anti-toxin suicide system with a delay system, which will allow the cell to perform its intended function before the DNA-degrading suicide machinery is expressed. By realizing the gradually dilution of regulatory transcription factor and the special use of stationary-phase specific promoter, they can delay the activation of the suicide system composed of a restriction enzyme and an anti-toxin plasmid, which together will destroy the whole engineered genome when the time comes.
With these three levels of safety design, their studies and wet lab experiments showed convincing result that many of their design do work; and"

Endosome detection operon
Fig 3. Overview of endosomal detection operon. It is composed of cro – antirepressor from phage λ, tetR – repressor of tetracycline resistance operon, cI – repressor from phage λ and cfp – Cyan Fluorescent Protein.
Low endosomal pH and low concentration of metal ions lead to decrease the likelihood of transmembrane receptor kinase phoQ binding its ligands – divalent cations. This enables the phosphorylation of phoP by phoQ. Phosphorylated phoP activates the gene expression from MgtC promoter leading to production of proteins encoded by endosome detection operon. cI protein inactivates the invasion operon. TetR protein activates cytoplasmic operon. Not all genes encoded by cytoplasmic operon are expressed in endosome, due to the presence of cro box sequence, which binds cro protein thus stopping the trancription Cro protein is encoded by endosome detection operon. After bacterium escapes into cytoplasm the endosome detection operon genes are no longer expressed, since phoP is not phosphorylated in cytoplasmic conditions. The process can be monitored using CFP fluorescence protein.
The cytoplasmic operon.
Fig 4. Overview of endosomal detection operon. It is composed of YFP – Yellow Fluorescent Protein, tetR – repressor of a tetracycline resistance operon, cro box regulatory sequence from phage and λ desired genes and genes specific for desired function of bacterial strain. In this case p53 – apoptosis inducer.
Cytoplasmic operon, like the invasion operon, is a bistable switch. The regulatory elements are: synthetic promoter inhibited by TetR, promoter inhibited by araC, araC protein (inactivated by L-arabinose) and TetR protein (repressor of tetracycline resistance gene inactivated by tetracycline). [18] This switch controls genes expressed in the cytoplasm. Cro box confines the gene expression to the cytoplasm only. Cro protein bound to it stops the transcription while the endosome detection operon is expressed. The yellow florescence protein is expressed to allow detection of the cytoplasmic operon activity. The set of genes in the cytoplasmic operon depends on the desired functionality of bacterial strain."

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," sciences,” referring to how we were combining synthetic biology with plant sciences - two fields which typically do not interact in academia. Dr. Pineros area of expertise is in abiotic stresses and ROS production. He suggested we study root biology in hydroponics and measure the ROS production in treated vs. untreated plants for our testing. Furthermore, he gave us important feedback on containment: he suggested we use some sort of filter to contain the flow of nutrients in one direction and keep the bacteria separate from the plants. This manifested in the dialysis tubing we used to contain our bacteria. Moreover, his hydroponic set-up gave us some in-person contact with the type of system we wanted OxyPonics to be utilized for. This helped us understand firsthand what might work in such an environment, to build on the recommendations and suggestions provided through grower interviews.
JULY 6, 2017
Dr. Philip Benfey
After speaking with Dr. Pineros, we wanted more information about root systems and root biology. Dr. Roeder suggested we reach out to Dr. Benfey in Duke’s Department of Biology, who helped us learn about roots and ROS in root systems. He mentioned that our project was venturing into little-researched territory, and that the results could have important results on hydroponic crop growth. He also discussed some of the potential effects of ROS on root development. For example, reducing hydrogen peroxide levels leads to more rapid root growth in some plants, as well as distribution of superoxide and peroxide in the plant root tip and elongation cells. Dr. Benfey further mentioned some of the precautions we would need to take if we wanted proper plant development, namely if the bacteria need to be in a symbiotic relationship with the root and if it is possible to gauge the internal redox environment of the plant from the outside.
This knowledge provided support that controlling ROS has been shown through research to increase plant growth in a substantial way. OxyPonics is therefore a valuable innovation.
This interview was especially valuable in helping us figure out how to apply the knowledge we had accumulated so far into our product designs. We needed to see if our E. coli could live with plants in a hydroponic set-up, and through our interview with Dr. Maria Harrison we learned this was not the case, so we decided to contain our bacteria with dialysis tubing. When tackling the issue of being able to measure plant internal redox we referred back to our interview with Dr. Tim Setter where we learned that oxidants seep out of a plants roots, leading to our choice to"

Cette BioBrick contient une séquence d’adressage nucléaire SV40 (DTS). Elle peut être utilisée pour augmenter l’efficacité du taux de transfection du gène.
Les plasmides atteignent rarement le noyau s’ils n’ont pas de mécanisme d’incorporation nucléaire.  Des études ont été menées sur l’utilisation de séquences pour l’importation nucléaire de  séquences génétiques : les séquences DTS (DNA Nuclear Targeting Sequence). Cette BioBrick est capable de jouer ce rôle. Cette séquence, connue pour avoir la capacité de fixer 10 facteurs de transcription différents, assure le transport de l’ADN jusqu’au noyau. Ajoutée au plasmide thérapeutique, cette séquence permet l’entrée et l’expression du plasmide thérapeutique dans le noyau de la cellule cible.

Stem cell factor (SCF) est un facteur de croissance stimulant la survie, la prolifération et la  différentiation de cellules hématopoïétiques. C’est aussi un marqueur spécifique des cellules souches. Quand il se fixe à c-kit, le  c-kit ligand induit une dimérisation du c-kit et la particule d’encapsidation. Donc c’est un ligand efficace pour transfecter un gène dans les cellules souches.

MEET UP in Wageningen
At the end of June, our team was on the road to Wageningen. The aim of this meeting was first to have a good time together but also to meet other iGEM teams from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. It was a great opportunity to share about science with other students coming from abroad. We had the pleasure to present BactaSun in front of those iGEM groups. Indeed, what would be science without sharing it? At the end of the day we came back to Belgium with a lot of interesting ideas about our project and much more energy to do it properly.
""Café conférence""
We noticed that synthetic biology is not yet a common topic among students.  In order to explain our project in front of a large audience and at the same time present what synthetic biology actually consists in, we decided to schedule a conference. We collaborated with ""Café Numérique"". The concept was to follow the presentation and then participate in a debate about artificial nature with a good Belgian beer in your hands. We started the conference with the presentation of our iGEM project and then we had the pleasure to discuss with Gauthier Chapelle. He is a scientist who worked as scientist officer for the International Polar Foundation, he promoted Biomimicry in Europe and is now a co-founder of a sustainability consultancy firm. Moreover, we were pleased to host Dr. Philippe Gabant, a specialist in molecular biology and founder of a biotech company in synthetic biology called Syngulon.

1.apply for a paten
We are planning to apply for a patent on the green ground that we designed. We continually improve our designs based on the living characteristics of cockroaches and the convenience of human use. We believe that the final version of our design will definitely maximize the sterilization of our genetically engineered Metarhizium. Therefore, we want to apply for a patent, which will not only protect our creative achievements but also is a kind of affirmation and support for our design.
2.take a quality inspection
During the Mid-Autumn Festival, we went to Hunan Province to distribute our first Green Ground with wild type Metarhizium as an insecticide, and it was very affirmed by the villagers. We are convinced that our products will have better results if they are developed. For this reason, we intend to send our final products to the relevant departments for quality inspection, making it a product that can be put into reality. It takes a lot of money and effort, but we believe that our products can bring convenience to more people in the society.
3. promotion of synthetic biology
When we did social research, we found that everyone is not too familiar with synthetic biology and resists GMOs. We are not preaching the synthetic biology but willing to make the public have a more accurate and deeper understanding of synthetic biology and genetic engineering. At present, we have developed aa applet, biocampany, based on WeChat platform. We intend to promote iGEM and synthetic biology with our applet. It must be a good platform for more people to follow the progress of iGEM teams and iGEM.
In addition, we also intend to bring the courses as well as"

This communication link uses WebSockets, a communication protocol that enables two way communication between the browser and server. Peripheral Manager takes advantage of this protocol for serial communication with the Arduino.
Back-end code
The back-end software runs both the XY Plane and Control Syringes. The approach in designing the back-end was to treat information in the context of a series of different outputs coming off of the microfluidic chip. By creating an “Output” class, we created different methods that were responsible for assigning each output a set of dispensing coordinates and pair of corresponding control syringes that open and close the output. We are then able to access each output to get the necessary information to control the hardware. The control syringe and xy-plane software are detailed further in the Software section of our Wiki.

We sought to emulate HONY’s singular style, a mode of social media posting that is informative, striking, and familiar: every picture includes as its point of focus a person or group of people, and is accompanied by a quote from their conversation with the photographer, a piece of text that often highlights some unique quality of the interviewees.
For our project, we built a Facebook page . We produced a document that invited iGEM teams from across the world to contribute posts. This invitation outlines interview protocols, instructions for obtaining permission to post an interview transcript and photo online, and how the project relates to the broader goals shared by the iGEM competition and its constituent teams.
After e-mailing this to all teams whose e-mails were readily available, as well as posting our invitation on the iGEM Facebook group several times this summer, results started to flow in. The submissions weren’t the only memorable element of this outreach - we learned a great deal about how individuals around the world think about and relate to synthetic biology.
We continue to actively solicit and accept submissions for Humans & Synbio. Please contact us through Facebook if you are interested in participating!
SynBio Opinions
We surveyed a sample of our colleagues, peers, and community members (n=166), hoping to understand how individuals’ opinions about environmental issues and about the viability of synthetic biology affected their stated judgement of our synthetic biology application. We disseminated this survey using Facebook, e-mail, and other forms of social media. We also sent out invitations to all the iGEM teams who had their contact e-mails readily available on their websites. Results are summarized and pictured on the corresponding page, accompanied by a sample survey. Of note is the fact that out of the respondents who provided a complete set of responses (n=162), a distinct minority (n=3) indicated that they either disagreed or strongly disagreed (on a 5-point Likert scale) with the use of synthetic biology to implement the following description of our project:

Als verantwortliche Modelliererin soll Münch zusammen mit Kolja Schleich, einem zweiundzwanzigjährigen ""Mobi"" - so werden Studenten genannt, die den Lehrgang Molekulare Biotechnologie gewählt haben -, die einzelnen Vorgänge in dem biosynthetisch erzeugten Killerspiel der Kolibakterien auf einem Rechner simulieren.
Das Erzeugen eines so komplexen Computermodells hat jedoch seine Tücken. Am Ende, wenn alle Bausteine passen, könnte man auf dem Bildschirm Zeuge eines Mikroben-Kleinkrieges werden, der von den Studenten wahrhaftig in der Petrischale provoziert wurde. Gegenüber stehen sich dabei zwei Kolibakterien: der ""Killerstamm"" auf der einen Seite und der ""Beutestamm"" auf der anderen Seite. Die Aufgaben der Mikroben sind klar. Die Aufgabe der Studenten besteht nun darin, eigentlich harmlose Darmbakterien durch die Nutzung vorproduzierter DNS-Bausteine, die vom iGEM-Veranstalter konserviert und getrocknet in einer Art Briefmarkensammlung für Geningenieure bereitgestellt werden, in veritable Kriegsteilnehmer zu verwandeln. Jede Gruppe bedient sich - wie es die eigene Strategie erlaubt - dieser in der Genbibliothek angelieferten DNS-Werkzeuge. Im November dieses Jahres werden dann die Planung und die Verwirklichung des biotechnischen Kriegsspiels, das sich wahlweise gegen andere Bakterienstämme oder gegen Tumorzellen richten kann, von den Juroren am MIT bewertet.
Der mikrobiologische Schlachtplan der Heidelberger Studenten enthält zwei entscheidende Schritte. Zuerst müssen die ""Killerbakterien"" ihre Beute erkennen und zielgerichtet darauf zuschwimmen, und zum anderen muss das ""Tötungsmodul"" sicherstellen, dass mit Hilfe eines Bakteriengifts die Beute gezielt ausgeschaltet wird. Ein durchaus prekärer Plan. Denn es muss unter allen Umständen verhindert werden, dass die Killerbakterien selbst von"

Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of"

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html,". The current sterilisation techniques employed revolve around a series of clean rooms, sterile rooms in which all particles entering the room are strictly controlled to create microbial barriers. (Frick et al, 2014)  Followed by chemical cleaning and sterilisation to prevent recontamination and mission planning to prevent heavy impacts and contamination of solar system bodies (NASA, 2018). Bioburden assay methods are also employed to ensure effective sterilisation has occurred and no sporulating bacteria have survived (Lundin, 2000) (Venkateswaran et al, 2003)
Mission categorisation also determines what sections of spacecraft need to be cleaned, for example for landers or rovers where only certain parts of the machine are exposed to the surface, only these parts must meet the required contamination protocols (NASA, 2013) . This assumes that the internal sections were sterilised and assembled in a clean room of category ISO class 8 or above (Connect2cleanrooms, 2018).
Whilst these methods are used within a sterile environment, spacecraft are launched from open air launchpads thereby challenging planetary protection through recontamination (Bernardnill et al, 2014). In order to prevent recontamination spacecraft are specially packaged to prevent contact with microbes in the open air environment (Frick et al, 2014). This process can include, deployable biobarriers, filtration systems reducing particulate transport, overpressure approaches and assembly techniques (Hogan et al, 2006).
Recontamination is the most difficult part of ensuring sterilisation for spacecraft whilst they are launched from Earth and different techniques are required for different stages of launch and different parts of the craft.
These prevention methods are designed to minimise contamination of not only Mars but other icy satellites including Ganymede, Enceladus and Europa. Contamination is believed to be a high risk upon impact with planetary surfaces and in order to minimise this, trajectory corrections and biases are used to lower the probability of contamination (NASA, 1997). These trajectories primarily ensure that there is no chance of impacting upon or contaminating liquid bodies of water.
Risk of GMOs on Mars
The extensive sterilisation protocols put into place by space agencies such as NASA means that unwanted contamination is minimised, thus the chances of interactions between GMOs and terrestrial bacteria are minimised.
The main risk of contamination of Mars would come from humans themselves. Humans contain a rich microbiome containing many species of bacteria, the majority of which live in the gut but also inhabiting the mouth and the surface of the skin. These bacteria would be"

Since lactose is a β-galactoside, the enzyme will degrade lactose into galactose and glucose. This gene is sufficient to degrade lactose. LacY encodes for a permease located to the outer membrane, thus ensuring the transport of lactose into the cell. This is a key element of the lactose operon as it acts as a feedback mechanism in the genetic circuitry. In fact, when lactose is present, it stimulates the production of large amounts of permease thus acting as positive feedback. The LacA protein encodes β-galactoside transacetylase. The exact function of this protein in the lac system has not yet been determined.

Wetlab
Different concentrations of IPTG were added to a 96-well plate [link to assay] of e-coli Top 10 cells containing LacI-RFP genetic constructs. Here we measured the optical density of the cells over-time, for different concentrations of IPTG to monitor the effects in the culture. The IPTG growth curve results are plotted in the figure (ADD A FIGURE CAPTION TO IT: FIG1, FIG2 ETC). By visual assessment,the growth rate of the culture prior the saturation phase stays within a narrow range and does not change significantly with concentrations of [IPTG]. Therefore, we can conclude that [IPTG] in the concentration ranges we are using does not affect cellular growth and is non toxic. The effects of IPTG have been widely studied [SAY THAT WE ARE CONFIRMING SOMETHING WELL KNOWN ANYWAY BY OTHERS]
Modelling
Taking into account the indications from the wetlab, we can then draw a relationship between different input IPTG concentrations and the amount of polypeptide produced.
When we introduce IPTG into the system, it temporarily removes LacI from the system. Hence, during this period of time, we produce the drug of interest.
When the effects of IPTG wear off, the system returns to equilibrium.
The more IPTG we add in, the higher the amount of output protein.

Calcium     phosphate transfection has been optimized and widely used with many     adherent and non-adherent cell lines (Jordan et al., 1996). Calcium     phosphate transfection can result in transient expression of the delivered     DNA in the target cell, or establishment of stable cell lines.
Procedure:
The ingredients prepared according to the protocol with the GFP gene     plasmid:
23 ul of PUC GFP DNA ,187 ul OF 1M CaCl2, DDW up to 750ul + 750 HEBSX2
All ingredients were made and then filtered in 0.22 filter for sterile solution
The ingredients were mixed for 30 minutes in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf for the 6 wells plate (250ul of complete reagent for each well)
In the 6 wells there were 2 options for the transformation:
a) Medium removed, 250ul reagent added. after 30 min new medium(2.5ml)     added
b) 250ul reagent added + old medium(2.5ml)
After 8 hours all old medium removed and added new 2.5ml of relevantmedium

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," no vesicles are produced in the wild type strain compared to the KEIO strain. Furthermore, the concentration of vesicles after growing overnight is much higher than 3 hours after induction, thus showing that more vesicles are produced over time. Also, the concentration of vesicles with and without induction differ only with around 2 mg/μL which is not that significant considering the error bars. The reason for this could be the use of a high copy plasmid in combination with a leaky promoter. Besides this, it is confirmed that the presence of the TolR plasmid does not result in large differences in vesicle production.
Figure 38: Liposome calibration curve. Calibration curve of liposomes. The intensity (a.u.) is put against the concentration of liposomes. The liposomes were stained with the membrane dye FM4-64, which only fluoresce when it is bound to the membrane. A linear fit is made, with the formula $I = 4.7865 \cdot C + 950.0159$.
Figure 39: Concentration of vesicles. The concentration of vesicles present in the purified samples of TolR and pET-Duet in the KEIO strain and pET-Duet in the WT strain. The concentration, in mg/µL, plotted for the different samples at 3 hours and 20 hours after induction.
TorA-GFP plasmid assembly
We ordered our TorA-GFP from IDT and assembled the part on pSB1C3 by digestion assay with EcoRI and PstI and consecutive ligation . We transformed the construct into a TOP10 strain and screened some colonies with colony PCR (with primers IG0006 and IG0013 ).
Figure 40: Gel electrophoresis of colony PCR products resulting for the transformation with the construct. The gel includes a ladder (L), negative controls (C), a blank (B) and the different inserts (1 to 4) from different ligation. The indicated bands have the expected size.
The indicated bands have an expected band size of ~1500 bp. Colonies 1 and 2 from ligation 1 were picked for sequencing (with primer IG0013 ), where the sequence of both plasmids was further confirmed.
Transporting GFP into the vesicles
Introducing vesicle production is only the first step in transporting proteins into vesicles. It also requires translocation of the proteins to the periplasm. To achieve this we placed a TorA export tag in front of the protein and this fusion protein was transformed into the KEIO and"

A crystal structure of the protein bound to B12 is available (PDB1N4A; Karpowich et al.., 2003). For us it is highly interesting to see, if a protein that is naturally involved in B12 import can be converted to mediate its export. If this was possible, the concept could potentially be applied to other proteins involved in the import of small molecules.

Working on water treatment is to us the most pertinent way to contribute to the fight against cholera.
Analyzing the current solutions
Therapeutics
Fig. 4: currently used therapeutical solutions against cholera.
The most used treatment is the Oral Rehydratation Solution (ORS), composed of salts and glucose in order to fight the extreme loss of water due to cholera. It can be drunk or injected intravenously depending on the patient and his symptoms 7 . This curative method does not wipe out the infection.
The therapeutic solutions do not eradicate the disease vector. During treatment, the human is still considered as a V. cholerae reservoir and can contribute to spread the disease. Moreover, all humans resulting fluids have to be considered as Biosafety 2 contaminated wastes.
Even if the ORS treatment is very efficient, it would be more appropriate for people to use prevention methods. While direct preventive methods such as vaccination are currently used, they have been shown to have low efficiency 8 . Efficient scientific detection or purification methods exist, but they require trained staff and sophisticated equipment which are generally not available in all areas of the world 8 .
Water treatment
Fig. 5: currently used methods for water purification.
Cheaper and more accessible alternatives consist in attacking the cholera problem at its root by proceeding to water treatment. The current most efficient ways to eradicate cholera from water is sodium hypochlorite treatment. According to MSF, bleach treatment requires dedicated and well trained human resources and a logistic to ensure a good supply. The bleach water treatment is complex: before treating the water the chlorine demand has to be evaluated in order to determine the right amount of bleach to treat the volume of water. Low pH, high temperature, sunlight exposure, metal and turbidity impact bleach stability and correct treatment. 9 Besides, bleach impacts the organoleptic properties of the water, hence presents an acceptability problem. However, bleach is current best solution available so far, according to the WHO (2014)
Another solution consists in filtering water. This prevention methods could be expensive and difficult to set up. Moreover, people living in remote villages do not have easy access to these systems and it can take days to reach a camp to be cured.
The last classic solution is to boil the water, but this could be complicated for big water volumes, especially to maintain low level of V. cholera agent if the water reserve is contaminated again because of people use. Thus, new methods of prevention and treatment have"

where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged (it is equivalent to use pLux/Tet hybrid promoter).
The results is shown for each (we plot GFP concentration versus time and compare it with experiment measument):
Part:BBa_K176026 (Promoter Strength: 0.55 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176126 (promoter strength: 0.0192 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176128 (promoter strength: 0.0016 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176130 (promoter strength: 6.4E-5 1/s)
Toggle Switch
Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state."

Team Activity Tests:
Another part of the characterization of our ECOL and BPUL laccase was to measure their activity when exposed to different concentrations of ABTS. We choose an exponential gradient of 2 µL to 16 µL and measured with the usual laccase concentration of 0,003 mg/mL and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (ad 200 µL H2O). Unfortunately the measurements that contained 16 µL ABTS could not be measured completely because the OD420 exceeded the maximal value that Tecan was able to measure. The results of ECOL (see. Fig. 1) show as well an exponential increase in the OD420 correlated to the ABTS concentrations, respectively. The negative control was chosen to contain the maximum of 16 µL ABTS in buffer and water that was incubated with CuCl2.

William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices#Retirement communities_-_-_TEXT.html," specific stories to share and questions to ask based on their readings! Conversations ranged from the threats of bioengineered weapons, to the potential to cure disease. We discussed the scientific feasibility as well as the ethical implications of a variety of synthetic biology applications. Ultimately, our team learned a lot about the fears and hopes many members of the older generation have for synthetic biology. It was especially meaningful to hear about the apprehensions some of the older gentlemen had concerning biological threats. As students working in an iGEM lab, we comply with safety policies; our projects are approved before we begin and we would never consider letting our projects out of lab without approval. However, some of the participants were particularly interested in the legal, not just ethical, barriers that stood between researchers in a lab posing a threat to the community. These conversations shifted our perceptions about the work we do every day in lab, and reminded us why bioethics and biosafety are a vital part of the work we do. When responding to these questions we shared the policies our team complied with. On the other side of the conversations, many of the participants were eager to see where synthetic biology was headed. One of our favorite comments made during the event was from woman from Williamsburg Landing who shared:
“We may be afraid of this now, but people were nervous about vaccinations when they first came around. This could just be the next step in human evolution”.
We have received positive feedback from activities coordinators and requests for new programs. At the end of the event the activities coordinator from Windsormeade shared her feedback via email:
""Jessica, I got 100% super positive feedback from everyone who attended your presentation!!! You were a huge hit!! I am disappointed that I didn’t get by the ballroom yesterday to meet you. With the storm approaching, I have had a lot of preparations and changes to do.
The residents have requested more presentations such as you provided. So, if you have any suggestions, please let me know.
Thank you so very much for sharing your knowledge and time with the residents of WindsorMeade.""

Moving forward with our retirement community programming, we are scheduling longer sessions, leaving 35 minutes for our presentation and 45 minutes for our conversations portion. We will be hosting a 2 hour session for the Christopher Wren Society in Spring.

On the last day, there was an iGEM meetup where members of these teams got together to network and talk about iGEM at their institutions.  We met some interesting people and got some contact information for a few people that we might be interested in working on a collaboration with, particularly in the field of human practices.
Overall, this was a fantastic opportunity for members of our team.  There are some incredibly cool projects going on in the world, and it was very inspiring to hear from some of the leading scientists in the field.

More Educational Aspects: Rules Animations
The next step to enrich the educational aspects of our model is to animate each rule. With doing so, biologists can make connection with the rules as well as the notations used to implement these rules. It is really important for us that make our model convenient to understand for biologists as they are the main users of it. that is why we have designed these animation so that biology and computer science could be connected.
That is what I have been working on this week.
In addition we had our meeting, and here is a summary for modeling team:
The team members involved in modelling need to meet more and learn more about what the others are doing. We will address this by meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10h00 am. On the differential side, we have a lot of breadth to our approach but it's still fairly superficial. We have established a differential reaction-based model on SimBiology, but finding values for phosphorylation constants has been a much greater challenge than we had anticipated. We will need to set up a model anyway and collect some input/output data, and from that we can approximate a set of parameters. It's highly unlikely that they'll be unique, but they will give us something to work with and help us evaluate which ones are limiting steps and would be worth tweaking in a real system The point of standardisation and characterisation is to have a set of parts to work with and choose from, based on characteristics that can be compared among different parts. Endy's 2006 paper is interesting, but it only presents character"

ArdjanLabCaptainLab Lad
Currently I am partaking in the second year of my bachelor Biomedical Technology here at the TU/e. Whilst I thoroughly enjoy my courses I am always looking to do more and to put my theory into practice.  The iGEM competition gave me the perfect opportunity to do this, allowing me to spend time working on research of my own choosing, and giving me the chance to spend time in the lab. Outside the university I spend my time keeping up with my favorite TV shows or, weather permitting, on the road bike.
If you don't like penguins I don't like you.

I am a bachelor student in Biomedical Engineering at the TU/e. Classes in biochemistry and the molecular biology of the cell raised my interest in synthetic biology. Since the field is relatively new there is a vast range of possibilities for research in synthetic biology. By competing in the iGEM competition I hope to open doors to new opportunities using my Biomedical background. Furthermore it will be a big - though very interesting - challenge to set"

GO BACK AND CHECK OTHER YEAST CONSTRUCTIONS
OXIDATIVE STRESS RESPONSE
This construction is made up of two parts: (1) a transcriptional factor binding site inside the promoter, (2) the coding sequence which contains a synthetic fluorescent (green) protein. The expression of the thioredoxin reductase (TRR) promoter is regulated by two transcription factors, YAP1 and SKN7, which work together in response to oxidative stress [1].
When is the protein synthesized? We obtain the green fluorescent protein by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. (H2O2).
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: YAP1 transcription factor is regulated by subcellular localization. Under normal conditions an exporting receptor (CRM1) escorts YAP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is stored. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, another protein (HYR1) catalyzes the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in YAP1 [2]. This conformational change allows YAP1 to accumulate in the nucleus and to bind to the TRR promoter by a bZIP DNA-binding domain. On the other side, SKN7 transcription factor is constitutively nuclear. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, SKN7 is able to associate with the TRR promoter. Some studies suggest that the formation of the SKN7+ YAP1+ DNA complex requires more than the binding of these two transcription factor to the promoter in close proximity. In conclusion, the two transcriptional factors require only one binding site within the promoter [3].  Once the two proteins are bound to the TRR promoter, the transcription of"

Enzymes responsible for oxidative degradation of PCBs
1 BphA: biphenyl dioxygenase
Biphenyl dioxygenase is a Riesketype three-component enzyme, comprising a terminal dioxygenase that is composed of a large subunit (encoded by bphA1) and a small subunit (encoded by bphA2), a ferredoxin (encoded by bphA3) and a ferredoxin reductase (encodedby bphA4)
It catalyzed the conversion of biphenyl to dihydrodiol compound in step 1.
2 BphB: dihydriol dehydrogenase
In the second step of the upper pathway BphB enzymes catalyzes the conversion of dihidrodiol to dihydroxy compound.
3 BphC: 2,3-dihydroxybiphnyl dioxygenase
The third enzyme in upper pathway is a 2,3-dihyroxybiphnyl dioxygenase involved in the ring meta-cleavage at the 1,2 position.
4 BphD: hydrolase
In the forth step BphD, a hydrolase, hydrolyzes the ring meta-cleavage yellow compound(HOPDA) to chlorobenzoic acid and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate.
Design Abstract
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of organic pollutants that are persistent when released into the environment. Our task is to design an effective as well as intelligent PCBs degrader. Thus our work could be divided into two parts. One is to develop a sensing system for the detection of PCBs and activation of the downstream degradation pathway; the other is to enhance the degradation efficiency.
DHBD(2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase), the third enzyme of the bph pathway, is of particular significance because it is incapable o f catalyzing the ring cleavage step and is subject to various types of inhabitation, as well as suicide inactivation. According to the recent research, ortho-chlorinated PCB metabolites (DHBs) are potent and physiologically significant inhibitors of DHBD, so we design a feedback activation pathway to increase the BphC transcription and expression under a 2, 3-DHBP and 4-CB inducible promoter Ppcb.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
