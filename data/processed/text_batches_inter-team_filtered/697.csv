Marketing for August 5th (2009-08-05)
Today, I concentrated my energies on fundraising for our research project and finding potential media partners.
For the fundraising part, we conducted a bake sale from which, we raised $494.18 CDN Dollars. Every team member had contributed to the endeavour. I also contacted some airline agencies to get a quote for our trip to MIT, Boston.
I also contacted our University of Calgary Community Radio Station called CJSW 90.9 for doing a media coverage for our research project this year. I will do a follow-up later this week.

Verification of cl lambda in psB2K3 and PQ-B-R-OU-B in psB1AC3
Overnight cultures were prepared of cl lambda and sequenced PQ-B-R-OU-B. Different concentrations of IPTG (0.5mM, 1mM, 5mM) were added to the cultures of cl lambda at the mid-exponential phase of growth. Plasmid was isolated using the QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit, and the concentration and purity of plasmid was measured using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer. Restriction digest was then performed cutting with XbaI/PstI and EcoRI. The restriction digest was also set up for an isolated plasmid of cl lambda from July 17, 2009. The figure shows the results:
Noteworthy sizes (all are verified by the gel above):
-cl lambda gene: 987 bp
-psB2K3 for cl lambda: 4.4kb

Posted on Sep 6, 2010
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of?
Researcher safety,Public safety,or Environment safety.
Based on our experimental design, all facilities in the laboratory are performed in Biosafety Level 2 and the materials we use are E.coli Top 10, Salmonella typhimurium VNP. Melanoma B16F10 and the laboratory mice.Since the Salmonella typhimurium VNP is infectious , we take some measures to ensure the health of the team when we conduct the experiments with them. During all the experiments, all the instructions are posted and the workers are asked to wear the nitrile gloves, lab coats and masks, movever, a room is separated for the experiments and the bacterial is kept in a special place We also clean the experiment table once a day. For the researcher safety, our team is trained by all the safety regulations before we start the experiments. Normal safety protocols are observed for experimental procedures. However, except for those normal procedures that the team can deal with on a daily basis ,  we will also use the ultraviolet light in our experiments so we decide to arrange different people to do this work to reduce the time contacting with it. As for the public and environment safety, we always keep the products in the cell cultures to avoid their spreading to the outside and check their conditions regularly.At the same time we will also dispose those products according to the protocols.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts(or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
NanJing Universty.
NO, none of the new BioBrick parts we made raises any significant safety issues since all the genes we use commonly exist in E.coli Top 10 and Salmonella typhimurium VNP. Although we give the transformed  bacterials  some advantages  compared  with the wild type, the advantages just exist in the"
XJTU-China,2018,Team:XJTU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," good time discussing our hairpin coupling model. Thanks to our collaboration, we can set up a hairpin coupling model as a fresh man. At the very beginning, the most important thing to set up the hairpin coupling model is to determine how can the hairpin structure couple the upstream and downstream expression.
The hairpin structure is the same with the stem-loop structure and forms when there is a similar strand of DNA or RNA due to the base complementary pairing principle. When the hairpin is in the gene and between two coding sequences, the expression levels of these two coding sequence will change because of the hairpin structure. What’s more important is that how can we determine the coupling efficiency based on the hairpin structure.
The hairpin structure is between the two coding sequences and we can use ordinary differential equation to describe the dynamics of genetic circuit. The expression level of protein can be defined as follows: $$\frac{\text{d}[Protein_1]}{ \text{d}t}=k_1-\delta_1 [Protein_1]$$ $$\frac{\text{d}[Protein_2]}{ \text{d}t}=k_2-\delta_2 [Protein_2]$$ When the protein expression level is stable, the expression level of two protein can be defined as: $$Protein_1^{Sta}=\frac{k_1}{\delta_1}$$ $$Protein_2^{Sta}=\frac{k_2}{\delta_2}$$  Then the coupling efficiency can be defined as follows: $$cpEff=\frac{ Protein_2^{Sta}}{ Protein_1^{Sta}}=\frac{\frac{k_2}{\delta_2}}{\frac{k_1}{\delta_1}}=\frac{k_2 \cdot \delta_1}{k_1 \cdot \delta_2}$$ Where $k_1$ means the transcription rate of $protein_1$ and $k_2$ represents the transcription rate of $protein_2$. Due to the research of OUC, we can calculate $k_1$, $k_2$ of coding sequence using a thermodynamics model.
The translation rate of the coding sequence can be defined as the following formula in statistical thermodynamics because with the decrease of Gibbs free energy, the system will become more stable and the ribosome will be more likely binding DNA. Then the $k_1$ can be calculated as $$k_1 \varpropto e^{-\beta \cdot \Delta G_{total1}}$$ We"
SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," higher mortality. Although M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder group has lower mortality within three days, it can show a difference more time. From the point of view of the rate of gnawing, under the natural condition, there is a similar behavior that cockroaches gnaw each other, but the M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder can strengthen this phenomenon, which represents higher probability of pathophoresis between cockroaches.
Based on the results above, our M.anisopliae emulsifiable powder will not cause a high migration rate of cockroaches compared with traditional products, although it has lower mortality within three days. Detailed and more scientific analysis can be found in our modeling section ."
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Lattice Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". Furthermore, electrostatic interactions have been found to have a slightly higher free energy contributions than hydrophobic interactions, 1.4 kcal/mol ( Berg 2002 ) versus 0.6 kcal/mol for small (36 residues) and 1.6 kcal/mol for large (341 residues) proteins ( Pace et al. 2011 ). Since TDPs have ~210-230 residues, we estimated a hydrophobic interaction energy to be 0.9 kcal/mol. Thus, we came up with the following equations for hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction energies scaled to their free energy contributions.
$$ E_{HCl} = -\left( 10 - \left| [HM(A) - HM(B)]\frac{19}{10.6}\right| \right)\frac{0.9}{1.4} \tag{2} $$ $$ E_{CCL} = - \left(1- [PI(A) - 7][PI(B)-7]\frac{19}{33.8} \right) \tag{3}$$
Model Conditions
In the simulation, Cas13a stays fixed at the center. However, a range of movements is possible for the TDPs surrounding it as illustrated in the figures below . Both movements of single units, at the end or the middle of a chain, and movements of multiple units including, snake movements, rotations of chain ends, and translations are possible.
Figure 2: 2D illustration of the process behind the movement of a single unit at the end of a chain. Possible new positions of the unit are determined and one is selected at random.
Figure 3: 2D illustration of the process behind the movement of a single unit in the middle of a chain. Possible new positions of the unit are determined by overlaying the possible open sites of its neighbours and one is selected at random.
Figure 4: 2D illustration of the process behind a snake movement. A possible new position of one end of the chain is determined and the following units moved along the chain.
Figure 5: 2D illustration of a rotational movement. A unit in the chain and on end of the chain is picked and the angle and axis (in 3D) by which the chosen part moves is generated randomly.

BIT
In the collaboration with BIT, we focused on the topic about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several issues including the early diagnosis and treatment about HCC patients were discussed intensively. During the interaction, we absorbed interesting opinions about the disease, our idea also improved a lot thanks to BIT. In return, we shared the information with BIT about GPC3, emphasized the possibility and advantages of GPC3 as a biomarker for early stage HCC diagnosis.
Conferences
BUDS
BUDS, a meeting for iGEMers in China to exchange experience, was hold in Nanjing University on May 19th. This year, the theme of the meeting was team building. Two former captains of Fudan shared their experience and opinions about team building. After that, each team introduced the process of formation, development and inheritance. Learning about the characteristics and experiences of iGEM project in each school, we perfect our team building. Judging from the present situation, these valuable experiences help to establish and maintain 2017 iGEM Fudan a tight, efficient and sustainable team.
iAPC
From July 30th to August 3rd, our team went to National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan to attend the Fifth iGEM Asia Pacific Conference. This was the largest meeting many of our teamers had ever participated. Of course we wouldn’t miss this good chance to rehearsal our presentation. During the conference, we gave a presentation to iGEMers from America, China, Japan and so on, collected their questions and tried to provide convincing answers. Frank exchanges lighted up the flame of thinking and promote the friendship between us.
FABO Open Night
In August 19th, six iGEM teams in Shanghai gathered in the Fablab O Shanghai. Each team gave a speech about their projects and shared the latest progress, which was a good preparation for the final presentation. What’s more, we discussed that the close distance between us should facilitate a more convenient reciprocal collaboration in the future.

For hue, Orpheus first decoded sound into wave shapes and analyzed its low, medium and high volume, then generated RGB values with our delicate mapping function. For brightness, Orpheus converted source photos into grayscale images which is in proportion to brightness. The random dropping process, just as the nightingale slowly colored the rose as it warbled in the story, each drop would color some area by the aforementioned method accompanied by the inputted music and finally a beautiful picture was produced.
.
Figure 2. Some beautiful outcomes of our software. The first one came from a poem. The second one came from wind. The third one came from the song of the birds. The fourth one came from rain.
As shown in the figure and videos, our software could generate beautiful pictures with the music going on. We believe that with this software people could enjoy themselves creating, and wandering at the junction of art and science. Our software is available at SOFTWARE
By using a projector, we could cast the picture we got from our software onto our plates. We also built a hardware to connect the computer, projector, and our plates together. (more information, see HARDWARE
LIGHT TO COLOR
In our project,  E. coli needed light and sound as inputs to produce color and odor as outputs. The process was mainly divided into three parts: sound to light, light to color, and light to odor. The light-color and light-odor conversions were achieved with the RGB system[2] which was based on the phage RNAP system as a resource allocator. As for the sound-light conversion, we developed a software that allowed users to upload their own music to generate their unique dynamic pictures, with which people could color and ‘ensoul’ their own roses.
LIGHT TO COLOR
We introduced a RGB system to stain our rose using light. The RGB system mainly consists of four modules: a sensor array, circuits, a resource allocator and  actuators.
Figure 3. The structure of the RGB system.
The sensor array combines 3 light sensors, Cph8*, YF1 and CcasR, which can respond to lights of different wavelengths. CcasR can sense and be switched on by green (535nm) light. Cph8* is switched off by red (650nm) light, while YF1 is switched off by blue (470nm) light.
To activate gene expression, the signals from the red- and blue- light sensors need to be inverted, which is done by connecting them to NOT gates in circuits.

These two composite parts were used to demonstrate the oscillatory nature of our genetic circuit. While incubated at 37 degrees Celsius, cells expressing the low pass reporter construct would express sfGFP (the reporter molecule), while cells expressing the high pass reporter construct would cease expression of sfGFP (normally constitutively expressed)
BBa_K2561005: High Pass Reporter Construct
A composite part consisting of a constitutively-active promoter sequence (J23100) that drives the expression of TetR (BBa_C0040) that in turn directs the expression of downstream reporter products. Translation of TetR is additionally controlled by an upstream RNA thermometer construct that prevents recognition and binding of the RBS at temperatures lower than 32 degrees Celsius. The TetR produced represses the expression of a sfGFP reporter molecule that is normally constitutively expressed under the pTet promoter (BBa_R0040). TetR is tagged with a degradation tag (BBa_K2333405) characterized by the 2017 William and Mary team that targets it for degradation by the mf-Lon protease; this allows fluorescence signal to return to basal levels between oscillations.
BBa_K2561003: Low Pass Reporter Construct
A composite part consisting of a constitutively-active promoter sequence (J23100) that drives the expression of an orthogonal sigma factor (Sigma F, BBa_K2561001) that in turn directs the expression of downstream reporter products.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

Typical Protein Degradation Rates
One of the first things that we needed to understand was how long it usually takes a protein to degrade. As seen in the graph on the left from Junbo Liu and R. Sakari Piha , regular protein degradation can take from hours to months to eliminate the protein entirely. Hover over the graph or select the individual proteins to see their individual degradation times.
How Protein Degradation Works
After understanding that a protein's life can be fairly lengthy, we needed to learn how proteins are biologically broken down.
Ubiquitination
There are three types of enzymes involved in ubiquitination which make up the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)  called E1, E2, and E3. Together these three enzymes create a ""three-step enzymatic cascade, resulting in the covalent transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins"" ( D. Kelly ).
In the UPS, each enzyme serves a specific function to target the substrate protein for destruction by the 26S proteasome or alters their biochemical properties and subcellular organization in plants. Here, E1 serves as the ubiquitin activating enzyme while containing two isoforms. E2 serves as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is believed to have at least 40 different derivatives. Then, E3 serving as the ubiquitin ligase which is predicted to encode for more than a thousand potential E3 ligases. ( Nitzan Shabek )
Although, most reasearch shows this system being used in several different species of plant, it also serves the same role in eukaryotic cells as well. ( Nitzan Shabek )
The BAITSwitch
The Bait-Switch is composed of two plant hormone-based degron systems that work in a bioorthogonal fashion, meaning that they work independently of each other, thus eliminating the chance of adverse biological cross-talk. These two systems are analogous in component functions, and they both result in rapid and specific protein degradation. Current methods of post-translational degradation, such as RNAi, are nonspecific and can have adverse effects from off-target effects. However, previous research shows that the components of the bait-switch can be transferred from plants to yeast and other vertebrate cells. Although mammalian cells do not contain the receptors to recognize these plant hormones, they contain the same SCF degradation pathway, and this can be exploited to achieve targeted, rapid protein degradation.
Breakdown of the Auxin-Inducible-Degron (AID) system"
BIT,2016,Team:BIT#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," At present, the mainstream methods of modeling control network include Petri net, Bayesian network and differential equation model.
In many methods, the differential equation can predict the behavior of the system quantitatively and accurately, and the stochastic model can fit the network accurately. The model needs to be simplified based on certain assumptions. In general, the computational cost is often increased as the description of the control network becomes deeper and more detailed. Differential equations have a wide range of applications in biomedicine, such as pharmacokinetics and enzymology, and are increasingly being used in the construction of gene regulatory networks.

When the two gene circuits mediate the downstream genetic expression synergistically, they actually change the states of downstream promoters independently. So the simplest way to construct model for this synergetic system is to first separate the two upstream circuits and model them respectively. Then we combine them when calculating their effect on the downstream promoters. That is to say, we add another set of reactions, which is very similar to the one we discussed before, with Lacl replaced by tetR and Bxb1 replaced by Fime. To calculate the regulation of Fime and Bxb1 on the promoter of GFP, we use 4 variables to describe the states of the gene circuit. These 4 variables and their meanings are listed below.
2 Lock-Key Model
In this experiment, two ribosome switches, lock1, key1 and lock3, key3 were used to regulate the background expression of recombinase FimE and BxB1, respectively, even though TetR and LacI proteins inhibited the promoters ptet and plac, but there was still a small amount MRNA is transcribed, it will affect the accuracy of detection.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 3: pchBA producing salicylic acid
In this module, we used the part BBa_J45319 given by iGEM authority to transform E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Salicylic acid was confirmed generated after several times of induced expression with IPTG and liquid chromatography testing of the supernatant. The harvest was 10mg/L, more or less (Fig. 15a). For the convenience of further testing, we also drew a standard curve (Fig 15b) of salicylic acid’s concentration with a series of standard salicylic acid samples of which the concentration was known.

b) The standard concentration curve of salicylic acid
Module 2: Salicylic acid and emrR binding promoter binds emrR protein competitively
This module is a transforming unit of the whole gene circuit, through which the signal of salicylic acid is transformed to the advantage in bacteria growth. The point of this module is to verify the inhibition effect of the repressor protein and the disinhibition effect of salicylic acid. Thus, we designed a part which expresses the repressor constantly, and an mcherry gene is placed downstream of the emrR binding promoter. Theoretically, this mcherry can only be expressed under the circumstance that salicylic acid is added to the media.
Fig.16 A) The expression of emrR prevents the initiation of PemrR, but the protein changes its configuration after binding with salicylic acid and leaves the promoter region, thus enables the expression of downstream proteins (in this case, mcherry). The promoter of emrR is a constant promoter, acquired from E. coli, originally responsible for the initiation of GADPH gene. When salicylic acid exists, red florescence can be observed. B) Control strain under white light, no salicylic acid added. C) Control strain under green light excitation, no salicylic acid added. D) Experiment strain under white light, SA conc. is 5mg/L. E) Experiment strain under green light excitation, SA conc. is 5 mg/L.
The result of our experiment showed very low expression level of RFP when there was no salicylic acid in the media. When a concentration of 5~10mg/L salicylic acid was added to the media, the bacteria showed a peak level of red florescence intensity (induction time: "

The strategy used to assemble expression plasmids with the T3SS signal sequence Map20 can be seen on figure 2. The same approach was used for insertion into the vector with and without chaperone genes. We used 3A assembly to insert the reporter genes with Map20 signal downstream of the pBAD promoter in the vectors. The reporter genes are digested with XmaI leaving overhang complementary that of the Map20 gene digested with AgeI. This way Map20 is inserted upstream of the reporter. Additionally, the reporter is cut with PstI and Map20 with XbaI allowing them to be assembled with the vector backbone which is digested with SpeI and PstI.
The same strategy was used to assemble the expression plasmids with reporter without Map20 signal sequence. This time both the vector backbone and the reporter protein sequence were digested with XbaI and PstI.

Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," lysate containing nylC. The SEM images show that there is no significant difference between the reaction group and control group. We propose two reasons to explain the results for both mass difference test and SEM imaging.
We suspect that due to inappropriate experimental procedures, such as leaving lysis samples at 4 degree fridge overnight and conducting experiment at room temperature instead of at 0-4 degree, activated protease degrades a significant amount of nylC enzyme. We will carefully conduct the experiment under low temperature and figure out a more effective way to inhibit protease activity.
We also suspect that the degradation effect of nylC activity is not reflected in both the mass difference test and SEM imaging. The mass is measured inaccurately because our mass balance had a maximum sensitivity of 1mg while the procedure required a resolution of 0.1 mg. In addition, the nylC may have its degradation effect on the two edges of the nylon strip instead on surface. We will perform trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid assay next to verify whether there is a positive change in the concentration of primary amino groups in solution, thus examine the degradation effect of nylC.

Chromoprotein Reporter Constructs
Building upon the work of the Uppsala iGEM team, we developed a series of reporter constructs based on the chromoprotein parts developed by Uppsala.
Uppsala made a wide array of chromogenic proteins available over the course of several years. They registered a vast array of parts, including coding sequences and coding sequences with attached ribosomal binding sites. We wanted to pick up where Uppsala left off and create a simple one step reporter BioBrick unit. We combined the generic, high-affinity ribosome binding site, BBa_B0034, a standard double-terminator, BBa_B0015, and the coding sequences for a purple (tsPurple), blue (amilCP), and red (mRFP) chromoprotein.
These BioBricks allow any user to verify the expression of a protein, by performing one step of BioBrick formation. All that is required is simply adding the devices we’ve created behind one’s protein of interest. These are some examples of what such a construct would look like this
Through a ligation of the above parts, you will get the following construct

Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Ensuring safe practices among increasingly diffuse practitioners of synthetic biology is a complex challenge that is not feasibly amenable to conventional models of centralized regulatory oversight, and self-enforcing models are increasingly being pursued. Interestingly enough in at least some contexts, priming subjects with a moral code can completely eliminate of a particular form of dishonest behavior, likely a byproduct of self-concept maintenance (http://duke.edu/~dandan/Papers/PI/Dishonest_JMR.pdf). Although the results observed in the context of test-taking behavior can hardly be transferred directly to the challenge of synthetic biology self-governance, they imply that an agenda of promoting mindfulness of principles of safety by embedding them into the synbio culture in conjunction with some shared self-concept that prioritizes safety. Since self-concept is strongly influenced by media representations, the continued portrayal of technologists in promethean/frankensteinian/autistic stereotypes might make this an uphill battle.
Conclusions and Recommendations
Talking about and practices synthetic biology necessarily involves active human involvement in presentation, which profoundly impacts present and follow-on design cognition. The generation of explanatory concepts, visual representations, and language-based models in most fields happens fluidly, but in synthetic biology, many established or familiar ways of thinking about problems are conceptually inadequate to handle the technical reality, especially when situated in unmanageably complex global ecologies. To facilitate thoughtful synthetic biology design in the public good, synthetic biologists should drawn on cognitive science to develop habits of mind, representations, and metaphors amenable to more realistic design intuition and effective engagement.
Criteria for designing synbio representations Designability - Conceptual precision - Does the representation realistically portray its referent? - Quantifiability - Is the representation compatible with related quantitative analysis? - Imaginability - To what concrete, mentally manipulable images is the representation linked? - Functional fixedness - Does the representation exclusively determine a particular function? Public engagement and policy - Clarity - Is the representation foreseeably misunderstood, especially, if taken literally? - Framing - Does the representation prematurely imply a particular problem definition or solution strategy? - Sensationalism - Does the representation imply unrealistically optimistic or pessimistic views? Properties to incorporate in synbio metaphors - Evolution - Self-organization - Self-replication - Complexity - Multiplicity - Parallelism - Emergence - Situation within global microbial ecologies - Situation within global socioeconomic ecologies - Uncertainty Metaphors worth critically re-visiting - Biology as machine - Biology as information - Human as “engineer”

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Model#Performance evaluation_-_-_TEXT.html," means the time for signal induction does not account for a large portion in the total time for nicotine degradation.
The recycle rate of nicotine
The final goal of our system is to transform nicotine from tobacco waste to 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine which is a valuable intermediate for chemical synthesis of medicine. Because some portion of nicotine is catalyzed to 6-Hydroxynicotine to operate the sensing system, not all nicotine is transformed to 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine. We need to evaluate the extent of end product production with certain input of nicotine to validate the efficiency of degradation system. To describe the transformation rate, we define a concept called ‘Recycle rate’ calculated as below:
Equation 4 Definition of recycle rate
In simulation, we define the nicotine input in the interval of [1e-5, 1] M and promoter1 strength s1 in the interval of [0, 1]. To make sure that 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine reaches the maximal concentration, the simulation time is set to 300000s.
Figure 13 Product max with s1, nicotine
Figure 14 Recycle rate vs s1, nicotine
From figure 13, it is transparent that the relation between 1og10 nicotine input and product concentration follows the exponential function. But the amount of final product is not so strong related to promoter1 strength. Only when nicotine input is in high concentration, product amount tends to decline with the increase of s1. It is expectable because stronger promoter1 expresses more Vppa which transformed more nicotine to 6-Hydroxynicotine rather than 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine. About the recycle rate, we notice that when nicotine input is more than 0.01 M, stronger promoter1 leads to the attenuation of recycle rate. The maximal recycle rate is nearly 100% with small s1 which means that our system is efficient in transforming nicotine.
Conclusions
According to the results of simulation, with defined promoter3 strength, promoter3 strength, plasmid 1 copy number, plasmid 2 copy number, the systematic properties mentioned above is significantly affected by the concentration of nicotine input. Only with high amount of nicotine input, the influence of promoter 1 strength is amplified to an observable extent. We can acquire many valuable information about the rough value or interval of these properties, then these data can be used as reference for exact experiment design such as the choice of sampling time or nicotine input amount.

NärCon
NärCon, the greatest cosplay event of Scandinavia, took place at Linkoping University. Of course LiU iGEM seized the opportunity to spread the knowledge about iGEM and synthetic biology. One might think that cosplay, videogames and synthetic biology have nothing in common. However, that is not true since everyone has a relation to synthetic biology, even though it is not intentional. As earlier mentioned, it is important that the knowledge about synthetic biology and research reaches the public so it can be accepted before it gets implemented in the society.
Since NärCon is an event when costumes, comics and different fiction characters are in focus, our mascot Miss Mona fitted right in and made some new friends. It was a few days of successful dialogues with the visitors about iGEM and synthetic biology.
Hike
In connection with the reception of new students at Linköping University, a hike is annually organized in order to inform and encourage new students to get involved in university associations. LiU iGEM took the opportunity to show them our project and our organization. We gave a short presentation about what we do and thereafter played a game inspired by synthetic biology. The students were asked to work together and build different molecules with their own bodies. Before leaving, the students had the opportunity to leave their contact information if they wished to learn more about iGEM and our project.
KALAS
KALAS is a great fair that mainly refers to the new students from all programs at Linköping University. With 8000 students visiting students, KALAS is the largest event for new students in Sweden. We were on site to reach out to all students about our project and arouse an interest for iGEM and our student organization as well as synthetic biology.  It was an excellent opportunity to recruit interest from a wide set of skills for future projects and engagement. LiU iGEM had our own table and was giving handouts to the visitors to inform about iGEM.
Lecture for students at Linköping University
This year, we were asked to host a lecture for the third year engineering students in the course of gene technology at Linköping University. During the lecture we mainly presented our project and discussed different aspects of synthetic biology. It was a good opportunity to introduce iGEM to students who are interested in the subject and to give them a chance to ask questions about working with this type of projects.

Motivation for Igem Participation
Biotechnology, although not my chosen field of study, is one of my enduring interests. The opportunity to work alongside some of South Africa’s most capable young scientists, in pursuit of a novel application for existing, and created, constructs, is extremely appealing to me on a personal level. As a Computer Science student, I lack the practical capabilities of some of my peers, but am extremely interested in learning and participating to the best of my ability.
In terms of my future studies, I believe that the knowledge gained throughout the course of this project will provide invaluable insight into unexplored approaches to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Novel problem-solving, using biologically inspired computer"

Looking at Previous Wikis
Today I spent some time looking at iGEM Wiki's from previous years to see what looked good and what didn't work so well. A portion of our team was in Edmonton today at the Dragon's Den and we were very happy to hear that they had secured $20 000 from the Alberta Ingenuity Fund for our project this year.

Futher Media Coverage: APEGGA May 25th 2009
The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists, and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA) has regulated the practice of engineering, geology and geophysics in Alberta since 1920. Their Quarterly magazine chief editor was fascinated by our project and he asked me if a couple of engineers from our team would write a news article for the magazine. He wanted a personalized article written by one of our engineers and a couple of testimonials from our other engineers.

Figure. 4 measurement of novel translating ribosome based tryptophan sensor by galactosidase activity
In this week, we also tested our synthetic tryptophan sensor performance by galactosidase activity. Some protocol seemed not to work for some culture condition and measurement conditions. The final successful protocol was shown as below. Firstly, we picked up E.coli JM109 carrying pTrc99A_trp sensor_lacZ single clone and cultured it in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Tryptone 10g/L, Yeast Extract 5g/L, NaCl  10g/L) with concentration of ampicillin at 50mg/L for overnight. On the next morning, the 600nm optical density (OD600) of the culture was measured to be 3.090. This seed was transferred into 2mL LB medium with the same concentration of ampicillin by a ratio of 5% in a 5mL 48 well culture plate (Huayang Chengxun Cor. Beijing China). After 1.6h, OD600 of every well reached about 0.6. Each well was also supplemented with 720uL fresh LB medium. Isopropylβ-D-1-Thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and tryptophan stock solution was also added into each well to the final concentration of 0.4mM and a gradient of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3mM, respectively. After 21h, the galactosidase activity was measured as described below.

Methods: Colony PCR (modified)
Protocol: CP1.2
Notes: MgCl2 was added as a gradient, samples 1-2 contain 2 microlitres (0,04255), samples 3-5 2,25 microlitres (0,04787). We mistakenly added 30µl (instead of 17µl) premix to samples 6 - 9, so the concentration of MgCl2 is reduced. Sample 6 contains 2,25 microlitres (0,0375), samples 7-8 2,5 microlitres (0,04167), sample 9 2,75 microlitres (0,04583).

What recent research advances in synthetic biology are you most excited about?
""One of the first syn-bio research projects I ever heard about was synthetic manufacturing of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin, which can be credited to Jay Keasling and his research group at UC Berkeley, and to this day, I still consider it one of the most exciting advances. Artemisinin is produced by plants but plant production can be extremely volatile; during a particularly poor growing season, thousands more people could become more susceptible to malaria because of lack of drug production. The turning point is that now the Keasling group has figured out a way to genetically engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce an artemisinin precursor and this method boosts production tremendously. Malaria is still a huge problem in developing countries and I'm really excited to see how far this project can go. Right now, the drug is licensed to Sanofi and being scaled up to produce 35 tons and the project is backed by the Gates Foundation so... let's hope for the best!""

Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Abstract
PUF, the magic RNA binding protein: Programmable RNA binding protein with custom functions
         RNA has characteristics that are important in human gene expression (i.e. alternative splicing of mRNA, noncoding RNA). Therefore, a  modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways.

In purple is the RNA, and the three amino acid side chains are shown above it. PUF’s potential to bind any conceivable 8 nucleotide sequence is extremely novel. The NYxxQ subunit recognizes"
Peking,2015,Team:Peking#Project#PC Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," 11. The effect of genome copies/mL for NAD amplification on the bioluminescence intensity of PC reporter.
From single to array
We have demonstrated that our Paired dCas9 (PC) reporter system works well in bench and could be applied to the detection of MTB genomic DNA. Particularly, when combined with PCR, our PC reporter is as sensitive as to confidently detect only 1 genome copy per tube.
However, in the clinical practice, the situations are much more complicated considering the fact that strain mutation, sample difference and other environmental factors would cause misdiagnosis for single test. So we got an idea of designing a diagnosis array to extract more sequence information for on our PC Reporter to test multiple sites on the target genome at one time, thus  to guarantee reliability of diagnosis.
The core and also the first step of array design is to enumerate all the dCas9 binding site (PAM site) through the entire genome of MTB and to identify MTB-specific PAM sites as markers via SSPD. After computational screening, we totally obtained 2791 MTB-specific markers. 72 sgRNA pairs was designed according to 72 markers out of 9 fragments on MTB genome (Figure 12). Then we utilized Oligo Generator to design oligos for Golden Gate Cloning in a high-throughput manner, built sgRNA Generators for cell-free transcription, and finally obtained 70 sgRNA pairs (2 pairs failed during cloning).
Figure 12. 72 target sites (MTB-specific markers) out of 9 fragments on MTB genome, screened out using SSPD.
Then we performed array-based high-throughput measurement using PC reporter system (See Methods). Two separated assays were carried out using MTB and a control bacteria (E. coli), respectively. By data analysis, the results were presented as heat maps below (Figure 13). We can easily discriminate the results of MTB from that of control strain. Note that among 70 successfully constructed sgRNAs, 59 exhibit a significant performance for the detection of MTB; 11, however, fail to be positive. This is consistent with our concern that some factors might disrupt the performance of individual single test of PC reporter.  Reassuringly, the array-based PC reporter detection solved this problem (Figure 13).

To validate the results in a quantitative way, we selected Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test"

Realizing the importance of reliable and repeatable measurement for engineering biology, we are excited to participate in the Fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study. As a high school team, we choose to participate in “Plate Reader and CFU” Study.
We followed the standard protocol including LUDOX Protocol, Microsphere Protocol, Fluorescein Protocol, Cell Measurement Protocol, and Colony Forming Units Study, etc. (Detailed protocol information can found at https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/0/09/2018_InterLab_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf). During the whole InterLab study process, everyone, instructed by the team PI, studied the protocol carefully and worked on providing accurate and reliable experiment data to the Measurement Committee.
Materials
Provided in Kit: LUDOX CL-X, Silica beads, Fluorescein, Devices (R0040, I20270, J364000, J364001, J364002, J364007, J364008, J364009)
Provided by ourselves: 96 well plate (black with clear flat bottom preferred), ddH2O, PBS (pH 7.4-7.6), Competent cells (Escherichia coli strain DH5α), LB media, Chloramphenicol (stock concentration 25 mg/mL dissolved in EtOH).
Methods
We used a Tecan Infinite M200pro plate reader to measure OD600 and fluorescence values. The excitation wavelength is 485 nm, the Emission wavelength is 530 nm, and the Firmware is V 3.37.
OD600 measurements were taken in Corning 96 well assay plates (black with a clear flat bottom). The experiments performed at the College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of their instructor (Dr. Fangliang Huang, who is also the instructor of 2018 iGEM Team ASTWS-China). We appreciate the use of their plate reader and 96 well assay plates they offered us – see our collaborations page for more details (https://2018.igem.org/Team:HFLS_ZhejiangUnited/Coll"

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If"

Tn5
We selected to work with the hyperactive Tn5 transposase variant to integrate in a double strand DNA two small DNA molecules (adapters) compatible with Nanopore sequencing. The hyperactive Tn5 is a modified variant of the wild type Tn5 isolated from E. coli containing two mutations (E54K and L372P) responsible for increasing the activity of Tn5 ( Picelli et al, 2018 ). This variant is an excellent choice for the component responsible for integrating the adapter sequences. This protein forms a dimer and is able to pick up specific DNA (transposon) flanked by mosaic ends (ME) sequence (CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT) and integrate it randomly into DNA. It can integrate a single DNA, extending the target DNA by the length of the transposon utilized for in vivo functionality, or it can integrate two individual DNA molecules, inducing a double stranded break to the target DNA.
Linker
The Tn5 transposase ( BBa_K2643002 ) and the dxCas9 ( BBa_K2643001 ) were fused using a Glycine Helical peptide (GHP) Linker. The flexible linker is composed of 18 amino acids (K L G G G A P A V G G G P K A A D K) ( Cadinanos & Bradley, 2007 ). The GHP linker was selected as a high potential candidate due to its successful use in linking transposase with other proteins, for example to fuse piggyback transposase with ERT2, a ligand-binding domain ( Cadinanos & Bradley, 2007 ), or to fuse sleeping beauty transpose with zinc finger DNA-binding domain ( Voigt et al, 2012 ).
pACYCDuet-1 vector
The pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen) is designed for coexpression of two genes. The plasmid contains two multiple cloning sites (MCS), each of which is preceded by a T7 promoter/lac operator and ribosome binding site (RBS). The P15A replicon is present to sustain plasmid replication and the chloramphenicol resistance gene allows for applying selective pressure to cells for maintaining the plasmid. Additionally, after the T7 promoter a HIS tag is implemented for purification purposes.

We collaborated with other iGEM teams: we participated to Purdue and UGent online survey and had a nice workshop with Paris-Saclay team. We are also setting up a scientific collaboration with the Edimburgh iGEM team that is working on and environmental sensor using the Fur System.
As our project involves treating a human genetic disorder using genetically-engineered bacteria, it has numerous implications for human health, safety and security, and ethics. To enable safe delivery of therapeutic bacteria to the human intestine, we designed and constructed a polymer-based capsule . We also explored safety and ethics consequences of our project as the Human Practices studies:
We discussed the medical feasibility and implications of this treatment in a series of interviews and discussions with renowned experts on iron overload diseases.
We carefully analyzed the safety issues and potential consequences of our bacteria using consequence-based decision tree.
We organized and hosted a scientific conference on iron overload disorders and perceptions of our our project on 18 September 2013. This conference was attended by both medical experts and iron disorder patients.
We prepared and disseminated a patient perception survey about how our treatment could potentially help hemochromatosis patients. We received and analyzed the results from over 250 patients who responded to our survey.
We wrote an extensive report on our conclusions about  synthetic biology , which is the fruit of our many discussions over the summer.

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#HumanPractice#Sowing#Guidance_-_-_TEXT.html," according to Question 6, which means our lectures about synthetic biology and iGEM did attract a good majority of students' interests. This enables us to fulfill our goal to guide them towards future participation in iGEM.
Figure 3. Question 6
Based on the analysis of the data, it was clear what our next steps should be. According to the answers from the questionnaire, approximately 40% of the students were not willing to participate in iGEM in the future. But only a few students were not interested at all in synthetic biology or iGEM, so we decided to analyze the reasons behind this. According to Question 7, out of all the possible reasons given, ""having little academic support"" and ""no funding"" are seemed to be the most imminent. In addition, when we managed to find out what types of support students who desired to participate in iGEM need. Corresponding to Question 9, we discover that ""elementary genetic engineering techniques"" and ""guidance from previous participants"" were the most crucial aspects.
Figure 4. Question 7
Corresponding to Question 9, we discover that ""elementary genetic engineering techniques"" and ""guidance from previous participants"" were the most crucial aspects.
Figure 5. Question 9
In conclusion, our lectures helped to propagate the concepts of synthetic biology and iGEM competition to high school students, most of whom knew nothing about these two prior to the lecture. Some students had expressed willingness to participate in future iGEM competitions, while others were not due to reasons such as academic deficiency and/or financial shortage. Hence, the next step we considered was to offer assistance to the students expressing interest, such as teaching them how to implement elementary molecular cloning experiments; if it is possible, we would also like to guide students and schools to apply for funding from the Education Commission.
Funding Application
After the lectures, Ms. Lee Xuemei, the Science Director of Beijing No.4 High School, exhibited strong interest in synthetic biology and the international Genetically Engineering Machine (iGEM) competition. On July 26th, Ms. Lee came to the our lab. At the time, the PKU-UCSF Workshop was taking place. With the company of our advisor Prof. Ouyang Qi, we took Ms. Lee to the workshop field and had a serious talk on how to spread ideas of synthetic biology and iGEM to high school students.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Human_-_-_TEXT.html," we are more urgently required to establish a reasonable and comprehensive evaluation system to determine the actual genetic pollution level. With this system, we can also evaluate the seriousness of the genetic pollution under different times and the evaluation result might also be used to predict the future genetic pollution.
Establishment of the System
The construction of this system is based on many literatures analysis which contain related and useful perspectives. The frame diagram of this system is shown in the Figure 7. The shape of the system seems like a tree, so it is also called evaluation tree.
Figure 7. The frame diagram of genetic pollution risk evaluation system (From TJU iGEM team 2012)
How to use the System
The evaluation system is also very easy to use, we only need to give a grade within the range of (0, 10) through the different perspectives at the leaf note (the points which do not have child note) of the evaluation tree. After collecting of the data, we only need to do some basic calculation to obtain the final result of the evaluation of these teams on different layer of evaluation index. All these calculation results will be very helpful to help us to understand all these teams' performance in all possible level and perspectives.
The Inner Operating Principles
All the data are obtained from that of questionnaire. And the relative values are transformed through comparison matrix. This assessment has three levels. There are four aspects influencing the possible harm of Genetic Pollution. Aim level is the ranking list of the four aspects. The Second level is the detailed information about these aspects. The third level contains further assessment questions. From bottom to top, each branch has its weight of value. Therefore, we can calculate the points of that four aspects.

Though this assessment, we can notice that the range of academic use and remedial possibility are the most two important factors.
Transgenic technology is a newly born technology. It's used mostly in scientific fields. As a consequence, the main part of people's worry about transgenic technology comes from its wide use in research. Scientific research must obey strictly the rule of safety, especially when research is about some new technology with uncertain hazard.
Another source of worry is remedial possibility. Genetic pollution may endanger the whole system. Since we know little about its"

Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were unable to test the switches with luciferase. If we had managed to test our switches with luciferase, we anticipate that our sensitivity would be significantly higher.

Modeling
Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.
Applications
Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.
We have looked further into all of this on our silver human practices page .

With this financial assessment and our annual predicted revenue from the product once it has reached the market, it will take approximately 2 years to recoup the cost of investment and break-even prior to the company becoming profitable.  Beyond this timeline, our group aims to establish international connections in other areas of the world where this technology would be useful.
Several assumptions for this analysis were made:
This assumes we only capture the monitoring market that is established in the government regulation framework.
No sales costs because we don't have people who would get commission.
Shipping costs are billed to the customer.
Shipping costs were determined based on US Postal Service rates for pallet shipments Internationally with DNDC destination and five cartons.  Assumed that one shipment a month occurs at $150 per shipment.
Final Packaging Costs were estimated  based on packaging per cartridge cost was estimated based on bacterial addition definition in manufacturing section of being an additional $1.10
In 2013, the majority of expenses will be legal fees, in terms of patent application fees,incorporation fees and the drafting of legal documents, such as release forms and non-disclosure agreements.
In 2014, legal fees increase significantly due to regulatory costs and increasing consultation with legal experts./p>
Travel costs are minimal, however will increase in 2017 for promotional related events. These will increase as sales increase in order to visit potential customers.
Company Evaluation
In order to estimate our potential company evaluation today and in the future, we have performed a Asset Valuation for our company.  These were based on the following criteria:
Team Evaluation - Based on the technical abilities our team has acquired we valued these skills as a valuation towards the company.  As we continue to attract talent this is assessed.
Sweat Equity - As many of our team members will be unable to be reimbursed for their time in the company we have made an evaluation for this contribution.  This was based on the commitment level that the team member is making and their role overall in the progress of the company.
Patents - Patents provide a clear advantage to the company.  We have assessed a value of a provisional patent to be $50,000 towards the company's value and a full utility patent at a $1,000,000 contribution to the valuation.  We plan to have a series of patents to protect our technology by 2018.
Manufacturing - Establishing appropriate manufacturing contacts, facilities, prototyping development, and distribution are critical in the success of the company.  These were taken into consideration in this analysis.
Customers and Sales - Both having a customer base (market segment"

Step 6: Surface Displaying Copper Ions
To identify that whether our OprF has anchored on the cell membrane of E. coli, we performed immunofluorescence assay. HA tag was added to the N-terminal of OprF-CBP so that the recombinant protein OprF-CBP-HA can be specifically recognized by anti-HA antibody. When FITC labeled anti-IgG antibody was used as the secondary antibody and interacted with the primary antibody, green fluorescence could be observed in the cell membrane of E. coli under the fluorescent microscope.

Yener Tuncel
I have graduated from METU Molecular Biology and Genetics       department and just started the Bioinformatics Graduate Program       this fall. My main research interests is in systems biology,       and its applications. Currently I am focused on genome wide       association of SNP biomarkers, where we will utilize systems       biology approaches for discovering disease gene and pathway       associations after highthrough-put genotyping studies. During       the course of our research on the iGEM project this summer as       a Molecular Biologist I worked on the standardization of the       parts information for our applicaiton database. Also, as a Bioinformatician       in training, contributed to the development of the algorithms       for the BioGuide software. Besides research, I develop educational       tools for biology and bioinformatics education and getting used       to do couples dancing.
Motivation
Since 2008, we have been participating in iGEM as METU ( Middle East     Technical University) wet-lab team, and each year we have noticed the     increasing number of teams participating, along with an increase in     biobricks entries at partregistry.org .     While having more choices of biobricks to choose from is incredible,     searching for and choosing the appropriate parts is becoming a challenge.     This year during the construction process of iGEM biobrick parts for     our new project, we felt the need for an application to find interacting     parts based on an input/output model to design the genetic constructs.     Using a specialized software for searching the parts registry to find     possible biobricks to include into our construct would be much easy,     fast and accurate than manual. We have shared our need with a group     of friends who are software engineers, and initiated the METU_Turkey_SOFTWARE     team where we worked together over this summer to build the BIO-Guide     software.
Scope and Future Aspects
The partregistry.org is     a continuously growing collection of standard genetic parts that can     be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems.     The Registry is based on the principle of ""get some, give some"". Registry     users benefit from using the parts and information available in the     Registry for designing their own genetically engineered biological systems.     In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will contribute     back to the information"

Finally, the last element is the stealth system. Why, and against who?
A vector, usually bigger than 60nm and potentially charged, is detected by the immune system. It is one of the principal issues of this technology. That is why stealth systems were elaborated.
All vectors do not have the same components, and the same possibilities. Each vector type has its own characteristic.
Back to top
Vector types [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
Two big vector classes exist: biological vectors and chemical vectors.
First vector type, viral vector. Viral vectors are viral particles carrying an artificially modified genome, in comparison to viral strain from which is derived the vector.
Viruses represent natural vectors the most evaluated for foreign genetic information transfer in a cell. Many viruses have been adapted in vectors: the most advanced are retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAV).
Natural viral cycle is divided in two distinct parts: infection and replication. Infection consists in the viral genome introduction into the cell. Viral gene expression leads in a second time to new viral particles formation, this is the replication.
During the production of recombinant virus, viral particles encapsidate a modified genome containing expression cassette of the therapeutic gene of interest at the place of all or a part of the viral genome.
Transduction is defined by an abortive infection by the defective recombinant vector, for the replication, which introduces only functional genetic information in a targeted cell. This vector type has an advantage, it is naturally a genetic information vector, it has then all the capacity to move in the circulation flow, to recognize a targeted marker and to enter the interest cell to integrate the therapeutic gene. But it gets drawbacks as well: its high immunogenicity, the possibility of viral genome recombination in vivo and its industrialization.
Another type of viral vector, which is bacterial: phages. These viruses have others characteristics than eukaryotic vectors. They function on the same way; they are natural vector of genetic information as well. On the other hand, native of the prokaryote world, they are safer to use, easier to produce, and less efficient face to an eukaryotic environment. Their genome should integer specific sequences, which permit them to increase their transfection efficiency. They possess, like other eukaryotic viruses, easiness to integer genetic information"

Motivation
As every house needs a cornerstone we need our binding protein library. The demand of easily accessible, fast adapting and specific binding proteins is ever-growing. To utilize the advantages of binding proteins for our project, a library, adapting the end-users (or more specific: our) needs, was designed by us.
When we were faced the challenge of designing a binding protein library, earlier this year, we glanced at existing iGEM projects and were surprised by not finding approaches in similar manner. Actually - our research proved our approach to be unprecedented in this competition. Introducing and providing one therefor contributes to the community as well. In this way, we hope to show the benefits to pave the way for a higher usage of libraries in iGEM.
Overview
To achieve generating the perfect binder an initial library is essential for our project. Thus, we set up the foundation to build our in vivo mutagenesis system on.
Our library layout is based on synthetic binding proteins as well as naturally occurring binding proteins. To start with, we chose two different scaffolds: Nanobodies and Monobodies. Each possessing advantages compared to conventional antibodies, making them suitable for our system. Read more about our used scaffolds.

Dr. Gerlinde Metz
Dr. Gerlinde Metz investigates the influence of experience and environment on behaviour and brain plasticity. Her work was the first to show that stress affects motor system function and diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This research indicated that adverse experience at any time in life can become a predisposing or precipitating factor of disease. More recently, her laboratory has developed a rat model of transgenerational prenatal stress. This model allows the study of transgenerational inheritance of health and disease and epigenetic linkages from early development to old age. Her contribution to Synbiologica will include work in animal models of disease and physiological manipulations and assays, and related behavioural studies.

Because the Macquarie’s E. coli light switch is designed to serve as a fundamental biobrick to be used in variety of biomolecular applications including screening and specific selecting of proteins and Tsinghua’s antibodies requires a simply screening and selection method. GU Xiang was very pleased to hear about that suggestion. After discussing the specific ways that how Macquarie can help Tsinghua Team to screen and select their antibodies, GU Xiang kindly accepted Macquarie Team’s offer which was the beginning of two teams’ collaboration.
Hilal, Yagiz Alp Aksoy and GU Xiang in Collaboration
They took the first step of their collaboration together by running that day’s experiments with GU Xiang at Macquarie iGEM Labs. “It was the one of the best moments of my day to help Macquarie Team with their experiments in their world- leading class level labs” commented GU Xiang. “By integrating such an important part of our projects, we, not only help each other but also complete each other’s project with harmony which is the best that we can get out of the iGEM” said Hilal. They have finished the day with social activities where they found chance to learn scents from Chinese and Aussie cultures.

About the project of virus
I. Introduction of lambda phage
1. Construction and maintenance of lysogenic life cycle
Repressor CI is the only protein produced during lysogenic life cycle. Its functions are:
1) combine to OL: represses the expression of the gene downstream the promoter pL.
2) combine to OR1: represses the expression of the gene downstream the promoter pR.
3) combine to OR2: activates the expression from promoter pRM and maintains its own expression.
Transform into lytic life cycle
Cro is responsible for preventing the synthesis of the repressor CI and this action shuts off the possibility of establishing lysogeny. It has two effects:
1. It prevents the synthesis of repressor via the maintenance circuit; that is, it prevents transcription via pRM .
2. It also inhibits the expression of early genes from both pL and pR Cro achieves its function by binding to the same operators as (el) repressor protein.
II. Idea about our project
1. Promoter: same as the promoter in lambda phage.
2. Aaptamer: try to bind the receptor the phage uses to anchor onto the membrane of bacteria.
3. Genes for defence:
1) gene for suicide.
2) gene cI.
3) gene whose products can inhibit the expression of Cro.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
Overview
We probed the static and the dynamical properties our transmitter-switch (also signal-terminator) constructs with two subsequent approaches: 1) finding a terminator and a corresponding transmitter using thermodynamically NUPACK simulations 2) investigating kinetic parameters regarding diffusion and transmitter-switch binding dynamics.
As described on the project page, one key aspect of our switches is the idea, that a RNA transmitter molecule is capable to shift the state of a switch only if its trigger site is present and its identity site corresponds to the recognition site of the switch .
We simulated the termination and antitermination properties of our transmitter-switch constructs with NUPACK and"

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and community. With this report we think that iGEM can be improved even future. We believe that iGEM has already proven its volubility for the world. However we also think that there are always possibilities to improve even future and with this setting we have written this report.
To collect data about iGEM, we have developed a questionnaire and we have send it to all the participating iGEM teams. There were over 50 teams that eventually helped us with our analysis by filling in the questionnaire.
Competition
In this chapter, the competition itself is analyzed. Firstly, quantitative and qualitative data is collected about the competition. After this we have analyzed the competition and have especially focused on potential inequality within the iGEM competition.
Based on the quantitative and qualitative data analysis, we have concluded that the medal requirements are mainly focusing on science and policy & practice.  This is understandable, since the iGEM competition is all about the use of synthetic biology in a socially responsible way. However, we think that mathematical models provide a great way to describe the functioning and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices and that modeling becomes a more and more important aspect of synthetic biology in the future.  Therefore, we advise the iGEM headquarters to include modeling in the medal requirements as well. To make sure that iGEM teams with no experience in modeling are not extremely disadvantaged, we propose to add an extra possible requirement that teams can meet to win a gold medal. In that way it is still not required for every team to do something with modeling, but teams will get an extra motivation to do something with modeling.
“Construct a mathematical model to aid in the design, understanding, and/or implementation of your project. Validate your model with measurements.”
Another point of interest, is the fact that currently 90% of the teams are able to win at least a bronze medal. This raised the question whether the medal requirements are too soft. To analyze this proposition, we have asked the opinion of the headquarters and discussed it extensively within our team and with our advisers.   Based on the analysis we believe that it is not a good option to drastically change the medal requirements in order to decrease the number of teams that win a medal. The headquarters clearly stated that the goal of the medals is to make sure that iGEM teams focuses on the aspects they believe to be important. They would like to give every team a gold medal if all teams meet the requirements. Furthermore we have noticed that a gold medal can result in a boost in fundraising. Teams that win a gold medal could probably raise funding more easily. Therefore this is also an"

Plan for Growing Up a New Liter of Tamura
Evaluation of What We've Done So Far
The results of the BCA assay and SDS PAGE indicate that while the extracted Tamura proteins are pure, the yields are quite low. When fractions 3-5 from the previous IMAC batch purification procedure were pooled together and the contents run through a Pierce concentrator, only a little remained in the filter, showing that the protein was suspended in a high volume of buffers and solvents, rendering it very dilute. The concentrated fraction had a surprisingly low weight per volume ratio, estimated to be 0.12 w/v %. Therefore, to obtain greater quantities of concentrated protein of interest, and to better assist the members on the Materials Processing Team with their co-spinning objectives, we will grow up a new liter of Tamura. This time, the correct amount of Lysis Buffer will be added to re-suspend the cell pellets. This will make a significant difference in preventing our Tamura proteins from becoming solvated and diluted in excess solutions. We will also save reagents as quantities of lysozyme, deoxycholic acid, and DNAse required will all be reduced.
Also, when using the Histidine beads last time, there was concern that not enough Tamura protein was adhering to the beads due to an overwhelming presence of excess contaminant proteins binding to the beads instead. When purifying the Tamura proteins this time, the proteins will be suspended in a lot less lysis buffer, resulting in a concentrated solution of Tamura even before using a Pierce concentrator. The increased concentration of Tamura in the volume of solvent will increase the chances of Tamura binding to the beads, limited only by the binding capacity of the beads themselves. This will increase the effectiveness of our purification protocol."

One hour following encapsulin presentation,                   no significant change concerning the shape of the dendritic cells was observed. Fluorescence channels showed a diffuse fluorescence signal throughout the field, indicating the spread of fluorescent encapsulin throughout the mixture.                   Four hours post presentation, we could see that the dendritic cells had developed extensive processes indicating maturation of these cells. Fluorescence channels revealed localization of fluorescence particles within the processes and                   around the nuclei of the dendritic cells. We believe that these fluorescent particles indicate the presence of encapsulin aggregates in the processes and in endosomal areas in dendritic cells. Two hours later (6 hours post presentation and washing), the processes were more pronounced and the fluorescence was stronger, again revealing encapsulin aggregate localization to the processes and endosomal areas of the dendritic cells .
We also created a video of a 3D reconstruction of a dendritic cell using STEVE and Fuiji to represent the 3D shape of the dendritic cell following the encapsulin vaccine presentation. The video is presented above.
Validation of neoantigen presentation on dendritic cells
For the validation of the neoantigen presentation, we tested the ability of the encapsulin vaccine template to deliver the standard immunogenic OT-1 peptide (OT-1 is a model antigens in immunological studies) to dendritic cells, and trigger                   its presentation of MHC-1 complexes on the surface of dendritic cells. For that aim, we started by cell free expression of Hexahistidine encapsulin with the SIINFEKL peptide (SIINFEKL is the actual amino acid sequence of the OT-1 peptide)                   fused to its C-terminus. We also expressed standard Hexahistidine encapsulin, and prepared a negative control (Negative Control is standard cell free expression system without any DNA template that has been purified using our heat purification                   protocol).
Immature bone marrow derived dendritic cells were obtained from the Laboratory of Biomaterials for Immunoengineering. They were prepared, plated and presented with the vaccine construct/negative control according to our Culturing/Plating                   Protocol. Following presentation, the cells were incubated for 18 hours, then immunostained for FACS according to our Immunostaining/FACS Protocol. The results are depicted in figure 3.

After that, these parts were separately ligated to linear pHT01-GFP by recombinase, and the products were separately transformed into E.coli JM110. Verification PCR was performed to select the positive clones. The positive strains were chosen to be cultured overnight and plasmids were extracted. After restriction enzyme digestion verification, the positive clones were sequenced. Object plasmids are transformed into Bacillus subtilis 168 by electroporation transformation and verification PCR was performed. After that, we use the Microplate Reader to analyze the FI of the cultures after 2 hours.

We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The first component is User Interface . Users could give their assembling of parts by drag-and-drop function and setup initial conditions as well. System behavior as output will also be shown there. The second component is database written in MoDeL , which is the kernel of our automatic modeling idea. The last component is our Core Program designed to support MoDeL language. It functions as a driver: completing system network based on users' input and data stored in our database to give dynamic analysis as output.

WebGL
To develop a cross-platform software, we use HTML5 and WebGL for the frontend. We use pixi.js as the framework of our software, and decorate the 2D-Canvas in the html <canvas> for compatibility on browsers which don’t support WebGL.
The aim of this project is to provide a fast lightweight 2D library that works across all devices.
The Pixi renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. It is also very fast.
Unit Test
We use mocha, chai and phantomjs for unit test.
Mocha is a simple, flexible, fun JavaScript test framework for node.js and browsers. For more information please view the documentation.
Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and browsers that can be delightfully paired with any JavaScript testing framework.
Phantomjs is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas and SVG.
Automated Documentation Generation
We use jsdoc to generate the code documentation and API documentation generator for JavaScript.
Back End
Separation of Front End & Back End
Unlike most websites using MVC architect, we decide to separate front end and back end completely and use REST API as the interface between them. We have made it easier for other biologists and developers to continue work on our basis by decoupling. As a consequence, developers may design their own interface style based on our back end codes and no longer worry about any conflict with present front end codes.
Django & Django REST Framework
Django is a very popular web framework with MVC architect in python, which is efficient, safe and extendable. Based on Django, we also add Django REST Framework and the function of documents generating, thus we can obtain automatically generated API documentation on ustc.software/docs
Cython & Ctypes
In order to further shorten the time of simulating, we use C programming language to rewrite our simulator. Meanwhile we use the techniques of cython and ctypes to connect the simulator with diango framework. As a result, the speed of simulation is approximately 30 times faster"

Background
The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said         that there was ""in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every         forty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated         in the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and         one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars were, last         year, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the         city, a few days since, after this wise: 'Our young men are going to         destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help         save them.'""
In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits         as never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and         large places of the state.

But few of the human race die of old age. Besides the thousand and one         diseases flesh is heir to, and the disease which Mrs. O'Flannagan said her         husband died of, viz., ""Of a Saturday 'tis that poor Mike died,"" very many         die of disappointment. More _fret_ out. Mr. Beecher said, ""It is the         fretting that wears out the machinery; friction, not the real wear.""
""Choked with passion"" is no chimera; for passion often kills the         unfortunate possessor of an irritable temper, sometimes suddenly. Care and         over-anxiety sweep away thousands annually.
Let us see how long a man should live. The horse lives twenty-five years;         the ox fifteen or twenty; the lion about twenty; the dog ten or twelve;         the rabbit eight; the guinea-pig six or seven years. These numbers all         bear a similar proportion to the time the animal takes to grow to its full        "

Most people did not even know what melatonin was when we told them about our project, so how should they know about correlated diseases?     Our human practices goal was to learn more about it and to share our newly gained knowledge with the world.      We also met other science enthusiasts to spread the word of synthetic biology and the importance of science in society.

MEB - Medicines Evaluation Board
European Drug Approval
Interview with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila about melatonin as medication and its approval.
We talked with Leon Bongers and Tania Mattila from the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) about the process of approval             for Melatonin in the Netherlands and in the European Union.
We learned that the availability of melatonin could only change through pressure of pharmaceutical companies.             They also dicussed with us the chances and risks of melatonin supplementation.
We were very surprised that there is such a strict regulation of the availability of melatonin in our country.              Circadin is a prescription medication containing melatonin, which has been approved in the whole European Union from the age of 55.
In Germany, in contrast to other countries, melatonin products as dietary supplements are strictly regulated, while in our neighbour country the Netherlands,             they are freely available.
We learned from the IGJ (Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd), the responsible institution for the approval of dietary supplements in the Netherlands,             that a melatonin-containing product is only considered a medicine if it contains at least 0,3 mg of melatonin and claims to cure a disease.
Our team member Katrin interviewed clinical assessor Tania Mattila and Leon Bongers, the Senior Regulatory Project Leader of Pharmacotherapeutic Group I,             both from the MEB. Leon Bongers is responsible for the approval of melatonin as a medicine in the"

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Notebooktest_-_-_TEXT.html," we would consider what essential pieces of information are needed for submission of a model. The idea being that one day we could have a standard registry for models. This is already being planned by iGEM, but we can use this project to provide feedback with what we'd want from it.
2) An idea of a page that gives teams an introduction to the modelling on the iGEM website in the same way we have intros to the lab work. This would involve video tutorials on the main programmes used in iGEM. Other teams liked the idea and would consider doing one for the software they are using during the summer. Between the 8 teams we have experts in 10 different pieces of software!
It appears big things could come from this project!
Week 7
This week’s been a quiet one, but it’s given some fairly substantial progress for the experimental and human practice teams.
Experimentally, the FAS module arrived from Prof Mattheos Koffas of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. We successfully extracted lots of it (78ng/µl!). This FAS module will help increase fatty acid synthesis in our E. coli so we get a greater yield of product. We are incredibly grateful for Prof Koffas for his generosity in donating this module, as this will be a big help to our project.
In human practice news, the team first had a meeting with James Leigh, a chemistry PhD student who has worked with the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable. He told the team some advice about how to organise a roundtable for a possible talk with industry we have in mind. It sounds like a lot of work, so we’re not sure if this is going to be a viable idea in the timescale we have left. There was also a meeting with Dr Catherine Rhodes, an expert in science ethics. She made us consider the rights needed to keep the Malaysian and Indonesian economies stable, and possible patenting issues with our project.
Even more economic progress was made (having Matt on the team was definitely a good decision!). We got concrete figures showing there is a link between palm oil growth and deforestation, that there is going to be a sharp rise in the price of naturally grown palm oil in the future (2020 and to go with this we made a graph to show the increase in Crude Palm Oil prices since 2005, which we plan to extrapolate.

Steps and Result
We first grew cells in LB broth overnight. Then we cultured cells from the same tube with different concentrations of uric acid-LB mixed. We then incubate the cells for 1 hour and then pipette them into the 96-well plate. After that, we put it into the plate reader to measure the green fluorescence level.
The result is shown as below (Click to see raw data).
There is also no significant trend shown. When higher concentrations of uric acid are added, the amount of GFP measured is similar to that in lower concentration. Therefore, we tried to figure out the problem. After double checking the sequence, we found out that the DNA sequence we ordered from IDT is different from what we designed, in which the sequence 'tactagag' is missing. GFP E0040, Terminator B0010, K2197302 and K2197303 are affected.  Referring to the mechanism of the promoter, if HucO is missing, the repressor protein mUTS can not bind to it. Thus, the amount of GFP expression cannot be restricted and no trend can be shown. Also, the GFP is seriously affected, therefore, GFP cannot be expressed.
Assay B
Assay C
Design
Assay C is an experiment designed to prove the validity of BBa_K2197400. By incubating engineered cells (BBa_K2197400) and Competent cells with different concentrations of uric acid, then adding engineered cells (BBa_K2197300) after 30 minutes, we measure the Green fluorescence level in a plate reader. We expect that the columns with engineered cells (BBa_K2197400) will have less green fluorescence expressed when comparing to the column containing competent cells. As theoretically, the higher the concentration is, the more the smUOX will be expressed and this will catalyse uric acid into allantoin. So by adding engineered cells (BBa_K2197300) which expresses more GFP when there is more uric acid, the green fluorescence level of the columns with engineered cells(BBa_K2197400) will be lower than the columns with competent cells although they were in the same concentration at the beginning
Steps and Result
We first pipette the cells (BBa_2197400, competent cells) into different concentrations of uric acid and incubate them in 96 well plate for 30 minutes. After that, we add in engineered cells (BBa_K2197300) into the wells and incubate them for another 30 minutes."

An excellent measure he suggested us was to eventually plan to extract the hypopharyngeal glands in bees and determine if our AMPs are entering these glands.
He believes okay for us to supply our peptides and then try to see if they help bees resist foulbrood, as for now, he thinks it's an excellent first step if we can produce some material and prove it to work on the laboratory, he mentioned that's a paper already. He emphasized is not easy to have real larvae on the laboratory.
We were wondering his opinion whether our AMPs could affect the larvae negatively in their development or worker bees in general. He compared or product to a human antibiotic, it kills the disease, but it also eliminates part of its microbiota, he thinks we could mention it, but we would have to test these possibilities experimentally and see what happens. He stated antibiotic treatments available now for foulbrood not always work, and they could contaminate the honey. Regarding the possibility of our AMPs getting into the honey, he thinks there are going to be low levels of our peptides, and they are going to be on the larvae, he doesn't think it's going to be a problem our AMPs getting to the honey.
If we did get to test within larvae, we asked him which would be an optimum method to find out if our peptides are getting to the developing brood.
Consider two scenarios, feeding the larvae in vitro, where we won't be making use of a nurse bee or the second scenario where the nurse bee feeds the larvae.
See if our peptides get into the worker jelly; we can look at the hypopharyngeal glands and take a worker jelly sample from the cells where larvae are swirling.
Finally, compare to a control
If we want to see if our AMPs are getting into the food nurse bees are feeding the larvae in the colony, we would have to use a colony or a mini colony, which is more complicated, he said.
""Many people have been working on ways to protect the bees, they have different systems they are using, but none of these experiments involve all these different steps you are needing because it's very ambitious and requires much time"". He thinks if we can get the peptides off our bacterium and then show that they inhibit P. larvae and M. plutonius, we can talk about the next steps on a plan.
We were wondering if our peptides could activate some biochemical signal or have the larvae reject them"
