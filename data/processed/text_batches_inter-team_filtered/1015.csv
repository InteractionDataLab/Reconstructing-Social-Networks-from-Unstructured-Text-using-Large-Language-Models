SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Ethic_-_-_TEXT.html,"ces first to interest in finality of this science. What are we trying to do? Are we looking to reach a perfection state? When we are working for the improvement of a living organism, in addition to technical difficulties, we have to ask if what are we doing is desirable. Without the egocentric drifts we can easily imagine, we could try to correct our weaknesses, handicap, diseases. Dorothée Benoit Browaeys put in advance that the context can change a « tare » in asset: « there are diseases which give you certain advantages. So to take up the titer of Alain Gras’ book on the fragility of the power, we could speak of the power of fragility ».
However, potentials advantages seem sometimes negligible compared to the handicap: it is for example the case when we are affected by the HIV. And the engendered disease will not be controled, in Willy Rozenbaum opinion, « if we are not using synthetic biology ». More generally, this last one does not imagine « how we could do without it if we want to go towards an improvement of the human condition». The perfection myth seems not to worry him, because he affirms that we are still very vulnerable and far to be perfect.

Modification of the living representation
Searching to synthesize and modify fundamentally organisms push to wonder about the definition itself of the living. Craig Venter affirms that « we pass from the capacity to read our genetic code to the capacity to write it». But understanding and generating life mechanism can demistify it; and the fact to create living machines, in a precise goal, risk to give us a determinist vision of the living. Thierry Magnin wonders « in a context where life is assemble with bricks, what is doing the real difference between vegetal machinery, animal machinery and human machinery? ». After all, we can consider the difference between the three does not come from interactions between « bricks » which compose them.  « How can I recognize a certain dignity of Living if all is built by blocs » ?
Synthetic biology can reveal a game aspect, which can alter the respect that we carry to living organism : to quote one more time Thierry Magnin, « The things with I am used to play, I often have difficulties to respect it». We can create « pieces » of living organisms without of their context, stock, reproduce, transmit and assemble them. If we create biologic systems like we assemble “legos”,"

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," The activity of the NodC enzyme was evaluated via two different assays.
UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay
The other assay was the UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay from Promega. The Assay was used in order to test the functionality of the NodC enzyme. NodC is an N-acetylglucosamine transferase that uses UDP-GlcNAc as donor molecule. The NodC transfers N-acetylglucosamine from the UDP-GlcNAc to single N-acetylglucosamine bricks and UDP is set free. The free UDP is converted to ATP via a UDP Detection Reagent. This ATP generates light in a luciferase reaction which can be measured using a luminometer [13] .

Figure 8. Princip of the UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay. The NodC uses UDP-GlcNAc as donor molecule and transfers N-acetylglucosamine from the UDP-GlcNAc to single N-acetylglucosamine bricks and UDP. The free UDP is converted to ATP and the ATP generates light in a luciferase reaction. [13] .
Results
Expression and Purification
The nodC gene was expressed under the control of constitutive Anderson promoter (BBa_K2380025) and by arabinose-inducible AraC promoter (BBa_K808000) in E. coli Top10. Due to the E. coli cell's own proteins it was not possible to verify the NodC protein clearly. During the overexpression of the desired protein the cell's own proteins have also more time to express. To verify the expression of the NodC enzyme a SDS-PAGE was done after the purification instead (Figure 9).
We tagged the enzyme with a His-tag and purified the NodC enzyme via an ÄKTA system . The fractions were collected and the purity was examined via a SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE shows a band at 21 kDA (Figure 9, red arrow) which fits to our protein size. The verification was done by using these fractions for a functional assay for the enzyme. The assay shows enzyme activity and therefore the successful expression.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Modeling#Tutorial_-_-_TEXT.html,"\[S + E\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}C_{1}\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}C_{2}\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}P + E\]
In this system \(S\) represents our substrate, \(E\) our enzyme, \(C_{1}\) our enzyme-substrate complex, \(C_{2}\) our enzyme-product complex, and \(P\) our product.
Initially we will make two simplifications. Firstly, we will combine \(C_{1}\) and C2 into a single complex, \(C\), as we will assume that the time-scale of the conversion \(C_{1}\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}C_{2}\) is much faster than that of the association and dissociation events. Secondly, we will assume that the product never binds with the free enzyme. These two assumptions lead to the simplified network:
\[S + E\mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{k_{1}}_{k_{-1}}}C\mathop{\rightarrow}^{k_{2}}P + E\]
Using the laws of mass action (detailed above) we arrive at the following differential equation model:
\[\dfrac{d}{dt}s(t)=-k_{1}s(t)e(t) + k_{-1}c(t)\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}e(t)=k_{-1}c(t) - k_{1}s(t)e(t) + k_{2}c(t)\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}c(t)=-k_{-1}c(t) + k_{1}s(t)e(t) - k_{2}c(t)\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}p(t) = k_{2}c(t)\]
Concentrations are denoted as the lowercase letter eg the concentration of \(S\) is given by \(s\).
You may have spotted that the enzyme is not consumed in this series of reactions. Therefore the total amount of enzyme remains constant. We reflect this in the expression \(e_{T}=e+c\). We can now use this expression to eliminate \(e(t)\) from our model, leaving:
\[\dfrac{d}{dt}s(t)=-k_{1}s(t)(e_{T}-c(t)) + k_{-1}c(t)\]                              \[\dfrac{d}{dt}c(t)=-k_{-1}c(t) + k_{1"

Finally, incubated a melanin colony in 5 mL of 100ug/ml Ampicillin, 15 ug/ml CuSO4, 0.3 mg/mL tyrosine, 1mM IPTG over the weekend in preparation for pigment characterisation using the plate reader.
Progress on carotenoids (Friday)
Mini-prep (using Zyppy Plasmid MINI PREP kit) were performed for K118014 (rbs+CrtE), K118006 (rbs+CrtB), K118005 (rbs+CrtI), K118013 (rbs+CrtY), K152005 (CrtEBIY), R0011, and pPCB15 (all in TOP10) using preparation from Thursday.
Carotene extration were performed on overnight cultures for pPCB15 in original MG1655 (""MG1655""), pPCB15 in MG1655 PT5-dxs,idi,ispBDF (""MG1655 PT5""), pPCB15 in TOP10, K152005 in TOP10 and R0011 in TOP10 (as control), using "" Carotene extraction with acetone "" protocol.
The photo below shows the results of extraction with acetone. Visual inspection put the order of intensity of yellow colour as: pPCB15 in TOP10 < pPCB15 in MG1655 < pPCB15 in MG1655 PT5. This is consistent with the fact that the FPP flux increases in same order in these strains.
Measurement using microplate reader was performed on both intact cells (from overnight culture) and carotene extract. A full spectrum scan was taken, covering 450 nm (absorbance by carotene) and 600 nm (cell density). Results were as follows:
In the top graph showing absorbance spectrum of intact cells, there was no distinct peak at 450 nm (expected absorbance of beta-carotene). The OD 600 nm values, which indicate cell density, were also different for different cells. This indicated that the measurements on intact cells were unsuitable for detecting differences in carotene production.
In the bottom graph showing absorbance spectrum of carotene extract in acetone, there were two distinct peaks, one at about 450 nm (beta"

Aim
- To share knowledge about synthetic biology
- To change people’s misleading attitudes towards GMOs and synthetic biology field acknowledged from the feedbacks from focus groups in Science Park
Description
Since we got feedbacks from Science Park’s participants, the results from survey implies that people’s attitudes prone more to the negative impact of GMOs, even though they did not have in depth understanding regarding biological engineered product. We therefore created an article tackling this problem, and posted on facebook where several followers are from Science Park events. We wish this article can more or less contributes to people’s well-thought point of view.

BBa_K2868000
Composite Part T7 CsgA-6xhistag expression
Designed by Cale Lester. This composite part consists of a T7 promoter with RBS (BBa_K525998), followed by a coding region for csgA (BBa_K1583000) with a His-Tag expressed at the end, an ochre stop codon, and then a BglII cut site followed by a T7 terminator (BBa_K731721). The construct constitutively produces the amyloid-forming E.coli curlin-precursor protein csgA when restriction ligated into a backbone plasmid of choice. The his-tag allows for the protein product to be purified with standard his-tag protein purification methods. Because of the T7 promoter and RBS, for protein production this construct must be used in T7 cell lines like BL21 that produce T7 RNA polymerase. The SalI and BglII cut sites also allow for the replacement with a desired coding region after the construct is successfully in a plasmid backbone.
BBa_K2868011
Composite Part T7 CBD-6xhistag expression
Designed by Cale Lester. This part contains the genetic machinery to produce a chitin binding protein that is linked with a his-tag, with a T7 promoter and TE1 terminator.
BBa_K2868014
HHTC-Re
Designed by Advait Patil. This is a version of the peptide computationally designed by Kozisek et al. (Chemistry, 2008) to bind to copper (HHTC). This metal binding domain has had amino acids replaced for specificity, and has a flexible GSGGSG linker attached to allow for spacing for proper folding of the constituent domains in any fusion proteins being created.

Overview
A great benefit for iGEM competitions is the possibility to form smaller groups within a team which have their own responsible tasks. Still, for the outcome of a successful teamwork it is crucial to share all methods which were used to perform the experiments and to share all results for further discussions and experiments. For this purpose, an entire documentation of our work is an essential part of the project.
This section contains all data concerning our total experimental progress. These include weekly protocols from the work in the lab (see ""Lab Notebook” ), all oligonucleotide sequences for the design of the primers (see ""Primers” ), and lab protocols from previous iGEM teams which were used especially in the beginning of our work (see ""Lab Protocols” ). Additionally, all buffers and media which were prepared are listed under the section “Media and Buffers” ."

Observing Fluorescent Gene Stability
Introduction
One of the major issues facing genetic engineering is the overall longevity of genetic devices once inserted into organisms. An organism can be modified, but that does not ensure that the modification will last. Subsequent generations of modified organisms often lose or “break” the genetic device through mutations. Mutations that cause a device to break (or otherwise lose part of their functionality) decrease the metabolic load of that organism. This allows the mutant and its descendants to replicate and grow faster than the originally modified organism, allowing the “broken” mutant to overtake a population.
The stability of the sequence was the focus of our research over the course of the summer. We sought to identify sequences that contribute to the relative instability of genetic devices so they can be used to predict the longevity of a genetic device as well as be taken into account when creating and modifying such devices. In the spring of 2015, E. coli was transformed using various fluorescent genes and monitored for breakage, with varying results depending on the plasmid used. Five fluorescent proteins: Yellow fluorescent protein (BBa_K592101), Super-folder Yellow fluorescent protein (BBa_K864100),  Engineered Yellow fluorescent protein (BBa_E0030), Enhanced Cyan fluorescent protein (BBa_E0020), and Blue fluorescent protein (BBa_592100).
Understanding what leads to genetic instability could lead to more stable devices and thus could increase the longevity of genetically modified organisms.  Since genetic stability can be problematic for any work involving synthetic biology, we wanted to start by determining what sequence motifs make a genetic device unstable. So, in the spring, we began an experiment to study genetic instability of different plasmids in E. coli. We designed and transformed 14 plasmids into TOP10 E. coli. Then, we propagated the strains until either fluorescence was lost or the experiment was concluded.

The 1.5% agarose was prepared and poured in the same way as the DNA gel electrophoresis protocol suggests. The samples were then added to the wells in the way described above; the voltage was set to 60mv and left for 15-20 minutes. The photograph obtained from the resulting gel can be seen in the 'Results' section.
Results
Stochastic Switch Team
Today we ran the sac and ara PCR products from yesterday on an 0.8% agarose gel in order to determine whether they were worth using the clean up kit on. We ran two PCRs for each set of primers so that resulting fragments could be combined for a more successful ligation. As it happens there was a good result for the sac product but no fully clear bands for the ara product. However both PCR products for sac and ara were combined and the PCR clean up procedure was carried out according to the protocol. Following clean up a digest was done on both products using EcoRI and SpeI. This was done using the fast digest enzymes and buffer, however the reactions were left for an hour.  Rather than running these products on a wide well agarose gel the PCR clean up procedure was carried out to save time and avoid losing as much product. The resulting elutions were labaeeled and put into the -20 freezer in the midi-preps box.
Goksel carried out an E.coli transformation using the ligation product from yesterday (pSB1AT3 + sspb) however we are unsure whether the protocol used was appropriate for the E.coli strains used. For this reason on Monday we will try ligating all three fragments (sac, ara as well as sspb) with the pSB1AT3 backbone again. For this we will try the new Fast Ligation/Transformation kit to try to save time.

We carried out the E. coli transformation using commercial cells with ligated pSB1AT3 + sspB. We prepared four tubes with the following mix

Safety in the lab
Equipment
A conventional lab coat, closed with long sleeves
Closed shoes
Gloves
Glasses if needed (UV exposure, hot water or chemical handling)
Waste
Different trash containers are available in the lab:
One for biological waste (yellow).
This waste will be autoclaved before being thrown out.
One for common waste (green or orange).
Storage
We have three cupboards, each one dedicated to a different kind of chemical product we use:
Flammable products
Acids
Bases
Rules
Our workspace is divided in two rooms. We have a break room where no biological material is brought. In this room, we are able to eat and drink (a fridge, a kettle and a coffeemaker are available)  but it is also the space where we hold our meetings and work on our computers.  On the contrary, in the lab, we have to wear protective equipment and respect basic rules:
No smoking (all rooms)
No drinks or food
Obligation to wear a closed cotton lab coat
Obligation to wear closed shoes
Long hair must be tied up
Oral pipetting of any substance is prohibited in any laboratory
Regular handwashing
In some cases (UV light, projection risk), obligation to wear protection glasses
Apparatus
Chemical hood
We used the chemical hood when we had to manipulate dangerous and volatile chemicals. For example, all manipulations dealing with formic and butyric acid were done under such a hood.
Water-bathes
The water-bathes were used extensively (transformation, digestion, etc.). However, they can be dangerous because of the exposition to hot or even boiling water. To prevent the burning risk associated with heat, steam and projections, we used special gloves. We made sure to always check that the water-bathes were turned off at the end of the day.
Biological safety cabinet
To manipulate into a sterile area and thus avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms we used a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER – Ultrasafe). The bench of the BSC was cleaned with ethanol before and after each manipulation. We also cleaned the BSC completely every two weeks.
Ethidium Bromide
Dark room
We have a dark room dedicated to the use of EtBr and UV. This room is key-closed and everyone entering the room has to wear gloves, glasses and a lab coat. Everything in direct contact with something in this room has to stay there.
Waste
Two specific trash cans are dedicated to the gloves or paper and the contaminated agarose"

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Shenzhen University international genetically engineered
     machine competition (iGEM) questionnaire
Our investigation is mainly propaganda of synthetic biology, iGEM, and the investigation on cellulase understanding people. We designed a total of 12 questions. Here are some of the survey results.
Q1  Do you know iGEM ?
From the survey results, a majority of people do not understand the iGEM, about accounted for only about twenty percent. Description of iGEM in Chinese visibility is not high, but it can be understood. Because of this competition is the contest for university students, Chinese higher education degree is not universal, and biology students in China less.
Q2 what is your attitude to gene engineering technology?
From the result of the survey, more than seventy percent of the people support the gene engineering technology. That gene technology more good than harm. That people still hope that the support of gene technology, gene technology will develop better and better.
Q3   Do you think what is the application of cellulase?
Cellulase was applied in swage treatment, food industry, paper industry, most of the people know. Only a few people think that used in metallurgy industry and electronic industry, estimated their cultural level is not high, there is no concept of cellulase. Generally speaking, everyone on the cellulase application areas understand well, that our project is close to the practical application.
Q4 What do you think the development of Bio Industry in twenty-first Century?
Although said Bio Industry in twenty-first Century the most development potential of the industry, but because of the slow development of China in this regard, the domestic bio industry employment rate is low, the research progress of the biological aspects of the very slow. Although the people know that this is a sunrise industry, but because of the domestic development, people is not high to the biological industry confidence.
Q5 Using synthetic biology method, create an energy producing alkaline cellulase ""super bacteria"" is used to reduce the pollution of paper-making process on the environment, Do you think it"
Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," steady flow of repressor produced, the concentration distribution will get constant in the end. The results are shown in figure3.2.
The average distance (relative) between the promoter and the repressor source is about 0.17 and the corresponding concentration (relative) is 0.6577 which means when the repressor gets to the promoter, its concentration decreases more than 33 percent. It gives us an reasonable explanation to the problem why all the promoters are leaked seriously. According to the enlightenment of the model, we take two kinds of measures to ease the problem.
First, we can increase the plasmid copy number so as to increase the dense of the point sources and reduce the average distance.
Second, we can use only one kind of plasmid for both repressor production and the integrase production, so the source of the repressor will get extremely close to the promoter.
Figure 3.2 | The concentration distribution describes the steady relative concentration of the integrase varies with the relative position to the plasmid which we consider as the point source of repressor production in E.coli. The arrow marks out the average distance between the promoter and the point source as well as the corresponding concentration. We suppose both the average radius of the cell and the concentration of the point source as the unit 1.
In general, the model not only helped us to demonstrate and analyze our project, but also gives us a vigorous tool to solve the unexpected problem. You can see more detailed mathematical demonstration at the back of each part.

Members of the iGEM team presented to WISEST Teacher Appreciation Day, Aug 14, 2012, discussing the iGEM program and our project. WISEST is a U of A training program aimed at encouraging the attraction, retention and advancement for women of all ages in science, engineering and technology.
We also presented at the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines competition on Sep 15-16, 2012. aGEM, currently in its fourth year, is a western Canada gathering of iGEM teams, where they present and receive feedback from a star-studded panel of judges. Although patterned after iGEM, aGEM attracts its own audience, including more than 100 largely local luminaries who came to hear about advancements in synthetic biology at the hands of Canadian students. Although this year Calgary won aGEM (boo! hiss! the University of Calgary is a traditional rival to the University of Alberta), we received encouragement and a slate of useful suggestions for the remainder of our project.
High school students who took part in our team will be an important component of our outreach. Their experience, paired with the fact that they are still active in the local high school community will allow them to be powerful proponents of high school iGEM, and will hopefully allow them to have a part in setting up future high school iGEM teams in Edmonton.

""With great powers comes great responsibility."" – Benjamin Parker (Uncle Ben).
We know the importance of keeping genetically modified organisms under control. Ideally, modified genetic material should be unable to spread and organisms containing it should be easily distinguishable from wild type. Keeping this in mind, we created a biosafety module to be used in plants which will be available for future iGEM teams working with plants. Our biosafety module combines two biosafety strategies: identity preservation and male sterility.
Identity preservation enables an easy identification of the genetically modified organism. We expressed SlANT1 and SlJAF13 genes from tomato, which code for transcription factors that activate synthesis of anthocyanines [1], coloured compounds found in plants. The introduction of this element in the biosafety module generates differentially coloured plants (Figures 1 and 2). NRP-UEA-Norwich , and it is also used in their project “Green Canary”.
Figure 1.Anthocyanin accumulation in a N benthamiana plant.
Figure 2. Dark purple leaf with induced anthocyanin accumulation.
Male sterility makes impossible the dispersion of genetic material using pollen as the vehicle or by seeds result of self-pollination. In order to achieve this dispersion restriction, we integrated the active peptide of barnase, a RNAse from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, (Biobricks accession code BBa_I716211) under the regulation of the tapetum-specific promoter TA29 [1]. Both components are very well documented since TA29 has been used by a large number of researchers [2-6] and barnase has also been used under the regulation of different promoters [7,8]. We chose this strategy because it had been previously used in our laboratory with satisfactory results [9].
Our Biosafety module is our major present for future iGEM teams. It can be applied"
York,2017,Team:York#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," plate readers. Readings taken ~24hours manually.
Results: C. reinhardtii is able to tolerate an increase of ethanol to at the most 3.2% (as a portion of media). Given rates of increase it seems that it could tolerate much higher concentrations. This is encouraging, as ethanol resistance of the C. reinhardtii would likely be sufficient to survive upper limits of the LW06 strain’s ethanol production. Interestingly, C. reinhardtii experiences better growth at higher concentrations of ethanol, there is not a clear reason this is the case. Addition of ethanol to the media may have made growth conditions more amenable to C. reinhardtii. There is some chance that the ethanol may have evaporated which, while possible, is unlikely due to the sealing of the plate. Overall, it seems that C. reinhardtii would be able to survive the proposed amount of ethanol that could be produced by the LW06.
Co-culture of C. reinhardtii and E. coli LW06
There's a large growth disparity between the two organisms [3][4], so we also performed an experiment to check if LW06 would vastly outperform C. reinhardtii on all types of media.
Growth in a Co-culture
Figure 13: Cell counts for LW06 in each culture via spread plating at 104 dilutions.
Figure 14: Cell counts for C. reinhardtii via manual haemocytometer microscope cell counting at a 104 dilution.
Figure 15: Overlaid cell counts for the co-culture. LW06 represented by blue points and C. reinhardtii by orange.
Results: Overall LW06 outperforms C. reinhardtii in all but one of the cultures (Tube 4). It is encouraging to see LW06 perform well on TP.Maltose and TAP.Maltose, although the latter may have been due to the presence of a second carbon source in the form of acetate. It is odd that in every one of the experiments tube that were inoculated with 100 μl of 0.5-1.0 OD LW06 that the cell counts are considerably lower. It seems that the initial starting cell density may have inhibited growth but it is not clear why this effect would continue when dispersed in the co-culture. Alternatively, an unknown error may have occurred at some point during inoculation. From the results it is clear that, if it was some unknown or unnoticed error, it was made consistently in every one of the co-cultures with 100 μL inoculation. No relevant conclusions"

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," we bio-fused a domain of the toxin hemolysin A with a protein called phasin. Phasin is a protein used in R. eutropha that binds to PHB granules in order to regulate their size. Hemolysin A is the exotoxin secreted by hemolysin B and hemolysin D. By using only a short signal domain of the protein, we can tag the bio-fused protein for secretion without making it toxic. The fused phasin-hemolysin protein will keep its ability to attach to the surface of PHB granulates, through non-covalent interaction and thereby target the PHB for secretion RAHMAN, A., LINTON, E., HATCH, A. D., SIMS, R. C. & MILLER, C. D. 2013. Secretion of polyhydroxybutyrate in Escherichia coli using a synthetic biological engineering approach. Journal of Biological Engineering, 7. . The event will reduce the use of toxic and environmentally straining chemicals and eventually it could lead to a continuous system. In addition phasin has low binding specificity, thus the system can be used for other PHA’s (polyhydroxyalkanoates) Hanisch, J., et al. (2006). ""The Ralstonia eutropha H16 phasin PhaP1 is targeted to intracellular triacylglycerol inclusions in Rhodococcus opacus PD630 and Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, and provides an anchor to target other proteins."" Microbiology 152(Pt 11): 3271-3280. . The idea of a secretion system has already been explored by the iGEM Utah Team 2009 and have been processed in earlier studies from which we were inspired to develop our secretion system RAHMAN, A., LINTON, E., HATCH, A. D., SIMS, R. C. & MILLER, C. D. 2013. Secretion of polyhydroxybutyrate in Escherichia coli using a synthetic biological engineering approach. Journal of Biological Engineering, 7. . Plastic companies are very interested in use of PHB as the material in their products, but are not doing it currently because of the price of the PHB production. Using our secretion system it would be possible optimize the production of PHB, making it more attractive for the respective companies. For further details check out the assembly of the secretion system .

Lyon-INSA-ENS,2011,Team:Lyon-INSA-ENS#Project#IndustrializationFr_-_-_TEXT.html,"Les opérateurs d'exploitation vérifient quotidiennement le bon fonctionnement des centrales , et calibrent la puissance du réacteur selon le besoin du réseau électrique. Ils gèrent éqalement les activités nécessaires à l'entretien, la modernisation et l'extension de la durée de vie des centrales nucléaires. Les pannes sont des points importants de cette activité. Lors de l'arrêt des réacteurs, les opérateurs coordonnent le changement des barres d'uranium et prévoient également des phases de maintenance de grande envergure.
En aval,  la structure est divisée en deux activités différentes: le traitement des combustibles usés (recyclage en MOX pour une réutilisation), et la planification de la fin de vie des installations nucléaires (le démantèlement et le réaménagement de territoires).
En raison de l'importance des moyens financiers et technologiques nécessaires au développement d'une entreprise dans le domaine, la menace de nouveaux concurrents électronucléaire (nouvelles entreprises entrant sur le marché) est faible. Par conséquent, seuls quelques grands groupes se partagent les quatre lignes d'affaires(AREVA, EDF, GE Energy ou Mitsubishi). Cependant la concurrence est très forte puisque que les contrats sont rares et conséquents.
Dans ce domaine, les pressions extérieures sont particulièrement fortes. L'influence politique est assez importante: en France, le nucléaire tient une place primordiale, mais la politique peut à tout moment décider de favoriser d'autres moyens de production d'électricité, comme en Allemagne (solaire, éolienne, etc.). Par conséquent, le rôle des pouvoirs publiques dans différents pays ainsi que celui des organisations internationales (par exemple l'AIEA, l'ANDRA) est crucial. Ce sont eux qui décident et fixent les règles et directives. L'application des accords contre le réchauffement climatique par les pouvoirs publiques (Kyoto, Copenhague) peut également avoir une incidence directe et positive sur le domaine de l'électronucléaire. En effet, son impact CO2 est nul dans la production d'électricité.

Team ECUST
As high school students, we were not so familiar with the competition and the techniques it requires. Thus the mentoring from Team ECUST contributed a lot towards our understanding of the whole process and necessary steps. Moreover, ECUST offered us instructions and experimental equipment for the interlab session, which is essential for medals.
In return, we joined the 3+ net initiative they started. 3+ net is a collaboration&human practise project for putting forward guidelines for better understanding of our situation and projects. Our major role is to help with the Society+ part which call for collected opinions from different groups. With the mutual focus of environment pollution, we constructed a survey about public opinions towards bioengineering approach of solving pollution. Within a week, we were able to receive more than 500 questionnaires filled out from all age groups. By helping with surveys making and data analyze, our mutual bonds for advocating the potential of bioengineering is solidified.
Meet up with SHSID_China and SUIS-Shanghai
On July 21st, 2018, we brought together two other teams, SHSID_China and SUIS-Shanghai to discuss our project progression. Within an afternoon, we exchanged ideas about our projects and share mutual difficulties for possible solution. With questions and suggestions, we were able to identify each others’ strengths and flaws, seeking improvements. Future collaboration plans were also raised.
Mock presentation with SHSU_China and SHSID_China
On October 14th, 2018, our team met up with SHSU_China and SHSID_China at Fudan University for mock presentations as preparations for the final delivery at the Giant Jamboree. Feedback from each teams is exchanged and we gained more insights into possible impurities of our project. More experiences about human practise, wiki building and modelling are also shared in order to help each other seeking more improvements."

Human Practices 2016
Innovation in Disruptive Technologies
DNA origami is an example of disruptive technology, where innovation impacts pre existing value networks and generates a new market place. The implications behind the technology are usually broad and leads to accelerated development of varied downstream technologies. For example, the dNANO project is an application of DNA origami that aims to create standardized nano circuits which builds off the work of DNA origami. After speaking to Dr.Ferguson Pell, a biomedical engineer at the University of Alberta, adoption of these new technologies are hampered by the cost and accessibility at the time. Both these factors make early adoption of innovation unfeasible and therefore growth in these areas are likewise slow. For example, the field of synthetic biology has become a recent field exploration due to disruptive innovations in low cost sequencing and nucleotide synthesis making it economically feasible for innovators to innovate.
Our team recognized limitations which made DNA origami difficult to work with such as abberent base pair interactions, a lack of readily accessible resources, a lack of standardized documentation for structure construction and a community that is able to foster exploration with DNA origami. So we aimed to develop an open source repository for DNA origami. Open sourcing is a model in which information is able to be shared amongst a developer community composed of early adopters and enthusiasts, the benefit being knowledge spreading leading to rapid development. We then played around with the idea of sending DNA origami as a biobrick as iGEM has its own infrastructure for open source development. However, after realising the biobrick standard was incompatible with DNA origami, we decided to create our own initiative, the DNA origami library. Our tentative library would serve as a catalogue of entries for DNA origami shapes.
Each entry in the library will then contain the following:
Sequence of the template strand
Sequence of staples
An in silico visualization of the structure
A TEM of the actual structure
A detailed protocol that was utilized in the constructions. Parameters such as oligo concentrations and incubations will be some of the mandatory requirements included in each entry
Any other notes that may assist in reproducibility the structure folding"

1.1 Source
2 2. sfGFP collection
This year, we constructed 12 composite Parts, including functional pigment proteins and fluorescence proteins driven by bacterial promoters. Our aim is to construct plasmids express proteins that can be seen by naked eyes without special devices, and thus are friendly to all labs without limitation on conditions. More importantly, our collections are convenient to use as backbones for construction of BioBricks and other plasmids.
1. Chromoprotein collection
We successfully constructed 8 plasmids with various pigment coding sequence, including eforRed, gfasPurple, FwYellow and SpisPink.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-nuc_-_-_TEXT.html,"uc (supernatant and pellet in a 1:1 ratio) inhibits biofilm formation by S. aureus. The poor readout of the negative control implicates that the test is invalid. However, the absorbance of biofilm increases as volume of Nuc increases, and the negative control shows low values. There is a significant difference between the negative control and 50 ul of Nuc.
Demonstrating efficient biofilm dispersal by Nuc
Biofilm dispersal by Nuc is demonstrated using crystal violet assays; one with P. aeruginosa as the biofilm-producer, and the other with S. aureus. Induced BL21(DE3) cell lysate samples (both debris pellet resuspension and supernatant) are used for the experiment. The biofilm is treated with 1 µl, 5 µl, 10 µl, or 20 µl of Nuc sample. Differences between the negative control and Nuc are evaluated using the student’s t-test. A p-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.
Biofilm assay: First attempt [❌]
The samples from supernatants are labelled ""Nuc S"". The samples from the pellets were contaminated and are not shown in the results.
Figure 10. Absorbance measured for different treatments of Nuc using P. aeruginosa as biofilm-producer.
The graph illustrates how different volumes of Nuc dispersed biofilm formed by P. aeruginosa. There is a significant difference (p=0.023) between the negative control and 1 µl of Nuc treatment. Notably, the absorbance, associated with the amount of biofilm present, decreases as the amount of negative control increases. This may be due to contamination or elution or dispersal of biofilm because of the increased amount of fluid per se in the treatment.
Figure 11. Absorbance measured for different treatments of Nuc using S. aureus as biofilm-producer.
The graph illustrates how different volumes of Nuc dispersed biofilm formed by S. aureus. There is a significant difference between 5 µl of negative control and 5 µl of Nuc S.
Biofilm assay: Second attempt [✔️]
The second attempt of dispersing biofilm was similar to the first. However, this time a combination of pellet and supernatant was used as treatment with the ratio 1:1, e.g. for 5 µl treatment, 2.5 µl of each was used. For this attempt the biofilm was treated with"

AND GATE-input（AHL+green light)
The circuit to receive input signals is composed of AND GATE, quorum sensing promoter and light-controlled promoter. After being induced by AHL, pLuxR promoter activates the expression of T7 RNA polymerase (T7 ptag) which contains two  amber mutations. After being induced by green light, PcpcG2 promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, when AHL and green light exist together, T7 RNA polymerase will be expressed, and then T7 promoter will be activated to express the downstream gene.

Could make clothes with inherent UV protection, but they would all be red.... (Text by Nikki)
Sci-Fi prodigiosin ideas (developed by Rebekka, Nick and CJ from the RCA):
- Use prodigiosin (red pigment) as the new ""colour of health"" (know something is sterile rather than assume it is)
- Possible future uses: in decontamination/ as a ""panic room""/ sterile hospice -possible future products: hand gel, clothing (e.g. protective suits in bioreactor plants), decontamination paint (in hospitals etc)
- Actual uses: anti-cancer (could be in a red drip, red pill?), anti-malarial (drug verification because pigment colour is hard to fake) Eventually, this idea was scratched because optimising the production pathway does not contain enough synthetic biology. In addition,"

While I have been involved with many aspects of iGEM, I really enjoy working on human practices and seeing how synthetic biology has an impact on the community. After I graduate, I hope to pursue a Master’s in genetic counselling.

Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute
My first High School iGEM experience was actually when I was in grade 12 and participated on the Lethbridge High School iGEM team in 2012. I then went on to be an advisor to the high school team in 2013 when I started my undergraduate program. I am excited to be back instructing HS iGEM again! My favourite part about iGEM is designing genetic constructs because these molecular biology systems are so elegant. I shall pursue my MD after my MSc, and hopefully maintain an emphasis on biomedical research and engineering.
Harland Brandon
Fourth year PhD Candidate
I am a long time iGEM member but this is the first year I have helped with the Lethbridge High School iGEM team. iGEM helped me discover that I was truly passionate about scientific research and considering the ethical implications that come from the work that we do.
Dr. Brian Dempsey
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
Chris Isaac
Hi there. My name is Chris and I am pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics and Genomics. I worked with the team as a specialist mentor through MindFuel and GeekStarter's high school synthetic biology program. I discussed initial project design with the team and also helped teach them how to code their wiki through various workshops hosted by GeekStarter.

Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics.

I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-m"

It is the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) that those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.
Charles Darwin
We believe that collaboration is one of the most important facets of the iGEM competition. It is only natural that certain teams will have skills that others lack and vice versa. The great advantage of working within the iGEM framework is that we are stronger together than we are apart. In light of this we worked with as many teams as possible in order to achieve as much as we could, while helping other iGEM teams to do the same. Overall we collaborated with 12 iGEM teams from 9 different countries. Without them, our project would not have been the same.
Edinburgh UG Collaboration
Initially we set out to design a CRE-Lox based “kill switch” for our system. It was during this time we discovered that team Edinburgh UG was working on creating a recombinase based tool kit. After reaching out to them we held a video conference in which we each presented our projects and discussed how we could collaborate in a meaningful and effective way. We discovered that team Edinburgh had created an extremely powerful mathematical model capable of predicting crucial, and application specific, information regarding recombinase usage. Team Edinburgh generously offered to simulate our “kill switch” design using their advanced model. The information they provided us allowed us to modify our plans and more confidently proceed with our chosen ""Kill Switch"" . Additionally, we tried very hard to coordinate a wet-lab collaboration in which we were meant to further characterize one of team Edinburgh’s many recombinases and compare it with their modeling predictions. Unfortunately, different academic schedules and a lack of time did not allow us to complete this final task.
Team Edinburgh also conducted an in-depth analysis of the"

USTC-China,2014,Team:USTC-China#modeling#conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html,"n_3$ rise at first, but went down and faded away at the end, cannot competing with the soar of $n_3$ because of the preference for medium. After 24h， the ratio of $n_3$ (C.C. with plasmids) went over 75%, a pretty good consequence.
However, happy ending is always fragile. Consequence is hypersensitive to the subtle change of initial concentration of different types of bacterium. For example, when $n_1(0)=0.8$, $n_2(0)=0.2$, situation becomes entirely different as shown in Fig. 7.
Fig. 7
Now comes the question:
What's the best choice of initial condition which ensure the prevalence of $n_3$ in a relatively short time?
Phase-space Analysis
Trying to answer the question above, we did phase-space analysis. In our case, phase space is such a 3D rectangular coordinate space in which each points $(x,y,z)$ represents a phase $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$. From this perspective, the time evolution of the whole system can be represented by a trajectory in phase space.
Let's take the debut results mentioned above as a concrete example.
Fig. 8 shows its trajectory in phase space, where it begins at $n_1-n_2$ bottom plane, goes all the way up, and finally ends at $n_3$ axis. It means that initially $n_3$ equals 0, but prevails soon after, and finally dominates the whole system and eliminates other components.
Fig. 8
We can do more of this. Fig. 9 is a collection of trajectories, from which, one can easily tell that despite where a trajectory started, it always ended to a single point.
Fig. 9
To further evaluate this phenomenon, we singled out the only stable steady state in phase space shown in Fig. 11, which was unsurprisingly consistent with the common ending point in Fig. 9.
Fig. 10
Fig. 11
Now we have known a lot about this system： any arbitrary initial condition in the region of interest will lead to that single end, where n3 is the only kind to survive and thrive.
However, this is still not enough. Practically, we don't satisfy only with $n_3$ to survive and thrive. We hope it thrives in a short time (24h). So we evaluated the ratio of $n_3$ at t=24h when varying initial condition and plotted the"

Lysis of Cells, Testing the Protocol with Fractions 1-5
Observations: Purified Tamura still slightly cloudy and not completely transparent solution. The white cell debris pellets at bottom still contain specks of green and fluoresce when observed under UV light, indicating incomplete lysis and not all protein is extracted. This is likely because Tamura is suspended in very dilute lysis buffer, making it more difficult for reagents to react in a homogenous manner, especially since such small volumes and amounts of reagents are used. To troubleshoot, lysis protocol is repeated with remaining cell pellet from final centrifugation step.
Lysis Protocol
1. Add Lysozyme.
2. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
3. Add PMSF solution, and while swirling, slowly add Deoxycholic Acid in powder form.
4. Incubate at 37 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.
5. Add DNAse.
6. Incubate on rocking incubator at room temperature for 30 minutes.
7. Centrifuge sample for 15 minutes at 3,000g at 4 degrees Celsius.
8. Collect supernatant and store at -20 degrees Celsius."

Macquarie University
The 2016 Macquarie University iGEM would like to thank Macquarie University as a whole, as well as all of our advisors and supporters from the Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences (CBMS) who have provided us with laboratory space, materials and our amazing technician. We would also like to thank the Macquarie University iGEM teams from 2013 through to 2015 for all that they have contributed to this project;
2013 Macquarie Australia:
Designed and built single gene parts of the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway
Characterized ChlD and Plastocyanin
2014 Macquarie Australia:
Built composite parts for the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway
Repaired the ChlD (missing 50bp, but still functional)
Characterized ChlI1 and ChlD (new) with purified ChlH from Prof. Willow’s group
Characterized GUN4 binding of PPIX
2015 Macquarie Australia:
Designed and built single gene parts (small composite parts) of Photosystem II
Built ChlH biobrick
Characterized ChlM
Improved the characterization of ChlD
Modelled the PPIX production from ALA
Modelled the production of hydrogen gas by photosystem II/hydrogenase combination
We have expanded on that work this year by furthering the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and photosystem II assembly as well as adding the hydrogenase pathway.
Students
We had a large cohort this year who were divided between eight main teams. These teams included; The Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Team, who worked on constructing the ‘super operon’ and ‘mega operon’ and succeeded with proving function of the super operon; The Photosystem II Team, who worked tirelessly in the lab, ligating together parts to make up the five operons of photosystem II and then operons; The Hydrogenase Team, who have been working on designing and constructing biobrick parts for the hydrogenase pathway in our system; The Modelling Team, who modelled the chlorophyll production"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was"

""It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."" - Confucius
Our bacteria seems to produce rubber, so following further confirmation of the cells’ rubber producing capabilities, the next step is to optimize production. This includes:
Removal of  unnecessary pathways in order to minimize the energy consumption of non-rubber producing processes in the cell;
Further optimizing the MEP pathway, making sure the products are converted to IPP and do not exit to vitamin B1;
Optimizing the prenyltransferase/MEP pathway ratio for rubber synthesis, so as not to waste energy on making more IPP than the prenyltransferase can use;
Finding the optimal concentration of bacteria before inducing rubber synthesis;
Improving the methods of rubber extraction;
For potential perfection: building the system in Cyanobacteria where the energy source is photosynthesis that runs on sunlight and carbon dioxide, thereby bypassing issues of crop usage in bacterial media.
When the production is optimized, it is time to look at the big scale production. Going from erlenmeyer flask production to industrial production introduces new challenges. The design of"

Follow this guide on how to get the Qt source code, compile it and setup your environment correctly. Make sure that your Raspberry Pi is constantly running, since this process takes some time and must not be interrupted.
With the Qt-libraries installed, open a terminal and change to the directory where you put the source for the GUI (command ""cd [path to source]""). Call ""qmake"" followed by ""make"" and you will start compilation of the program. When finished, you can launch the GUI with the command ""./igem_GUI"".
The backend - that will establish the connection between hardware and the user interface - requires you to install additional packages for Python which is a high-level general-purpose programming language and an interpreter that will ship with your system. Open the README in the ""Backend"" directory and follow the instructions.
You now should be able to launch the backend by calling ""python takeimageserver.py &"" from the terminal.
Now start the GUI. An input dialog will show up asking you to provide the IP address of the backend server or the Raspberry Pi, respectively. Since you are running the GUI and the backend on the same device, just press Enter to select the default entry which is the IP of the local host. After a few seconds, when the connection to the backend server has been established, the user interface gets enabled and you can start to take images and time lapse shootings. If the image is not focused you need to adjust the lense in front of the camera by rotating it. For the full list of features refer to the Software section of this page.
In case you want to run the GUI on a remote machine, e.g. your notebook, follow these additional steps:
Install the Qt-libraries and QtCreator on your system. This is just an installation - you do not have to compile it. Get the source code for the GUI and open the "".pro"" file with QtCreator. After importing the project and selecting a built directory, click the green arrow on the left side. Compilation is started and as soon as it is finished the GUI will start.
In order to be able to connect to the Raspberry Pi you need to be connected to the same network. Therefore, make sure the Raspberry Pi USB wifi stick is working properly (see Troubleshooting & Useful Links ), and that you reside in the same network. Start the backend server on the Raspberry Pi. It will print the IP address on start up which you must enter in the GUI on your device running the GUI. Now you should be able to use all the features as if"

Penn,2011,Team:Penn State#HumanPractives_-_-_TEXT.html," group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now… The Penn State 2011 iGEM team conduced a three hour workshop at the Foxdale Village retirement community in the local State College, PA area. Throughout the course of the three hour workshop residents were asked to view the video and talk with members of the team who were present to answer any quetsions they may have. The participants were also asked to answer survey questions based on their opinions and knowledge of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and GMOs before and after viewing the video.
Research Component
The Penn State iGEM team had two main goals for the video “(Re)designing Life.” The Penn State team first wanted to determine if this video provided an adequate explanation of the technology behind synthetic biology and genetic engineering to any viewing audience. Assuming the video provided enough information for the viewers to understand synthetic biology fully, the Penn State team then hypothesized that with this information, the general audience will form more positive opinions regarding synthetic biology. In particular we focused on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are defined as any organism whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered through human intervention. By improving the public perception of GMOs, the Penn State iGEM team hopes to increase positive regulation of this technology without allowing severe limits by the government on scientific advancement in the field of synthetic biology and GMOs.
The adequacy of the synthetic biology information portrayed in the video as well as this information’s effects on the audience’s perceptions regarding GMOs were analyzed through the use of two surveys. The first survey first survey was given to the audience before the video in order to determine demographic information as well as a baseline for the audience’s opinions regarding GMOs. After the video was shown, a second survey was given to the audience in order to determine if the audience increased their knowledge of synthetic biology as well as if this knowledge changed their opinions regarding GMOs.
Survey Data
Statistical analysis was done based on the survey data that was collected to determine if the video was influential in changing the opinions of the participants. The questions on the survey had participants rate how strongly they opposed or supported the use of GMOs in certain situations. There were other questions on the survey; however, these had to be cut because it became difficult to accurately and truthfully analyze the survey data. We wanted the pre-survey and post-survey questions to be the same so that accurate statistical comparison could be made under the same conditions. Questions were eliminated to ensure that only the same questions got compared. Overall,"

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and maturation [17] .
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal species with S. aureus, and those two species competes with one another for nutrients. Epidemiology studies show that S. epidermidis inhibit the growth of S. aureus in the human nasal cavity and further studies indicated that this was due to the degradation of a variety of S. aureus CWA proteins. This degradation resulted in decreased biofilm formation and forced S. aureus back into a planktonic form, presumably resulting in decreased survival chances. [18] [19] Heavily involved in this process was extracellular serine protease (Esp); secreted by S. epidermidis, this protease degrades the proteins that maintain structural and chemical integrity of the biofilm. Purified Esp inhibits biofilm formation at the preliminary stage and is able to detach a pre-existing one. Additionally, Esp reduces the virulence of S. aureus through degrading other important proteins, e.g. quorum sensing molecule receptors, enzymatic proteins for biofilm dispersal. [20]
Figure 6: Esp cleaves off CWA proteins
Esp could be applicable for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases caused by S. aureus.  It has also been proven to be effective for the biofilms formed by MRSA and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. [19] We used the Biobricks BBa_K531003 and BBa_K531006 , which were developed by team Grinnell 2011.
Esp is produced as an inactive form of protein which is then secreted into the environment through Sec-mediated translocation. The propeptide at the N-terminal would be cleaved by signal peptidases during or right after the protein secretion. When expressed recombinantly, the protein therefore requires enzymatic activation - an issue we chose to address by working to create a truncated, mature version of the protein. [21] A successfully expressed Esp could be a good choice to tackle S. aureus biofilm through multiple pathways.
We aimed to improve the characterization of the Esp BioBrick by (1) testing expression in a new chassis, E. coli, (2) validating the findings of the creators indicating that Esp was able to disperse S. aureus biofilm and expand on this by testing other bacterial biofilms. To our knowledge, we were also the first iGEM team to characterize this BioBrick’s ability to (3) inhibit biofilm formation and (4) test a potential bacteriolytic activity.

Fig. 1 A simplified mechanism of action of RNA thermometers. At lower temperatures the secondary messenger RNA (mRNA) stem-loop masks the ribosome binding site (RBS). Higher temperature induces melting of the hairpin which reveals the RBS to allow ribosome binding and initiation of translation.
Background
RNA thermometers are RNA-based genetic control tools that react to temperature changes1. Low temperatures keep the mRNA at a conformation that masks the ribosome binding site within the 5’ end untranslated region (UTR). Masking of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence restricts ribosome binding and subsequent protein-translation. Higher temperatures melt the hairpins of RNA secondary structure allowing the ribosomes to access SD sequence to initiate translation 1. In terms of applicability of RNA thermometers in in vitro systems, they display certain advantages over ribo- or toehold switches: they do not require binding of a ligand, metabolite or trigger RNA to induce the conformational change2,3, therefore are especially compatible with our liposome IVTT"

Results and Discussion
Neither of the test device 1 replicates showed any signs of growth during the 6 hour growth period after dilution to 0.02 ABS units. This was particularly odd as test device 1 had a similar initial cell density, when compared the other devices and controls prior to dilution.  (see figure 2). Test device 2 had the greatest increase in fluorescence compared to test device 3 which had significantly lower fluorescence (figure 1).
Fig 1. This graph shows the change in fluorescence of each test device over a 6 hour
incubation period. Test device 2 had the greatest increase in fluorescence.
Fig 2. This graph shows the absorbance at 600 nanometres of each cell culture, which
provides an estimate for the number of cells in the samples.
We measured the effect of the test devices on growth. After diluting the initial cell cultures to an absorbance of 0.02, the dilutions (200 uL) were pipetted into 10 wells of a 96 well plate followed by 2 blank samples of chloramphenicol LB (200 uL). This was left overnight at 37⁰C to grow with the OD 600 taken every 6 minutes, the resulting 180 data points were plotted on a graph (figure 3). It showed that the cells transformed with test device 1 experienced a delay in the onset of their log phase by approximately 9 hours. We hypothesise that the promoter for test device 1 could be inhibiting the growth of our organism.
Fig 3. Graph of the OD 600 of the liquid cultures of each device and the controls
plotted over 18 hrs.
Conclusions
The Macquarie iGEM team were grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Interlab Study for the first time.
As both replicates of test device 1 showed no signs of growth, we undertook our own investigations into the effect of the test device on our organism. We found that the test device 1 caused a lag in the onset of the log phase.
We look forward to participating in future Interlab projects.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#7 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," these observations, a total of 6 tubes of 5ml LB solution were innoculated with the transformed E. coli cells. The first three tubes were inoculated by 3 cultures found on the 200ul LB+agar plate and the next three tubes were inoculated with 3 cultures found on the 500ul LB+agar plate. This was all done under aspetic conditions.
These tubes were then placed in the orbital shaking incubator at 37C in the morning of inoculations. The tubes were as follows:
Tube 1 - culture 1 from 200ul transformants on LB+amp plate
Tube 2 - culture 2 from 200ul transformants on LB+amp plate
Tube 3 - culture 3 from 200ul transformants on LB+amp plate
Tube 4 - culture 1 from 500ul transformants on LB+amp plate
Tube 5 - culture 2 from 500ul transformants on LB+amp plate
Tube 6 - culture 3 from 500ul transformants on LB+amp plate
Further Observations
When the tubes in the orbital incubator were observed in the afternoon, it was found that all of them had gone cloudy. This opacity meant that the E. coli cells had grown sufficiently within the space of a day.
Further Procedure
Inoculating 50ml LB flasks
Because it is likely that the Metal Sensing Team will be using BBa_J33206 in plasmid pSB1A2 DNA in further project work it is a good idea that midi-preps of the DNA are made. 3 flasks, each containing 50ml of LB solution (+ ampicillin), were innoculated each with 50ul from a chosen 5ml LB-grown E.coli culture.
The three 5ml cultures chosen to inoculate the three 50ml LB+amp flasks were taken from Tube 1 (culture 1 from the 200ul plate), Tube 2 (culture 2 from the 200ul plate) and Tube 5 (culture 2 from the 500ul plate). This was all done under aseptic conditions. The resulting inoculated flasks were placed in the orbital shaking incubator at 37C for overnight growth.
Attempting mini-prep
Seen as the six tubes containing LB+amp appeared to all contain sufficient amounts of transformed DH5-alpha E. coli cells, mini-preps of the samples were attempted. This was done using Phil Aldridge's mini-prep protocol and there were no changes to the protocol. However the"

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).
High Sensitivity

Module 2: Self Destructive Plasmid
The message that the helper plasmid caries and is delivered by the donor cell to the acceptor cell should disappear in the donor cell, after being passed to the acceptor cell. Therefore we would like to build a plasmid which is able to destruct itself. Therefore the plasmid should be able to degrade itself. This degradation should be inducible. In order to facilitate the degradation of the plasmid we construct a plasmid whit a I-SceI endonuclease gene which is under control of a Lac promoter. This plasmid also contains several restriction sites of I-SceI in order to start degradation after inducing I-SceI transcription.   In order to construct the Self Destructive Plasmid (SDP) we build the construct showed in Figure 5 and clone it this construct into a high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid.

In order to build this construct 6 other constructs should be built, assembly of these constructed will result to the above showed construct. We like to use in the first place already existing BioBricks. Since there is no I-SceI restriction site available as BioBrick, we should standardize this restriction site. The half-life time of the GFP-LVA is 40-80 minutes. This short half-life is useful for this project. After constructing the SDP we would like to induce the transcription of this GFP and stop the induction. At the time that the signal of the GFP disappears we induce the transcription endonuclease and in order to check if the plasmid is degraded we induce the transcription of the GFP once again.

Despite government distribution of free gas connection, most of them couldn’t register for it due to the lack of address proof for their temporary settlements. On being asked about the government scheme Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, they said that the number of people using wood as fuel has fallen a lot but hasn’t dropped to a nil. It was found that nearby government toilets charged Rs. 5 for one instance and it was not known if the charge that was procured was on a legal basis.
  
  
We told the people about the issues with using wood as fuel, about the breathing problems it can lead to in a long run and also about the pollutants released in the environment as a consequence of such practices. Also we told them about the problems associated with open defecation since it leads to mixing of toxic substances and harmful bacteria with underground water sources.   
   
  
 
 
  
Green Survey
  
We conducted a green survey via a set of questions and collated data from the responses we got   from various countries. The countries that participated include India, France, Sweden, Costa Rica,   Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Taiwan, Slovenia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Panama, Honduras, Mexico,   Spain, Egypt, Chile and Bulgaria. The total number of responses came out to be 119.   This survey highlighted many aspects that need to be taken care of if we wish to make people   participate in mitigating the effects or controlling further pollution:   
  
  
  
  58.5 % of the population does experience the effects of pollution in their everyday life. This   includes problems becoming very common like respiratory problems and troubles in vision   to be counted as a few among them. This points towards the fact that people do realize   the problems associated with pollution and this would help in motivating them to work   towards it.   
  
  
       
  33.1 % responses were received for either-‘They do not know” about ""Reduce, Reuse and   Recycle"" or they know but do not practice. This calls for large scale awareness!   
  
  
       
  Among all the people that participated in the survey, 39.3 % never make use of the public   transport. This occurs due to many reasons including poor transport facilities, using personal   vehicles as a symbol of status, lack of awareness about advantages of car pool system etc.   The number of"

Advantages
Our device has the function of detecting water pollution. Compared with the traditional detecting methods, our device has the advantages as convenient and economical.
Traditional way as AASer, AFSer, Oscilloscopic polarography, XRD and ICP-MS are very cumbersome so that in general, it needs people to collect the water sample and bring it back to their laboratory for testing. And at the same time, those devices are not only far more expensive for the public and family using but unaffordable for some developed countries as well.
Furthermore, traditional monitoring device is complex in using. People without particularly training cannot fluently use it. These problems above limited its application severely, especially when people need to monitor the water quality in wild, in long term real time or for normal families.
Our device, however, is light small economical and easy to use. It is quite easy for us to take it everywhere with its volume only large as two Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary. It has a graphical touch screen which will help the learners easy to get starting. By the way, our device can be put nearby the polluted water so that we can monitor the water at real time. Some families can utilize our device to monitor their tap water. We also provide professional version that can not only solve the problem of the hard control of traditional MFC but own the potential ability to meet the accurate and real time needs of some factories and laboratories.

We submitted a new gene to the registry to assist in the production of PHB: the phaJ gene that codes for PHB enoyl-CoA hydratase. This part contains both the phaJ and phaC genes and was shown to produce PHB on its own in E. coli under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. HPLC was used to identify and quantify the PHB produced. Results can be found on our part's Registry page.

It seemed that the prize “Totally Wacky Scientist” captivated many kids because by the end of the day we had more than 100 kids attempt at guessing. This was simply one more initiative in order to promote iGEM and to generate interest in science for young kids.
While the kids were occupying themselves with our activities, the parents had a chance to take pictures and inquire about our project.  Many parents had questions about iGEM and specifically our project. We were able to explain the connection between the “arts and crafts” bacteria and our project, as well as the objectives of our overall project along with any applications. Jen Hill, a representative from Alberta Ingenuity, dropped by our booth for a visit and was surprised to see how well we tailored our project to our audience.
Campus Fair was an opportunity to see how few people understood the concept of synthetic biology. We learned how much work is needed to accomplish our goal of establishing a strong synthetic biology community in Alberta. The kids seemed to have a lot of fun and were very excited to take the gloves, tubes and pipettes home with them.
Through Campus Fair, it is our hope that the adults, parents and children were able to not only gain an appreciation of iGEM and synthetic biology, but also to enjoy themselves at our exhibit. More importantly, the team had tons of fun and we were able to interact and express our excitement about our project with others.

The tripling the [K6R-HMG2] and [IDI1] for the production of DMA-PP increases the [B-pinene] by 7.3166 times and 1.3052 times respectively. In contrast, tripling the [IDI1] for the production of I-PP decreases the [B-pinene] by 35.65%. The simulations suggested that the increase of any enzyme would help increase the rate of monoterpene production. For manufacturing purposes, the engineered mevalonate pathway should be modified to increase the [K6R-HMG2] and [IDI1] for DMA-PP production for mass producing monoterpenes.

Harvard_BioDesign,2016,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," under sfGFP visualization, we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing our plasmids. We then induced the cells with 0.4M IPTG, except for a sample that was kept as an uninduced control. After inducing for 6 hours, we then visualized the cells by placing 3 microliters of cells in media onto a microscope slide and using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescent microscope to image our cells.
In our induced sample, we observed sfGFP fluorescence at a magnification of 100x. The individual specks in the following photo on the left are cells. On the right is the uninduced sample, also at 100x. Although you can still observe some baseline sfGFP fluorescence, the induced sample is much brighter and has many more cells fluorescing.
Induced (left) versus uninduced cells (right) show T7 promoter gives inducible control.
These images illustrate that our PETase-sfGFP part is being expressed. They also confirm that we have inducible control over our construct because the uninduced sample shows basal expression.
Showing our protein is inducibly expressed: SDS Page and Western blot
Next, we can validate protein expression further with SDS Page and Western blot visualization. Although we confirmed the presence of our protein with sfGFP visualization, an SDS Page will further confirm by showing that a protein of the correct weight is being expressed. Additionally, a Western blot will show that our histag is functioning. The Western blot is more specific than an SDS Page because only the histagged protein will bind.
Before performing the SDS Page we grew up T7 lysY Iq cells containing a plasmid with PETase under control of the T7 promoter. Cells were induced with 0.4M, 0.1M, or 0M IPTG for either 6 hours or overnight, at either 15 or 30 degrees C. After expression, cells were then lysed according to our ultrasonication protocol, and supernatant and pellet were collected for the SDS Page gel. Supernatant is the soluble fraction of cell lysate, while pellet is the insoluble fraction. After collecting supernatant and pellet, we ran the SDS page, with an additional lysozyme control. The following image highlights our significant result:

They score 3.27, 5.27 and 4.8 for the three questions while the overall average score is 3.57, 5.28 and 4.77. The participants aged 26-30 are wishing to decrease the level of heavy metal most and most willing to install a small “heavy metal water filter” at home. The respondents of 10-20 years old are most satisfied with the water quality and so they are the least willing group to install water filter. There would be a further study on what is the most considering factor about the water quality. The participants may concern about the waterborne pathogens more than the heavy metal and thus they score a bit lower in Q2 and Q3.
Conclusion:
From the above result, French care least for the water quality and least willing to install water filter at home, while the results of Hong Kong & Taiwan and Brazil show the similar pattern that they are quite concerning about the water quality and more willing to install water filter when compared to France. When considering different age groups, respondents from 41-50 age group are least satisfied with water quality but they are not willing to install water filter, whereas respondents of 10-20 years old are most satisfied with water quality and least willing to install water filter. After understanding the opinion of the public, we can adjust the focus of our project to persuade people and raise the acceptance of our project. On top of that, we can focus more on the harmful effects of the heavy metal on our health and thus, the public can have a chance to acknowledge the importance of the heavy metal filter."
