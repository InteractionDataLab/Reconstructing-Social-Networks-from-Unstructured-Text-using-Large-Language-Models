What is a Library?
Our project is based on the construction of an adequate library, which is defined as a collection of identical plasmids that only vary in the protein coding sequences (CDS). These CDS are designed to possess optimized and region specific randomized subregions displaying high variability. Upon transformation of the randomized plasmids into E. coli a heterogeneous culture is obtained with each colony carrying a different insert translating into different binding proteins ( Osoegawa et al., 2001 ).
One major advantage of our library is the availability of a wide range of different binding proteins as starting point for the directed evolution process. Completely new antibodies or variations of existing ones could serve as starting material.
By creating such a large variety, we are aiming for the highest chance for a possible binder. By adjusting the variable regions and their nucleic acid scheme we can specify the target further  but still have leverage to cover a wide range of possible targets in the beginning (see Library - Design and Construction ).
In order to identify suitable binding proteins for an appropriate scaffold of our library, we compared different types of antibodies and antibody mimetics from various sources. Antibody mimetics also show better accessibility to genetic engineering like construction of"

While the 3A assembly method is well suited for stepwise building of devices, larger complex constructs can take time to make. Being the impatient New Yorkers we are, as soon as we came up with the constructs for our project we had to have them immediately. Because of this, we began exploring other methods to piece together our system.
We decided to use the Overlap Assembly Method most famously published in this JCVI paper:
Gibson et al, Nature Methods 6: 343-345
This method allows researchers to assemble complex systems of many parts all at once rather than in a stepwise fashion. By combining your overlapping DNA parts with the required enzymes and buffers you can easily assemble a complete system in one day - perfect for the impatient New Yorkers that we are. Here's the general scheme of this reaction:
The downside of this system is that the parts to be assembled must overlap one another in their sequence, so you must order DNA oligos to PCR your parts into an overlapping form. To help us out with this, Russell programmed an overlap oligo maker that did much of the work for us -  check it out by clicking this link:
After getting the oligos in the lab we combined equimolar amounts of each part in a single reaction and added ExoIII, Phusion polymerase and Taq Ligase. We opted for a 2-step thermocycled reaction method for simplicity and cost-effectiveness and the relative ease of making a reaction mix. Using the reaction mix suggested in the Gibson et. al. paper, Russell designed a simplified version by using the Phusion and Ligase prepared buffers. We were able to get successful reactions from this simple mix:
50uL Assembly Reaction:    Equimolar amounts of overlapping DNA (~100ng) from PCR cleanup - up to 18uL       +   10uL  5x Phusion HF Polymerase Buffer   5uL 10x Taq Ligase Buffer   8uL   50mM MgCl2   4uL   2.5mM dNTPs       +   .5uL  ExoIII diluted to 10 U/uL   2uL"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#preservation system_-_-_TEXT.html," the fragment containing the unnatural base pair was successfully incorporated. This provides an easy screening method, since cells that turn red and survive in sucrose supplemented media most likely inserted the fragment containing the unnatural base pair into the plasmid. Having the coding sequences of both proteins in one frame has one big advantage: Given that sacB is prone to loss-of-function mutations, contaminations can be easily distinguished by color. Furthermore, cells with mutations in the promotor region would also survive, since they would not express sacB, but not turn red. Therefore, this two-layered system allows to visually check if a culture either is contaminated, has a mutation in the promotor region, or if the correct plasmid is present. This aspect is visualized in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Method for selection of the correct plasmids in liquid cultures. If the assembly was successful, cells turn red and survive in sucrose supplemented media. The cells die if the assembly was not successful, since sacB can be expressed.
To test the effect of sucrose on growth of the cells, a cultivation was performed of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring BBa_K2201017 . The cultivations were carried out in a 12 well plate in 1 mL of LB medium supplemented with different concentrations of sucrose. Three biological replicates were cultivated for each condition and three technical replicates taken for each measurement point.
Figure 6: Cultivation of E. coli BL21(DE3) in LB media supplemented with different concentrations of sucrose. Three biological replicates were cultivated and three technical replicates measured for each point in time. A clear difference in growth can be observed, with higher sucrose concentrations leading to weaker growth. The mRFP-SacB fusion protein does not lead to cell death, but shows bacteriostatic properties. Therefore, cells that successfully integrated the fragment containing the unnatural base pair should grow much better in the selective media and therefore overgrow cells harboring religated plasmid backbones.
The cultivations shown in Figure 6 clearly show that sucrose has a significant effect on growth of strains carrying BBa_K2201017 . A higher sucrose concentration leads to weaker growth, with strains cultivated in 20 % sucrose reaching only ~33 % of the OD600 of the reference strain cultivated in sucrose free media. The reference reached a final optical density of 3.233 ± 0.148, strains cultivated in media supplemented with 10 % sucrose 1.527 ± 0.055 and strains cultivated in 20 % sucrose reached"

MODELLING
Modeling plays a huge role in the whole project, as we fill in the gap between the experimental results and the existing data.
We characterized PE degradation rate based on previous iGEM data and predict how much adding OmpA to the sequence is going to affect the result of the laccase secretion. Kinetic parameters of fumarate addition mechanism were attempted to observe the activity of ASS genes and monitor the rate of conversion from alkane to succinate. This is very crucial since we do not have any laboratory experiment result to compare with. At the same time, we adopt Flux Balance Analysis to characterize how different factors from culturing media can affect direct electron transfers. For the MFC module, we have successfully established data to find the optimum culturing medium concentration for Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 growth, which aids the design of MFC experiment. Voltage and power density that can be produced from alkane were also estimated.
The innovative part of our modeling is using the existing model to further explore the effect of fumarate on the integrated alkane metabolism system, which guided our experimental design and will hopefully inspire future work on similar systems.

Bisphenol A degradation with E. coli
The bisphenol A degradation with the BioBricks <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> works in E. coli KRX in general. Because Sasaki et al. (2008) reported problems with protein folding in E. coli which seem to avoid a complete BPA degradation, we did not cultivate at 37 °C and we did not use the strong T7 promoter as Sasaki et al. (2008) did for expressing these BioBricks but we cultivated at 30 °C and we used a medium strong constitutive promoter (<partinfo>J23110</partinfo>). 30 °C is in addition the cultivation temperature of S. bisphenolicum AO1. With this promoter upstream of a polycistronic bisdAB gene we were able to completely degrade 120 mg L-1 BPA in about 30 - 33 h. By fusing <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> together (using Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard) we could improve the BPA degradation of E. coli even further, so 120 mg L-1 BPA can be degraded in 21 - 24 h.

Northwestern,2017,Team:Northwestern#integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," responses, prescription, and how international policy/health systems implement antibiotic resistance. He is an advocate for using standardized language when talking about antibiotic overuse across disciplines of the media and science.
Dr.Mendelson highlights how there are many players in the antibiotic game, not just scientists or doctors. Finance, food production and the general public are often in tandem with the science behind antibiotic resistance (AR). He stressed the importance of education and awareness as well as individual and national responsibility to use antibiotics in a poised manner. Using language that is clear such as ""antibiotic resistance"" vs ""antimicrobial resistance"" is also essential to the fight. Dr. Mendelson thinks that carefully planned use of antibiotics will be a lasting solution in addition to new therapies being created to fight bacteria.
Takeaway: We tried to implement the correct language when referring to antibiotic resistance that Dr. Mendelson stressed. When talking about antibiotics, this website only uses the terms ""antibiotic reistant"" or ""drug resistant infection"". According to Dr. Mendelson, most of the population can understand these terms, a first step to combating AR worldwide.
Special Agent Scott Mahloch
Scott Mahloch is a former member of the Navy turned FBI agent. After entering the FBI in 2008 and completing training, Mahloch was assigned to Milwaukee Division’s Kenosha Resident Agency, where he worked on a variety of cases. He currently is the Chicago Division’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Coordinator
Special Agent (SA) Mahloch didn’t have to much to say in relation to antibiotic resistance or the specifics of our project. However, Mahloch did highlight the use of biological threats when it comes to weaponry. He emphasized the importance of being vigilant and adware of ones surroundings while working in a lab and reporting potentially suspicious activity. Mahloch made us adware that the FBI was not a regulatory agency but is often the eyes to make sure that everything is working smoothly and safely.
Takeaway: There isn't much we can change about our project from Special Agent Mahloch's presention. However, our team is more adware of the dangers of biology and how it can potentially be used for nefarious acts. If we see something we will definitely say something!

The respondents’ overall impression about all the newly developed technologies and the focused biological technologies were both more likely to be positive, but close to neutral. This probably showed a general conservative attitude towards synthetic biology among the general public in Hong Kong (""Synthetic biology survey,"" 2011).

Scientists
Based on the interview with Professor Albert Yu that our team has conducted, field of synthetic biology is not widely known even among scientist. Only scientists with deeper knowledge in related fields such as systems biology and genetics know about it. This may be due to the fact the synthetic biology is a relatively young field and require understanding and knowledge in multiple disciplines.

Biotechnology research and development capabilities in Hong Kong
Hong Kong has a large capability for biotechnology development. Its biomedical research is already internationally competitive. According to a study conducted by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Corporation in 2004, the total number of basic medical publications per year was doubled to about 700 between 1997 and 2002. Around 250 biomedical study of high impact is conducted every year at present. Also, in recent years Hong Kong made great scientific contribution in genomic projects, and in identification of infectious diseases such as SARS and avian flu virus.
This kind of development in biotechnology was probably possible in Hong Kong because universities in Hong Kong are actively participating in biotechnology related research. With excellence in scientific innovation and research breakthroughs, Hong Kong’s universities are considered to be some of the best universities in Asia- Pacific region. In fact, out of 9 tertiary institutions, 6 of them are participating in biotechnology related research and have related undergraduate and graduate courses.
Biotechnology infrastructure
A bioinformatics centre and other buildings with shared equipment facilities are now operating in the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks. They are there to support the development of biotechnology in Hong Kong. These facilities can be utilized by biotechnology companies for research and development purpose. At present, there are around 50 biotechnology-related occupants in the Science Park and other industrial estates.

Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, pET28a and pBAD. The first plasmid pET28a contains a                         nanobody and a gene with an aldehyde-based catalytic substrate tag. The second plasmid, pBAD,                         contains the FGE (Formylglycine-generating enzyme) gene. Then we changed the conversion plan                         several times due to poor conversion efficiency, and finally got a satisfactory conversion                         rate.
We wanted to see that the substrate tag can be finally expressed at the inactive end of the                         nanobody in E. coli BL21, and has little effect on the conformation of the nanobody. In the                         cell, the substrate tag was converted to an aldehyde group by FGE treatment. Subsequently, after                         the transformation of aldehyde-based nanobody, we disrupted the cells by sonication and purified                         the disrupted cell suspension to obtain the nanobody we needed. Next step, we combined the                         Nanobody with C18. We have obtained a better experimental protocol by changing the                         conditions.
We designed a liquid crystal cell as the observation carrier. Firstly, we modified the slides                         with DMOAP which can induce vertical alignment of the liquid crystals, making the initial state                         of the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell black. Meanwhile, we modified the slides with                         APTES so that they can be attached to the β2-MG; Then we added β2-MG                         nanobody to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and the                         liquid crystals were added. We can observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystal cell under                         the microscope to judge the β2–MG of the detected sample concentration.

10. How much time can you spend on iGEM?
11. If you participate, you and your family are willing to afford in which aspects?
Some survey results are shown as below:
Discussion
Two major findings have been obtained from this analysis.
First of all, we drew a conclusion that almost everyone learned a lot from our lecture although they tended to be unfamiliar about the details of synthetic biology. Comparing the number of people who know about iGEM and the number of people who are willing to participate in iGEM, we think the number of people who are interested in iGEM increases nearly 60%. Just look at the reasons why they don’t want to participate, most people chose no time and no supports. Only few people claimed that they were not interested in it and far less people said they didn’t like biology at all. Considering that our high school students are under so much pressure from National College Entrance Examination and some high school are too poor to afford technologies and apparatus, our results indicated a really good reality that almost everyone was willing to accept this new science and technology.
Second, as for how to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology, we summarize two points.
On the one hand, popularizing iGEM and synthetic biology via internet can reach a good effect because nearly half of these high school students said they heard iGEM and synthetic biology from the internet. We all think wiki is really a good platform to popularize synthetic biology and communicate with other iGEMers. What’s more, publishing more books relating to synthetic biology and iGEM is also a good conduit to let synthetic biology and iGEM known by other people, especially the young.
On the other hand, teachers and parents seem to have difficulties in accepting a new technology in China or in the whole world so that students can’t learn some interesting and impressive new science and technologies from adults. It’s very common in China but we, as a new generation, should try our best to realize the rapid changing of our society.
Future plans
Finally we drew some conclusion to improve our survey next time. In order to obtain results that are more valid we should launch a more widely circulated survey. In addition, perhaps more copies can be distributed at random to the general public. On the other hand, it’s really important to make an effective and smart questionnaire to get a more cogent result.

We suspect that this concentration was too high for cell survival that initial demethylation of MeHg occurred due to the presence of enzymes within the cells after being grown overnight and before their addition to the sample tubes. Thus MeHg levels decreased until the NADP pool within the cell was depleted and MerA was no longer able to remediate mercury ions resulting from demethylation, leading to cell death.

The main goal of EncapsuLab was to create a system for the preservation and protection of the bacteria in our system,  as well as physically separating them from the outside environment. To achieve this, we created a water-porous   silica matrix using techniques developed by the Aksan and Wackett labs at the U of M. Furthermore, we developed   a device to work as a proof of concept for the use of encapsulated bacteria in a real water-cleaning system.  In addition to this, we conceptualized a scaling-up of our system for larger water-cleaning problems. Lastly,  we developed a mathematical model to compare our experimental data in order to better understand the biochemical networks behind our work.

Encapsulation Procedure
To make a silica matrix surrounding a cell, we needed a supply of silica nanoparticles and a reactive cross-linker capable of
covalently bonding reagents into a unified volume. Two solutions were prepared: one was a combination of TM-40 (colloidal
silica) and diluting components (ultrapure water and polyethylene glycol). The second solution was tetramethyl orthosilicate
(TMOS) cross-linker. In slightly acidic conditions, methyl groups of TMOS are hydrolyzed, producing methanol and the silica
cross-linker. Resuspended and washed cells are then added to the relatively innocuous colloidal solution. Upon combining
these two mixtures, a rapid polymerization linking colloidal silica together occured. In order to achieve proper bead
sphericity, we combined all of these components in an hydrophobic solution and let them set. After some experimentation, we
were able to produce beads with a consistent size. To purify the mixture, we phase-separated the silica beads by adding
water to solution, which forced them into the aqueous phase. These were then recovered to assess viability.
The Biochemical Network
In this project, systems of mathematical equations are used to model the biochemical network of methylmercury conversion in E. coli and to determine the effects of changing methylmercury concentration on the conversion rate. A combination of"

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," analyze the trpR frameshifth mutation.
24 August 2010
Sequencing Results:
The trpR gene from the mutant strain doesn’t have a frameshift, instead of that it has a non synonymous mutation (Alanine to Proline) corresponding to the aminoacid 80. We hypothesized that  this change might causes a dramatic structural change to the protein thus being non functional.
LovTAP promoters
In order to test the new LovTAP, designed considering Dr. Devin advices and Lausanne team modeling results. We had to choose the proper promoters under which LovTAP expression will be regulated.
After looked up the promoter in the registry of biological parts. We decided to use the following members of the family J23: J23117, j23114, J23105 and J23102.
All these promoters are contained inside J61002 plasmid, and control the expression of RFP protein. Besides, the plasmid harbors an ampicillin resistance.
Experimental Procedure
11 August  -  18 August 2010
1.Get the plasmids harboring each promoter, from the corresponding plates.
2.Transform cells.
3.Grow up the transformed cells in LB medium with ampicillin antibiotic. This is because the plasmids harboring each promoter have a resistance against ampicillin.
4. Once the cells are correctly transformed with the plasmid J61002 harboring each promoter,  start the plasmid extraction procedure, using the High Pure Plasmid Isolation kit from Roche.
5.  After finishing the isolation of plasmid J61002 with each promoter ,  make the restriction enzyme assay  (SpeI/PstI)in order to remove the RBS site, the RFP gene and the double terminator from plasmid J61002 to replace them with LovTAP gene.
21 August 2010.
6. Once the plasmids harboring the  promoters are correctly digested with the enzymes SpeI and PstI,  make the dephosphatation reaction for each one in order to prepare them for ligation.

Computation
The sensitivity coefficients are defined by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation,
<math>\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial s(t,q)}{\partial q}=N[\frac{\partial v(t)}{s}\frac{\partial s(t)}{\partial q}+ \frac{\partial v(t)}{\partial q}]</math>

The choice of <math>s(0)=s_{0}</math> and <math>p_{0}</math> fix a trajectory <math>s(t)=s(t,s_{0},p_{0}</math> , and hence determines the function <math>v(t)=v(s(t),p,t)</math> as well. The equation above can be solved numerically for the concentration sensitivities. In performing such a calculation, we must note that the right-hand side depends on the time-varying value of the species concentration vector s(t), so a simple computational strategy is to determine <math>s_{i}(.)</math> and <math>\partial s_{i}(.)/\partial q</math> simultaneously.

Quorum Sensing and Synthetic biology
This system has already been used in the field of synthetic biology to create new behaviors. For instance, Lingchong YOU et al. (2004) designed a bacteria that regulates the maximum density of bacteria inducing a controlled suicide via intercellular communication. With this system, even if the population is stable the genome is expressed as if they were in exponential growth.
Fig 2 : Structure of two different AHL. In orange the common part to all AHL. A : 3OC6-HSL synthesized by LuxI. B : 3OC1-HSL synthesized by LasI
Other quorum sensing systems has been described in different species of baceteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The system has the same architecture with protein LasI that synthesize the AHL that binds to LasR, the intracellular receptor. One of the differences between those to systems is the structure of the AHL (Figure 2.)
The use of two quorum sensing system is possible. This is one of the challenges that Frederick K. BALAGADDE et al. (2008) carried out successfully. They constructed a synthetic ecosystem that imitates the prey-predator relationship in two different strains of E. coli.

CIEI-BJ,2018,Team:CIEI-BJ#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," in Nanjing Foreign Language School. I am mainly in charge of modeling in this IGEM competition. It’s my passion and love for biology that motivated me to attend this interesting and meaningful competition. I thought this would be a perfect chance for me to combine my knowledge in math modeling and biology, as well as presenting my understanding in gene. Working with my teammates is also a wonderful experience. I enjoy sharing ideas and cooperating with them.

My name is Haolun Cheng and my nick name is Orange. I grow up in Tianjin but my hometown is actually Jiangsu province. As the photographer and designer of CIEI-BJ, this remarkable team gives me a lot of strength and it is an honor to meet and work with our team members. I participated in iGEM in order to learn some knowledge about synthetic biology as well as make friends from all over the world.
Jiangqian Xie
Member
I’m Jiangqian Xie from CIEI-BJ. I lead Human Practice section in the team. It was in the synthetic biology workshop I attended last winter that I learnt about iGEM. To learn a little theory, to apply it to edge-cutting technology, and most importantly, to help solve some tough problems in reality. iGEM perfectly combines all of them together. That’s why I join this team.
Jiayi Zhang
Member
I’m Jiayi Zhang (Sunny) , who is one of the members in lab research and human practice team. Because of my great interest in synthetic biology, I decided to participate in iGEM in order to meet more challenges. Moreover, the philosophy of iGEM is to use biological methods to solve some real life problems, which is important and helpful for teenagers like me to understand the scientific research. Making more friends is also one of my wishes during iGEM. It’s a really good opportunity for us to learn the teamwork rather than compete with each other.

Member
I am Haomin Leng. An experiment operator and a member I human practice group. At the first time, I think this competition is just about the biology and we only need some biological knowledge. However, when I participate in it deeply, I think this activity is complex--we need a lot of people who are good at computer, math, experiment or so respectively. iGEM can teach a lesson to me a lot."

What We Offer
HAZU
    (1)We offered them a knockout exercise-induced gene system      The system we provided was a recombination system and its detailed experimental process is from Lv Zhenmei, our teacher in college of life sciences, Zhejiang University.     (2)We shared the data of light control system with them          Due to the situation that ZJU and HAZU all adopt light control system in their projects, we constructed and tested the red light and green light system together and shared the data based on documents written by Jeffrey J Tabor.
FAFU
    We supplemented their incomplete toxicity models. According to their project, we built models in mainly two parts. The first one is about the growth rate of algae. The second one is about the quantity of wrigglers according to time. We built these models in a specific logic: first we built separate models, and then we found their relationship. Finally, we gave FAFU our suggestion and feedback based on our results from modeling which has helped them improve their project (the modeling page) . Also, we helped them with some difficulties that they met when editing their wiki.
What We Receive
    (1) During the G20 Summit held in Hangzhou, FAFU and HZAU shared their labs with us. Thanks a lot for their generous help.     (2) XJTLU helped us to test the light-induced system and provided us with their illumination device designed by themselves.     (3) HZAU shared the light-induced circuits with us, and introduced key points when doing related experiments.     (4) HZ"

    LB medium for E.coli
    1）  Weight the component: 5g/L Yeast Extract. 10g/L NaCl. 10g/L Tryptone
           Note: solid medium: add 20g/L agar
    2） The above materials are fully dissolved by water.
    3） Sterilize the medium for 20 minutes at 121 °C.
    M17 medium
    M17 medium is the commonly used growth medium for L. lactis. This medium is commercially available without carbon source.
    Addition of carbon source for growth:
    0.5% glucose or 0.5% lactose (all strains can grow on glucose; for growth on lactose a strain needs the lactose operon)
    Media and growth conditions for Lactococcus lactis
    Lactococcus lactis vector pNZ8149 harboring lacF as food grade selection marker is selected for the ability to grow on lactose. The host strain L. lactis NZ3900 has all genes involved in the lactose fermentation on the genome, with a deletion of the lacF gene (Enzyme III of the Lac-PTS). The strain can grow on glucose, but in the presence of the lacF gene on a plasmid, it can also grow on lactose.
    A special medium that can be used for selection of Lac+ colonies is Elliker medium. On this rich medium all cells can grow, Lac+ or Lac-, but when lactose is added as sole carbon source the lactose-fermenting cells give yellow colonies.

   However, the online questionnaire is mostly completed by people from 15-35. So, in order to understand people's thought in different ages .we did a face-to-face interview towards visitors in China Science and Technology Museum. We interviewed 15 people in total elders, middle-aged people and college students are included. We get some great feedback.

   During the interview, we knew most college students are somewhat over-positive about their physical situation.
   So, back to school, we did a interview again. This time we interviewed 6 students and 3 school hospital workers, From our analysis the health consciousness of students are relatively weak. That also warn us that we need to make some changes
 
   This time, we got the most responses and useful advice ever. It is a breakthrough for our team. With the globalization of the world, we are trying to involve more people in our project. Next year, we will trying to make bigger plans and trying to be more considerate.

Finally, we have investigated the legal issues surrounding the release of genetically modified organisms and how they impact our project.
In addition, we devised a guideline on how to assess the possibility of releasing an iGEM project into the environment in order to help future teams.
Visit our Human Practice page for an in-depth report on how it influenced our design.
Achievements
We successfully expressed indole 3-acetic acid in E. coli and observed its effects on a reporter line of Arabidopsis that produces YFP in response to the compound. We also have results showing that our E. coli move towards malate , which is a compound secreted by roots. In addition, we observed the uptake of our bacteria into roots and made the first photoconvertible fluorescent reporter available on the Registry. We have used this reporter to observe metabolic activity of our chassis within the root. We also characterised four fluorescent reporters for their thermostability . We have created a user interface to model the 3D root growth of Arabidopsis depending on the input IAA concentration (video 2). We have also modelled the chemotaxis capillary assay , demonstrating the population dynamics of bacteria.
Visit our Main Results page for an overview of our main achievements in all modules or visit our Data page for an overview of the BioBricks we constructed and characterised.
Video 1. Photoconversion of Dendra2 using 405 nm wavelength in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. After 24 hours, the bacteria were re-imaged at the same settings. Expression of green Dendra2 had increased, showing that the bacteria are metabolically active inside the roots (Imaging by Mark Scott for Imperial College iGEM 2011).
Figure 3. E. coli cells expressing superfolder GFP (sfGFP) can be seen inside an Arabidopsis thaliana root using confocal microscopy (Data and imaging by Imperial College iGEM team 2011).
Video 2. This video shows how the 3D simulation MATLAB toolbox give the prediction of the root system after 25 days with a certain input IAA concentration.

Evry_Paris-Saclay,2018,Team:Evry Paris-Saclay#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that our PEPTalk system could improve and optimize.
A first application would be to give to each species of bacteria in the coculture a different peptide signal. Therefore, we can adapt a quorum sensing between all the species present in the medium, as well as decide to treat them separately with a little group of peptides.
Because of that advices, We have thought of a way to generate a large variety of peptide / receptor pairs in a future part of the project. See the Future Perspective page .
A second application would be to use our communication system as a signal amplificator. For instance, in a biosensor which detects the presence of a molecule (example: arsenic), the reporter signal can be very weak when the quantity of arsenic is low, getting mixed into the background noise. This is because few bacteria are in contact with the arsenic and produce the reporter. To amplify the signal and discrimin low concentration of arsenic, we could use our peptide as a diffuser of the induction information to other bacteria in the medium (by amplifying the signal of induction).
J. BONNET told us that our communication system could have been very useful as an information diffuser in one of the bacterial biosensor systems that his team used during their research project on logics gates [4].
Economical aspects
From an economic point of view, our system promises to revolutionize and control genetic circuits through the use of hexapeptides as genetic inducers. Using peptides is a cheap and accessible method, unlike the high cost of the IPTG inducer which is more commonly used in this kind of projects [3].
Medical aspects
From a medical side, we can allow more accurate estimates of the diagnosis of a disease. For instance, using a biological biosensor with our system as an signal amplificator would increase the sensitivity and reliability of detecting a malignant tumor in the body. Besides, our system could allows the detection of several factors that interest us at the same time (see the Logic Gates chapter ). This will allow the detection of cancers as quickly as possible to hope for an optimal and total cure.
Environmental aspects
From an environmental side, it will be possible, for instance, to detect micro plastics or endocrine disruptors with much more reliability than before. Indeed, our project, once again would detect a wide variety of bio component via a biosensor based on a logic gate with multiple inputs. This signal would be more sensitive than existing tools thanks to the broadcast system. As a result, we could better understand the pollution problems we are facing, from a macroscopic as well as a microscopic point of view. Because"

We purified the directional GFP insert plasmid, ran PCR on the multiple cloning site (MCS) and submitting it for sequencing. The GFP insert was perfect, with no mutations, insertions or deletions.
11 April 2011
Mackay did the PCR with the primers on this gel (these serve as templates for each other ... they prime each other to form the OxyS binding site with sticky ends for the ligation step). They worked, according to Dr. Grose. Because the PCR product is so small, Dr. Grose recommended we suspend the DNA in ethanol and spin it down, rather than use a purification kit.
13 April 2011
Restriction digests from last week were left in the 37 degree heating plate for days. Dr. Grose said they may still have worked fine. We ran it on a low-melt gel but only the plasmid showed up ... not our insert. We reviewed the primers we'd used and decided that they probably require template ... we'd designed the primers badly. We redesigned the primers to anneal to the E. coli SoxS, OxyS, KatG and HemH promoters.
14 April 2011
OxyR team came in on reading day and purified the plasmid with the GFP insert since we forgot to add ampicillin to the overnight culture last time. We boiled some E. coli to use as template for colony PCR to check the binding domain.

Gradient aTc induction results illustrated that elevated GFP signal upon the addition of formaldehyde is more significant when aTc concentration is 25 ng/μl.
Fluorescent and DIC Equipped Upright Microscope Results
After we did our induction, we looked our cells under Fluorescent and DIC Equipped Upright Microscope whether we can observe GFP signal color which is supposed to seen green according to signal rate:
Image 1. 40x zoom for 25ng/ul aTc concentration of HxlR construct after overnight measurement of  induction.
Image 2. 40x zoom for 25ng/ul aTc and 1 mM VOC concentration of HxlR construct after overnight measurement of induction.
As it is seen from the images, comparison between them indicates that addition of VOC increases the green color density which refers that our formaldehyde biosensor is working.
HxlR/pFor Sensor Gradient Formaldehyde Induction
To determine the concentration of formaldehyde which would facilitate a higher fold change in GFP signal, gradient formaldehyde induction is performed. Since the most appropriate aTc concentration is determined in gradient aTc induction, all samples are initially induced with 25 ng/μl aTc. On the other hand, the least concentrated formaldehyde which provides a sufficient fold change, might be detected by gradient formaldehyde induction.
Figure 5 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit)16 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. Voc: formaldehyde.
The results of gradient formaldehyde induction depicted that 1 mM and 3.2 mM formaldehyde addition have a higher potency in GFP signal increase.
AlkR/pAlkM Sensor Gradient aTc Induction
In order to control the expression level of AlkR protein, gradient aTc concentrations are utilized since AlkR gene expression is regulated by the promoter pL(tetO) within the AlkR/pAlkM sensor. Thus, AlkR protein is produced upon the addition of aTc and the amount of AlkR protein produced is positively correlated with the aTc concentration.

NCKU_Tainan,2017,Team:NCKU Tainan#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have written the nucleic acid bases of DNA and RNA on it. So a matching pair is not to same cards but two nucleic acid bases that is complementary. For example, A pairs                 with T, C pairs with G.
If they can match three pair in five turn they win.
For the advance mode, we change the words on the cards to genetic code and their function. For example, UAG and stop codon.
What’s more? We thought that Bike Festival should be like carnival full of fun, that’s why we prepared prizes for the visitors who have listen carefully to our introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology and win the game. Even though most of the prizes             are just simple drinks and snacks, we still hope them have a pleasant experience.
Feedback
Most of the students doubted themselves whether they can win the game or not at first, but after they pluck up their courage and give it a try, they found it fun and interesting. Certainly, some of the students do forget which nucleic acid bases matches             with which, but with our little hint, almost every player have successfully won the game. Game is definitely the best way to learn, since you will learn in a pleasant way. Plus, we believe that they will memorize them longer than they learn             from school.
This Bike festival is basically an event for the high school students, however the reality is their parents are actually much more worried than the students themselves, many parents will bring the whole family to come as a family trip which gave us a             good chance to promote iGEM and synthetic biology. We get a chance to talk to their parents, brothers and sisters and even their grandparents which is a really good opportunity for us since most of the time we are promoting in the student             group. Explaining synthetic biology to elder people is definitely a memorable experience, we learnt how to describe things in many creative ways in order to make them understand easily.
Of course, we want them to stop at our land for information instead of the prizes. Nevertheless, we tried to take it easy, not being too strict on game and just making everyone leaving with a happy mood.
Some of the challenges will absolutely be when they come with a group of people, it is much more difficult to catch everyone’s eyes than one by one, you have to ask them question or talking about the synthetic biology in the daily life first to gain their             attention. With practicing talking to a lot of visitor, we have all progressed a lot on how to introduced ourselves and how to face listeners of all kinds.

Tyler: Did LR at 4:30 pm for pEXPR 4-5 UAS:EBFP2. Will transform tomorrow morning. Plan on also getting LacI (without the Krab) from Weiss lab for use as a weak repressor.
Summary of Week 6: July 11 - July 17
In the sixth week we continued re-attemping previous failures using modified protocols or higher quality DNA in hopes of obtaining successful reactions. We also began looking at Cadherins and the possibility of using them as a clumping mechanism for mammalian cells. In order to visualize Cadherins, we needed some sort of fluorescent color, so construction of NCadherin-EGFP (NCadherin is one of many types of cadherin) began. DNA for NCad-EGFP was ordered, but needed to be in a format such that we could LR react it with the different promoters we have. This is done by attaching attB sites to flank the NCad-EGFP gene and then performing the BP reaction, which generates LR reaction-compatible parts. PCR of the attB sites was successful. By this week we have also begun work with mammalian cell cultures. To explore the limitless possibilities of synthetic biology, a few of us took it upon themselves to look into other interesting gene components, such as the Caspase gene and the FF4 tag.

Kingsborough_NY,2016,Team:Kingsborough NY#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the effects of pollution, and investigated the impact sewage and wastewater runoff had on the local environment. Our investigation led us upstream of the inlet to the nearby marshland and estuary, Jamaica Bay.
Jamaica Bay is a regionally important fish, wildlife, and plant habitat complex. In the past, the Bay supported a vigorous fishing and oyster industry, but has experienced changes due to pollution and other changing environmental conditions. Sewage and pollution from the surrounding urban areas flow into the bay, leading to an excess of nitrogen in the water. The eroding marshal, turbid water, diminishing marine life and changing ecosystem partly reflect the impact of sewage and nitrogen discharge into the bay. Our project intends to address this issue at the source, and more efficiently remove nitrogenous compounds during wastewater treatment.

They were printed on sweaters and key rings, delivered to friends, instructors and others who gave us a hand during our preparation. Also we will bring them to Giant Jamboree. Thanks to them, more and more people come to know our team, realizing that iGEM involves more than wet-lab students.

As a cutting-edge therapy, cellular immunology is really a hot spot. Mostly people only know it by the media, but hardly understand how it works. To make the public get acquaintance with the STEP system and how it comes to our mind, an animated video was created. Producing a video helps us reflect on the whole project design as well as plays an educational role.

What’s the connection between porcelain and STEP? We came to a workshop and made a STEP plate with our own hands. As a traditional Chinese art, it contains philosophy from our ancestor. Round and smooth, the porcelain plate serves people as a container, while it would easily hurt us when broken into pieces. Just like our system, it’s never easy to create one and make it serve the public for the right purpose.

Colour dash
At the end of June, five members of the team took part in a 5k run for the Irish Cancer Society, called the Colour Dash. Each kilometre of the run has a colour dedicated to it which represents a side of cancer; either a cancer we need to find a cure for or, a cause of celebration such as cancer survivorship.
Ponytail Campaign
As part of her birthday celebrations one team member Seema Subedi decided to raise fund for the Rapunzel Foundation, which is a charity organisation that works to improve the lives of those living with hair loss (alopecia). She took part in the Ponytail campaign by cutting 15 inches off her hair.
Tandem Charity Skydive
On Tuesday 13th September four team members took part in a 10,000ft tandem charity skydive in aid of Breakthrough Cancer Research which has done ground breaking work in the field of cancer. In the lead up to the big day each member worked to raise €480+ in funds.
Our Just Giving page can be found via the following link: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/UCCiGEM2016
Here are quotes from two team members explaining why they wanted to partake in the charity skydive:
James Meeke: I've fallen off of bikes and down staircases, so falling out of a plane is the next logical step! Doing it In aid of a worthy organisation such as Breakthrough Cancer Research makes it all the more rewarding!
Donnacha Fitzgerald: I'm doing the skydive because I've always had the urge to do something as crazy as fall from 10,000 feet, and because I am 100% confident that Breakthrough Cancer Research are more than a worthy investment in the future battles against the toughest cancers!""
Charity Quiz
In addition to the various other ways we raised money and awareness for charity, we also hosted a charity quiz in our university with multiple societies fundraising for Breakthrough Cancer Research. It was a tremendous success as over 70 participants entered the quiz and we raised over 400 euro for the charity."

Figure 4 | Overview of the orthogonality experiment system. a, plasmid pUC19 with transcriptional factors; b, plasmid p15A with test devices for orthogonality. There are 5 of this kind of plasmid with 5 integrases. All primer pairs used in following experiments are shown as arrows; c, primer pairs A & B designed.
Results
Figure 5 | Gel electrophoresis results of PCR with 25 cycles using specific primer pairs to validate the orthogonality. Every attB/P sites on testing plasmid(see Fig.4) of each integrases were tested. Original attB/P site with specific primer pairs A and B is shown in Fig.4 c. Pair A used to detect original site, while pair B used to detect recombinated site. Experiments were set up in E. coli TOP10 strain with transcriptional factors cultured at 37℃.
As shown in Fig.5, bands on lane A and B indicate the existence of original and recombined attB/P sites template respectively. The result implies good orthogonalilty between most integrases in that only the band of corresponding recombined attB/P site appears after induction. However, we find that integrase phiRv1 can invert the sequence between attB and attP sites of integrase phiC31. By the way, the leakage of integrase Bxb1 and TG1 is obvious. We have discuss this leakage in diffusion model part.
The efficiency of the integrases
Overview
If we want to build meaningful sequential memory modules, integrases we use in our system should have high efficiency, which means low leakage and high percentage of recombinant after induced. So, we designed experiment to investigate original sites versus recombinants.
Methods
Another type of testing plasmids was constructed(Fig.6). Sites of phiBT1, Bxb1, phiC31, phiRv1 and TG1 were tested using qPCR, quantitively measuring the percentage of recombinants.

Overview
    We are very concerned about the topics about public engagement and safety problem (about the transportation of biological products) in synthetic biology.
    Before we take up the challenge to address these topics, the identification of them are discussed in detail. We’ve considered the reason why the public need to engage in science, and what role they should play. In order to contribute to the popularization of synthetic biology, we also try to give some possible solutions, and try to apply them into reality. As for the safety problem, status quo of it is carefully investigated from as many aspects as possible. We give our own perception of it, and also try to give some suggestions.
Public engagement
    We have to admit that a similar concept in biology field, transgene, has been doubted since it came into being, and the idea of synthetic biology is heard much less, which make the public much easier to misunderstand it. Apparently, synthetic biology will not “save the world”, but it has great potential to make it a better one. As iGEMers, we hope to contribute to expand the public understanding of synthetic biology, so that to save the potential from the public’s misunderstanding. From another aspect, burying ourselves in the lab is not a sensible idea, so we need the voices outside lab to help us to know what we have been engaged in better. So we organized some activities concerned public engagement to interact with people. To our satisfactory, we got positive feedbacks and were inspired in a way.
    What role should the public play in science? We have been thinking about these since the beginning of our project. In China, people are familiar with the heated debate between the media people and the biologists about transgene."
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in order to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. Throughout the game, we advertised the iGEM to freshmen, and introduced our project this year. It was worth mentioning that we also collected solicited opinions from all the students about the feasibility of our disease detective device and treatment device with cell-free system this year. 86.7% of participants showed positive attitudes towards our detective device, with the common sense of this device could performed pre-diagnosis quickly to guide patients. 66.8% students thought that it was difficult to treat tumors with vesicles, but it was very promising.
Visiting Yanwu Elementary School
In order to popularize the common knowledge of biology to the public and meanwhile to draw the public attention to synthetic biology, this year we XMU-China team visited to Yanwu Elementary School, volunteering to teach elementary students biology, introducing our team and work, and directing them to do some simple biological experiments. For instance, we let them extract DNA from bananas.
In the course of our introduction, the children of Yanwu Primary school expressed their great enthusiasm, responded positively to our interaction, and moreover they showed terrific zest for our introduction. In these next simple experiments, the children were thrilled to be involved in one of the experiments.
In the end, through our teaching and guidance, most of the children have achieved remarkable results during the experiments. After the event, Yanwu Elementary school students said they learned a lot of useful knowledge, and very happy to do these interesting experiments by themselves within our guidance.
Also, the teacher fed back that they think this activity is so meaningful, extremely hoping to hold more such events in the primary school campus.
Idea and Wisdom
No one can make great progress without advice and golden ideas from their excellent partners. During last six months, we participated in some iGEM conferences or even worked as the innovative online meeting organizers. Hopefully these events contributed greatly to all of us.
The CCiC
The 5th CCiC, which full name is the Conference of China iGEMer Community Meetup, was held at ShanhaiTech University on the subject of “Among us, past, present and future meeting” from August 27th to 31th. Dozens of teams from all over the China as well as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer if the iGEM Foundation, Meagan Lizarazo took part in. During this conference, we fortunately got the chance to have deep communication with many iGEM teams including iGEM_BIT(Beijing Institute of Technology University), iGEM Tianjin (Tianjin Unniversity)"

However, 04500 was extremely dilute, while 032015 was extremely concentrated. Additionally, SpeI appeared to not have cut completely:
This was a double volume digest of 100µL, which is very bad considering the resources wasted. It may be possible to do 50µL reactions with high concentrations of plasmid and extend the digest, then purify this smaller volume to 30µL in order to save precious enzymes.
Digestion products will probably not be used due to these issues. J032015 was diluted to 50% of  its current concentration, as that band is REALLY bright.

⇒ A giant digestion of ZiF268, Gil-1, ProRBS, and ADIA-I was prepared. The following change(s have been made to this protocol as a test:
∴ 1µL Enzyme instead of 2µL will be used, since a large excess of enzyme is used anyway. This will save enzyme (duh.) This was recommended by Knight in the openwetware protocol.
∴ Digestion time was extended to ~4 hours (up from 2 hours) due to the nature of double digests with SpeI and PstI in NEBuffer 1 (both 75% effective), as well as XbaI and PstI in NEBuffer 3 (XbaI being 75% effective). SpeI was also behaving flakily in the previous digest (see above.)

We also had to detail our own qualifications and experience. This form had to be approved by the School of Biological Science's GM Safety Committee before we could begin work. A draft version of the form has been uploaded here for the sake of completeness.
On a wider scale, we are subject to the Health and Safety Executive of the UK government. As part of the 2010 UK iGEM meet-up in Newcastle, we attended a detailed talk from Mr. Brian Cook that outlined the various rules and regulations that we are subject to as well as the future development of further laws that are suited to the growing importance of synthetic biology. From this, we were given a good overview of the biosafety rules and guidelines that we have to consider when working with engineered organisms.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Some ideas that came up regarding how to deal with safety issues are as follows:
Standardised guidelines for risk assessment and probability / hazard identification. Many informatics and engineering projects incorporate such guidelines that allow them to pre-assess the possibility of risk both before and throughout the project timeline; an accepted global standard for such a purpose may be useful for future iGEM competitions.
A structured and comprehensive testing regime, coupled with defined standards as to how to characterise a BioBrick part in terms of its safety and a requirement (perhaps not restricted to iGEM, but certainly before the part is made available from the Registry).
A strict and defined process for the release of engineered organisms into the environment, allowing for the potential commercialisation of iGEM projects. One such effort is being spearheaded by Kim de Mora at the University of Edinburgh, who was a member of the 2006 team that worked on the prize-winning arsenic detection device that also pioneered the field of biosensors within iGEM.
The BRIDGE protocol, along with the ability to perform markerless insertion and targeted gene deletion, may be used to create a 'safer' host chassis as well as pave the way for releasing non-antibiotic-resistant organisms into the environment.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.

Understanding Microfluidics
The key goal of MARS is to make microfluidics as accessible and understandable as possible to the synbio community. From our poll results it was obvious that most people had not heard of microfluidics before or only had a limited understanding of their application in a lab. This highlighted the need for more education on our hardware and created the perfect basis for our human practices and public outreach.
We worked together with STEM Pathways at Boston University in order to engage and inspire High school girls to pursue careers or higher education in STEM fields. This event was particularly well suited to our project as our activity would be happening in conjunction with many others related to synthetic biology. This helped prep the students as they received a good understanding of synthetic biology prior to arriving at our microfluidics station.

Summer Pathways
On July 12th 2017 the BostonU Hardware team was able to participate in Summer Pathways, an event organized by STEM Pathways. This event aims to expose and engage high school girls in synthetic biology. Our activity aimed at giving the students a basic explanation of microfluidics and then push them to test this understanding through designing their own synbio chip using cardboard primitives.
The event opened with a video explaining the basics of synthetic biology and how it impacts the world we live in. Following this, the girls broke off into smaller groups and rotated between the different activities planned for the day.
Our activity began with a discussion of what microfluidics are and how our work can aid research in synthetic biology. Although we were limited to ten minutes, the student’s curiosity pushed us to explain microfluidics in way that was simple but did not lose the potential and universal applicability of the hardware.
Next, we handed out two synbio protocols, cardboard primitives and a primitive key. The students immediately began working on translating protocols to microfluidic chips and created a variety of creative designs. While the students worked, we engaged with each group individually answering questions, discussing designs and challenging them to include features such as shared inputs or valves geometries.
During this time, we were also able to ask the students what opinions or thoughts they"

Once the error messages are fixed, further literature searches and consultations will be done in order to change the biomass reaction to one that will target the product growth of cellulose instead of organismal growth of G. hansenii.  Once an accurate growth rate with the proper medium is found, it will then be possible to plot the organism growth rate vs. product growth rate. Plotting this data will determine if there is a direct or inverse relationship between the two quantities.

Safety
There are risks in all lines of work, however those within labs must be assessed and reduced as the hazards in this environment usually have more severe consequences. In order to minimise the risks within labs there are legislations in place within iGEM, the UK and worldwide. Our lab work is in line with these legislations. As Part of our Human Practices we have looked into the national legislation for biological safety ( Heath and Safety Executive ). In the labs we have followed the standard safety procedures as per the regulations of the University ( Occupational Health and Safety Service ).
Local Policies
Each member of the team must abide to the policies, practices set by Newcastle University, all staff, and students are responsible for making themselves familiar with these responsibilities. Academic staff support our team to ensure that these policies and practices are followed with care. They have prior experience within the molecular biology labs we are working in. Each team member supports each other throughout the project and has received appropriate lab inductions, training in handling of chemicals, sterilisation methods, disposal and handling of contaminated material.
Every lab has safety files that are revised and modified regularly and kept up to date, the appropriate forms have been signed by every member participating in experiments. Risk assessment forms are filled out for every compound and lab experiment, and then signed off by all team members. Before entering any of the labs the Emergency Procedures were outlined by a member of each lab.
National and International Policies
The work conducted in our labs was carried out according to UK and European regulations. We reviewed these in more detail as part of our Human Practices section, to help communication within synthetic biology we"

ICT-Mumbai,2017,Team:ICT-Mumbai#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," inoculated for making glycerol stocks and miniprepped the next day.
Week 10: Gene deletions!
We learned that ammonia assimilation in E. coli is regulated by PII proteins that adenylate glutamine synthetase (GS) under nitrogen rich conditions and render it inactive. It was found that the cell also contains another PII like protein called GlnK.(Ref. 2)
Since we wanted the cells to work under ammonia rich conditions, we had to delete glnB gene coding for PII, and, glnK gene coding for glnK. Gene deletions were carried out as described by Datsenko and Wanner (Ref. 3).
Week 11: Sequencing results arrive
Sequencing results were positive only for glnA. We anyway decided to get biobricked glnA and gltD synthesized from IDT. Since the PR in our kitplate is without a rbs, we decided to get that too synthesized from IDT. We sent out the sequences for the same. We decided to have glnA, gltB, gltD along with PR in one plasmid and BBa_K1604022 with BBa_I74211 in another plasmid containing a different ori in the same cell. We planned to carry out a 3A assembly using BBa_1604022, BBa_I74211 and BBa_JO4450.
Week 12: 3A assembly!
Sequencing results were positive only for glnA We carried out a variant of 3A assembly using BBa_1604022 (cut with EcoRI and SpeI), BBa_I74211(cut with XbaI and PstI) and BBa_JO4450 (cut with EcoRI and PstI). Unfortunately, it did not work.
Meanwhile, we received our gBlocks for glnA, gltDand rbs+PR from IDT. The concentrations of each of them were found to be extremely low that we reordered all the theree gblocks again.
From left to right: glnA fragment 1 (G1_F1), glnA fragment 2 (G2_F2), gltD fragment 1 (G3_F1), gltD fragment 2 (G3_F2), rbs+PR follwed by 1kb DNA ladder in the last lane.
Week 13: Discussions and decisions!
After a negative 3A result, we discussed and planned our next plan of action.

7-2 Discussion about iGEM JAPAN
 
We discussed about iGEM JAPAN’s future initiative at this meeting. Setting up iGEM JAPAN was committed to making it easier for iGEM teams to communicate with each other. However, the interactions between the iGEM teams have been decreasing recently, and the only event that iGEM teams gather together this year is the meetup held at Tokyo Metropolitan University in August.
We had to seek a solution for this problem. At this meeting in Nagahama, iGEM JAPAN created a Facebook page. Our future plan is to make a website directed toward the outside.
 
 
 
8. Our Question About Biosafety
 
 
Through the activities mentioned above , we found one question about our project : how can we can solve the safety problem (related to the commercialization. )
Our approaches to this problem were interview to a biosafety specialist.
We consulted the biosafety expert, Mr. Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a lecture on dual-use technology. After that, we asked him some questions about biosafety.
 
Q1. When we use bacteria that produces harmless substances, does a biosafety or biosecurity problem arise? (Naoto)
A1. In that circumstance, it is necessary to find out whether the problem comes from the bacteria or the substances. In other words, the measurement against the problem differs depending on whether the problem is biohazard or chemical hazard.
 
Q2. No matter how hard we try to keep bios"

Plugins
The great thing about BioHub is that we have designed a unified, extensible plugin platform, which not only have the powerful tools provided by the development team, but also is easy to learn and use by other developers to provide better features. Each specific feature of BioHub is provided by a plugin, whose developer do not need to care about details such as server and network requests. Plugins can just focus on performing their own tasks and manage user's design results. With BioHub's plugin platform, once any of the latest tools or algorithms in the field of synthetic biology got programmed, developers can easily transform it into a BioHub plugin by studying the sample files we provide, making it a new blade of the powerful Swiss Saber - BioHub.
Docker
In order to make BioHub easy to install, configure and use, we carefully selected the program architecture and package format. The use of server -  client architecture makes it possible for labs to run the server on a high-performance computer, and easily access it from any device. Also, we use Docker to package the program, which makes the server very easy to start, update and shutdown. Normally, users may never encounter any compatibility issues. What's more, we also released a virtual machine image file for non-Linux platforms.
Outlook
Since our project is a software designed for synthetic biologists to simplify their work as well as give them effective auxiliary, there are undoubtedly dozens of chances of this software to be improved, just like the previous work 'Biopano'. In the future, we will upgrade our program in order to implement more functions as well as enhance the current ones. For example, we may enable the 'Pathway finder' module to find the strength of the connection between genes, which our software cannot do this at present. Meanwhile, we will introduce our software and its background to our juniors to attract them to join us and to participate in the following iGEM competitions.

After which we had a round table discussion about what kind of projects we may follow up with and the process of using the NCBI databases to discover pre-existing sequence information related to our various ideas. One idea we have discussed was the option of creating a smoother introductory curve for fellow DIY-Bio commmunity members and the creation of home-brewed enzymes that might be to pricey for the amateur scientists. We ended the night with the beginning of the various ligation reactions, as seen above.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," commercially available for full-scale up at the time of application.
Technological verification: our product will be validated using either existing data (obtained within the last five years by a reputable third party) or data obtained by a third party source through the ETV program. This data would need to substantiate the performance claim that we would be trying to make about our technology.
Submission of application: A formal application including the verification data would be submitted for a fee of $1500. At this stage, we would sign a contract with EVT for them to assess our product.
Review of application: the data submitted is reviewed, and if found sufficient to substantiate the claims, is approved.  If this occurs, an award is issued, allowing the technology to be used for 3 years before a re-application is necessary.
When we have the biosensor working as a consistently performing prototype,  accurately predicting the levels of chemicals that it can sense in solution, both in the lab and the field, we will go through the EVT certification. Being EVT certified will instill confidence in us by end-users and investors which will aid in the success of our company.
Costs for the process
Initial application fee: $1500
Verification fee paid to third party entity: $10000-20000 depending on the nature of the tests required.
Renewal Fee: $2000/3 years
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Certification
In order to bring our product into the US market, which we hope to do by year five, we need to secure EPA certification. This is the required approval in the United States for biotechnology products. This can be an extremely extensive process, costing up to $300,000. As such, we will need to wait until we have established sales before we begin this process. It is still important to consider this early however, as it is a requirement for entry into US markets.
Conclusion
Through the development of a versatile sensing platform, we hope to be able to meet a critical market need for more rapid and reliable monitoring of toxins in the oil and gas sector. With a solid proof of concept in place, we hope to be able to bring this first generation product to market, as well as several future generation products. As we research to develop and optimize the product we will perform the necessary steps to meet the requirements of regulation for safety and standards.

We also transformed pC13P + pC13BA which resulted in very dense colony growth. Attempted to pick 5 colonies and culture them. Also column purified pC13CY. Carotenoids received the right forward primer for amplifying ‘’crtE+crtB+crtI’’ in pC13A, and we ran a long, two-step PCR with an extended annealing time and 40 cycles.
Today we completed the transformation of C. heterosporus and continued inserting our constructs into the new vectors for the last round of fungal transformations coming up. Transformation of PtrpC and ‘’afp1’’ was really successful! Picked colonies for culture and sequencing. On carotenoids, we finally got the right primer and ran a PCR for pC13A.

We transformed the completed ligations into E. coli. We checked for colonies in the evening, but there weren’t any yet. Any bacteria containing the new vectors have been growing very slowly under selective pressures, since they might be low-copy compared to our usual plasmids. We ran a PCR of pS13EB to prepare for Gibson assembly. Ran a gel of pS13EB, bands at 10,000 and 2,000 indicating probable correct product. Also, pC13DU, pC13DV, and pC13DW were miniprepped. We also digested pC13AI with SpeI and PstI. We then dephosphorylated, purified, and ligated pC13CY into pC13AI. We then miniprepped 5 colonies of pC13P+pC13BA, column purified the Psal, and quantified each.

Reason why Thor is a dwarf:
He is rather short.
Despite his short stature he is the tallest of his kin.
The family summer house is build for short people.
DnD dwarves have similar names to his.

Next, we test the effect of mazF. We transformed the constructed PcspA-mazF plasmid into BL21, added 1 mM IPTG to the plate, and cultured at 16℃ for 16 h (Figure 11A). We then cultured BL21 transformed with the PcspA-mazF plasmid overnight at 16℃. After diluting to OD=0.2 on the next day, the cells were cultured at 16℃, and the OD value was measured every hour for 9 hours (Figure 11B). From Figure 11 below, you can see that our kill switch can work at low temperatures. Although some engineered bacteria still survive, we believe they will be effectively killed in the absence of nutritional support.

Equation 3.
$$\begin{aligned}         \dot{X}_w &= - \beta X_w + \alpha X_u \cdot \left(\frac{\delta N - X_w}{\delta N} \right) - D X_w \label{Xw}             \end{aligned}$$
Equation 4.
Where, κ is the death rate, δ the maximum carrying capacity of the cells, α the rate constant for binding, β the rate constant for unbinding.
Equation [1] represents the change in E. coli cell concentration, equation [2] represents the change in limiting substrate concentration, equation [3] represents the change in unbound particle concentration, and equation [4] represents the change in concentration of particle bound to the surface of the E. coli.
In equation [3] we have βXw [9] which represents particle unbinding from the E. coli population, it depends on β: the kinetic detachment rate, and Xw: the concentration of particle that is bound to the surface of the E. coli. We are also removing particles from the solution by $$\alpha X_u \cdot \left(\frac{\delta N - X_w}{\delta N} \right)$$. This depends on the kinetic binding rate α, the concentration of unbound particle within the solution (Xu), and the proportion of available binding sites on the E. coli, this is represented by $$\left(\frac{\delta N - X_w}{\delta N} \right)$$. Equation [4] is the negative of equation [3] but we also remove Xw at some dilution rate D.

Blog #3 - School Project Kick-Off
By NBailly 20:48, April 28 2014 (CDT)
Today was the kick-off for the cooperation between our iGEM team and the Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Aachen. In the upcoming weeks, exciting school lessons with members of our iGEM team await the students of the 9th grade biology-chemistry class. Different aspects of our project will be highlighted and explained to the students. Demonstrative experiments will explain the practical relevance.
In today's lesson, our members Nina and René offered the students a short impression of what to expect in the course of this teaching module. We also explained synthetic biology and the goal of our project.
