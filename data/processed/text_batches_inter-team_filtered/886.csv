Plasmid preparations of the liquid cultures from the transformation of BtuF in R. planticola were performed.
A control digestion of BtuF in R. planticola was performed and successful for all tested clones.
Collaboration with Team TU Darmstadt:
Transformations of S. blattae with MiniColactive, MiniColmut and pSB1A3(empty vector) were performed. All transformations were successful, the colonies on each plate were counted.
GlmS and BtuF constructs:
GlmS and BtuF were cloned in pSB1C3 and transformed in E. coli TOP10. Plasmid preparations were performed and the plasmids were sequenced.
MutB constructs from the lab:
Expression studies were performed for PMB5 in R. planticola as well as for PTM3A, PTM3B and PTM6 in S. blattae. Analysis with SDS page and western blot showed expression of PMB5 in R. planticola.
B12-Assay:
R. planticola with Glms w/o Thio as well as with BtuF w/o Thio were cultured and induced with arabinose. After harvesting, fractions of cytoplasm, spheroplasm and periplasm were separated. Samples of the fractions were submitted to the B12 plate assay.

MutB constructs from the lab:
PMB-Amp was transformed in S. blattae and PMB-Kan was transformed in R. planticola. All MutB constructs were checked for restriction sites that may interfere with the ones present in iGEM prefix and suffix. It was concluded that there were too many to continue the work with these constructs.
B12-Assay:
The plates showed no growth of E. coliDSM4261 where the samples were added. Instead the area around the samples were lighter than the rest of the plates. This might be due to the presence of buffer P in the samples killing the E. coli cells. Therefore, in all following B12-assays, a desalting of the samples was suggested.

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2018,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," The team members need to understand more about the current diagnosis and treatment methods later, and then consider whether you can focus on diagnosis rather than advanced treatment if you want to make more contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer.
There are many approaches to the current treatment of colon cancer, but the treatment effect for advanced colon cancer is not ideal. The key to colon cancer prevention is not to focus on advanced conditions doing hard treatment, but how to find them earlier. The team members need to understand more about the current diagnosis and treatment methods later, and then consider whether you can focus on diagnosis rather than advanced treatment if you want to make more contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer.
In order to explore more possibilities in the practice of the project, we communicated with several teachers at the School of Pharmacy. We propose to use certain materials to protect the bacteria into the intestine and realize the possibility of oral administration. Professor Guo Shengrong, who is mainly engaged in the research of polymer materials and drug delivery systems for emerging medicines, believes that the use of gastric juice insoluble API materials, such as pH sensitivity. The enteric coating can be achieved and a brief explanation of how to design the bacterial coating is given. Further, we consulted Professor Qiu Mingfeng, who is engaged in research on new drugs and new dosage forms, and determined the feasibility of preparing the freeze-dried powder into a commercially available enteric-coated capsule shell, and was fortunate to have a capsule-making process in his laboratory. We also consulted Associate Professor Qian Xiuping who is engaged in microbiology research. She also affirmed the feasibility of oral capsules and learned that she had done similar experiments. I believe that our project will have a wide application space.

Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#AzureA_-_-_TEXT.html," and Trichomonas. Giemsa stain is also utilised to visualise chromosomal configurations by the so-called “G-Banding” of karyograms, which were the early methods of detecting chromosomal deletions and translocations (Sumner, 1980). The Azure A compound used herein was Azure A chloride; supplied as a dark green powdered solid available from several chemical supply vendors. The Azure A used by Glasgow Team was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (A6270)
The costs of staining DNA
Sigma-Aldrich sells 10ml of Ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution at a concentration of 10mg/ml for £45/$56 (E1510) (Sigma-Aldrich, 2015). We used a solution of 15ul (10mg/ml) EtBr per 0.5L of TAE running buffer for post-run staining, which works out to ~6666 0.5L stains per bottle of Ethidium. Traditional DNA staining with Ethidium bromide appears to be low-cost when only the expense of buying the stain is considered; with a cost per gel of £0.0067. However the cost to a lab is greater than simply the stock stain; Ethidium stained DNA requires visualisation on a UV-transilluminator, and the model of UV transilluminator available to us comes from a range which begins at £600/$900 (VWR, 2015). UV illumination requires an enclosed space where other people and sensitive items will not be damaged by irradiation. Additionally, imaging an Ethidium stained gel requires specialist camera filters to prevent camera sensor damage by the UV radiation, or the use of an enclosed illumination and photographing apparatus such as the BioRad Gel Doc™ XR system. Disposal of Ethidium bromide stained gels is also costly; EtBr has been found to be a potent mutagen in in vitro testing, thus disposal and handling is treated very seriously. The EtBr disposal policy of the University of Glasgow states that EtBr waste should be disposed of into biohazard marked containers, which must be uplifted by a 3rd party waste disposal service. 10g of Azure A chloride powder costs ~£36/$60. 500ml of 1x stain was reused by Glasgow up to 2x per day, for two weeks, equalling somewhere in the region of 28 gels per 500ml of 1x. 10g of Azure A chloride will produce 25L of 1x stain, or 50 500"

Monday: Today was Simon's return to the world (yep, he's back and brought us chocolate). Early in the morning we had our third meeting with Copenhagen team. Valencia couldn't make it again. Nothing has changed much since Copenhagen still has problems with the assembly technique (USER cloning). We are going to stay in touch by e-mail with both teams and  will schedule another meeting once they have constructs ready.
Also, transformation of E. coli with Lux Brick took place to try our franky's chick sensor.
We did a PCR colony of the bacteria with C1.1, C1.2, Pcaa3 and ADF3 and finished with a regular PCR for our constructs parts.
Oh, and Pollak is really sick but comes to the lab anyway...
Tuesday: So today we tried out our franky's chick light sensor. It works ok under environmental light and in the dark room. We reinoculated our lux coli (sob medium) to test the arduino's sensitivity under bacterial light tomorrow.
WE HAVE CONSTRUCT 1.1 READY! After the selection by colony PCR of constructs assembled last wednesday, we digested them and colony number 8 of C1.1 is the right size. YEAH! The rest of colony PCR's although (wednesday's C1.2 and the friday assemblies) were... well"

To guarantee a reliable reporter expression we first built a stable cell line of mCherry reporter with pTight promotor of both HEK293T and HeLa cells, and used transient transfection of transcription factor tTA to select a best monoclonal cell strain. After that we transfect it with a single chain or both chains of VEGF-STEP, adding VEGF to the solution and see if it makes a difference. We also test different transfection quantity and ratio of two chains, and build a model to study the best transfection condition (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Principles of our modelling work.
Another work we decide to do is to raise the binding affinity of the scFvs and ligands. An improved binding affinity means a stronger attraction between the two chains when signal protein exists, thus increasing the dynamic range of our system. A little change of sequence on the interface of the extracellular domain can affect the structure of that interface to a large extent, and the binding affinity might be greatly increased or decreased. As it should be, we can certainly try every permutation of residues on the interface by mutating residues again and again and screen out the best sequence through wet experiment. A better strategy is to look before you leap. Instead of enumerating those possibilities of the sequence in wet lab, we can first test it virtually in dry lab. Here, we use Rosetta, a software for computational modeling and analyzing of protein structures, to accelerate the process of designing and redesigning. Through Rosetta we can achieve structure predicting, macromolecule interacting and sequence designing for the ligand binding domain of these two chains. After acquiring a certain mutation with the lowest energy, we can express the mutant protein, compare its binding energy with the original protein through ITC test and in turn model our work or optimise the algorithm we use"

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," academics, bTB is not only a highly challenging disease, it is a disease where advancements have been slow to non existent.
However, each group is working towards the common goal of eradicating bTB, all from different approaches. Saved & Safe is working to bring these approaches together... Something our test may be able to assist with.
Smart Solutions
One of the problems to do with bTB in the UK is the issue of how the disease is dealt with. In its simplest form if an animal tests positive for TB it is immediately sent to slaughter, the farm is put under restriction and a second test will be conducted in 60 days. This routine will continue until the farm has no positive reactors for two successive tests. Apart from restrictions to the farm, no other measures are put in place to try and aid with clearing bTB from the farm. Any further action has to  come from the farmer individually. Where is the solution?
Yes, some farms will take a number of usually expensive and difficult measures. This can involve building a wall around the farmyard to isolate it from the environment outside - something that can cost up to £250,000. Keeping any cattle indoors all year around is also a common method to limit the effects of bTB. However none of these measures offer a genuine solution to the problem of bTB.
Michael made it clear that smart solutions are the way forward. Rather than the situation being left for the farmer to deal with, a coordinated effort that offers a motive for the farmer is needed, and this is where the UK can learn from Saved & Safe...
Providing the Missing Mechanism
Saved & Safe offer the mechanism for coordination of the elements that are needed to eradicate bTB from a farm. Taking a field by field, farm by farm, county by county approach allows for a coordinated, strategic approach to achieving officially bTB free status for the UK. M.bovis has been shown to persist in the environment for up to 21 months - during this time it is crucial an infected farm has a way to manage the infection. Isolation of the farm, disinfection of the entire area and protection of the border around the farm offers this management tool. Taking a strategy that saw a reduction of bTB incidence by 96% in just 10 years in New Zealand and bringing it to the UK makes Saved & Safe a world leader in the fight against bTB.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,"_J23106, and BBa_J23119 were characterised for expression strength using a GusA assay in C. difficile. The four novel registry parts were characterised alongside the existing registry promoters in a GFP assay in E. coli as well as in a GusA assay in C. difficile. The most remarkable conclusion from the E. coli GFP assay of these promoters is that both of the suspected strong C. difficile promoter PCsp_fdx and Pcac_thl were stronger than any of the three existing registry promoters we assayed; with Pcac_thl producing around three times the concentration of fluorescein (0.3235µM) as the positive control used in the InterLab studies (0.0958µM).
As part of our collaborative studies, we invited two other iGEM teams (Imperial College London and University of Warwick) to characterise our composite parts using their equipment and calibration curves, and the observed reproducibility between laboratories further validated our observations. Furthermore this part has now been characterised in a Gram-negative and a Gram-positive non-model organism. When tested in the Gram-positive organism it was driving expression of gusA.
Our main objective in characterising these promoters was to find a suitable pair of strong promoters to use in our subsequent dCas9 or asRNA projects. For this the GusA assay within C. difficile was most relevant since this is the chassis in which these constructs would be acting. The C. difficile GusA assay clearly showed that none of the three existing registry promoters from E. coli had any detectable activity in C. difficile. By far the strongest promoter we were able to measure was PCsp_fdx which was around 7.5 times stronger than the next strongest promoter we found (PCdi_TcdA). We were unable to clone the strongest promoter from the E. coli GFP assay PCac_thl into a GusA reporter plasmid. This is likely because of the toxicity of the gusA gene in E. coli and since we know that  PCac_thl is the strongest of our promoters in E. coli it is unsurprising that this was the most problematic plasmid to clone. As a result we did not measure the strength of PCac_thl in C. difficile, but due to its measured strength in C. difficile as well as its widespread use for overexpression studies in Clostridia we decided to select it alongside PCsp_fdx as a promoter to use in the next stage of our project.

Kyoto,2018,Team:Kyoto#ExpertInterview_-_-_TEXT.html,"yo University. The feature of the optimized method is that it is low cost and protocol is easy for students to reproduce. We suppose that such a low-cost cloning method would be beneficial for all students participating in iGEM. However, as we looked for information on the internet, there were pros and cons evenly so we could not assure if this method is reliable or not. Fortunately, Prof. Motohashi who developed this method was in Kyoto, so we decided to ask in person and establish the protocol of SLiCE method.
In fact, SLiCE was a very simple method. As it is mentioned in the result section, there was an example of cloning which succeeded for the first time by the method of SLiCE. From the above, we believe that this method is one of the dreamlike ways to make cloning work easier. In the same way, it is expected that we can share this method with other iGEMers suffering from cloning and release all iGEMers from the difficulty of the work."

What are we facing?
Biosafety has always been a major concern to the public, to the companies and to the researchers. Doubts and worries were raised just as genetic technology was invented. With the rapid growth of synthetic biology and the iGEM community, and more and more synthetic biology products being built with widely distributed DNA toolkits or the inexpensive DNA synthesis service(Synthetic and Will); we are facing the unprecedented biosafety issue of unwanted leakage of synthetic biology products to the environment that may cause unexpected but likely disastrous problems.
Predecessors
For decades, researchers were striving to build biosafety devices through auxotrophy or external inducive kill switches(Lee et al.); of the latter holins and restriction enzymes are most commonly used. Most failures of the previous devices were due to mutations and evolution of immunity(Moe-Behrens et al.) .
The two major threats of engineered microbes’ leakage are the possible horizontal gene transfer which will lead to the spread of recombinant DNA to the ecosystem, or the fact that engineered bacteria could contaminate or overrun the natural habitat.(Wright et al.))
Project Xscape
Under this circumstance, this year we decided to be a fundamentalist to synthetic biology, using genetic circuits and logic gates to establish biosafety devices which can apply to real-world situations.
Since cell death and lysis mean there is a continual presence of free DNA in the environment, holins, which are most widely used are excluded from our choices, and colicin E2 nucleases (Darmstadt iGEM2016) came into our site. We choose site non-specific nucleases since the entire genome and plasmids needed to be entirely digested to prevent the spread, and we use nucleases from a different family to prevent the possible evolution of nuclease inhibitors. Artificial DNA, RNA, and amino acids are a good solution, but due to its high cost so far, it is not applicable to most of the user.
For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the escape"

Luckily, the Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Activities (IETA) was held in Shenzhen on Oct. 13-15th. There is a software company fulfilled this proposal. It is worth mentioning that two leader of their team are people suffering from hearing disability. The application, named Deaf Life, can help with real time communication for hearing-impaired people and thus improve living quality of them. It was said on their website that, Deaf Life is not only a way for more people to pay attention to the hearing-impaired group, but also to attract more hearing impaired people to express their own ""voice"", to display their own talent and highlights. It also allows them to live better in our society, to the world, when communication with other groups is no longer an obstacle.” ( See more ).

Constructs
We propose to produce biological pigments that can be used in ink at a smaller environmental impact than current sources. We have identified pigments that can be produced in Escherichia coli that correspond to the four main colors in ink cartridges: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. They are melanin, indigoidine, anthocyanin, and zeaxanthin, respectively. We have decided to produce these pigments because there has been success in producing these pigments in the past (Misawa et al., 1990, Cabrera-Valladares et al., 2006, Lagunas-Muñoz et al., 2006,Yan et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015). Using synthetic biology techniques, genes corresponding to pigment biosynthetic pathways from a variety of organisms will be engineered for expression in E. coli. Pigment production will be followed by purification to separate the pigments from the bacteria, which will then allow the produced pigments to be incorporated into ink.
Standard Genetic Construct for Pigment Production
Each of the four pigment production constructs is designed in the same way. Each construct consists of a T7 promoter, the E. coli ribosome binding site (RBS) B0034 (with the exception of the zeaxanthin construct, which uses Pantoea ananatis native RBSs), the coding sequences for pigment biosynthetic genes, and the double terminator B0015.
Use of a T7 promoter allows us to utilize the induction system of the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). In this strain, T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) is expressed by the lacUV5 promoter, which can be induced by the addition of IPTG to the culture. T7 RNAP will then transcribe the pigment biosynthesis constructs(Figure 1.).
Figure 1. The T7 RNA Polymerase expression system in E. coli BL21(DE3)
Additionally, using this system allows us to control exactly when the cultures will start to produce the pigment biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore the"
CCA_San_Diego,2017,Team:CCA San Diego#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," reservoirs, groundwater, and ocean water. Due to the flexibility of our project, this process can be carried out on ships, within bioremediation centers, and in on-site vats. When speaking with a representative from Argonne, we learned that a sheet-like sponge is an effective approach at targeting oil for remediation by a process of submerging the sponges that contain our biodegrading bacteria within wastewater solutions. The oil is then absorbed into the sponge and eventually degraded. Through this method, the contaminants can be contained in one area instead being arbitrarily spread out, allowing for monitoring of the transformation of PAHs into byproducts. Vats of pumped water containing these sheet-sponges will be capable to carry out degradation in an ex-situ onsite or offsite location. Incineration and thermal treatment will also be applied to this application model in order to destroy bacterial byproducts and residue substances. The PAH-free water will be pumped back out in monitored values once degradation has occurred.
All these approaches have clear limitations. Therefore, there is the need for a commercially viable means of degrading PAHs in oil spills. Our approach offers a novel methodology for the degradation of multiple PAHs through the implementation of bacteria-derived pathways into E. coli. This methodology allows broad spectrum degradation of PAHs within an oil environment into safer residues.
To be able to degrade as many aromatic components as possible, our approach is to converge catabolic pathways and employ gene augmentation. This approach is possible because there are some intermediates that are common between pathways. To that end, we have cloned the genes upstream of the common intermediates of the phenanthrene and fluorene pathways and introduced them into a bacteria that would already have the ability to metabolize the downstream intermediates. In other words, the host strain already has a piece of the pathway, and by a process of engineering, we are augmenting its gene pool and thus its capacity of degradation.  The advantage is that the product is universal meaning that it can degrade many chemical species of PAHs.
Applications of Designs in Commercial Settings
One application can be administered in cities or local living areas by treating sewages with sophisticated sponge racks for contamination remediation that comes from asphalt runoff and may possibly contain harmful PAHs.
Other sources of PAHs are derived from industry products such as dyes, plastics, and pesticides. Through weather or byproducts released from industrial companies, the harmful compounds may be released into streams, sewage water, and groundwater. The pump and treat methods we have created may then be implemented into efficient vat sites nearby to prevent"

Insights
Team Düsseldorf designed a construct which makes E. coli regulate its own cell density through a lysis gene. This gene is inducible by quorum sensing molecules. iGEM Düsseldorf proposed we could use this construct to regulate the E. coli population in our hydrogels. We set up a Skype call to discuss the possibilities. If they had their construct prepared on time, we could test it in our bacteria. During the conversation, we also realized that quorum sensing may offer an option to prevent the infiltration of our gel by foreign bacteria.
Follow-up
Researched the potential of using their construct for the prevention of:
overcrowding
infiltration by foreign bacteria. Check our safe-by-design page for the details.
August 07, 2018. Meeting with professor Menno Prins about biosensing
Menno Prins is a professor at TU/e active in the field of molecular biosensing who develops technologies for protein detection and the study of protein function. We met with him to discuss the potential of our living material in sensing applications. He warned us that bacterial biosensors have two serious disadvantages compared to (bio)chemical or physical sensors: they require very stable environments and detection is slow compared to other sensors: on the time scale of hours versus milliseconds.

August 07, 2018. Meeting with professor Menno Prins about biosensing
he only recommends using bacterial sensors as ‘second choice’ sensors. That is, when bacteria are anyway present in the system (e.g. in the gut), and when they can also be used for sensing to favor integration. Our lysostaphin secretion would be a good example of this, as it could be combined with quorum sensing to only secrete lysostaphin in the presence of S. aureus. Prins urged us to ensure that different functionalities can be regulated individually, as this makes testing and optimization much easier. We will do this by using distinct operators for our adhesin, secretion system and lysostaphin. He also highlighted the importance of safety, to prevent destroying our reputation and that of the SynBio field.
Insights
We learned that bacterial biosensors are most relevant as ‘second choice’ technology. We realized that this also applies to our system if we choose to integrate a sensory mechanism.
We also realized the advantages of regulating different functionalities independently.
Our awareness of the importance of safety in the design process increased.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"
Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," module and demonstrated that the system functions best on 1:1 ratio compared to the 2:1 used most often in Tet-On systems.
As we can see our RNAi-based logic circuits are capable of actuating our pre-programmed response (fluorescence in this case) in a cell-type specific manner! Another striking result is that our model seems to be remarkably successful at predicting the classification performance of a given circuit!

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the flexibility and wide range of microfluidic chips compatible with TERRA make the system easy to incorporate into different workflows.
Potential Users
Engaging with Experts and Potential Users
During the course of this project, we met with two commercial microfluidic companies based in the greater Boston area, Phenomyx and Fraunhofer Center of Manufacturing Innovation. During these meetings, we presented an overview of our system TERRA alongside the goals and motivations driving the project. Meeting with these microfluidic experts helped give us an idea about how to use our system to help remedy the lack of standardization in the field of microfluidic as well as brainstorm some potential applications and ways to integrate our system into some common workflows. Explore our integrated human practices page for more information.
In addition to the experts in the commercial microfluidics industry, we also consulted our resident microfluidic experts and other researchers here at Boston University’s Design Automation and Manufacturing Production (DAMP) Lab. From the researchers focused on biology, we were given a some protocols that TERRA should be able to run in order to improve their workflows. The graduate students who worked directly with microfluidics helped us determine the feasibility of some of these workflows and help guide the course of the project."
IONIS-PARIS,2017,Team:IONIS-PARIS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," funniest was to disguise one               person from each of the student unions (Sharkomère and Western Shot)  as a bacterium and explain to us their properties.
Here are the 2 best bacteria:
In conclusion, this week was exhausting, but it was very interesting to exchange with others. Moreover we got a lot           of positive feedback and interesting ideas about Softer Shock that were used later in the development of our project. We succeeded in communicating about our project and this worldwide competition. Even if it was a stressful week         it allowed us to practice coordination and build team spirit.
Thanks to all these experiences we know how to talk about our project and inform young people through introductory         science education. It was a very rich experience to exchange with everyone because of their valuable questions and remarks.
Meetups
Parisian Meetup - 07/21/2017
We had the chance to be invited by the Pasteur iGEM team at         the Parisian Meetup the 07/21/17 to meet all French teams and present our project.
The day started with a breakfast around which we made a first relation with the presented teams. Then all teams presented         their projects. We were able to exchange about our difficulties, our successes and advise us for the continuation of the         competition.  Moreover some teams such as Bettencourt asked for our help in model a part in their project, in their case         they wanted us to aid them to model their RNA organelle strands. We started a new collaboration and it was a pleasure to         help them.
After teams presentation each team had to pitch in front of everyone. At the end the jury had to choose the best         pitch and the winner won a teddy. The winner was the team of Toulouse with their project “Croc’n Cholera”. Finally they         split us in several groups to do little workshops, in our case we had a conference with an entrepreneur who quickly taught         us how to pitch properly for D-Day! It is important to present yourself correctly and to draw attention to a subject that is         important to us.
In conclusion, it was an incredible experience in which we had for the first time a professional presentation as a         mini Jamboree. We had the opportunity to meet other French teams, exchange ideas, points of view, learn from each other and         live an iGEM experience!
Since that day, we have been in touch and collaborating with some French teams such as Bettencourt, Grenoble and Pasteur.         We want to thanks the team Pasteur for this great adventure!

UVic
This is the first year that the University of Victoria has entered the iGEM competition. Our core team this year is a group of five students who are enrolled in a directed studies course under the supervision of Dr. Nano and Dr. Upton. There are also a number of other students involved, but who are not taking the directed studies course. Our lab notebook, ideas brainstorming, and progress can currently be found at igem-victoria.pbworks.com
Our Project
We are designing a NAND logic gate using the ribokey/ribolock system designed by the 2006 Berkeley team. This system should constitutively produce RFP except when the cells are grown in the presence of both arabinose and IPTG.
We are also coupling flourescent outputs with the ribothermometers made by the 2008 TUDelft team.

Software Promotion
Since our software is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists, it’s of great importance to promote our software to synthetic biology related users.
To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, in September we packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology and in October we packed a more advanced version to some igem teams worldwide. We introduced them to Biohub and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful. And then we have packed our completed version to the real synthetic biologists by now."
Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"18 bp spacer between the PAMs.
Target cassette 1 and 3 with 6bp and 18 bp spacer, respectively.
We had big problems regarding the 12 bp cassette and had to stop working with that one. The other two cassettes (BBa_2483005 and BBa_2483006) were successfully assembled 5 times resulting in 25 recognition site pairs per plasmid.  The PAMs and recognition sequences are facing each other to achieve the smallest possible distance between IAAM and IAAH. We put “big spacers” of about 120 bp length in between every recognition site pair to reduce problems of homologous recombination.
We hope to get better channelling results with this 2-plasmid concept than NUDT China 2015 because they only used one big part with less recognition sites.
We also uploaded two “subparts” of the final low-copy part BBa_K2483000 and K2483002. The first one consists of both IAA enzymes fused to RBPs, each with rbs and one Promoter (pVeg2). It was inspired by the part BBa_K515100 from iGEM Imperial College 2011.
K2483002 is a part containing LacI (BBa_C0012), a Lac inducible promoter (BBa_R0010) and dCas9. We made dCas9 inducible to reduce potential growth inhibition by it.
After both plasmids have been introduced into E.coli, IAA concentration was measured via GC-MS. The results were compared to controls with IAA-RBP fusions only and no dCas9, high-copy plasmid or sgRNA.
LLPS approach:
The second method revolves around Liquid-liquid-phase separation, a process naturally occurring in cells[1]. Through this process, proteins aggregate together to form droplets or membraneless bodies in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. This can be thought of as lipid droplets forming in water, just with proteins. Examples for this process in nature are stress granules or cajal bodies. The formation of droplets has already been studied by attaching YFP to Ddx4 (Nott et al.)[2], a protein known for aggregation. There are also indicators for this to happen in bacteria[3]. To use this mechanism for improvement of enzyme efficiency, the YFP-coding region will be replaced by the coding region of the IAA enzymes and expressed in yeast.

Apart from this we contacted the National Dutch sports organization, the NOC*NSF, to hear about their experiences with gene doping. However, as they pointed out, they are not very familiar with the concept and the idea of it actually happening. They wanted to help to find out about the prevalence of gene doping though and set the initial steps to send out our athlete survey to all Dutch top level athletes. What became apparent from the athlete surveys we had already send out is that athletes highly value quick detection with a result within a few days. Furthermore, athletes tend to not mind privacy invasive tests, since they see it as inherent to the desire to be in sports. To us nevertheless, athletes' comfort and well-being remain top priority at all times.
3. Reflection and Responsiveness
Apart from the science related events, we have talked to many individual stakeholders and integrated their feedback into our design, as can be seen from our Value Sensitive Design .
3.1 Value Sensitive Design
Based on the interaction with all stakeholders we then created a Value Sensitive Design to improve our strengths and reduce our weaknesses to satisfy everyone’s needs and preferences. In figure 8, an overview is given of our values, how they are related to values we identified through interaction and the design requirements that we implemented based on this. Below you can read more about how the stakeholders have influenced us in every step of our project.

Sample Preparation
The Dutch National blood bank, Sanquin, has been of great influence for the development of our sample preparation. Sanquin is specialized in blood analysis and has it's own research departments to keep improving and developing new methods for the analysis of blood. Sanquin is responsible for all donor blood in the Netherlands, but is for example also specialized in tests focusing on the fetal cell free DNA in a mother's blood. This knowledge about analysis of DNA extracted from blood was exactly what was needed to develop a secure and optimized sample preparation for our project, ADOPE.

When he got to know that we wanted to fight IBD, he pointed out to us that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which is an important factor of his ongoing research, is a molecule that has the ability to promote regeneration of cells in the inflammatory regions. Prof. Lu introduced us detailed mechanisms of this growth factor and emphasized that in different human tissues, EGF will have different effects. Therefore, as a growth-promoting factor, EGF may bring about the risk of over-proliferation and even cancer. He reminded us that we have to pay great attention to safety issues.
In the end, Prof. Lu encouraged us to be ambitious and have a try. It turns out that this interview became the foundation of our project!
In our project, we chose intestinal bowel disease as our object of study. To have a better understanding of IBD and obtain the first view of the current situation of patients, we contacted two doctors and set up an interview with them.
One is Ge Wensong, who comes from Shanghai Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The other is Zhang Shengyu, who is from Beijing Xiehe Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine,Tsinghua University.
Here is the summary of the interview script. (Q= question, A= answear)
Q: Human diseases include not only intestinal diseases, but also many other diseases which threaten human health seriously. So what’s the reason that made you choose to do the research in the field of intestinal diseases?
A1: Diseases involved in gastroenterology are complicated. One of the most prominent disease is intestinal diseases. There are so many different types of intestinal diseases and a major part of them consists of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal tumors. Studies of intestinal disease are the core research of intestinal diseases nowadays. Personally, I’m very interested in the field of intestinal tumor.
A2: There are three reasons:
Upon the development of social economy and the change of life styles, disease spectrum of digestive system also has been changing. For example, the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease is closely related to the the process of industrialization in Europe and America. And I antipate that intestinal diseases will be one of the most common diseases of digestive system in the 21st century in our country. And the obvious increase of the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in our country in recent years proves this opinion.
During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example,"

Without libraries, what do we have? We have no past and no future. – Ray Bradbury
Figure 1: BBa_K2082004 and BBa_K2082005 in pSB1C3 Backbone.
Libraries are a powerful tool in synthetic biology, but underestimated in iGEM. Unfortunately, the construction of a library is a difficult and time consuming task.
To supply this tool for following iGEM teams, we provided our designed Monobody library ( BBa_K2082005 ) to the iGEM community, as implementation of a new category in iGEM parts registry. As a result, our unprecedented part collection includes not just a few parts, but rather over 100,000 distinct sequences of antibody mimetics, out of a theoretically size of over one billion (1,073,741,824) possible sequences which is the result of a sophisticated library design.
On top, we constructed and submitted a fundamental framework to construct further Monobody libraries or specific antibody mimetics. This part ( BBa_K2082000 ) consists of the Monobody constant regions including RFP instead of variable regions, which can easily be replaced with randomized variable regions or a constant Monobody segment for a specific"

After confirmation of the construct, Kozak Sequence – FadR coding sequence – NLS was cloned into pEGFP-N1 that contains mammalian constitutive CMV promoter. The pFadBA promoter and FadR protein constructs were to be co-transfected in HEK293FT cell and selected using different drug selection markers – Puromycin for BBa_J176171 and Neomycin for pEGFP-N1.
After co-transfection of two constructs to HEK cell, no EGFP signal could be detected from fadBA promoter construct. We believed that even though we have introduced Kozak and nuclear leader sequences to protein coding sequence, difference in prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription mechanism gives fadR protein low possibility to be expressed in mammalian cell.
After transfecting to mammalian cells, these promoters will be induced by Fatty Acids or its oxidation products, leading to expression of EGFP. By comparing the image of the intensity of EGFP using Fluorescent microscopy, we will be able to quantify their expression and determine the desired sensing mechanism which is most efficient for Glyoxylate genes expression.

The standard iron core of ferritin however is not very suitable for catalyzing this process. The catalytic activity of ferritin can be increased by synthesizing ferritin with a magnetite core. The synthesis of this ”magnetoferritin” however is time consuming and is prone to disruption due to oxidation.
Figure 2. Chemical equation for the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen radical species using iron as a catalyst; Fenton chemistry.
An alternative to increasing the catalytic activity of ferritin would be to provide the necessary ferrous ions for the Fenton chemistry via the iron complex Prussian blue. This compound could act as a surface modification agent to give the ferritin core a Prussian blue surface. Prussian blue has previously displayed high catalytic activity and is believed to act as a source of negative charge at appropriate pH levels in order to yield an affinity with positively charged peroxidase substrates such as TMB (Zhang et al., 2010).
Synthesizing Prussian Blue Ferritin
The creation of Prussian blue ferritin is a relatively simple process that involves the surface modification of the iron core of normal ferritin. In order to accomplish this purified ferritin is combined with the compound potassium ferrocyanide under acidic conditions in order to produce the iron complex Prussian blue (Zhang et al., 2013). This chemical reaction can be seen below:
Figure 3. Chemical equation for the synthesis of Prussian blue ferritin using potassium ferrocyanide.
The chemical process can easily be observed as there is a visible colour change from the colour of ferritin to the blue colour of Prussian blue ferritin (Figure 4). This reaction takes place overnight and then the Prussian blue ferritin is collected via dialysis.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Reversion_-_-_TEXT.html," was active through very low levels of arabinose in LB. It is possible     that even very low levels of leakiness can lead to some mutagenic proteins. For example in the case of dnaQ926 one     protein is enough to create one proofreading deficient polymerase III complex. In normal E. coli strains this should be no problem but the Top10 strain is deficient for the arabinose metabolism and therefore low levels of     arabinose are not metabolized but activate promoter activity.
We concluded that in order to obtain more reliable data we had to plate dilutions with low amounts of cells in order to     determine the viable cell count in our samples. To combat the supposed problem of promoter leakiness in LB media we dicided     to use LB supplemented with 20 mM glucose. This is analog to the protocol from Badran and coworkers who used a defined media with glucose.
Using all this experience, we designed another experiment to determine the mutation rate.
We transform E.coli Top10 with the reporter plasmid as well as the mutator plasmid (pSB1C3:BBa_K2082116 or BBa_K2082117), plate a portion     and use another portion to inoculate a LBCmKan culture with 20 mM glucose, let this culture grow till mid-log phase and induce     or repress the PBAD. 24 h after induction the cells were plated on LBCmKan or LBAmp each with 20 mM glucose and     counted revertants and the total viable cell number. This experiment was performed for each of our mutator in six replicates.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," presentation, and the fact that Adrian was not around to help us with the competent cell protocol, we decided to hold off on this.
Need to run gel on PCR products.
Also, heard back from Christina Smolke.  She is sending us the W303_alpha strain that has a knockout for the gal2 gene.  She is also sending us the construct that will enable us to do the same knockout in W303_1a.  Apparently, the construct can generate a knockout via homologous recombination for anything as long as we attach the correct ends during PCR.  The ends should target the construct to a specific site (locus) in the yeast genome, which will then cause a knockout of that gene.  Thus, once we receive the gene, we only need to PCR it with the primers that will target it to the GAL2 gene.  Note that this construct operates using G418 resistance this gene replaces the GAL2 gene via homologous recombination, thus simultaneously providing the knockout and inserting a selection marker.  G418 is expensive!! ($100 per gram).
Are there other possible uses for this powerful construct as we move into tests?
One other consideration to keep in mind is that if we decide to use the gal2 knockout strains we need to change our plan for subsequent transformations.  Hopefully we will not have to redo the transformations we have already completed, though we should keep that option open, especially if we do not see a good enough response from the GAL1 promoter in the normal W303 strains.

Came in to discover that both new bottles of LB media were contaminated.  The same was true of the 2xYPAD.  This means that it will be impossible to make an overnight culture of HB101 tonight.  However, streaked out a new plate and put into the incubator at 11:20 pm.
Will attempt ligations in ratios of 3:1 and 6:1 for insert to vector and see which one gives better results.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HumanPractice#Synenergene#TechnomoralScenario_-_-_TEXT.html," very new project for which some villages decided to only use regenerative energy sources. The citizen of Amberville liked their project because they knew that they were doing a good job for the environment and that they were an example for many people out there. Everyone in the village could see how good they were doing because of their displays. Each citizen of Amberville carried a watch which allowed to see how much energy was produced by which source. So many people wanted to change their lifestyle because of Amberville’s usage of energy.
It was a cloudy day back then when suddenly everything became dark in Amberville. They just asked themselves what the problem was because every electronic machine abruptly turned off. Someone pointed up in the air and the view of everyone followed his finger. They became afraid. The sun was dark, covered by the silhouette of the moon. The first citizen began to cry and scream. They fear the depletion of their reliable energy source from one moment to another. The energy of the sun was gone in a matter of seconds. A few hours later their machines turned on again because the sun became uncovered slowly. Suddenly they realized how dependent they were. The fear was huge that such an incidence would happen again. They talked to each other about their fears and the first citizen started to leave Amberville to move to another city that still used traditional energy sources.
The murmur was great after the incident when the citizen looked at their displays showing their energy balance. Many houses were producing more energy than needed. They knew this before but no one was interested in this fact. They were just happy with the knowledge to use only regenerative sources. But now, as they realized that their energy was not as safe as they thought, they started to think about possibilities to use this overflow. But nobody had an idea what to do.
A few days later there came a man. The citizen talked to him and he heard about the problem of their energy system. He had a smile on his face. Storage and transport systems were his profession. He talked about a new upcoming system which converts surplus energy into a storable form.
The days and weeks were passing until there was another incident. One moment all machines turned off again. The people looked up to the sun immediately but the sun was there, uncovered. They wondered how this could have happened. Many looked on their displays which were partly working without the energy. The income of solar energy was high enough but there was a zero at water energy. They turned around and ran towards the river where many hydroelectric power stations were built. With a surprised looked they realized the truth. There was no water left in the river. It"

Toronto,2012,Team:Toronto#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"M# 11-B6 A. niger (Sporometrics Internal QC).
Made LB agar, into which we added kanamycin from old stock we found in the chemical storage cupboard and was more effective than the stock we bought last month. (Remember that the antibiotic solution is added to the LB agar after it is autoclaved, but before it has cooled to solidification) Two plates of each Aspergillus strain were prepared in PD agar in order to make a long-term stock. The plates were left to culture over the weekend at 37°C. MS medium was made, and A. thaliana seeds were inoculated on the plates, which were stored in the cold room at 4°C.
  June 11
Made a long-term stock of all Aspergillus strains by suspending in 40% glycerol and storing in the -80°C. Attempted a Chelex prep on the A. niger strain 11-B5, which failed. Transformed K652001 using DH5alphaC.
  June 12
Made 500mL CTAB extraction buffer for D. carota DNA extraction, and 500mL TENS buffer for A. niger DNA extraction. The fume hood was cleaned, and all the chemicals were organised therein. The K652001 transformation was done with two plasmids (since the BioBrick kit came with two plasmids): one failed, the other did not. As a result, we must send this DNA for sequencing before continuing with PCR on this BioBrick. The D. carota DNA extraction was attempted, but had to be postponed, because the proteinase K stock exploded in the -20°C.
  June 13
Digested and ligated the Kozak sequence and did a transformation. The D. carota DNA extraction was attempted, and failed because regular 15mL Falcon tubes containing the DNA samples broke in the refrigerated centrifuge.
  June 14
The first portion of the D. carota DNA extraction was completed, and the result was left to incubate in the -20°C overnight, as per the extraction protocol. The June 13 Kozak transformations failed, so another attempt shall be made to remedy this situation.
  June 15

Experiment and Results
1    Glucose responsive promoter activity
The result shown in Fig. 1 indicated that PI promoter has significant activity in LB culture media. However, the activity of Pcar promoter is greater than negative control but much smaller than PI and positive control. It’s consistent with the properties of PI and Pcar promoters just mentioned previously in GENE CLONING section and described previously in Part Resgistry [Part: BBa_K861170] by team WHU-China in 2012 who designed the promoters.
In our experiment as presented in Fig. 2, PI and Pcar promoters just responded to various concentrations of glucose with a  very slight dose-dependent increase. This phenomenon didn’t correspond to the data provided by team WHU-China in 2012 and team NCKU_Tainan in 2016. Maybe our measurement was not in an optimized condition. Or the reporter of RFP activity was not sensitive enough to respond this difference.

Cloning
This year, we succeeded in cloning all missing parts required for our measuring system. While mPR Xl, mPR Dr, mig1, Padh1 and rox1 were available in pUC-IDT vector or pGEM T-easy vector from last year's iGEM-Team Tuebingen , Pfet3, Panb1, Psuc2 were cloned directly from yeast genome. Furthermore we used the fluorescent reporter protein mOrange ( BBa_E2050 ) and the transcriptional terminator Tadh ( BBa_K801012 ) from the parts registry. A galactose inducible promotor ( BBa_J63006 ) from the registry was used to create some plasmids which we want to use for the characterization of some of our parts. The cloning of luciferase succeeded only shortly before wiki freeze. As a result, the assemblies requiring luciferase were not performed anymore.
 
Assembly
Our general assembly strategy is illustrated in fig. 1. The pRS vectors do not fit the RFC10 criteria and can therefore not be used the for 3A-Assembly. Instead we used the BioBrick RFC10 vector pTUM100 ( BBa_K801000 ) which was kindly provided by the iGEM Team of TU Munich in order to fuse promoter and coding sequence. pTUM100 is a high copy shuttle plasmid which is based on the commercially available pYES2 vector and contains the cyc1 transcription terminator after the BioBrick suffix. Thus we could use some of the pTUM constructs directly for characterization of our repressible promoters (Pfet3-mOrange-pTUM100, Panb1-mOrange-pTUM100, Psuc2-mOrange-pTUM100, Padh1-mOrange-pTUM100). The parts required for the next steps of characterization were equipped with a the transcriptional  terminator Tadh by ligation into a pSB1C"
FAU_Erlangen,2016,Team:FAU Erlangen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of Curli fibers. Curli are amyloid fibers that Escherichia coli and some other bacteria produce to enhance the structure and stability of biofilms. These proteins were ideal for our purposes, as they are secreted by the cells and require no further purification before use.
To bind inorganic material, we inspected literature for peptides which are known to adhere to zinc oxide and metal sulfides. We chose a zinc oxide binding peptide (part:BBa_K2169137) (related to Tomizaki et al.) and a zinc sulfide binding peptide (part:BBa_K2169138) (related to Mao et al.) that had been shown to bind cadmium sulfide as well. Those peptides were fused C-terminally to CsgA (part:BBa_K2169000) and expressed in E. coli. The resulting biofilms were incubated with the inorganic compound and either sintered (heat inactivation) or UV-sterilized for further characterization.
Binding of Heavy Metals
Due to the metal binding domains on the curli fibers, the biofilms are able to bind not only zinc oxide, but also heavy metals. This might present a safety application since biofilms could scavenge toxic heavy metal ions out of wastewater.
Copper and nickel were tested first. The corresponding metal salt was dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water, yielding a concentration of 0.05 mol/l.  Absorbance spectra at t = 0 were recorded. Afterwards, a biofilm grown on a glass substrate was put into a beaker and submerged in the solution so that the biofilm is just covered. The solution was stirred gently. Absorption spectra were recorded after 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes. During this time, the metal ions were supposed to bind to the curli, leading to a decrease in metal concentration and therefore a decrease in absorbance of the solution.
Figure 1: Absorption spectra of copper (left) and nickel (right) solutions in dependence of time after exposure to biofilm glass slides.
Unfortunately, the curli could only bind very few metal ions, leading to ambiguous results. The change in concentration was too small for the UV/Vis analyzer to detect reliably.
We then tested a different approach utilizing gold ions. In the same setup, the biofilms were covered in a solution of chloroauric acid. Gold ions were reduced with ascorbic acid, leading to formation of gold nanoparticles in solution.

PiggyBac (PB) transposon system
PiggyBac (PB) transposon is a mobile genetic element that efficiently transposes between vectors and chromosomes via a ""cut and paste"" mechanism but leave no “footprint”. PB transposase in this system recognizes the transposon-specific inverted terminal repeat sequence (PB5 & PB3 in Figure 5) located on both end of transposon vector and efficiently moves the contents from the original sites and efficiently integrates them into TTAA chromosomal sites. Figure 4 illustrates the working mechanism of PB transposon system (Source: Wikipedia; Author: Transposagenbio).

A-B toxin
A-B toxinare two-component exotoxin secreted by a number of pathogenic bacteria. The complexes contain two subunits called A and B. A subunit is the active portion that is poisonous to host cells. B subunit has a translocation domain and cell receptor binding domain, which helps the A subunit going into the cell through endosomes. Figure 4 shows how Anthrax toxin (a kind of A-B toxin) enters into human cells (Source: Wikipedia; Author: Y tambe).

Experiment design
See the full list of plasmids we used.
Constructing EGFP-Cas9 expressing cell lines
The program aims to endow the human cell the capacity of resisting the infection of HIV by introducing the CRISPR/Cas9 system into the human cell. To test the efficiency of the Cas9 and explore the optimal conditions of the system, we need a reporter to indicate whether the Cas9 functions and the targeted sites are cut off and destructed. So a cell line integrated with EGFP and Cas9 gene is firstly constructed in a similar way. We use PiggyBac transposon to transfect Hela cell for permanently expressing Cas9 protein. Once the proper gRNA is delivered into these cells, Cas9 binds to the gRNA and start to cut the complementary DNA strand. The vector design is based on Feng Zhang lab’s and Wei Huang lab’s plasmids.

Error-prone PCR
Similar with Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), error-prone PCR is also a powerful method to produce linear DNA fragments, but results in random mutagenesis. This mutagenic PCR, which introduces random mutations by reducing the fidelity of the DNA polymerase. This process is similar to standard PCR cloning of a target sequence except that, for constructing a diverse mutagenesis library, a much larger pool of transformants are needed to increase the diversity of the library, making the process tedious and inefficient. As a result, various processes have been developed to streamline the methods.
The process of mutating P-atp2 is cockamamie, when it does not require excellent skill of experiment or advanced technology. Even though there are several ways to change the reaction condition, we finally chose to put manganese ion into our error-prone reaction system. So our error-prone PCR was performed in 25 μL reaction solution (Table.1).

Measurement of enzyme activity
To verify the promoters after the error-prone PCR, we used LacZ alpha, encoding the enzyme β-galactosidase with LacZ beta, as a report gene to reflect the ability of promoters. With the purpose of high throughput screening promoters, we measured them on the 96-well cell plate. As these bacteria grew normally and the OD600 was up to 1.5, we lysed cells, then"

A preparative gel for PCR products 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (from PCR with Herculase) provided new template DNA for another PCR with Taq/Pfu polymerase.
Week 6  (8/13 - 8/19)
preparative gel to isolate digested inserts
1. The first successful ligation and transformation into pGEM vector of part 4 in E. coli TOP10 was executed. A lot of colonies grew on the agar-plate. After a restriction digest with XbaI and SpeI and the control with a gel electrophoresis the right band of 711bp was visible. The sequencing of the DNA confirmed that part 4 has the expected nucleotide sequence. A Midi-Prep, restriction digest and preparative gel electrophoresis followed in order to prepare them for later ligation into pRS vectors.
Ligation of part 3, 6, 7 and 8 in pGEM vector was performed. Reaction took place over night at 4 °C. The transformation of these parts was executed into E. coli TOP10. After growth over night, a mini plasmid preparation was performed. After a colony-PCR with parts 3, 6, 7, 8 failed,  a step backwards to the restriction digest for insert controlling was done. Positive samples were prepared for sequencing. The parts 3 and 8 were sequenced successfully and yielded a good sequence. The ligation of parts 6 and 7 failed, so it was decided to skip part 6, in order to use only Psuc2 as a alternative promotor for luciferase.
2. The synthesized receptor of Xenopus laevis arrived at the laboratory. It was successfully transformed in E. coli TOP10 and purified with a Midi-Prep.

1. The PCR of the parts 1 and 2 with Herculase polymerase was executed. The PCR products were checked with an analytical gel afterwards. The PCR of part 1 failed again, so it was decided to reject part 1 and continue working only with luciferase (part 2), because only one reporter gene was needed.

Recently an A. terreus model has been published. This is quite interesting, since A. terreus is the organisms that naturally produces lovastatin. A quick scan for metabolites shows that both dihydromolacolin L and lovastatin are included in the model. Altough reactions have been lumped, now we can also investigate the potential differences between the lovastatin pathway present and the one we constructed ourselves.

Promoter design
Promoters classes
Constitutive promoters
There are several types of constitutive promoters that we can focus on.  These promoters are separate in regard to their respective sigma binding domains.  Constitutive promoters that interact with the sigma 70 domain of RNAP are most common most prevalent being as how sigma 70 RNAP is most common at normal cellular growth conditions.  The alternatives would be sigma 54 and sigma 32 binding factors, these types of polymerases are more active when the cell is under certain strain, such as heat shock of nitrogen starvation.
There has already been considerable work done with sigma 70 RNAP including an established promoter library of varying promoter strengths available on the parts registry.  We will develop and implement a method to fully characterize and standardize these promoters' activity and upload it to the registry.
Promoter UP Elements
Work has been done to identify a consensus UP element on some promoters which interacts with an alpha subunit on RNAP.  This UP element has been shown to significantly increase the recruiting power of promoters.  We are working on creating this UP element as a modular BioBrick part and characterizing its activity using the promoter characterization method that we develop.  We will also manipulate this element using a bottom-up design approach to get UP elements of varying degree's of strength.  Thus increasing the level of control we have over gene expression.
T7 Promoters
T7 phage promoters have long been utilized as a way to create orthogonal gene expression.  There is very little variation in the strength of T7 promoters available via the BioBrick registry.  Our goal is to identify a consensus T7 promoter sequence and use our bottom-up design approach to create a library of T7 promoters which we will characterize and upload to the registry.
Design strategies
Promoter design will be approached from the bottom up.  First, a consensus promoter sequence will be studied and accepted by researching the work done by others on various promoters.  This consensus will be our starting point as we identify which nucleotide and nucleotide sequences are most important to RNAP binding affinity.  We will use direct synthesis to construct promoter sequences that we will test.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 14_-_-_TEXT.html," functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much"

Since the model will only cover a short timespan, in which the Dronpa concentration is constant, we were interested in the steady-state concentrations. A steady state implies the presence of a decay of the molecules. An exponential decay with half-life time \(\tau\) is described by the following equation.
\(\begin{eqnarray}  \frac {\partial \left[  \textrm{Dronpa}_\textrm{On}\textrm{-Cre}  \right]_\textrm{decay rate}}  {\partial t} &=& -\frac{\ln(2)}{\tau}  \left[  \textrm{Dronpa}_\textrm{On}\textrm{-Cre}  \right]  \\ \end{eqnarray}\)
In a steady state, the production rate equals the decay.
\(\begin{eqnarray}  V : \left(\frac {K^n} {[GAL]^n} + 1 \right) &=& \frac{\ln(2)}{\tau}  \left[  \textrm{Dronpa}_\textrm{On}\textrm{-Cre} \right]_\textrm{s.s}  \\  \Rightarrow  \left[  \textrm{Dronpa}_\textrm{On}\textrm{-Cre}  \right]_\textrm{s.s} &=& \underbrace{  \frac {V \cdot \tau} {\ln(2)}  }_{V'}  : \left(\frac {K^n} {[GAL]^n} + 1 \right) \end{eqnarray}\)
For a given \(V'\), \(\tau\) and \(V\) are inversely proportional. Therefore, we did not need to explicitly determine these parameters, because their product is sufficient to determine the steady state concentration.
According to Hippler et al, 2003, photochemical reactions can be modeled as a zeroth order kinetics with the following rates.
\(\begin{eqnarray}  v_{\textrm{Off}\rightarrow\textrm{On}} &=& \alpha \cdot \left[  \textrm{Dronpa}_\textrm{Off}\textrm{-Cre}  \right] \cdot [400nm] \\"

Wet lab:
•Emaleen and Erica performed the fluorescence and OD600 readings on the     cells for the Interlab study and submitted last minute on Friday!
•Courtney and Alex cloned Ecotin-Winsulin 2.0, YncM-Winsulin 2.0 and     Cytoplasmic-Winsulin 2.0 into pSB1C3 and transformed them into E.coli     TOP10, while simultaneously performing the ligation into pET15b.
•Steph and Grace transformed pET15B::Cytoplasmic-Winsulin 2.0 and     pET15b::Ecotin-Winsulin 2.0 into TOP10 E. coli.
•We ordered precast SDS-PAGE gels as our own gel casting skills left a lot     to be desired.
Week 24:  2/10/2017-8/10/2017
Wet lab:
•Erica and Alex performed colony PCRs on the pSB1C3 and pET15b plasmids     transformed into TOP10 E.coli last week.
•Many many gels were run and eventually we saw at least one positive result     for each colony PCR. Below is just two of these gels loaded with the PCRs     performed on the pET15b with Ecotin proinsulin inserted
Week 25:  9/10/2017-15/10/2017
Wet lab:
•Jamie sent some pSB1C3 submission vectors, some pET15b E. coli expression     vectors, and the pUS258 B. subtilis expression vectors off to sequencing to     verify correct gBlock insertion. Got verification of correct insertion so     that we can progress with submission into the parts registry and also     verification that we have the correct inserts in our expression vectors.
•Alex performed autoinduction on our BL21 cells transformed with our pET15b     expression vectors with with our Cytoplasmic and Ecotin gBlock inserts.
•He then did periplasmic chloroform extraction for the cells transformed     with the Ecotin constructs and cytoplasmic extraction for those with the     cytoplasmic constructs and ran them on an SDS-PAGE gel. We did not get     conclusive results from this method, partly due to a disputable negative     control. Will go back to IPTG induction.

1.Preparation of Competent Cells
1.Grow  yeast cells  at 30 °C in 10 ml YPD broth until mid-log phase
(~5 x 106 - 2 x 107 cells/ml  or OD 600 of  0.8-1.0).
The following steps are accomplished at room temperature.
2.    Pellet the cells at 500 x g for 4 minutes and discard the supernatant.
3.   Add 10 ml EZ 1 solution to wash the pellet. Repellet the cells and discard the supernatant.
4.    Add 1 ml EZ 2 solution to resuspend the pellet. At this point, the competent cells can be used for transformations directly or stored frozen at or below -70°C for future use.  It is important to freeze the cells slowly.  To accomplish this, either wrap the aliquotted cells in 2-6 layers of paper towels or place in a Styrofoam box before placing in the freezer.DO NOT use liquid nitrogen to snap-freeze the cells.

* Levels means all possible values the parameter can have, which is either generated automatically or manually.
Abstract
The filter for the abstract only checks, whether an abstract was submitted or not. See the pseudocode:
if user wants to see all teams return full data set else {  iterate through all row names in the data-frame {   if the abstract of the team ""row name"" in the data-list matches the string ""-- No abstract provided yet --"" save the name to a vector  }  delete all teams without abstract  return the reduced data set }
Since the information content is also related to the abstract, they are put together in one tab of the filter notebook. As it turned out that the information content always is in a very small range around 50%, the possible selections were chosen accordingly. The filter function is similar to those of any other numeric parameter, where the only difference is that all choices are numeric and thus the different cases of minimum and maximum selection can be skipped.
Medal
The medal filter is just the same as the filters for track or region, since it is also saved in the data-frame.
Team Name
For filtering the team name a text entry box was introduced, together with a javascript, that checks on the entered search term. A list of all team names was created and converted to a javascript array using R and its package RJSONIO. The javascript code then compares the entered term(s) with this array and changes the text color to either red (no exact match) or black (exact match). To allow for multiple name entries comma-serapated terms can be entered and are automatically separated by the javascript for color changing and by the filter function.
The pseudocode of the filter funciton looks like this:
split the input string at every comma iterate through all strings {  find all teams having the string in their name and keep their ids } reduce and return dataset

6. Spin down 10 minutes 14K rpm
7. Run a gel with 25 µl of the supernatant. (Note: it is difficult to apply the mixture because of its viscosity. Loading the mixtures into empty wells rather than the wells filled with buffer and pouring buffer thereafter may give better result.)
8. Under UV-illuminator, plasmid DNA should be visible between E. coli genomic DNA (20-30 kb) and low molecular weight RNAs.
Test for auto activity of bait constructs
Background: The constructed strains carring the bait plasmid should not grow on plates without histidine, the promoter for histidine should be active only after mating and positive interaction. Sometimes the gene is transcribed and false positives colonies occur.
1. Plating the yeast strains transformed with the bait construct onto SC double drop-out plates lacking Tryptophane and Histidine and supplemented with 3-AT (6 mM) to suppress the background leakage of the Gal4-dependent promoters. Streak out the same strain on plates without Trp,  to save the colonies.
2. No growth should occur on the plates without Histidine. Then the colonies on plates containing Histidine can be used for further experiments
3. In case of growth on these control plates the promoter activity is too high and colonies cannot be used for the Yeast-Two-Hybrid experiment.
Yeast two hybrid assay with robot
1. Inoculate desired strains (bait and prey) in selection medium over night.
2. Pipette 200 µl of each strain into a 96-well plate for robot screen or measure OD600 and spot same cell amount onto SC plates. Let this grow over night.
3. Use mating program of the robot, where it picksand transfers a colony to a mating plate or stamp colonies from SC plates to YPAD plate.
4. Mated colonies should be transferred to SC plates without aselection marker to select only for interactions, supplementation with 6mM 3-AT avoids auto-induction. Grown colonies indicate an interaction.
5. Transfer same cell amount with the robot and spot cells after OD600 measurement onto plates without marker, 3-AT and X-α-Gal. Growth over night and check for blue colonies.

(h)
Through this equation (h) we can at various levels of substrate determined by (g) optimize the promoter activities for the ethanol construct and the PDC inhibiting construct so that maximum product yield is reached.
Utilization
Employing this model we could with two inducible promoters make experiments and then determine the optimal levels for those promoters. The model is however built upon a number of assumptions and while they are altogether sane the model is still greatly simplified.
This raises the question whether this is the right way to go if our only goal is to increase yield. If we in any case has to do experiments with different levels of expression from the promoters we could as well do a Simplex optimization of the system and automatically  adapt for feedback loops, product toxicity and other complicating factors.
The model could be of use if we want to investigate assumptions that we have made of the systems and through that improve our understanding of the different pathways. This making it possible to better guess what the next step should be to increase the production of ethanol.
