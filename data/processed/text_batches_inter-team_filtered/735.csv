NCKU_Tainan,2018,Team:NCKU Tainan#Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html," that of engineered E. coli without CA.                                                  Although our working space was open system that we cannot sense precise data of the change of CO2 concentration.                                                  Through pyruvate produced rate, we can easily recognize which phase of CO2 uptake and then figure out the percentage of total CO2 uptake.                                                  It is the method we calculate how much CO2 uptake by our engineered E. coli.

Actually, xylose consumed rate is slightly related to has little relationship with the CO2 uptake rate,                                              since that xylose metabolism wasn’t just a single pathway.                                              What we can analysis is that the pyruvate produced rate being correlation with CO2 uptake rate,                                              which help us to define the question that how much CO2 uptake by engineered E. coli.                                              It can also fit with experimental data easily. Next, we discuss about the true CO2 reaction in E. coli CO2 utilization bypass pathway. Every single mole of CO2 uptake will react                                              with one mole of RuBP and then produce 2 mole of 3PGA.
Fig 3. result of RuBP and 3PGA during CO2 uptake
Since that RuBP and 3PGA are just intermediate products in metabolism,                                              their concentration is quite low. Besides, results of three CO2 uptake time interval showed similar.                                              We still can see that 3PGA produced is 2 times larger than RuBP produced.                                              We then calculate their produced rate in three CO2 uptake time interval.

Carbon metabolism flux
The main metabolic pathway of xylose in E. coli is PP pathway and glycolysis. As for recombinant E. coli,                                          it has multiple xylose metabolic pathways, and we can simplify them into original pathway and CO2 Bypass pathway.                                           Therefore, we need to define the percentage of xylose, which is consumed by engineered E. coli, entering CO2 bypass pathway and utilize CO2.
It takes a lot of time to get absolute metabolic flux of CO2 in engineered E. coli and require feed of 13CO2 during cultivation.                                          Since the metabolic flux of the original metabolic pathway is quite stable"

When the complex [TetR: Dox] is degraded with                             the same rate as tetR, we assume that Dox can be free inside the                             cell again.
tetR dimerization, binding to Doxycycline and binding rate to                                 tetO2 operator sites: A tetR dimer is sufficient for                             specific binding to the operator sequence. However, a tetR monomer                             is unable to bind and exert any repressive effect. Thus, we assume                             that the repressor dimer binds to the operator (denoted as species                             O) with a one-to-one stoichiometry and also assume that a dimer                             binds one to one with Doxycycline. These assumptions are valid, as                             monomers forming a dimer and dimer forming a complex with                             Doxycycline are very fast interactions and do not affect other                             simulation components. As a consequence, we halved the translation                             rate of tetR and the concentration of Doxycycline that was injected                             into the solution.
We expressed the Hill equation as mass action kinetics for the two                             different states as we did in TALE system.
The subsystem is described by the following kinetic reactions and                     differential equations, which we used to implement the simulation in                     Simbiology, and also in python.

Figure 3.
According to Parts Registry, the LVA-tagged LacI part has been used 684 times despite of its poor function. The natural LacI parts that have been submitted to the Registry by previous teams are pending (and thus did not pass HQ quality control). We have therefore submitted the coding sequence of natural LacI to the Registry for future teams to use as an improvement to the LacI:LVA biobrick. Furthermore, our experience has been added to the experience of the part encoding the LacI:LVA basic part ( BBa_C0012 ) on Parts Registry.
Characterization of AraC/Para
Figure 4. The HRT2 gene is under the control of the arabinose promoter (see Design ). We assayed the inducible capabilities of our design and, as part of the experiment, we tested the ability to suppress expression prior to induction. The assay was carried out by measuring the mRNA levels of HRT2 using the Northern blotting technique.
To test whether overexpression of AraC improved expression control, devices with and without the araC device were assayed. Duplicates of MG1655 strains carrying either pSB1C3-Para-HRT2 or pSB1C3-Pcon-araC-term-Para-HRT2 were grown to late-exponential phase: OD600=0.8. At this OD, the strains were induced with 0.2 % arabinose at time t=0 min, and samples were taken at times: -2 min, 15 min, and 30 min. Total RNA purified from the samples were run on a gel, blotted onto a membrane, and hybridized with probes specific for HRT2 mRNA and 5S rRNA (loading control), respectively.
The results prove that we are capable of inducing our HRT2 devices with arabinose. There is only little expression before induction and within the first 15 min, expression is at its maximum. Overexpression of AraC does not seem to have an effect on the expression levels after 15 min compared to natural levels of AraC. However, it is inconclusive whether AraC might contribute to an effect at times less than 15 min after induction. (Fig. 4).
This experience has been added to the experience of the part encoding the arabinose promoter on Parts Registry.

Results (S9): GFP/anti-GFP binding was observed, however none of the antigen/antibody pairs showed any binding. Since anti-GFP bound successfully to GFP, mistakes in slide preparation can be excluded, hinting that the antigen/antibody couples are either not able to bind due to wrong epitopes, or that too many proteins are co-purified with the antigens, leading to a very low antigen concentration on the stamps. Westerblots would be an advisable next step to assure that the antibodies are capable of binding to the epitopes of the corresponding antigens.
The anti-salmonella (pIG15_1303) showed strong unspecific binding on the whole slide, confirming previous observations. This might still be due to denaturation problems with the salmonella elutions.

Biosafety education video in Chinese
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.
Teams participated the production:

Reagent share to USTC
iGEM team USTC is working on the CdS based bio-film. They want to know whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as expected. A key component for one of their experiments requires CdS quantum dots, which they cannot generate by themselves.
We provided them the CdS quantum dots sample. They added our sample into the culture to assist bio-film formation onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically, CdS quantum dots would be attached to the surface of the bacteria as the bio-film was formed.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," new batches of dFBA simulations clearly indicate that, during the day there is no difference between the models. But this is only so because during day neither MS nor ICL are carrying a flux (not active). During the night, again we see that the Δ fumC Δ zwf is beneficial compared to the Δ fumC alone. But more interesting, we see that the glyoxylate shunt on top of the Δ fumC Δ zwf further boost fumarate production.
Figure 5.4. Dynamic simulation of fumarate production for multiple strains.
When taken together, all the modeling observations here reported indicate that the conditional expression of the glyoxylate shunt over a double mutant of fumC and zwf would be beneficial. It would lead to an increase in fumarate production during the night beyond what we had achieved so far when focusing on the native metabolic network alone. And more importantly, this increase would be aligned with fitness, hence, stable. Although very promising, this in silico result comes with string attached… the timing has to be perfect. And this is timing of activity, not expression per se. So how can we time this perfectly? We dived into the exploration of the native regulatory network of an organism that has evolved to exploit circadian cycles - our very own Synechocystis ! If there is a perfect promoter out there to control the shunt genes, chance are that Synechocystis will have it. And so the search using libraries began… but about this you can read more here .
Modeling industrial conditions
At the industrial scale, Synechocystis and other cyanobacteria are often grown in large outdoor ponds or in greenhouses [15], where natural solar radiation is the primary source of light. This means that the cultures are subject to an oscillating light-dark cycle with a period of 24 hours. Additionally, these cultures must also deal with natural fluctuations in light intensity which can be due to a variety of factors including self-shadowing of the cells and mixing.
Culturing photoautotrophic cells in a controlled fashion in a laboratory is typically done in lab-scale photobioreactors. At the Molecular Microbial Physiology group at the University of Amsterdam we had access to Multi-Cultivators (PSI, Czech Republic) to carry out the physiological characterization of the strains we developed in this project. There they have developed an in-house software package to control the many pieces of hardware that surround these photobioreactors (e.g. LED panel, online OD measurement, temperature, etc.). Py"

Conclusion:
     Considering our experiment condition, the second idea is the most practical. To control cells density, we can use ccdA to restraint ccdB and then release the DNA gyrase astricted by ccdB. Compared with site-directed mutagenesis and sequentialermr prone PCR, controlling cells density in that way would be more labour-saving.

b) About signal molecule.
2. –Yizhen Yan
a) Binary transfer → encoder → nand gate → digital tubes.
b) Density display device: A/D converter → encoder→ digital tubes.  Special difficulties: Constructing an operational amplifier.
3. –Yuan He
a) How to decompose fluorescent proteins in order to recycle the displayer device? One of the ideas is to use pigment to stimulate fluorescence, and then add some enzymes to decompose it.
b) Cells immobilization → embedding cells.
Conclusion:
     Some intricate circuit may be too long to express. In this case, connecting expressive gene with promoter in series or in parallel can help.
     To construct recycling fluorescent device, fluorescent proteins should decompose themselves. How can we attain that?
     After studying a lot of literatures, members knew more about biocomputer and how to transfer signals in biologic units. Yan drew a logic circuit simply which turns input signals (1 or 0) into corresponding numbers (1-9). In this way, our goal of constructing a display device will be easier to reach. To fix the fluorescent cells, they primarily decided to embed cells in special tubes.
     But how to switch the number showing on the screen, namely how to decompose fluorescent proteins is the primary problem. Group 2 and Group 7 have started to find a solution to this problem.

Nootkatone
In order to have a proof of concept for our compartmentation strategy we intend to establish the nootkatone pathway inside the peroxisome. Therefore we aim to target the three enzymes for the nootkatone production to compartment. Before starting the actual lab work for the ambitious plan to establish a completely new pathway in the peroxisome, there are several aspects that have to be considered first.
The initial step is to find a reliable source to prove the abundance of our precursor Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) in yeast peroxisomes. So far there is no proof of existence of FPP inside yeast peroxisomes yet. However it is predicted to be present, as it was detected in mammalian and plant peroxisomes Olivier et al. (2000) .
Figure 7.1: The structure of FPP the precursor for nootkatone.
The precursor FPP is converted into valencene by a valencene synthase (ValS). We chose the one from Callitropsis nootkatensis because of its comparably high efficiency in microorganisms. It achieves greater yields in yeast than the citrus valencene synthase. Furthermore, the product specificity is relatively high, while production of byproducts is low Beekwilder et al. (2014) .  The valencene synthase was also chosen because of its robustness towards pH and temperature changes Beekwilder et al. (2014) .   Our modelling approach revealed that for optimal yields an overexpression of valencene synthase is necessary because of its slow conversion rate (Model) . This is why we chose the strongest promoter of the yeast toolbox (Dueber Toolbox) for this attempt.

3 Project Highlights
1. Project Idea
1.1 Why we name after ‘ECHO’?
In Greek myths, there is a story of the love between nymph Echo and Narcissus. The voice of Echo remains hovering in the valley in the end of the story, from then on, ‘echo’ starts to have a meaning as reverberation or response of sound. In the field of automation, we use ‘feedback’ to refer the process of response in a system, that is, the process in which part of the output is returned to its input in order to regulate its further output, just as an echo.
Analogously, ‘echo’ plays a significant role in our design. CELL-A generates AHLs, sending a message to CELL-B, and after B expresses the particular gene, B will ‘echo’ the message to A as a response. Therefore, the pre-state of A has a regulating influence on the next-state of A, restricting A to fluctuate in a certain behavior within a certain range. The ECHO feedback part contributes to the communication and well-function of the system.
1.2 How can bacteria act as group?
As the passages state above, CELL-A & B communicate by AHLs both within their own populations and with the other. To understand this principle, we need to take a further look at the quorum sensing (QS).
QS is the ability of populations of bacteria to communicate and coordinate their behavior via inter-cellular and inter-species signaling molecules. AHL is one example of these molecules. AHLs produced by a certain group of E.coli (as Group I) accumulate, and once the concentration passes the threshold, the receptors in another group (as Group II) are activated, and the specific gene is regulated to express. Thus, bacteria will act as two groups, in which I induces II under the quorum sensing.
1.3 How does the system work?
In ecology, the predator-prey system often serves as a wonderful example to describe population dynamics. In the"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"

Providing strains
The iGEM Team York built a digital in-line holographic microscope (DIHM) this year. To validate its function, they used a number of different microorganisms that iGEM teams      worked with this year. We provided the iGEM Team York with several mutants of our S.cerevisiae strain (Fig.).
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Knoxville
Mentoring and Troubleshooting
For a successful project, a critical and objective review of the progress and problems is necessary. To ensure this objective view, we have conducted repeated discussions with the iGEM Team Knoxville.     In addition, we held a mentoring session focused on the problems of iGEM Team Knoxville regarding the  recruitment of a new team. We discussed ways to improve the this process in the future      to form a larger team for the coming years.
In troubleshooting sessions, a detailed description of the problems of the respective projects was discussed. With the results obtained from these sessions, we improved our project several      times and adapted our work so that our project is easier to understand and our laboratory work becomes faster. Especially our Project Presentation was really complicated and misleading in the      beginning and has been improved a lot with the help of the iGEM Team Knoxville.
iGEM Aachen - iGEM Delft
European Meet-Up
The Delft european meeting was our first international meet-up. This brought along a lot of positive effects on our whole team as a whole and on our working goals towards the Giant Jamboree.
At first, we arrived at a camping place after a long trek in the beautiful suburbs of Delft surrounded just by nature. In this camping place we got the opportunity to meet a few other members      of the attending teams. Starting from there the whole experience was full of interchange with our iGEM peers. That night we went out and got to get a glimpse of the city and exchanged our      ideas accompanied by the warmth of a good pub.
On the second day, we attended the scheduled symposium where we got to listen to three uppermost interesting presentations by Prof. Dekker, Dr. Stemering and last but not least Prof. Murphy.
Prof. Dekker as a pioneer in biophysics gave us a glimpse into his research on synthetic biology. We were really excited to"

Preparation of Electrocompetent Cells
Purpose: One of the techniques used to incorporate new genetic material into a cell is called electroporation. In this process, electrical pulses create holes in the cell membrane so that genetic material, such as plasmids, is able to permeate the plasma membrane. It is most commonly used in bacterial cells because electroporation is highly efficient at incorporating the new DNA into the bacterial cells that will then be used for cloning. There are special cuvettes that are used for this process that enable the cells to be evenly distributed without air bubbles and for media to be directly added immediately after electroporation occurs so that the cells can recover. Electrocompetent cells are different than normal bacterial cells because they have a weaker cell wall so that electroporation will have a high efficiency.
Procedure:
Part 1: Overnight cell growth
1.  5 mL of LB media were added to a test tube.
2. 5 µL of Streptomycin were added to the same test tube.
3. E. coli cells of the desired strand were used to inoculate the media.
4. The cells were allowed to grow overnight in a shaker at 37C and 300 rpm.
Part 2: Growing Electrocompetent cells
1. 100 mL LB media was added to 2 Erlenmeyer flasks ("

It was the thoroughness in which they completed the project; these teams included everything from hard-core mathematical modeling to an analysis of the impact of their project on the world. It was their clarity in presenting their complex projects. It was their competence when answering tough questions that judges threw at them.
This is my 5th year of participating in iGEM- 2 as a member, 1 as an advisor, and 2 as a judge- and I am proud to see this organization continue to excel at developing both the talent and the foundational repository of data necessary for the synthetic biology revolution.

At first, the overnight culture’s OD600 and red fluorescence intensity are measured. And then we measure the OD600 and red fluorescence intensity every 1-2 hours.
And then we draw the diagram about RFP intensity/OD600 and time under different concentrations of arabinose (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 the diagram of the about RFP intensity/OD600 and time under different concentrations of arabinose
From this diagram, we can clearly know more arabinose added, less RFP expressed. When the arabinose concentration is 0.003％, the RFP intensity have been very low. So we think when the arabinose concentration is above 0.003％, the in-promoter will be fully repressed that means the killer will not express to kill the bacteria.
Then we collect the data after passing 17.5 hours from Fig. 3 to draw the diagram about the relationship between RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose concentration (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4 the diagram of the about RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose concentration
From this curve, we can directly to see the relationship between RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose’s concentration: The arabinose’s concentration have a negative correlation with RFP intensity/OD600. We regard that the in-promoter have been repressed fully when the concentration of arabinose between 0.003％ and 0.004％. So we think when the concentration of arabinose is 0.003％, the in-promoter’s activity is very low, and the killer gene wouldn’t kill the bacteria. So we regard that 0.003％ is threshold of arabinose concentration which also is fit in with our modeling part.
After we use the PBAD promoter to construct the environment with different concentrations of inhibitor, we have successfully proved that the in-promoter will respond to the different concentrations of inhibitor differently and found the threshold of inhibitor’s concentration that the PBAD promoter expressed under the 0.003％ arabinose concentration.
2. Found out the concentrations of inhibitor under different concentrations of arabinose and used the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit.

Our team
Our first meeting was during January 2018. We started as a small group of students and our advisors. We met weekly and recruited new team members and brainstormed about our project. In April 2018 our team was complete and the idea to create an anti-microbial surface was developed. Until October 2018 we tried to realize our project in the lab. In the process, we were supported by different people, companies and institutions.
General support and fundraising
We thank all the listed foundations and companies for the great support and collaboration. Without their support our project would have been impossible to realize. With donations of lab equipment and financial aid, they helped us to establish our own iGEM Lab at University of Stuttgart. Now there is a place to work for us and all future iGEM teams. Special thanks to Prof. Dr. Georg Sprenger and Dr. Josef Altenbuchner from University of Stuttgart for providing us with the laboratories premises.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#FerritinJournal_-_-_TEXT.html," native ferrihydrite core is converted to magnetite--a paramagnetic material which can be attracted to magnetic fields (Jordan et al. 2010, Wong et al. 1998). We were able to attain some general knowledge of magnetism in nano-scale material, including a basic understanding of blocking temperatures, superparamagnetism and magnetic moments, all magnetism-related measurements. But we are ill-equipped to model this system theoretically in terms of calculated forces. We also explore the possibility of alternative magnetic particles, in the case ferritin is too small to exhibit magnetic forces significant enough to move proteins.
Magnetosomes were found to be much larger, but unviable due to the complexity of their creation. The CCMV virus may also be an option, although there is currently little known about it and therefore further research into this topic is required. (Lohsse et al. 2011).
Because we also intend to scaffold proteins to ferritin as in our TALE DNA-binding proteins, we looked into fusions to both C- and N-terminals of ferritin. The N- and C- termini of ferritin subunits are present on the outside and inside of the nanoparticle respectively, and therefore N-terminal fusions are an obvious choice to ensure TALEs are present on the exterior of the nanoparticles (Dorner et al. 1985).
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
While we are unsure of exactly how ferritin will be used in our project, any capacity in which we use it requires isolating recombinant ferritin from E. coli. We investigated which terminus to locate purification tags (eg, His tags) on ferritin subunits. Ingrassia et al. (2006) found that small amino acid additions to the C-terminus of either heavy or light chain ferritin are not deleterious to its function. Thus, we are contemplating fusing proteins to the N-terminal of ferritin as discussed last week, and using the C-terminus for tags to isolate recombinant subunits.
We also contemplated methods for controlling expression in terms of proportions of H and L subunits in completed ferritin. This could influence iron dynamics of completed ferritin. Lee et al. (2002) overcame this issue by fusing the heavy and light chains together to ensure that completed nanoparticles have a 1:1 ratio of each subunit. We are trying to determine pitfalls of this expression strategy. Finally, we investigated methods for validating nanoparticle formation. Namely, we considered fluorescence spectroscopy as tested by Parker"
William_and_Mary,2018,Team:William and Mary#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," allows for the ability to dynamically change the concentration of a small molecule inducers .
Lastly, we realized that many teams were unable to perform flow cytometry measurements due to lack of equipment or due to the prohibitive hourly costs associated with the use of their institutions' flow cytometer. This issue is further exacerbated during time course measurements, as experiments often last multiple hours, which results in large financial and time costs. To ameliorate this situation, we designed, tested, and validated a flow cytometry protocol that preserves cells for later measurement without changing their fluorescence data (Figure 1). This procedure can be performed with nothing more than a -80C freezer and glycerol, enabling teams with limited resources to partner with more resourced teams to obtain single cell characterization of their projects, as well as enabling teams performing time course measurements to have a lower cost way to obtain their crucial single cell measurements.
Figure 1: Single cell fluorescence measurements of BBa_K2333428 time course live (NonFrozen) and 3 days later (Frozen). Each dot represents the geometric mean of at least 10,000 single cell measurements each of 3 biological replicates, the shaded region represents one geometric standard deviation above and below the geometric mean.
Data Visualization and Availability
One crucial aspect of engineering disciplines is that data is displayed openly and in an unbiased fashion. To that end, we displayed data in the appropriate fashion, using univariate scatter plots instead of bar graphs, and clearly displayed our data in a manner that allows the reader to see the level of variation present in our graphs [2]. As gene expression is log normally distributed [3], we made sure to use the geometric, rather than regular, means and standard deviations on our graphs, and made sure to use the appropriate y axis scale. Lastly, we attempt to provide a model for data availability by providing both the full data (in .csv or .fcs) format as well as detailed experimental methods for every graph on our wiki on a single page .

talking with other iGEM team about their project and giving advice
We talked with some members from other iGEM teams. We were interested with their ideas and surprised at their work during summer. China-Tongji iGEM team tried to make nematode light-sensitive, which is an amazing project we thought. However, we suggested that although scientists had created light-sensitive mouse, it was a challenge to let nematode express light-sensitive proteins. Also, we mentioned ethic issues and safety for China-Tongji. ZJU-China team made a funny biological playing card. This bio-card could help student learn many knowledge of synbio. We advised them make the biocard easy-understanding and design more detail information so that public could accept it rather than only biology student. NUY-Shanghai did a fantastic project, they were not limited in synbio but used knowledge and technologies of multiple subjects including engineering, computer science and VR. We learned a lot from what them did and managed to improve our project display. We planned to use LEGO to show our genetic circuit and ribosome meter, thus this presentation would be easy to understand and participate for public.  Furthermore, we started to cooperate with them after the workshop. We provided several biobricks for them to support they finish their project.

Public presentation
One of the most important tasks in iGEM competition is human practice. This part is aimed to let more people in different societies know about synbio and iGEM, also give us a change to change the world.  We contributed many efforts to this part and we believed we could make influence on our world. During the workshop, we explained every detail on our project to a museum staff and she presented all projects on the museum website for online visitors. Furthermore, we introduced our project to many visitors. They usually did not have any biological background, thereby we used the simplest way to introduce synthetic biology and show our project. After that, all the visitors understood and felt interested in what we did. Additionally, we gave an academic presentation to an expert from Fudan University. He was very integrated to the ribosome meter and he predicted this technology would have a huge application. During workshop, we surprisingly found that a little child was able to participate in the exhibition of NUY-Shanghai. Giving some educations to next generation may the best thing in this competition, which is our responsibility to influence the world and the further.

The main part is E-coding, which use E. coli to                                         store data. Another part is to sense the pollutant in river of Mexico, which is                                         the part that we could link our work. We had constructed a pH sensing biobrick                                         which express fluorescence under low pH condition, they suggest us to                                         incorporate our pH sensing construct in their pollutant sensing system, making                                         their system become more complete. Therefore, we shared our plasmid map and                                         construction protocol with them, which they can be used to construct the                                         biobrick in the future.
Also, we found out that the new combined sensing system can be applied in our                                         bioreactor as they aim to sense pollutants such as nitrate, phosphate or heavy                                         metals. This will be a useful alert system for our bioreactor since the flue                                         gas may contain pollutants especially heavy metals that are highly toxic to the E. coli.
Through this collaboration, we not only combined two sensing system, expanding                                         its application field, but we also found a more complete sensing system for our                                         device.

UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," we are aiming to reach the grass-root level. This was 4 days emotional journey to reach this village. The only transportation to go to this village is by join the truck, because the pathway was terrible broken and muddy. We have mission to going to this place not only focusing on educating the people about diphtheria outbreak and our project, moreover we want to know about their health needs. From the insights, we understand how our project would affect the society’s life. Through KERSOS we also could build some lavatories and any sanitary facilitation for the villagers. We also patched stickers of the right steps to wash hands in every house to remind the villagers in keeping their hands free from bad-bacteria. Those was aimed to prevent and minimize the risk of diphtheria outbreak to happen in that location since diphtheria can caused by the bad quality of sanitation and health habits.

Teaching the class of chemical engineering UI 2016 about synthetic engineering. The material we present made from collaboration between UI IGEM Team and NTU IGEM team.
In this campaign, our team brings up the diphtheria outbreak case to student who already understanding the basic of genetic engineering and ask their perspective with our project: how it works, how we make it, how it would impact the outbreak and society, and also the comparison to previous diagnostic method. We purposely give a deep explanation about Finding Diphty to the students so that they—as public and a risk population—can understand the solution and criticize our project. In the end of the session, we held a mini survey by giving them a questionnaire according to our project and their opinion and advice about it. On 14th September 2018, we did the same public campaign on Faculty of Engineering, what make its special, because this time, we collaborate with NTU IGEM team, to conduct survey and collaborate teaching.

Tongji_China,2017,Team:Tongji China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," project and toolbox to students from the School of Design and got a lot advice on the user experience and possible new applications.
S.T.E.A.M education is very popular among students and parents, and many S.T.E.A.M education schools have been established. But we find that there are not many Biology classes in China, and they are also scarce around the world, so we designed a Biology class firstly in China to let Synthetic Biology be known by more community members.
We have already contacted some high schools in Shanghai. They will add this course as an elective. Tieling High School will be the first experimental unit. We were happy that schoolmasters have shown great interest in our course, and we will do our best to spread it.
This course focuses on the basic knowledge of Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Microbiology. We also introduce Synthetic Biology to all the students and let them design their own engineered bacteria. We use a variety of methods to make esoteric theories much easier for them to understand:
We use building blocks to explain Synthetic Biology.
We use similar music to show what variation is and how BLAST works.
And Fablab Shanghai will give them a mechanical course to lead them make simple pipettes.
We think firsthand experience plays the most important role in studying so we included biosafety and basic experiments for them.
For more information about the course and toolbox you can contact us by sending e-mail to 3141244178@qq.com, we welcome to your consultation.
Open Night (with LIVE network)
The 1st LIVE
We held the 1st Open Night Live (ONLive) in Creative Square to spread some knowledge of Synthetic biology to our society. ONLive is an event open without invitation to everyone. The public can listen to lectures and express their ideas. ONLive focuses on simplifying knowledge and accurately spreading it to everyone. Beforehand, we advertised in the form of online advertising to propel the movement forward and let more people know about and join us. We gave lectures on Synthetic Biology and transgenic technology to people form the community and introduced our project.
We also invited a lot of designers and scholars to make comments in different ways and show their recent results. We had a live webcast to allow people who could not come to watch ONLive through the internet. We hope ONLive can be a great way for people without professional knowledge to learn more about Biology. In the Q&A section we also got a lot of good advice from the guests, who thought that our project would be useful for pest control, and that's the reason we selected this as our final project.

More exciting news for ‘Desert Island… Science?’ today - Professor Richard Kitney of Imperial College London agreed to partake! Professor Kitney has been a visiting Professor at MIT since 1991, holds an OBE for his work, and is globally recognised as one of the leading researchers in the field of Synthetic Biology.
We also received the board game survey data back from Colyton Grammar School and have done a basic analysis on the results - overall, 77.8% of students reacted positively, saying they had enjoyed the board game (“It was a fun way for learning about synthetic biology.”) and/or had found the board game session educational (“It helped me remember most of the information because it was fun and engaging.”).
The lab team attempted Q5 site-directed mutagenesis today using a two-step PCR and a 1 in 10 dilution for the primers (10μl primer : 90μl water). The products have been transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells and left in the 37oC incubator overnight. They also made a table to document the contents of the freezer box (a mix of DNA and PCR products).

Today was predominantly focused around talking with other iGEM teams and organising collaborations - we had a Skype session with Cardiff and talked about our projects and current progress. We also spoke with Westminster over Twitter about the possibility of collaborating.
Yesterday’s attempt at Q5 site-directed mutagenesis turned out to be unsuccessful, so we will be re-attempting that today. We also measured the concentrations of DNA we had for various promoters, terminators, minipreps, etc, and made a table for future reference so we can track how much we have left.

Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production. Thus"

pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Cm ( BBa_K510001 ). This construct is the result of replacing the gentamycin resistance cassette in pUC18SfiI-miniTn7BB-Gm by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette obtained from pBS1C3 by PCR amplification.
pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Cm ( BBa_K510013 ). This construct is the result of replacing the gentamycin resistance cassette in pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette obtained from pBS1C3 by PCR amplification with these primers
pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Km ( BBa_K510014 ). This construct is the result of replacing the gentamycin resistance cassette in pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm by a kanamycin resistance cassette obtained from pBS4K5.
pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm-RBS+RFP ( BBa_K510015 ). MiniTn7-based reporter for promoter characterization. Promoter insertion at prefix restriction sites results in a transcriptional fusion to RFP. Characterization can be performed in single copy by integrating the miniTn7 element in the genome of the appropriate organism.
pUC18R6KT-miniTn7BB-Gm-pBad/araC ( BBa_K510016 ). MiniTn7-based expression vector. Insertion of genes at suffix restriction sites allows arabinose-inducible transcription.  Characterization can be performed in single copy by integrating the miniTn7 element in the genome of the appropriate organism.

We transformed the ligation product following the Alpha Select cells protocol. The colonies grew! We picked colonies and incubated them overnight. We performed Miniprep and DNA quantification.
We ran a single restriction digest (SpeI) and a double restriction digest (SpeI and EcoRI) of the pSB1k3 sample. We ran gel of the double cut and the uncut to confirm the circularized backbone.
Because the transformations of pSB1C3 yielded low count of blue colonies we decided to dephosphorylate the pSB1K3 backbone before ligation in order to decrease the likelihood of the backbone re-ligating to itself.  We, then performed PCR clean up and Dna quantification.
We, then, ligated the pSB1K3 backbone to the DVL1_ AF_ER, DVL1_ FF_GR, DVL1_ EF_FR and DVL1_ GF_HR inserts we had amplified before. We transformed using the same method as with the Level 0 transformations.
July
Week 5
We ran a restriction digest with BsaI on miniprep samples from DVL0s transformations of last week to check sizes and send them for sequencing. We ran a ran a gel to confirm it.
Unfortunately, the sequences we got back showed multiple plasmids contamination. Two of them worked and had a clean sequencing file but lacZ had the wrong orientation. We had to work on the DVL0s again :(
To resequence the DVL0s, we learned in depth on how to streak plates and re streaked plates of the DVL0 cells in order to get single blue colonies. Then, we picked the colonies and ran minipreps on them the other day and made glycerol stocks.
We kept working in pSB1K3 backbone, in order to perform new ligations of DVL1. We ran a restriction digest of the psb1k3 backbone with SpeI and ran gel of the RD product with the uncut psB1K3
We gel extracted the RD product of pSB1K3, it`s concentration was 5 ng/uL. We, then, dephosphorylated pSB1K3 and ran a PCR clean up with concentration of 5 ng/uL. We finally ligated all the L1s amplified lacZ with psb1K3, doing two transformations for each set, one using dephosphorylated backbone and the other, regular backbone. And they finally grew!!!! :) :)

Figure 8: Organizations likely to be involved in the funding and development of Golden Rice
Potrykus is Chairman at the Humanitarian Board . In addition to the progenitors and the financial support by the private sector, many authorities and members of the Humanitarian Board contribute to the project's benefit. That help also reaches developing countries (see figure 3). The Golden Rice Network is a community work with a strong trust and delivery which involves researchers, breeders, expansionists, and the small farmers. In general all technologies are patented. In total just 12 of the 70 patents were important for developing countries. Those were determined with the help of the company Syngenta (before: AstraZeneca). Through the treaty, the latter has all worldwide commercial rights. In turn national and international research institutes were assured non-commercial use. So only 12 licenses were needed for the humanitarian project. It was contractually agreed that the GM-rice would just be used for humanitarian not commercial purposes. If the farmers i.e. dispose the rice freely, the industry had to abdicate money-dis-empowerment of license-fees. The GM-rice doesn’t need any herbicides and costs just like the non GM-rice. The farmers whose annual income is under $ 10,000 should use the GM rice without licensing costs.
Golden Rice – an impact of human health
“Why did Beyer and Potrykus choose rice as the food crop for the genetic modification?”
Figure 9: Largest producers of cereals in Asia Pacific region in 2006
Potrykus handles the difficult transformation and regeneration of monocots. The monocot rice is one of the basic staple food crops for half the humanity. (see figure 4) It is a major energy source and represents the major carbohydrate and even protein source in SE Asia and Africa. The both inventors developed their project in South and Southeast Asia where 90% (3 billion people) is grown and consumed rice. Concerning to figure 5  in some places more than half a kilo rice eats a person daily thus the energy intake per day comes from this food crop. Due to the brilliant source of calories the micronutrient content is very low. Another advantage is that the rice doesn’t contain provitamin A (more or less deficient of Vitamin A) which is necessary for humans to create vitamin A. So the lack of rice as a food can lead to VAD mostly affecting children and pregnant women. Rice includes high amount of substance which are needed basically (e.g. polished rice includes 20% of irons"

For both plates, the volume of LB medium with bacteria was 100uL per well. (a) GFP intensity was measured by Tecan Microplate Reader with excitation wavelength at 470nm and emission wavelength at 509nm. A black 96-well plate was used to minimize the interference of different well. (b) OD 600 was also measured by Tecan Microplate Reader in a transparent 96-well plate, since the depth of 100uL in the well did not reach 1 centimeter, the OD 600 value here was smaller than that was measured by a spectrophotometer.
As shown in Fig 3, the basal level of PTPCAD is relatively low. At the concentration of 5.0E-8 mol/L, the expression of GFP was observed. With longer induction time and higher concentration of Hg (II), the fluorescent intensity dramatically increased in a narrow concentration range (Fig. 3a). After the normalization by OD 600, the trend did not change obviously (figure not shown). Around 120min later, bacteria growth reached stationary phase (Fig 3-b) while GFP still accumulated rapidly (Fig 3-a). When the concentration of Hg(II) was higher than 1.0E-6 mol/uL, GFP expression level grew slower which might be explained by the saturation of MerR by Hg(II) and the cytotoxity of mercury.
Fig. 4  Dose response curve of MerR/PmerT to mercury in vivo. Note that the GFP expression intensity was induced from 10% to the maximum across a narrow range – 7 fold change in Hg (II) concentration. The basal level is low and the activation fold is dramatic. Also the metal reorganization specificity of MerR was demonstrated by the result that lead (II) could not activate significant GFP expression in vivo.
Besides, it is obvious that the MerR dependent regulation worked as a hypersensitive switch which represented negligible basal level expression of GFP, but induced from 10% to 90% of maximum in response across a range of Hg (II) concentration as narrow as 7-fold change (Fig 4). When the expression was fully induced, it was even below the threshold at which Hg (II) adversely affects the growth rate of bacterial cells. Actually, the hypersensitive switch behavior"

Modular Terpenoid Biofactory
Ever since the potential of genetic engineering became apparent, we have seen a rise in the use of synthetic biology to develop full-fledged systems working for the very interests of mankind. The idea that a basic system could potentially be used in the production of a whole range of molecules suggests that this kind of multi-directed manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize any given product at a given time. This is when the idea of a modular biofactory comes up, and the proper strategies for its design and execution were the focus of the project.
Starting from the assumption that a synthetic biology project is founded on the design of the proper genetic construct being transformed into an organism, it follows that most of the versatility of the project rests on the proper planning strategies applied to the DNA molecule. This would allow for distinct parts of the construct to be exchanged, added, or eliminated, depending on the development and focus that is ultimately given to the entire project.
Considering restriction enzymes as the basic tool for molecular cloning, it is possible to strategically locate the proper restriction sites in a genetic construct for the entire cloning process to be optimized. The proper design can come up with a master molecule from which a great number of sequence combinations can be derived using a limited number of enzymes. If certain restriction site pairs are assigned to each specific module, it would enable the future manipulation of each of these specific parts separately in the most efficient way possible.
The ability to manipulate specific portions of the genetic constructs opens up possibilities in the project execution that allow it to be more dynamic and adaptable. When working with a synthesized construct, one of the barriers for its proper realization is the high costs of producing long nucleotide sequences by oligonucleotide synthesis. This modular design strategy, by allowing to make multiple sequence combinations of the already synthesized construct, enables to study different sequence setups without having to synthesize each specific iteration separately, thus cutting a great amount of costs from the project.
Obviously, this can and has been achieved by working with digestion and"

During the course of this iGEM edition, TU Delft embarked on an ambitious and challenging journey for the realization of its project. However, we believe that the iGEM experience is more than just carrying out complex microbiological lab work and developing complicated yet cutting-edge models: iGEM is also a worldwide community that continues to expand, with more than 300 teams participating from all around the world this year. Consequently, TU Delft organized an European iGEM Meetup in which teams from all over Europe were invited to join us in Delft, the Netherlands. Approximately 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects, and present and share their projects with all the other teams. Besides the fun experience, the presentations and synthetic biology discussions with the other teams inspired us to engage in several collaborations. We hope that the rest of the attending teams were also equally inspired to collaborate with each other!
TU Delft iGEM 2017 is happy to have collaborated with the teams of Munich , Wageningen UR , NTHU Taiwan and Hamburg as well as have contributed to the surveys of UNebraska-Lincoln , NTHU Taiwan and BU-Hardware .
NTHU Taiwan
After stumbling upon the description of our project, NTHU Taiwan initiated conversations with us via Facebook. Their project also consisted in a biosensor device, in this case featuring a series of overexpressed receptors and enzymes capable of both sensing and degrading EDC’s (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals) on-site in sewage waters. A series of Skype meetings followed, in which the usefulness of the inclusion of any of our accomplished BioBricks into their project was discussed. Initially, vesicles and TDPs were deemed potentially interesting for NTHU Taiwan. However, after a closer study of our vesicles' BioBrick by Taiwan, they came back to us with a series of points (such as the variability in the content and size of vesicles) that made us aware of  the weaknesses of our approach for packing Cas13a and TDPs in our vesicles. Such a feedback resulted important for TU Delft iGEM 2017, as it made us aware of more aspects that should be addressed and optimised in our vesicles prior to their integration in our project.
However, the collaboration changed its direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation of their plasmids.

After mini-preping we confirmed the constructs and attempted retransformation of the vectors into BL21DE3. However transformation failed and no cultures grew on the plate over night.  Since we also planned on sending in our pETue1.2 expression vector to the registry, we had to remove AgeI cleavage sites from it by mutagenesis PCR. We transformed NEB5α with the product, which we had labelled pETue1.3. The success was later confirmed by a control digestion with AgeI. We also finished up the synthetic peptide by construction of the Spy-Tag, followed by HPLC purification and ESI mass spectrometer analysis. The fractions containing the product were lyophilised. We also did a blog entry on team Heidelbergs iGEM blog , presenting our project.
Week 9 --- 29.09.14 - 03.10.14
Previously we were in contact with Team Oslo, which whom we planned to collaborate. We were to receive PCR amplified parts, which we then wanted to ligate with pSB1C3 to send to the regisrty. Due to toll issues the parts arrived quite late though, leaving us with little time to complete Team Oslos request. Our efforts to do that are detailed here .  Last week’s plates of the failed transformation of Bl21DE3 with our pETue1.2 constructs strangely did show colonies after storage at room temperature over the weekend. We analysed them, in order to find out if it was just a contamination or actual BL21DE3 with pETue1.2-constructs. To our surprise the colonies did contain the correct constructs, as we analysed them by sequencing. We suspect that the plates did contain too much ampicillin, which delayed colony formation. A  test expression of these still did not yield any Protein though, even though the vector was sequenced and correct. Following up on our failed expression attempts we then tried to re construct our pETue in a last effort to try and make the pETue1.2 vector work.  Yet again NEB5α transformation worked, but retransformation with BL21DE3, showed no colonies on the plates. We also were in contact with Team Heidelberg, who had offered us a two way collaboration. We were to analyse one of their proteins by MALDI, to which they did not have access. In return they would provide us"

Figure 2: Developing a Toxin Sensing Organism
We performed the transposon screen with the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5: a native tailings pond bacteria shown to degrade oil sands toxins. From this screen strains which responded to general oil sands toxins (sulfur-heterocycles, nitrogen heterocycles, and naphthenic acids) were kept for further analysis. We characterized these strains and selected from the original responders, strains that reacted to oil sands toxins but not general hydrocarbon compounds and stress agents (Figure 3).
Figure 3: FREDsense strain detects toxins. Characterization of one of the transposon strains responsiveness to petroleum toxins using an X-Gal blue-white screening assay.  Cells were inoculated in duplicate at different dilutions into LB media as a control, and LB containing different toxin compounds at environmental concentrations. Absorbance was read at 615nm (maximal absorbance of X-gal) every hour.
This response consists of production of a reporter enzyme capable of cleaving a substrate which could then give an electrochemical response. Further testing on one strain using tailings pond samples showed a higher than baseline response, and the organism was capable of survival in the toxic substrate (Figure 4).
Figure 4: FREDsense strain detects toxins in environmental tailing pond sample. Current change over time was monitored in a tailings pond water sample, illustrating lacZ induction by our identified transposon sensory element. Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) was used as a base-line negative control.
Electrochemical Enzymatic Reporting System:
The reporter proteins utilized by FREDsense are part of a class of enzymes known as hydrolases. Characteristic of these enzymes is recognition and cleavage of their target structure from another compound that it is bound to. An example of this is the protein β-galactosidase (encoded by the gene lacZ).  Hydrolases recognizes and cleaves sugars bound to other compounds and has traditionally been used for colorimetric reactions in biological science study. For our purposes we are using sugar bound to electroactive compounds or analytes CPRG, PNPG, and PDPG. Freeing this into CPR, PNP, or PDP respectively, unmasks its charge, permitting electrochemical detection of it in solution by cyclic voltammetry.
Also characteristic of many hydrolases is the specific recognition of their substrates. A cell can produce more than one hydrolase by independent stimuli and those"

Our main job is to build up a 3D model for a better following test for our EDCs detector and enzyme filter. This part is pretty vital since our enzyme filter is only capable for a small stream in, that is, we didn’t make a 1: 1 model owing to the concern of cost and result uncertainty. However, we designed the model based on flow dynamics and the data collected from field investigation. We are pretty sure that this model could demonstrate the real condition and is ready for any series of tests. The purpose to build up 3D model is not only to bring imagination into the living but also to serve as a pilot application. We are going to find out the potential problem that might happen after we put it into a real application so that we can fix it or improve it.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," The hairpin's loop is forced to have a length between 3 and 13 nt, inclusive, by setting loop_pen(n) to a large constant for any n outside that range. The constant 'gap' gives the cost of not pairing a base with some base on the opposite stem and thus introducing a gap on one side of the hairpin stem.

The D score is calculated by Carafa Scoring System.
Carafa Scoring System
Scoring System 2 is based on the model created by d'Aubenton Carafa 2. The score of terminator consists of two parts, the free energy of stemloop and the score of 15 nt poly T tail. The free energy of stemloop is calculated using Loop Dependent Energy Rules 3. The minimization of the free energy also determined the secondary structure of the stemloop. T tail score is calculated by the formula given by d' Aubenton Carafa.
Detailed Calculation of Score
1. Some definitions3
i. Closing Base Pair
For an RNA sequences, we number it from 5' to 3' . If i < j and nucleotides ri and rj form a base pair,we denote it by i.j. We call base ri' or base pair i'.j' is accessible from i.j if i <i' ( <j' ) <j and if there is no other base pair k.l so that i <k <i' ( <j' ) <l <j. We denote the collection of base and base pair accessible from i.j by L(i,j). Then i.j is the closing base pair. Here “L” means loop.
ii. n-loop
If the loop contain n – 1 base pairs, we denote it by n-loop. (Because there is a closing base pair, so we denote it by n-loop even though the closing base pair is not included in the loop.)
Here we can divide loops which may be formed in the terminator secondary structure into two kinds.
1-loop : Hairpin loop(size of loop shouldn't be smaller than 3)
2-loop : Interior Loop(right strand size and left strand size are both bigger than 0.)

Seeing all those great projects we decided not only to improve biodegredation by looking at the actual degredation processes but more importantly by establishing a wholly new chassis to the iGEM competition and to phytoremediation in general.
Why Physco, why?
So why exactly did we choose Physcomitrella patens as the basis for our remediation project? One big point was that we wanted to make our filter system available for everyone and bacteria just didn´t do the trick for us: Harder to control and harder to grow and implement in nature. We wanted something that could be deployed in a few simple steps and would be self-sustainable and self-renewing. Short, we wanted an autotrophic organism which could be easily established in an aquatic environment. Not only does our moss provide us with these features as it only needs water, light and carbon dioxide to grow and can be grown on soil as well as in water but it can also be easily cultivated in bioreactors which gives us the possibility to envision industrial scale waste-water treatment based on our system. For more information on Physcomitrella patens you can read through the Physcomitrella patens wiki page .
Constructed Wetlands as a large-scale application of Phytoremediation
In the last decades Phytoremediation made the transition from a solely scientific approach to an industrial scale water treatment technique. Today large amounts of water are treated through constructed wetlands as it poses one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to treat sewage-waters either on their own or in symbiosis with a traditional treatment plant.
How do they work and why do we need them?
Figure 2: Constructed wetland diagram. [ EPA open water system ]
Natural wetlands, as well as constructed ones, are systems in which plants and microorganisms form complex biotopes capable of filtering, degrading or inactivating various substances in the water. The wetland, slowing the speed of the passing water, can trap suspended solids in the vegetation which also"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," lead it towards a more sustainable future. So, we set out to teach children of all ages about GMO in general, as well as about our own PowerLeaf, to show them that this concept, which is considered to be unnatural, could actually be used to help nature.
Close
Danish Science Festival
At the Danish Science Festival we hosted a workshop for kindergarteners, during which we taught them about synthetic biology, sustainability, the history of GMO, and bioethics. The children would in turn teach us as well, as they showed us the endless possibilities for bacteria designs,  through the “Draw-a-Bacteria”-contest. This inspired us to reevaluate our initial idea.
School Project Interview with 6th Graders
Following the Danish Science Festival, we were contacted by two enthusiastic 6th graders, Bastian and Magnus. The two boys wanted to learn more about iGEM and GMO, which they intended to write about in a school project. They were curious to what range GMO could be used, and how we utilised it in our project, the PowerLeaf.
UNF Summer Camp
The UNF Summer Camp is an opportunity for high school students to show extra dedication towards science. We talked to some of the brightest young minds imaginable, all of whom aim to work in different fields of science in the future. At the summer camp, we held a presentation about our project, the iGEM competition, as well as how to handle and work with genes. We taught them how to assemble BioBricks and provided them with BioBricks for DNA assembly experiments, creating a ‘hands-on’ experience for these enthusiastic teenagers.
One of the high school students suggested that the Powerleaf should be able to rotate according to the sun, to ensure maximum exposure and outcome. We took this brilliant advice into consideration and contacted Robot Systems Engineer student, Oliver Klinggaard, who helped us with the potential implementation of a pan/tilt system. He provided us with his recent project report on the subject, as well as a description of the adjustments required for the implementation in our system, which you can find here .
Two students from the UNF Summer Camp thought the PowerLeaf was an interesting approach to sustainable energy, and they wanted to hear even more! So, they contacted us in late October, as they were interested to work on a project about green technology.

Stability assay
Incubate the culture of the strain E. coli DH5α carrying different construct in M9 minimal medium, at 37 °C and 180 rpm. Subculture the bacterium every 12hr and collect sample every 24hr, make serial dilution of the cell suspension, including a 10-7, 10-8 and 10-9 dilution. Plate these dilutions on the LB agar plates without antibiotic. Incubate the plates overnight in 37℃ and stamp transfer colonies to agar plates with selection pressure. The ratio of colonies on the plates represents the plasmid retention rate. By this way, we can know the plasmid loss rate of different construct versus time.
We cooperate with NYMU-Taipei to finish the experiment. The result can be found on their webpage.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"We also assisted with high school lab trainings and the Biobuilder Panel. During the high school lab training, members from our team hosted and taught a group of high school students basic laboratory skills and synthetic biology protocols. We demonstrated pipetting, plating cells, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. The Biobuilder Panel was an event hosted in LabCentral for local high school STEM educators in order to better incorporate synthetic biology into the current science curriculum. We participated in a discussion of undergraduates performing research in the field of synthetic biology. Our team shared our iGEM research project to illustrate a current project aimed to assist synthetic biologist.
Northeastern iGEM (NEGEM)
In order to engage with the iGEM community, our team collaborated with the BostonU team to organize and host the Northeastern iGEM Meetup (NEGEM) on July 6, 2018. The BostonU, BostonU Hardware, Harvard, MIT, and UConn teams gathered at NEGEM to present their current projects and progress, as well as share and receive advice among teams. We provided feedback forms for all teams per presentation in order make it easier for comments and questions to be recorded and used to improve the presentations and projects.
Our team gave a twenty minute presentation introducing the applications of microfluidics in synthetic biology and our project, TERRA, to our fellow iGEM teams, most of whom had not been exposed to the field of microfluidics prior. We explained the general workflow of manufacturing and testing microfluidic devices, as well as discussed the impact of our project to the microfluidic industry and greater scientific community. We then received feedback on our presentation and answered questions regarding the function and applicability of TERRA. The general consensus was that our presentation on microfluidics as a field was clear, but there were questions of how sterile microfluidic chips were and the cost of our system. We incorporated this feedback to our project by creating a sterilization protocol and a cost analysis of our system.
Overall, NEGEM provided an opportunity for iGEM teams to discuss collaborations and obtain valuable feedback and advice from fellow teams and team mentors to further projects.
On July 20, 2018, our team had the opportunity to speak to research scientists at Fraunhofer Center of Manufacturing Innovation. One of Fraunhofer CMI's interests is integrating microfluidics with biomedical engineering to produce diagnostic devices. During our visit, we presented our work on TERRA and discussed the role it would play in the field of microfluidics. The scientists at Fraunho"

Places where we have reached with the SynBio Educational Series and Beyond the Bench[mark]
An Overview
     The Carnegie Mellon University 2014 iGEM team spent hundreds of hours teaching students, teachers, and community members about synthetic biology and endocrine disruptors and researching policies, ethics and impacts involved in the latter. We collaborated with other teams to heighten awareness of synthetic biology and promote a scientific interface between the lab and society, while working on a project that will help detect for micropollutants, such as estrogen/estradiol, in water sources cost-efficiently. Our project directly affected how we saw Policies & Practices as a way to start an initiative dedicated to going past the benchmark that limits science classrooms and literacy across America.
Greatest Achievements

DESCRIPTION
Overview
To achieve our goal of detecting the antioxidants capacity of different products in living                         cells, it our system can be divided into three parts, regulator, feedback and output.
Regulator
Firstly, we choose to increase the intracellular ROS content, considering that:
● The level of ROS in normal cells is low and hard to detection.
● Make the cell under oxidative stress to simulate the normal cellular oxidative process                             or, rather, the aging process.
● The most intuitive effect of antioxidants is their reduction of intracellular ROS                             content. We can evaluate antioxidants indirectly through the remaining amount of ROS.
● After reviewing most cell-based antioxidant detection methods recorded in literature, we                             discover that almost all protocols will induce cell in an oxidant stress firstly.
Therefore, we established this part to do such kind of thing. Meanwhile, we hope the way to                         stimulate the accumulation of ROS is easy and equipment-independent, which makes our system                         more available for customers.
However, higher oxidative stress is always accompanied by lower survival rate, in hence we also                         need to do something to make our host cell more robust and prevent cells from dying for                         oxidation.
Feedback
After increasing the concentration of ROS in cell, there's still somethings we need to                         consider:
● The high level of ROS will damage the cells and even lead to cells death.
● Low survival rate under high oxidant state may affect the signal output of our system,                             making our results not convincing.
● It's hard to control the ROS accumulation in every assay, which means our test may be                             NON-repeatable.
Based on these reasons, we need to add an feedback system to control the concentration of ROS                         in vivo, make it higher than normal level, lower than death level to maintain cell viability                         and last, steady for test. We solve this problem by adding an ROS sensor, which has a suitable                         sensing threshold so that it can maintain the"

Main Project Abstract
Fig 1 . Here is the potato.
Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli “Pneumosensor”, that will      work inside an in vitro diagnostic device. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. Pneumoniae. Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. It is also equipped with a new promoter for the specific and tight regulation of      target gene expression in E. coli. In addition, the team is documenting and characterizing existing CR-TA riboregulators for post-transcriptional     regulation of gene expression. Our work will help other iGEM teams more effectively incorporate this tuning tool into their project design.

Synthetic Cancer Killers
""Killer cells of the immune system identify cancer and pathogen-infected cells and kill them. These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of cells. In order to differentiate between healthy and diseased cells, killer cells use a variety of receptors, which bind to specific ligands on the target cells’ surface. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the killer cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the killer cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming nearby cells, triggering a directed apoptotic response.
Our team will focus on improving killer cells’ specificity and killing efficiency towards cancerous target cells. By using tools of synthetic biology, we hope to create powerful killing bio-machines to fight cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.""
We believe that as long as the proper precautions are taken and the safety guidelines are followed, most potential safety concerns can be prevented. None of our genes, parts, or devices are considered potentially oncogenic or pathogenic which would require a safety rating above BSL1. We specifically chose not to use materials from known pathogens. A possible extra precaution to make parts, devices, and systems safer would have been to put suicide genes into the sequences to prevent unintended introductions of them into the environment, but this was less necessary based upon the components and systems we used.

""The development of sensitive and selective biosensors is an important research field in synthetic biology. Biosensors can be applied in a wide range of uses - from the detection of environmental toxics up to clinical diagnostics. Because cells have to sense their surroundings, there are a lot of natural systems that are similar to a biosensor. Prejudicial cellular biosensors often show negative side effects that complicate any practical application. Common problems are the limited use outside of a gene laboratory due to the use of genetically engineered cells, the low durability because"
Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," allows us to functionalize all of these heads simultaneously. To investigate the possible conformations further, we continued our approach with the robotics inspired methods.
IDR Conformational Sampling and Exploration
Both the SRS and TRS methods were applied to the minimum energy conformation of Orthos obtained previously, generating 1,000 structures each.
Thanks to this large scale sampling of possible conformations, we conducted a statistical analysis studying the distance between the alpha carbon of the phenylalanine 366 and the alpha carbon of the glutamic acid 32 of the streptavidin binding site, as well as the global Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the protein.
The RMSD is a measure equal to the sum of the geometric distances between each atom of a molecule, compared to the initial conformation, aligning each frame to this to mask the translational and rotational variations. Through this, we can study the conformational variability of our protein. We calculated it here on the peptidic backbone of the protein.
Figure 5: Various positions of the mSA2 domain (in red) in relation to the CBM3a (in green) as calculated by the SRS strategy developed by the LAAS, showing the distance between the mSA2 binding site and AzF alpha carbon (dotted line, distance in Å), animated
Figure 6: Various positions of the mSA2 domain (in blue or red) in relation to the CBM3a (in green) as calculated by the SRS strategy (left) and the TRS strategy (right), static
The figures shown directly above (Figure 6) were generated by loading 5 different structures calculated by the LAAS, then aligning the CBM3a domain of each of them. As you seen on the figures, both of these simulations show the range of positions that the streptavidin head can take in relation to the CBM3a, also demonstrating the high flexibility of the linkers.
With these data extracted, we can move on to the statistical analysis of the measurements made.

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

We realized that we have to step back in the process by inserting the different parts we want to ligate into a plasmid before ligating them to each other.
We then started our day in the lab by doing a PCR reaction on PCR1 (consisting of template 2:2P, primers yellow#5 and yellow#6) and PCR2 (consisting of template 2:2P and primers yellow#5 and yellow#7). Unfortunately PCR2 didn't show the right sequence when run on gel. This means we will have to repeat our PCR 2 from before to se if it works in second round.
PCR was also done on the lacP promoter (BBa_R0010)and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840). The sequences machted the the lenght seen in the gel. The band from the gel was cut out and purified.

NpuDnaE intein circularization construct using Type III AFP and a computer-optimized linker
What: Starting from the NpuDnaE intein RFC [105] circularization construct BioBrick from Team Heidelberg 2014 ( BBa_K1362000 ) we developed a computationally-optimized linker sequence to circularize a Type III antifreeze protein. Our linker consists of the tripeptide GAA, which in addition to the extein scar CWE/RGK, links the N and C termini of a the Type III AFP (PDB file: 1AME) without straining the core protein structure or distorting the residues critical for ice-binding. Our BioBrick also added a constitutive T7 promoter (Part BBa_I14018) allowing expression of your circular protein without any additional sub-cloning steps.
Why: Type III AFPs have a variety of potential applications in the oil and gas, food, and health industries, however these industries often use processes involving extreme temperatures, pH levels, and salt concentrations. Type III AFP is a particularly fragile protein as it denatures at 37oC. Circularizing the protein using our BioBrick affords greater stability at a wider variety of experimental conditions
BBa_K1831001
Type III AFP with E-coil + His tag
What: This BioBrick is a fusion protein consisting of the E-coil domain of our coiled-coil system fused in-frame to the C-terminus of a Type III AFP. Type III AFP (PDB fIle: 1AME) is a moderately active antifreeze protein from the ocean pout, with a small (7Kb), globular structure"

PREAMBLE
After centuries and centuries of practicing agriculture, mankind appears to have all the knowledge it could ever need on crop production and cultivation. Despite the high level of understanding for farming, the possibilities for the further application of such information are astounding: “Knowledge is power, but enthusiasm pulls the switch”. Per usual, there tends to be controversy surrounding any attempt to let go of familiar practices for an unconventional methods. It is important to respect the opinions of others for even the slightest possibility that they might see the matter from a different perspective and in time change their minds. Our story begins from that very desire to help and change our society
WHERE DID CHATTERPLANT BEGIN?
Since the beginning of agriculture , there has been a lack of respect for the environment: natural resources have been exploited and the use of pesticides have damaged the natural richness the soil. Only a few years ago, sustainability and environmental impact have have become a factor to be considered. However, it is perceived that the advancement of technology is not as fast as the advance of agriculture. Consequently, it is evident that agricultural industry is not taking full advantage of new technologies.
To counteract this situation, the integration of synthetic biology with agriculture would be a way to establish innovative technologies into agriculture, with the objective of making crops more sustainable.
To transform the beginning ideas into what is now ChatterPlant, a social and a legal framework analysis was performed. With the knowledge obtained, the construction of ChatterPlant was completed. Furthermore, a plan to encourage the adoption of such technology was put together through additional research. Through a step-by-step workflow, known as a pilot project, the adoption of ChatterPlant was proposed.

FUTURE WORK
Owing to the limited time and the lack of ribosome binding sites (RBS) of different efficiency, we cannot get enough data to achieve regulating RBSs. However, we were illuminated by the project did by Peking University in 2011 [1]. And we come up with the idea that we could use genetic rheostats as means of RBSs' regulators. And then, we could get the excellent RBSs' efficiency and use RBS calculators to edit the RBSs' sequence to achieve a suitable efficiency. Genetic rheostats are ligands-responsive RNA devices. From the kits, we can get a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-regulated hammerhead ribozyme. This part is numbered K598003, which is a TPP down-regulated hammerhead ribozyme 2.5 with native RBS (Figure 1, [1]).
Figure 1 Mechanism for TPP ribozyme 2.5 [1]
As shown in Figure 1, TPP ribozyme 2.5 has a self-cleavage of hammerhead domain. At the absent of thiamine pyrophosphate, these RNA devices would cleave themselves and expose the ribosome binding sites. Then the translation processes start. However, TPP ribozyme 2.5 would transform to a structure that hides self-cleavage of hammerhead domain. As a consequence, ribosome binding site remains covered and the translation process stops. So TPP ribozyme 2.5 is a statistical ribosome binding site with which we can regulate the translation initial rate by changing the concentration of thiamine pyrophosphate. However, statistical ribosome binding sites cannot be applied in industrial production due to its complicated operations. So we need to change them into normal ribosome binding sites, which can be achieved by means of RBS calculators. There are two kinds of thermodynamics-based RBS calculators online. They are the RBS calculator and the UTR designer [2]. Therefore, we"

The Hill coefficient describes cooperativity of the binding. Positive cooperativity (n>1) means that a bound enzyme has higher affinity for other ligands; negative cooperativity (n<1) means the converse is true; and non-cooperative binding (n=0) means that whether or not the enzyme is bound has no bearing on further binding (Weiss, 1997).
The Hill equation is shown below:
, where [L] is concentration of the ligand (in our case, the inhibitor), Kd is the dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient.
Mouse Inhibitor Serpina3n vs GzmB Activity
Our first dataset (Table 1), which measures Serpina3n concentration vs relative GzmB activity, came from research by Ang et al. at the University of British Columbia (2011). Serpina3n is a known mouse GzmB inhibitor, and the paper documented the effects of Serpina3n on GzmB activity. Given its specificity in mice, this inhibitor was not chosen as part of the final construct, but data from this paper was used because the relevant constants can be analyzed and compared to other inhibitor substitutes.

Several adjustments were made to the equation and dataset so that we could have a meaningful model.  First, GzmB activity was shown as percentages ranging from 10% to 120% in the paper. This is likely because the control for the experiment was set at some point where the Serpina3n expression is not 0. Thus, we scaled down the data points by a factor of 1/120. This scaling is necessary since the Hill equation returns a fraction; the output is limited to between 0 and 1.
More importantly, since the data was presented as the concentration of enzymes that remain free after binding, we needed to modify the Hill equation in order to model the fraction of unbound"

Change the plan to build upon Cambridge ideas
We were thinking to just slightly modify the plasmids that produce a gradient fluorescent band, in the article “A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern information” by Basu et al. A closer look at the plasmids sequence showed that our lab didn’t possessed the restriction enzymes nor adequate sticky ends in the sequence, required to cut and ligate biobricks insertion. Therefore we look after alternative solution for the project and found last years iGEM construct design very suitable for our bioclock construction. It would allow the team to modify their biobricks construct and rearrange to build band detect construct suitable for our bioclock project
Solve the detailed problems like AHL removal, color protein, and irreversible transmission of signal.
Overproduction of AHL was a problem that could destabilise the system. We thought the AHL gradient produced would disturb the quorum sensing signalling of the next set of band detect colonies in the bioclock. Therefore we planned to design a biobrick construct with the same organisation as the band detect construct, with the only difference that the fluorescent gene would be replaced by aiia-gene producing a protein degrading AHL.

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Sustainability#Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," and many children suffer from it our project.
Contact person: Prof. Samir K. Brahmachari, former director of India's main research body - The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR); Chief mentor, Open Source Drug Discovery center.
Advice: Regarding the law, there is no GM microorganisms that are allowed because of the use of antibiotic markers that makes them unsafe to eat. But for him if we can add a safe vitamin pathway on already eaten bacteria (lactic bacteria for example) that will be sterilized but producing enough vitamin to fortify the food, it should be possible. It is not impossible that regulatory issues can undergo changes. Concerning the GMO debate in Europe and India, the main points are different: in India, people don't want GMO to be associated with farmers, they don't want them to be dependent and no one want a monopoly of a particular plant. These issues don't apply to our project for Samir Brahmachari, but labeling would be an problem: the use of our product only depends on people's wish. If people find it beneficial and safe, they would take it. To continue, an accelerated evolution can be more acceptable for a project like ours for the GMO regulation. Also, since our project doesn't imply a big company producing and giving a product, it is more likely to work and be more accepted, as well as the way we want to implement it (give power to people, let them have their own ""mini-lab"" and produce their bacteria and yeast for their consumption) according to him.  Prof. Brahmachari visited us this summer and participated to our first workshop. We went to meet him again at the 2nd Annual Open Source Pharma Conference in Frankfurt, Germany at the end of the summer.
Indian Citizens - field study & Acceptance :
Because the law is not the only element we needed to consider for our project, we decided to build a survey on the food habits of Indian citizens, to understand what they eat the most and when, how they cook, how often the food varies, how they see our idea, would they try it, etc.
This survey take an important place in the Human practices, because collecting information on the field is essential, to understand people’s acceptance toward our project, and to find ways of introducing this project into their daily life without disrupting their tradition and culture.
Alice trip to India :
