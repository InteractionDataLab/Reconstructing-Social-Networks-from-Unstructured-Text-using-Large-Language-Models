4. B0014 + RS2 + psb1C3. Plate resistance: chloramphenicol.
5. B0014 + RS2. Plate resistance: kanamycin.
Also, we did an electrophoresis run of LuxCDEG PCR product. Nothing showed up u.u. But we could purify more psB1C3 (it does not make up for lux though)
Finally, we prepared some parts to send to our international advisor (yeah, the Argentinian) so he can try to assemble them by the Gibson technique.
SIMON LEFT US TODAY :_( He'll be spending the next three (yes, THREE!) weeks in San Francisco. He couldn't help but trade us for sunny californian beaches...
Tuesday: We had a videoconference with Copenhagen and Valencia teams. As we are working in very similiar projects we decided to establish a collaborative alliance. Eventually, we will share our constructs to compare their performance in the different systems. Go teams go!!!
E. colis with lux brick were grown in LB media. L-Arabinose 2 mM was added. The sensitivity test for the arduino circuit will be done tomorrow.
Later on we checked yesterday's plates and all of them had colonies (yay!!), although the ones with newer ligation buffer had better yield (plates 1 and 5). The previous low transformation efficiencies might have been because of this. We culture colonies from plates 1 and 5 in bacterial tubes for further extraction.
Another gel run for LuxCDEG PCR product was done. Again, no sign of bands. Run for LuxCDEG with X+P also showed nothing. We think we must have done something incorrectly. We'll try the following ligation: (Lux CDEG1 E+S digestion) + (Lux CDEG2 X+P digestion) + (psB1C3 E+P).
As a day with no transformations is a dull one we transformed: Lux CDEG in psB1C3, Lux CDEG in psB1A2 and Lux CDEG in psB1A2 (from plasmid).
Checking final details of synechocystis transformation protocol. We hope to do it on Thursday!
Parts for our Argentinian advisor are on their way to Cambridge :) hope they make it through customs!
Wednesday:
The bacteria with the last ligation didn't grow in kanamycin plates. We believe the digested parts were wrong labeled"
NEFU_China,2016,Team:NEFU China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious effect on protein separation). Introducing a 10% ‘spacer gel’ between 4% stacking and 16% separating gels considerably sharpens the bands for proteins and peptides of 1–5 kDa.
3. Adjust protein concentrations so that a suitable amount of protein can be loaded onto the gel. Concentrate samples, preferentially by techniques that do not increase the salt concentration (such as ultrafiltration). Roughly 0.2–1 μg of protein for each protein band (in 0.7 × 5 mm gel strips) is sufficient for Coomassie staining. Accordingly, the desired protein concentration in the sample is 0.1 mg/ml–1 for each protein band. For silver staining, 100-fold less protein may be sufficient. Depending on the requirements of protein detection and analysis, concentration of the sample may be necessary.The maximal protein load can be limited by large amounts of neutral detergent in the sample and by high concentrations of lipid when solubilizing biological membranes. SDS must always be in large excess over neutral detergents and/or lipids. For isolated mitochondrial membranes (70% protein, 30% lipid), for example, the optimized maximal protein load of sample wells 0.7 × 5 mm is 20 μg. Increasing the applied amount of protein to 40 μg, for example, may cause the individual protein bands to disappear in a diffuse background. Around 0.4% neutral detergent in the sample can be tolerated for direct mixing with SDS-containing sample incubation buffers and application to SDS gels. The incubation buffers and volumes described in Step 4 set a tenfold excess of SDS over the neutral detergent. Setting the SDS/neutral detergent ratio to <10 may result in a surprising result after staining: normally separated, large proteins may be detected in the upper gel areas, but the lower gel areas may be completely clear with no small proteins detectable.
4. Mix samples with SDS-containing sample buffers. The volume and buffer to be used depend on the origins of the samples. For low-density samples such as elution fractions from chromatographic columns, add 5 μl of reducing or nonreducing sample incubation buffer A or B (see REAGENTS) to 15 μl of sample. For high-density samples such as fractions from sucrose density gradients, add 5 μl of sample buffer C or D to 15 μl of sample. For pellet samples"

Safety Assessment
Once the biological device is complete, the biocontainment is implemented and the possible risks have been assessed, the robustness of the device must be analysed. Although in an iGEM project it is difficult to implement, a biological device should be robust in the sense that even after failure of single parts or subsystems, the device will keep working in a safe way. The safety assessment allows to find weak spots in the biological design, as well as potential problems that may not have been taken into account previously. This information will help to redesign the biological device to make it more robust and safer, for example by implementing redundant circuits.
There are different ways of performing the safety assessment. One of the most common methods is the Tree Analysis. There is an inductive approach (Event Tree Analysis), in which possible failures are identified after considering malfunctioning of the different parts of the device, and a deductive approach (Fault Tree Analysis), in which failures are first defined and the possible causes are traced backward. We have developed an example of a Fault Tree Analysis applied to the biocontainment mechanism, which can be found below (Figure 2).
Figure 2: This figure shows the Fault Tree Analysis that we have developed to analyse the possible problems that might make the biocontainment method not work.

The sequence, and the original native AmilCP sequence with the same elements was then ordered as customized genes from IDT inserted in pUCIDT, a cloning vector containing ampicillin resistance.
Unfortunately IDT wasn’t able to synthesize the codon optimized Austin Texas sequence even though multiple attempts were made. Each attempt resulted in the switch of a base, causing an early stop codon to form. Hence we never were able to compare our codon optimized sequence with the sequence from the Austin Texas team. We continued with our experiment and decided to make a stability assay where we compared the expression between our two Biobrick parts containing optimized AmilCP sequences and the original AmilCP sequence from the iGEM registry.

Experiments
Design and Transformation
The original native AmilCP sequence, Part:BBa_K592009 was codon optimized for E.coli K12 with a codon optimization tool provided by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). In order to conduct a stability assay through growth in liquid culture, the codon optimized basic part and the original native AmilCP part was attached to a constitutive promotor, RBS and a double terminator separately. The two Biobrick parts were ordered as customized gene fragments from IDT inserted in pUCIDT (Amp).
Both vectors were transformed into DH5-aplha E.coli cells through single tube transformation and yielded phenotypically blue colonies for cells containing plasmid with original part and plasmid containing codon optimized part.

Synthethic biology lessons
In a brainstorming session with our team we discussed whether we thought subjects around synthetic biology were taught well in a good way in high school. All of us agreed that this was not bad at all. When we were in high school, we learned about a lot of subjects related to synthetic biology, but they were neven connected. Biology and chemistry for example were kept completely separate.
We are aiming to solve this by providing high schools with two different lessons on synthetic biology. An important requirement for these lessons is that it should be sustainable. It should be developed in a way in which it can be used more than once. Since we will not be part of the iGEM team in the upcoming years, the lessons are not developed to be taught by us, but by the teachers of high schools. This way, the courses can be used year after year.  We created PowerPoint presentations and course guides for teachers and worksheets and answer sheets for students.
The first lesson is about the societal impact of synthetic biology. This is illustrated with three examples: Golden Rice, Designer Baby’s and Gene Drives. The goal of this lesson is to let the students form an opinion about how synthetic biology can be applied in society. This lesson is applicable for high school students in general.

The second lesson is about a more technical aspect of synthetic biology. In this lesson the steps of a protocol for cloning are described in an interactive way. The steps that are included in the lesson are: digestion, ligation"

Existing variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) often misfold when expressed as fusions with other proteins (this is exactly we are going to do in our project), while a robustly folded version of GFP, called sfGFP, can fold well even when fused to poorly folded polypeptides. sfGFP shows improved tolerance of circular permutation, greater resistance to chemical denaturants and improved folding kinetics[6]. Other properties of sfGFP is similar with GFP, so as we planned before, we decide to split sfGFP into sfGFP1-10 (1-214) and sfGFP11 (214-230), then connect sfGFP11 with PrD. The protein structure we simulated are shown below.

Acquisition of sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11
Finally we make our experiment plan and set out to acquire two sfGFP fragments: sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. The gene sequence of sfGFP1-10 is the same as 1-642 of sfGFP sequence, so after getting the pSB1C3 plasmid containing the gene of sfGFP (Part BBa_I746916) in 2016 Kit Plate 6, we get sfGFP1-10 by PCR. First we want to get sfGFP11 in the same way as sfGFP1-10, however, the gene sequence of sfGFP11 contains several mutations from sfGFP, also we need to add a linker (a flexible polypeptide chain) to joint sfGFP11 and PrD (prion-determining region), so we decide to acquire sfGFP11, together with the linker directly by gene synthesis.

As the first week of actual iGEM work, there is some initial prep work that needs to be done.  Before we can start focusing on the main project involving the development of DNA plasmids and invertases to function within the cell, we must confirm our protocols and create working plasmids with fluorescent protein genes.  Also, we want to see which promoters and ribosomal binding sites (RBS) work the best together.

Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'
Starting with a bachelor in ""Molecular Biotechnology"" I made my bachelor degree in the field of renewable energy. Working with a strain of the hydrogen producing ""Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"" I studied the physiology of some promising new opportunities for our world's energy problem. To get more insights in the omics-techniques I switched for my master to ""Genome Based Systems Biology"" and in my master thesis I `m  working with an acarbose (diabetes agent) producing Actinoplanes. In a collaboration with ""Bayer Healthcare"" we are going to reveal the changes in the transcriptome under acarbose producing conditions.
At this time I'm looking for a project for my PhD with challenges in the field of systems or synthetic biology, preferentially with a medical background.
As a retired passionated baskeball player I now turned to mountainbiking. After working time I love to ride my bike with friends trough the local woods and in the wintertime I carry out my Snowboard from the basement and went south for a trip to the Alps. This summer I went to the Alps again and tried some fixed rope route climbing - it was a great pleasure!

Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'
In 2005 I began my bachelor in molecular biotechnology and in 2008 I switched to the master studies of genome based systems biology. From the very beginning I had a strong drift to computer science. In my bachelor thesis I did both, wetlab and programming for an online-image based cell classifier. Later I specialised more in biodatamining and at the moment I am preparing a realtime collaboration software in my master thesis. My upcoming PhD project will deal with analysis and dataming in metabolomics and it will somehow combine all preceding topics.

On the basis of the above experiment, we intended to choose GFP as a signal for PgltAB activity, so that we can easily measure the florescence intensity by plate reader, combining with the transcriptional level of gltC measured at the same time. Due to time constraints, we haven't prove this concept yet.
As we all know, LacI plays an important role in lac operon model, it can sufficiently inhibit the activity of its downstream promoters. For Bacillus, the promoter Pgrac consists of the groE promoter; the lacO operator and the gsiB SD sequence, among which the lacO operator can be inhibited by the LacI protein. Due to time constraints, we haven't prove this concept yet.
High glutamate concentration can improve tetA expression
To test the expression of tetA, we tagged it with the fluorescent reporter GFP-coding gene ( BBa_K2705004 ), whose expression was detected by microplate assay (395 nm\509 nm). The intracellular glutamate concentration and bacteria concentration (OD600) were also examined, respectively. (See Figure 2.) It could be concluded that with the increasing glutamate in medium, intracellular glutamate concentration went high, and tetA of PopQC was upregulated to express. The results suggested that the system can help individuals with higher intracellular glutamate concentration express more TetA, so that be able to survive in the tetracycline condition.

UCL_London,2011,Team:UCL London#HumanPractices#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html," the focus of the Wellcome trust is to build capacity for future high-level research. Meher explained that exaggeration of the potential of synthetic biology has made it difficult to decide which research is worth funding, and also made news media wary of covering developments. We asked what Melissa and Meher thought about the Human Practices element of iGEM, and they said that next year’s funding call would take engagement projects into consideration if they were well integrated with the science taking place.
Emma Frow , Research Fellow ESRC Genomics Policy and Research Forum University of Edinburgh, told us about her experience as a iGEM judge in the 2010 competition. We asked her about what ‘human practices’ is and how it fits within iGEM as a competition. She explained that the area of ‘human practices’ within iGEM is expansive with social, ethical, legal and philosophical inquiry all falling under the same umbrella. She added that in 2010 teams had consistently neglected a central theme in science and technology studies - understanding the relationship between science and society. She felt that the enthusiasm for synthetic biology seen within the competition had left little scope to ask delving and critical questions that might lead to fruitful human practice investigation. Our conversation with Emma has allowed us to focus attention on the analytical quality of our sociological investigation into the iGEM competition.

It contains not only one fusion protein for the system, it also contains the whole modified reporter construct with the binding site for the cI protein of phage 434. With this part we want to make it possible for every coming iGEM member to create their own bacterial two-hybrid system for in vivo selection directly in E. coli. To get better informations about what we have achieved with this part you can go on our Best Composite Part site.

BBa_K2082000, BBa_K2082004, BBa_K2082005: Monobody construction kit
For the iGEM community we designed not 10 or 100 coherently parts. Our part collection includes 100,000 distinct sequences of special binding proteins, namely monobodies. We, the team iGEM Bielefeld 2016, want to enrich the iGEM community with a whole library of monobodies freely usable for everyone. With this collection we do not only integrate a new category in the iGEM part registry database, we implemented a whole fundamental framework composed on the monobody constant regions and RFP instead of the variable regions, which can easily exchanged for creating a specific monobody or even an own library. To round off the library we do not only create a framework for monobodies, we also created a similar framework for nanobodies, too ( BBa_K208001 , BBa_K208006 ). For more informations about our part collection visit our Best Part Collection site.

DnaQ is part of the DNA polymerase III and responsible for the proofreading activity of this complex. The dnaQ926 variant     loses this activity through mutation of two function essential amino acids inside the active site. The complete loss of proofreading as well as the resulting saturation of mismatch-repair makes dnaQ926 the single strongest mutator gene known (Fijalkowska und Schaaper 1996)
dnaQ926 is part of our genome wide mutator BBa_K2082117, but we also used it as a standalone mutator in BBa_K2082116. After initially     designing our genome wide mutator we looked for mutagensis gene already in the iGEM partsreg and found several candidates.     The most prominent one is iGEM SYSU-China 2014's dnaQ926 BBa_K1333108 .    Furthermore, we use iGEM Uchicago"

Heidelberg,2010,Team:Heidelberg#crap_-_-_TEXT.html,"2008 and since then knows the obvious reason to join the competition again: iGEM simply is the most beautiful competition existing in biology and its mix of constructive creativity and team work guarantees a uniquely inspiring science experience. Philipp's beyond-iGEM scientific interests are in neuroscience and after finishing his bachelor thesis at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Neuroscience at University of Heidelberg he will start his master studies in Neuroscience. Since Philipp has been mentoring science projects for high school kids for years he also enjoys the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the Human Practice Projects in science communication he’s involved in.
Rebecca Berrens
Rebecca is a first year master student in the Molecular Biotechnology program at the university of Heidelberg. She recently finished her bachelor thesis on drosophila microRNA binding site identification at the european molecular biology laboratory. Joining the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010, Rebecca seeks for linking her strong background on microRNAs to bioengineering, discovering a completely new area in synthetic biology within a creative research team.
Rudolf Pisa
Rudi is not a spy (or is he?)! He’s just participating in the Cambridge-Heidelberg exchange programme. In Cambridge he was reading Natural Sciences Tripos that allowed him to gain insights into molecular biology as well as chemistry which he specialized in last year. He’s very grateful for the opportunity of being part of the iGEM team Heidelberg this year. It helped him not only to acquire some new lab experience but also gain many other transferable skills. Rudi especially values the possibility of developing new projects from the beginning and working with a very dynamic and enthusiastic group of people. In his opinion synthetic and chemical biology are the most exciting and promising fields for future advancement in health sciences.

The substract and products are updated depending on the equation rate, in the following manner:        dP/dt = v0        dS/dt = -v0    Which guarantees mass conservation inside the system (if no sink/source nodes are present in the pathway).    To create a reaction in PolyEnzyme first there has to be two or more nodes in the canvas. Pressing the button ""Create reaction"" in the top left menu initiates the reaction wizard. This has two functions:
2.2.1 Create Reaction
This process has two phases. First, all the nodes acting as sources must be selected (they become highlighted in green). Once this is done, click ""Done"" in the top left menu to start the second phase, where the products are selected (highlighted in blue). Note that a node can't be product and source of the same reaction. When all the products are selected, cliking again the ""Done"" button will trigger a prompt asking for the enzyme catalyzing the reaction (optional) and the parameters Vmax, km. Not setting those parameters will result in them initializing at 1.5[mM/s] and 0.5[mM] respectively.
2.2.2 Set inhibition
If the reaction is gonna be a inhibition on an existing reaction, the selected source nodes will represent the inhbitiors of such reaction. To create the inibition, click on any reaction in the canvas. A prompt will appear asking for the inhibition type and the inhibition constant Ki. The inhibition type can be set to Competitive, Uncompetitive or Non-Competitive(mixed).
2.2.2.1 Competitive Inhibition
Binds the complex EI + S, where I is the inhibitor. It only affects Km, and therefore has less effect at high substract concentrations. Here, ki is the actual EI complex dissociation constant.     $ v0 = Vmax[S]/([S] + km(1+[I]/ki)) $
2.2.2.2 Un-competitive Inhibition
Binds to the complex ESI. It only affects Vmax, and therefore has less effect at low substract concentrations.     v0 = Vmax[S]/([S](1+[I]/ki) + km)

3. A Peep into iGEM's Hidden Nature, or Future
Bindrune means combining two or more runes together to form a new rune.Bindrunes give rise to new meanings to the new entity formed, such as its hidden traits, its aspiration, its goal, etc. These are possible because in the crossings of lines, new runes may occur. To make a bindrune, you try to combine two runes together by trying out various ways to ""ligate"" them. And two runes can make more than one bindrune depending on the way you ligate them. I'm not a rune master, but trying out sometimes is fascinating.
We've all seen one or two examples of bindrunes in our daily life: the logo of the Bluetooth is the bindrune of Hagalaz and Berkana according to wikipedia,[12] but personally I think it is Gebo and Berkana, which makes more sense. It doesn't use the elder futhark, but another set of runic alphabets with some slight mutation in form, and that's not what we're going to discuss here.
I tried to make a bindrune of iGEM to see what was the results. And to my astonishment, I found the simplest and most elegant form of the potential bindrunes to be an already existed rune, and none other but Mannaz! Can bindrunes even work like this? Pitiful"

Fig. 2-3-5. Our induction assay result for our phoA promoter
Fig. 2-3-6. Our induction assay result for OUC-China 2012's phoB promoter
From our results above, we determined parameters for the induction mechanism by fitting the results to the following Hill equation (Fig. 2-3-7). α denotes the maximum GFP expression rate in this construct. m denotes the phosphate concentration at which the GFP expression rate is half of α. β denotes the hill coefficient.  Those parameters (Fig. 2-3-8) can be used in future modeling.  Plants are reported to be in phosphate starvation when its concentration is below 1 mM (Hoagland et al., 1950).  Our part can sense the concentration below 1 mM, too (Fig. 2-3-9).  Therefore, our improved part is useful for our farming circuit. Moreover, a sensor for phosphate concentration is valuable for various studies in synthetic biology.

3. Cytokinin synthesis
In order to construct the cytokinin production part, we focused on AtIPT, a plant enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of cytokinin.  The mechanisms of cytokinin synthesis are shown in Fig. 2-3-10 (Takei et al., 2001).  We ordered two DNA sequences of AtIPT (AtIPT4 and AtIPT7) derived from A. thaliana and constructed the part including one of them.

Overview
To introduce the synthetic biology to general masses, we hold two opening activities and set up an online platform. And our outlays have been paid back.
White Crabapple Season Open Day
On 15th April 2016, Tianjin University opened its doors to the general public for its fifth White Crabapple Season Open Day, where this year we hosted a stand. Over 30,000 people entered our campus throughout the day and visited our Science Popularization Stand.
Our stand plays an essential role that major in popularize synthetic biology knowledge with easy experiments that can be operated by the audiences while doing no harms, like blood type test and so on. Meanwhile, members from our team will introduce the principle of the experiment then answer questions. There are other forms of fun games contained biological questions battle, color filling the drawings about biology and our campus, compete in describing our project in more detail after reading our poster about iGEM and our team. Besides, we also prepare some interesting specimen for observation, like specimen if onions, oral epithelial cells and so on.
Our stand attracts a lot of attention during the whole festival. Many kids coming here with their parents feel a sense of accomplishment when they see the experiment results come out by themselves. These bio-experiments excite the curiosity of the children. That is one the best advancement of synthetic biology.
Children's Day
After the Begonia Science Popularization Festival, there still be a lot of families which have missed our stand in festival want to lead the child to experience more about biology and contact us. We think it will be a good chance and set up a Children's Day, a little trip in laboratory.
We give 10 families warm reception. In the laboratory teacher's guidance help, team members carefully prepared and hold a little speech with easy-understanding language to introduce the mystery image of the micro-kingdom, also cited the classic Chinese ""Journey to the West"" plot to explain the process of phage infection of bacteria. The students teach the use of microscopic laboratory instruments and observed microorganisms such as mold, penic"

For constructing BioGuide 2.0 we have some plans.
Short Term plan:
Next year we are planning to generate BioGuide 2.0 by using all parts     data but inorder to do this we will update our part database but easyway     is standardization and reorganizing all parts in partsregistrty.org     according to our suggestion because re-organizing and normalization     are crucial. We are planning to add new tools to improve graphs.Our     ultimate aim is finding best pathway based on automated construction     and input-output relation. BioGuide 2.0 will be more faster because     we are planning to use OODBMS and all all platform will support BioGuide     2.0.
Long term plan:
We want to improve our algoritm and add more parameter to make graphs     more effective. Our dream is embeding our software into partsregistry.org     so no mere iGEMers will choose parts in real time by using our software.
Suggestions based on PartsRegistry Survey Results
First suggesiton is offering fartnership with Google for easy search     and founding a committe to enforce a standardized nomenclature for terminology     and parts registry entries.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should assume the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would beeven better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately. We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or     with negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still     archive them and make their data available through the parts registry.     So the while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated,     fully working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on     a more exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the     parts stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be     encouraged as an collaborative effort. We are sure, all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database. We are planning to provide"

1.5 The iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes efficiently arrests cancer cell proliferation in vitro
KRAS over-expression has been demonstrated to promote the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells and be involved in migration and invasion of lung cancer. For further verification, we examined the role of iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes in cell proliferation. An EDU assay using Cell-Light™ EdUTP Apollo®567 TUNEL Cell Detection Kit, was carried out after siRNA-iRGD-exosome incubation and as a control, nude exosomes were also treated to A549 cells. The result indicated that KRAS knockdown had an anti-proliferation effect on lung tumor cells while nude exosomes were not capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.
Figure 7. Cell proliferation assay for A549 cells treated with PBS or transfected with iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes (exosome). Left panel: Fluorescence microscope photos of A549 cells. The red points represent divided cells for cell proliferation rate calculation. Right panel: Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation rate, indicating that iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes can effectively suppress cell proliferation. (**: p < 0.01)

2.1 Establishment of none-small cell lung cancer mouse model with 40 mice to perform validation experiment in vivo
The iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes can be released into A549 cells and suppress the expression of KRAS in vitro. To examine the consequence of KRAS knockdown by anti-KRAS siRNA in vivo, we built a non-small cell lung cancer mouse model for in vivo experiment. Forty mice were subcutaneously injected A549-LUC cells to realize tumor implantation. Then tumor volume were measured through bioluminescent imaging several times after injection. The areas that emit fluorescence in the mice bodies represent labeled tumors (tumors developed from the implanted A549-LUC cells), which helps us to monitor the tumor growth, location and metastasis.
2.2 Mice were divided to receive different treatment, testing the function of iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes
Mice were randomly assigned to 2 groups (n=20 per group) and treated differently. One group received PBS injections, the other group is treated with iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes via tail-vein injections. The administrations were given five times for"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the official fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology, which is carried out by the iGEM competition itself but also in the InterLab study from this year’s Marburg iGEM team.       They are working with Vibrio natriegens as a possible new chassis for synthetic biology. In their project „Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio“ they aim to establish Vibrio natriegens, the fastest-growing organism known to date (doubling time ~ 10 min) as the new go-to organism for everyday lab work in both academic and industrial applications. The task in their InterLab study was similar to the official iGEM InterLab study, i.e.       to measure fluorescence of different test devices at different time points.

Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", but we need to make sure that our project will be effective in the future and doesn’t simply mimic another business or open-source project out there that wasn’t successful!
Mike Nichols
In order to make a global impact, you really need to build a business around your products, patents and all. Raising funds will be a lot easier when you start a start-up in conjunction with us, as many businesses with much less appeal have made millions of dollars after just a few years here.
Team DISCO
Wow that’s amazing! It would definitely be easier to raise the funds as a company.  Much of the price of insulin comes from manufacturers and patent holders adding huge mark ups on the product that the governments and consumers then must face. If we were to design a business, obviously we wouldn’t impose those kinds of mark ups.
Narcyz Ghineaa
Hey guys, slow down a little. Discovering promising compounds is only one step in the process. It is the in-human trials that are needed to convince regulators the drug should be registered that is the real challenge for open source drug development. How are you going to fund that? If you want to get a drug to market entirely open-source without industry involvement you will probably need to consider “open source clinical trials”, and organise a network of people that are willing to do the necessarily research on a non-profit basis.
Team DISCO
We hadn’t considered that. I guess that we need to think about all the potential options for funding that doesn’t necessarily involve us making it directly to fund the project.
Mike Nichols
You should also start thinking about how the initial manufacturing plant begins. If I were you, I’d find a country that has a high demand for insulin and is currently very undersupplied. Build your plant there, following the regulatory guidelines required for that country. Once your Human Insulin production starts making a profit, you can begin phasing in your Winsulin. Get Winsulin off the ground with your human insulin production.
Neil Donelan
This might be a nice way to start. We currently have a large amount of processes that we have to go through in order to transport insulin from one country to another. Custom imports are different between countries, some of which are time and resource intensive to manoeuvre through. Localising your operation in one location may be a better way of organising this before expanding.
Mike Nichols
Would you have anywhere specifically in mind?

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html,"ediation is the intricacy of the techniques that are involved. Aside from the general publics qualms about bio-remediation procedures, even the scientific community does not have a holistic understanding of how the processes within bio-remediation work, or how to optimize a microbe’s “oil-eating” activity based on its metabolic characteristics. Most say that bio-remediation is a cost effective technique in treating vast oil spills, but it seems that investors and economists have not incorporated the cost of time and labour required in mastering the techniques involved. Once these techniques have established, there is a definite opportunity for this field to overpower the current invasive chemical processes that are being used as a last desperate resort in treating these environmental disasters.
The project wiki contains a condensed overview of the industry analyses, if you are interested in learning more be sure to check out the complete industry analysis.
Conclusions and Outlook
After conducting this research into the current and future position of synthetic biology particularly in the context of the business world, we are optimistic about the course that it will take. There are significant hurdles to overcome but overall there is a sense that synthetic biology will impart a positive impact not only in terms of specific products but also in terms of micro and macroeconomic impact.
In this inquiry we have attempted to understand some of the important issues facing synthetic biology from a business perspective. In the future we hope to take our work a step further; we hope to take our knowledge, thoughts, and questions into the business world. Through interaction with business owners, scientists, legal specialists, and other stakeholders we hope to disseminate our findings and build on them. In the future we will continue to focus on our goal of deciphering the path that synthetic biology will take as it emerges in the business world.

LB grown MG1655 phaCAB grow more rapidly initially then M9M with 3% glucose sole carbon source but reach the same OD after 6h while EV shows a different trend. EV in M9M levels off at a much lower OD at 4h, as seen with EV grown in LB. ANOVA analysis shows that the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between M9M and LB in empty vector and phaCAB, thus we must accept the null hypothesis (F 3,24 = 0.8451, p < 0.4827). Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
phaCAB growth in M9S supplemented with 3% glucose. LB grown MG1655 phaCAB grow more rapidly initially then M9S with 3% glucose sole carbon source, but after 5h, phaCAB in M9S continue to grow to a higher OD. EV shows a different trend, in M9S it levels off at a similar level to LB. ANOVA analysis for the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between M9S and LB similarly must be rejected as p > 0.05 (F 3,24 = 0.9802, p < 0.06009). Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusions: Glucose has an optimum growth around 3-4%. In M9S, it does not give any growth advantage to cells cultured in higher glucose concentrations. Cells grown in M9S grew equally well as those grown in LB, possibly because of LB having a pH shift as it gets used up.

Procedure: Synthetic genes encoding for the GLF protein and invertase were ordered and transformed into DH5α cells. Transformants were selected for on ampicillin plates and cultured in LBamp broth. Plasmid DNA from the transformants was isolated using a QIAgen miniprep kit and submitted for sequencing.
Results/Discussion: Sequencing data indicated successful transformations of DH5α cells with GLF and invertase. Thus, a large amount of plasmids containing these genes were produced for future experiments.

The PGI enzyme, responsible for converting fructose into glucose, will be ordered and stored until further testing.   Results: Final NADH concentrations were determined using the molar extinction coefficient and were proportionate to initial glucose concentrations.  Discussion: At this point we have only tested glucose quantification, although we have not assayed with PGI and tested fructose quantification, we have concluded that this assay is working and is sensitive enough for our application.

There were also papers read on the supersecondary structure, that provide us the building blocks for our linkers. The value of the different patterns was evaluated and first thoughts on the set up of the library were made. Software-wise, a short-track for small proteins was implemented and the flexible ends were really taken into account.
Wet lab:
As last week, our aim was still to get pSBX-2Zv2Npu. In addition, we wanted to express LambdaLys(lin). For some mysterious reason, we ordered primers for inserts that can be cloned into our pSBX-2Zv2Npu (LambdyLys(rigid), LambdaLys(H6) = Lambda-Lysozyme with different Linkers for circularization). pSBX1K3-LambdaLys(lin) was successfully (!) cloned into BL21(DE3) and a 100ml culture was induced with IPTG. A CPEC of the PCA-product and pSBX1K3 with overhangs finally seemed to work, but sequencing results were not yet available.Since pSBX1K3 contains a BsmBI site, we cloned the potential 2Zv2Npu-biobrick into pSBX4C5. An attempt to get LambdyLys(rigid) and LambdaLys(H6) into pSBX1K3-2Zv2Npu via GoldenGate cloning failed.
Software:
In this week we have coded the translation from the software calculated paths to amino acids sequences. It was some literature work to be done for the right angle-patterns. On the other hand the set up of the screening library was refined. We decided not to screen a whole library of 60 linkers but we should construct it and then just take some few representative linkers out. For the screening-proteins GFP was discarded as the ends are too close together. Softwarewise also the clustering of linkers with the same structure was finished and the scoring on the clusters was implemented. A preliminary angle-library was also included in the software. First good linkers were obtained from the software and pictures of them were made. Another important step was the modelling of ligands, that should be omitted with sizes.  The software ran for the first time from beginning to the end and provided good sequences to us. The search for a"

Dioxygenase
Many of these reactions have little or no precedent in organic chemistry. Di-oxygenase and mono-oxygenase enzymes that are able to activate dioxygen are divided into oxidases, which use oxygen as an oxidant, and reduce dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide or water; and oxygenases, which incorporate oxygen atoms from dioxygen into the product(s).Dioxygenases incorporate both atoms of oxygen into the product(s).
Oxidization of Dibenzofuran, a dioxin like molecule we used in the lab1 1.
Most dioxygenase enzymes require a metal cofactor, which is most often iron(II or III). Dioxygenases primarily oxidize aromatic compounds and, therefore, have applications in environmental remediation. Dioxygenases serve as part of nature’s strategy for degrading aromatic molecules in the Environment. They are often found in the soil bacteria as well as almost all higher plants. Dioxygenase enzymes are used for a multitude of separate steps in the pathway described.

After being spun, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1ml calcium chloride again. This solution was again pre-chilled in the fridge, was again 0.1M but only 1ml was applied this time round.

50% glycerol was then applied to the mixture. Because the concentration of the glycerol to cell mixture was supposed to be 10%, we applied 0.ml to 0.9ml of cell mixture.
The resulting mixture was then placed into 50 microfuge tubes (each with a capacity of 100 microlitres) with these tubes being placed into a flask of liquid nitrogen. This process shock-freezes the E.coli cells.
After being given a few minutes to confirm freezing of the cells, the tubes were immediately scooped out of the flask and transferred immediately into a -80 degrees celsius freezer for storage.

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM team helped to give me a look into what is possible in the computer sciences and what I could do going into the future. I now have a slightly more concentrated view of what I want to do in college and possibly as a profession. Overall, this summer was one never to forget.
Nicole's Notebook
Tuesday, 6/30 -
Today was my first day at Wellesley College. The other interns and I first went to the large open area in the science building to talk about our internship requirements and other housekeeping information. Soon after we arrived our mentors joined us and took us back to the labs for a brief tour. My mentors Sam and Christina showed me the HCI lab and gave me an introduction to the projects the lab was working on. I learned about the PGHCI project and the iGEM project.
Tuesday, 7/7 -
I started working on learning Javascript and html using Codecademy. Also, I helped the PGHCI team by giving them input on how I would organize certain health conditions into categories. This helped the team decide how to sort the diseases and conditions to make it easier for users to understand their genomic information.
Tuesday, 7/21-
I continued to work on learning Javascript on Codecademy. I later helped the iGEM team research biobricks to use in their project, which was creating an interactive museum exhibit to help non-expert museum patrons understand synthetic biology concepts. The biobricks we researched were ones which could be used in bacteria on mars to create a more hospitable environment for human explorers.
Priyanka's Notebook
Throughout the month of July, I worked with the iGEM team and the other two interns, Nicole and Melissa, on the BacPack for New Frontiers project, an interactive display in which bacteria use available resources in extreme environments to make products important for human survival in those areas. For example, on Mars, resources include carbon dioxide, solar energy, soil, ice, and waste, which can be used to make oxygen, water, food, heat, and fuel. One of the tasks that we completed make the project easier to understand for younger students, we came up with simplified definitions for each resource and its use. In addition, we researched basic concepts related to the project such as the definitions of genes, bacterial reproduction, and bacterial colonies.
The third week, some interns from other labs came and tried the interactive display, and we observed them. Their feedback was useful in figuring out which aspects of the project can be improved upon, so that the display is more user-friendly. In addition, in order to explain"
Toulouse,2015,Team:Toulouse#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"One might ask if the importance we give to protecting bees does not have its roots in anthropocentrism since bees produce honey, wax and propolis, products we use. Other pollinators that do not supply us with interesting goods, such as wasps, are less considered.
Furthermore bees are the first pollinating species in terms of fruits and vegetables produced thus the advantages of protecting them are obvious for global trade.
Why is our solution better than what already exists?
Being aware of the worrying decrease in bee population and having developed an ethical reflection since the beginning of this project, we endeavoured to learn more about the causes of this decrease.
It is due primarily to the overuse of pesticides that have proven to act as neurotoxins to bees. However we decided not to act against this threat. Indeed using synthetic biology to solve a problem attributed to a human behaviour did not seem relevant to us. Measures to educate populations to a rational and responsible use of those pesticides would be more appropriate.
Another major cause of death for the bees is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The infestation of European bee colonies by this parasite was caused by their contact (wanted or not) with infested asian bees through globalization. Though it is true that the problem first originated with men, today we cannot solve it by changing our behaviour. In this case, synthetic biology could prove to be the solution.
Furthermore we tried to design a system that would be as respectful of the bee’s life cycle and products as possible, hence the circadian regulation and natural molecules .
Finally, we do not aim at completely eradicating the parasite from the environment. In fact, Asian honeybees are capable of identifying the varroa’s presence on themselves and of getting rid of it. Some colonies in Europe seem to start developing behaviours of the same kind. Thus we only wish to slow down the infestation by varroa with our system, to grant honeybees enough time to adapt to the menace and reach a balance with Varroa.
We talked above about the problem of controlling our modified microorganisms, and we put a lot of thought in the biocontainment issue: how could we prevent the dissemination of our E. Coli modified strain? Indeed bacteria are not machines and we cannot control them entirely. It is obvious that we cannot let uncontrolled modified organisms disseminate in the environment. Thus we need to take on a responsible position and accept to not use our system if total biocontainment is not demonstrated, even if positive results are obtained.
Bacteria have a high growth rate and can spread and mutate quickly. This aspect"

    Based on our idea “Science for all & Science is fun”, we vigorously engaged ourselves into education and science advocating activities. All events have served for our final goal in long run: creating a science culture for all generations in our community in the future. Hopefully, we’ve tickled all the boxes that “Best Education and Public Engagement” requires. As far as our activity’s scale and dimension are concerned, we are confident to say that we did well beyond the prize requirement in such interaction-oriented education and public engagement.
A “Deciphering Life” workshop in China Science and Technology Museum
    We held a fantastic workshop, whose theme was “deciphering life”, in the dinosaur square of China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM) for three days during our national days. The workshop attracted thousands of audience, including lots of children and their parents, who showed great interest in biology. iGEM as well as synthetic biology was also introduced in our exhibition. The workshop consisted of five sections, including the display board exhibition, DNA model building, E.coli DIY workshop, E.coli war and bacteria art exhibition. What’s more, we eventually formed long-standing cooperative relationship with CSTM, which will be a public educational base for later Tsinghua-A teams’ human practice.
I Display board explanation
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made 12 display boards in total, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents"
Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," to stabilise the system. However it is impractical and expensive to insert large amounts of DNA into individual bacteria with current methods.
User experience
The activation rate script is simple and deterministic. The results for activation rates are usually very high but that can be counterbalanced by either reducing the intensity of either the sensor absorption spectrum and/or the incident light. The results of this method have two important parrallels with the physical reality making it a working simplified model of sensor activation.
The Stochastic model is very sensitive to changes in rates and initial conditions. With very different behaviour resulting from only small pertubations. This is due to the stochastic nature of the model compounded by the small number of DNA agents as discussed before.
The absorption spectrum over time surface plot has to potential to produce accurate results. We have writen a script in MATLAB® that calculates the reflected light over time given the absorption over time and the incident light. It is possible to write a program that converts the reflected light spectrum over time into a colour over time. Regrettfuly we did not have the time to attempt such an edevour.
Sources of error
The model we have created is limited by the lack of experimental data to test and update it. As a result the data used in our model has a variety of sources and these indroduce many sources of error.
Firstly the rules describing the biochemistry of our cell addressed only the reactions unique to our pathway in detail and related reactions in a simplified manner. A small number of external conditions were addressed such as the competition for RNA polymerase and ribosomes between our pathway and other activity in the cell. This however means that the model does not take into account any interference from other cell activity. This is a source of error in our pathway simulation, however it is unlikely to the primary source of error.
Secondly the absorbtion spectra for all proteins and the background cell do not have their relative absorbtion intensities. Furthermore the spectra of the light sensors are approximations to data in literature, but the blue light sensor's absorbtion is that of LOVtap not YF1. LOVtap and YF1 are both light oxygen voltage blue light receptors and therefore we expect them to have a similar absorbtion spectrum. The spectra of the pigments are approximations of the standard cyan, magenta and yellow pigments used in colour printers. Therefore the pigment absorbtion spectra only represent the ideal colour of our pigments. This final point does not affect our rule-based stochastic simulation. The inaccuracy in our spectra causes an uncertainty in the calculation of activation rate and a greater"

Link
With Imperial College_London, we proceeded Kuas’s team survey and discussed about each team’s project. Imperial College_London were trying to develop a team communication app that allows every member of the team an equal opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns. Accordingly, to design their app and ensure its effectiveness, they needed help from the iGEM community on deciding the content of the app. Kuas teammates were deeply interested in team communication issues and had many discussions on similar topics before, so we were glad to deliver our thoughts about the team communication by conducting individual surveys on August 17th.
Also we provided feedback on their science communication guide, which helps scientists to tackle inconsistency problems in synthetic biology when it comes to sharing information with non-scientists and with the public. Providing feedback to their guide was a valuable experience, giving our Human Practice team the opportunity to learn attitudes to have when performing public engagements.
Since Korea and the United Kingdom are so far to have an actual meet-up, we have consistently been in contact through e-mail, Facebook, and online Skype. The first online meet-up was on August 18th through email. Imperial College were working on controlling bacterial gene expression on a 2D plane using electrical stimuli from electrode placed at specific coordinates. Their project was very intriguing and as same undergraduates, Kuas thought our team could provide feedback on their project and also get wet-lab advice and feedback on our project from Imperial College_London.
On September 5th, we did oral description about each project and actual feedback by videochat. Human practice member of Imperial College_London first asked about our project and gave advice, and KUAS also gave feedback on Imperial College_London’s project. On our concern about new variable in microbial system, Imperial College_London recommended the concept “pioneer” as a creator of nutrients. Also, like suggesting quorum sensing system which gave us fresh inspiration on detecting microorganism, Imperial College gave us good opinion on our overall project. We checked Imperial College_London’s project progress and provided some feedback. On the latter part of videochat, we talked about Imperial College_London’s team communication app & science communication guide and finished the collboration. The collaboration with Imperial College_London was really inspiring and gave us valuable learnings.

Monday, 3rd October
What a weekend! Happy and exhausted, the team have returned to London with some lucky few exploring still exploring Amsterdam while the rest of us return to lectures.
Tuesday, 4th October
There are so many things to be done. So many things we want to do. But where to start? The team started organising itself and the first few emails were sent out to arrange imaging, mass spectrometry and other experiments.
Wednesday, 5th October
Working hard
Thursday, 6th October
Still working hard
Friday, 7th October
We held a big meeting and discussed what we want to get done by the time we go to Boston. Gene Guard assembly is a big priority and we want to do some more imaging of Dendra2-expressing bacteria to see if the bacteria are metabolically active inside the roots. The modellers are keen on doing some more data fitting. Yuanwei's list of things to do on the wiki never gets smaller. It's because we love him.
There are so many things to do!

Peking
Jianzhao Yang from Peking came to Fudan University this July and had a friendly academic exchange with members of Fudan-CHINA. These two teams previously had little, but they became acquaintance after borrowing rainbow beats from one another. They scheduled an exchange on one project afterward in Shanghai. We introduces our programs to each other and took Yang to the lab and research platform where IGEM is at our school. Yang told us the method of connecting simultaneous multi-segments used by Peking University currently.

Tongji-Software
In September, we received an invitation from Tongji-Software and went to Tongji University who owns all kinds of delicate buildings. During this meetup, we realized cross-track communication. The model Tongji-Software used also included Probability Theory, sharing similarities with the Markov chain used in our main model. Inspired by them, we made some changes in terms of the probability parameters of the model, introducing some probability distribution conclusions in biochemical reactions, making the model more persuasive. After introducing the project to each other, we learned that Tongji-Software encountered some difficulties in the process of making a Wiki page. Our team member who is the computer master guided them on how to use templates, how to upload files, how to edit Web page code, and also reminded them of all the files and the external source code that needed to be uploaded to the iGEM server.
Education & Engagement
Comic: Funniest Failure Experience in your experiment
We decided to collect some interesting reasons for experiment failures and choose some of them to design a comic brochure, to add some amusement and at the same time remind everyone in the lab to be really careful and not to make mistakes during operation. Also we will distribute this brochure in our school and Giant Jamboree to get more researchers' attention in a humorous way. Luckily, we got response from iGEMers all over the world. Some of them are really miserable though bring us a lot of joy. We consider those stories lively but meaningful to all of us. Thus, thanks to our great talented drawer Hao"
Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#chassis_-_-_TEXT.html,", in front of the Duke of Toscane, the contraction of the frog’s muscle, separated from the frog with its nerve, under the action of a simple compression of the nerve. While there’s no more links between the nerve and the spinal cord, the contraction can be repeated at will. Opposing to the most widespread hypothesis, Swammerdam concluded of his experience that the muscle contraction can’t only be explained by the action of a fluid that flowed inside of the nerve, from the spinal cord to the muscle.
One of the experiences of Swammerdam on the muscle of a frog.
“If one irritates the B nerve with scissors – or with any instrument [the muscle contracts] and move the two hands that handle the tendon closer”
In one more precise version of the experiment “put the muscle in a A glass tube and pierce the tendons with two fine needle BB […] from which the tip is fixed in a piece of cork. If one’s irritates the nerve C, one can see the muscle moving the needles closer in DD; while most of the muscle becomes considerably thicker […] and blocks the tube”.
Jan Swammerdam, Biblia naturae, Leyde, 1737-1738 [manuscript from 1679]
The details and conclusions of Swammerdam’s experiments are not much diffused because, renouncing to science to focus to spirituality, he burned a part of his manuscripts. What’s left will be published half a century later, but his public demonstrations and his correspondence made his works known by European scientists.
The extreme sensitivity of the frog and the facility by which one can isolate its nerves had made it a preferred subject in the study of the nervous command. In the second part of the XVIII th century, the nerves of the frog’s tights are excited by pressure, by “irritation”, by chemical action of opium or curare, or more, by the direct use of electricity.
It is “the most delicate electrometer discovered until now” (Galvani, 1786)
The new stimulant discovered by Galvani – a distant spark – caused a general astonishment and new wave of researches.
We won’t tell here the story of the adventures that took Galvani’s frogs to the Volta battery. But, we should note that Volta joined Galvani in his praise to the precious batrachians:
“I’ve chosen the frog among any other animals, because it is gifted by a very sustainable vitality and because it is very easy to prepare it”. (Letter to Cavallo, 1793)

Introduction
What's PHA
fig1,synthetic mechanism
PHAs are the abbreviation of Polyhydroixyalkanoates, which are linear polyesters produced in nature by bacterial fermentation of sugar and lipids. They are produced by the bacteria to store carbon and energy. PHAs are also a kind of bio-plastics, which are more sustainable because they can be biodegraded in the environment a lot more faster than fossil-fuel plastics. PHBs are the abbreviation of polyhydrobutyrates ,which are a kind of polyhydroalkanoates. In our project we used the poly-3-hydroxybutyrate（P3HB）form of PHBs, which is the most common type of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesized by the gene phaC1-A-B from Ralstonia eutropha H16.
As long as we know ,there was no team succeeded in synthesizing PHAs in iGEM format before. But this year we are very excited to tell you that we made it and we are going to show it to all of you. 9/4

Human Practices 2016
Innovation in Disruptive Technologies
DNA origami is an example of disruptive technology, where innovation impacts pre existing value networks and generates a new market place. The implications behind the technology are usually broad and leads to accelerated development of varied downstream technologies. For example, the dNANO project is an application of DNA origami that aims to create standardized nano circuits which builds off the work of DNA origami. After speaking to Dr.Ferguson Pell, a biomedical engineer at the University of Alberta, adoption of these new technologies are hampered by the cost and accessibility at the time. Both these factors make early adoption of innovation unfeasible and therefore growth in these areas are likewise slow. For example, the field of synthetic biology has become a recent field exploration due to disruptive innovations in low cost sequencing and nucleotide synthesis making it economically feasible for innovators to innovate.
Our team recognized limitations which made DNA origami difficult to work with such as abberent base pair interactions, a lack of readily accessible resources, a lack of standardized documentation for structure construction and a community that is able to foster exploration with DNA origami. So we aimed to develop an open source repository for DNA origami. Open sourcing is a model in which information is able to be shared amongst a developer community composed of early adopters and enthusiasts, the benefit being knowledge spreading leading to rapid development. We then played around with the idea of sending DNA origami as a biobrick as iGEM has its own infrastructure for open source development. However, after realising the biobrick standard was incompatible with DNA origami, we decided to create our own initiative, the DNA origami library. Our tentative library would serve as a catalogue of entries for DNA origami shapes.
Each entry in the library will then contain the following:
Sequence of the template strand
Sequence of staples
An in silico visualization of the structure
A TEM of the actual structure
A detailed protocol that was utilized in the constructions. Parameters such as oligo concentrations and incubations will be some of the mandatory requirements included in each entry
Any other notes that may assist in reproducibility the structure"

Figure 9: Induction
Now the production of peptide aptamers can begin. The production is induced by Isopropyl-β-D-  thiogalactoside (IPTG), which is added to a concentration of 2 [mM]. The target concentration of product will be discussed during the   elution phase of the product recovery. The composition at start of induction and of the fermentation broth   can be viewed in table 7. It was shown that inducing in the late log phase let to  high yields of production, reducing the production phase to 4 [h]. Another benefit of the shortened residence time of the product, which reduces the risk of degradation by for example proteases. In the research paper the yield of product was reported to be   56 [mg/L] and the dry cell concentration was 92 [g/L]. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

PlcR Promoter
Through the identification of the PlcR box within the promoter of the PlcR regulon, a promoter that contains the PlcR box as well the requisite transcription-initiating landmarks within the promoter will be synthesized. Hence, any construct that is placed downstream of the promoter will be activated by the addition of exogenous PlcR and the facilitating peptide PapR. The PlcR-PapR promoter will be synthesized through primer-primer annealing and subsequent PCR elongation.
PlcR-PapR Fusion Gene
The plcR-papR fusion gene that codes for the activating peptides PlcR and PapR has been included in construct so as to amplify the initial signal presented by population 1. Since the fusion protein of PlcR and PapR is translated into its inactive form, there will be no direct self stimulatory effects within the same bacterium. Once secreted and processed, the peptides will serve to activate neighboring bacteria thus ensuring the propagation of the signal throughout the entire population.
Phage Activator
Developed by the winners of 2009 iGEM competition, Team Cambridge developed an array of activator and promoter combinations (derived from bacteriophages) that have varying degrees of binding and activating strengths. The intention was to create a library of activators and promoters than can be combined in such a way so as to vary the degree of negative feedback SpoOA exerts on the PlcR-PapR promoter. As such, several alternative endings of cassette 2 will be created, and based on experimental procedure a combination will be chosen so as to introduce an effective delay in repression. This delay is crucial so as to allow sufficient transcription of both the"

Biosafety and biosecurity concerns
Main | Preface | Methods | Introduction | Biosafety Biosecurity | Naturality and Artificiality | Practices
Conclusion | Acknowledgements | References | Appendices
In the first part of our analysis, we will focus on biosafety and biosecurity problems, a primary concern surrounding synthetic biology. Our analysis is based on the synthesis of arguments from a heterogeneous literature. Thus, as stated in the introduction, we must try to take into account the polyphony of ethical discourses. By reading these papers, we can find a homogeneous ensemble of arguments and warnings, showing that homogeneity could happen even in polyphony, when every social actor has the same interest, creating an invisible and informal consensus. We will use the evaluations of Vivagora (Vivagora), a French intellectual association that studies the stakes of biotechnologies, the ethical report Life to Lego of the Delft University of Technology (Flipse 2008) in Netherlands for IGEM 08, two monitoring strategical reports from French State (Note de veille stratégique (Suet 2009)) and the European Union (through the Synbiosafe initiative (Synbiosafe)) and the paper A Synthetic Biohazard Non-proliferation Proposal by George M. Church, professor of genetics at the Harvard Medical School (Church 2004).

As the week ended, the RX Lab Students decided to try a practice run of the plate reading of the iGEM Interlab as to hasten the process for when the real data collection was to begin.  To begin the protocol, Peter and Max ran an OD readings of the prepared culture while Jonah taught Chris and Travis how to stain the 96 well plates for the biofilm data collection.   After the OD readings were recorded, Max and Travis stayed at the lab to finish the protocol while Peter, Jonah, and Chris left for UES in order to attend Vanessa’s bioinformatics and mathematical modeling lesson.  After the cell reading Interlab protocol was completed, Max and Travis headed to UES where they met up with the rest of the team and worked on the following tasks: Chris and Peter continued working on song lyrics, Chris contacted companies, Peter worked on Chia the Chitinase and Mike the microbe, Travis began research on the resuspension protocol, concentration, and storage information for the chitinase enzyme, and Max and Jonah did more research on Cinnamaldehyde and the collaborations with fellow iGEM teams.

Another day closer to finishing their project! The LabPats arrived at the lab with the goal of being able to send their finished RhlR-iGEM plasmid with the CheZ in for sequencing. However, after checking the plates in morning, the LabPats were disappointed to find that the plates did not grow at all. Nevertheless, they decided to re-do the PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, Gel Extraction, and transformation again. After another long day, the students were able to complete the PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, and stored the gel in the fridge.

Auxotrophic Approach
BactaSun
Overview
Auxotrophic approach details
Our aim is to create a rapid UV-response system, so people can be rapidly warned of potentially harmful exposure to sunlight. For this reason, we’ve decided to work with a photocaged amino acid. One of our PIs, Professor Patrice Soumillon, has already worked with those compounds during his doctoral thesis and knows how efficiently they work. We’ve used the ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine (ONB-Tyr) for its relatively low price compared with other photocaged amino acids. The oNB cage is cleaved when exposed to UVs (312nm), and releases the tyrosine for protein synthesis (Fig 1).
Figure 1 : the photo-uncaging of the ONB-Tyr (https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/2/24/T--Aachen--onbtyrosincleavagereaction.png-modified)
We placed the ONB-Tyr inside a liquid cell culture. We studied a tyrosine auxotroph (TyrA-) E. coli strain. Those cells contain a plasmid including a gen encoding for a red fluorescent protein (RFP). This plasmid was furnished in the iGEM DNA distribution kit (BBa_K577882), developed by Boston University and Wellensly College in 2011 (Fig 2). The RFP originally comes from a coral, Discosoma striata and gives a red color.
We used a pBad promoter to induce the RPF expression with arabinose when the biomass is sufficient to produce a visible indicator.

Linear ligation of HT-1 and HT-2 fragments were conducted by using SalI restriction enzyme, yielding approximately 1954 bp complete HT BioBrick. Unfortunately, PCR amplification in the beginning using hand-made designed Fwd and Rev cloning primers could not generate specific bands (i.e. the primers anneals unspecific in various length of both HT fragments, see Collaborations page). Therefore, the gBlocks were shipped to Nanyang Technology University, Singapore (NTU-Singapore) team for ligation into pcDNA3 and pSB1C3. Our team conducted immediate transfer of complete HT BioBricks into pQE80L, while waiting for NTU finishing the cloning of the HT complete fragments into pSB1C3. The transfer of completed HT into pQE80L is shown in Figure 7 and 8, while the transfer of completed HT into pSB1C3 (done by NTU-Singapore) is shown in Figure 9.

The Interviews
In order to understand Alzheimer’s disease from multiple perspectives, the Human Practices team set out to interview experts from different backgrounds. We were able to learn about the physiological and biological aspects of Alzheimer’s disease by interviewing Dr. John Provias, Dr. Margaret Fahnestock, Dr. Ellen Ryan, and Dr. Paul Fraser. We also had the chance of interviewing people who understand Alzheimer’s disease in terms of its care and management, including clinical nurse Trish Corbett. Additionally, we spoke with Phyllis Fehr, who has Alzheimer’s disease and is an international advocate and partner in many Alzheimer’s initiatives – including the Ontario Dementia Advisory Group and the Dementia Alliance International. All together, these interviews provided us with a few main takeaways: the task of finding the cause of Alzheimer’s disease is an arduous one, and international research is uncoordinated; Alzheimer’s disease is poorly understood by the public and highly stigmatized; and appropriate care for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease is sorely lacking.
Dr. John Provias
— July 6th, 2018; McMaster University (Research stakeholder)
Alzheimer’s Disease is not due to a single, simple biological cause, but rather is the outcome of a complex system of biological hallmarks. For many decades, the Amyloid Beta hypothesis, which focuses on the amyloid beta protein, has been the most dominant approach in studying AD. Dr. Provias shared four reasons why he thought we have still yet to find a treatment for AD. First, amyloid beta, which has traditionally received the most attention, may not be the most central player in AD pathogenesis. Second, most trials were implicated in patients who were in advanced stages of AD. Third, a combination of amyloid with other factors was not considered. Lastly, study designs may have been too simplistic to study a multifaceted condition like AD. There is a huge need for AD treatment as a large proportion of the population is affected by this condition. Dr. Provias suggested it will be important to direct attention to earlier detection of the disease as that will make it easier to design a treatment.

For each of the three experiments, we will begin by inserting lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome using homologous recombination.
Week of July 16th
Overview
About half the team spent the week drafting our thesis. While some of us were writing, others were meeting with professors on campus to discuss our ideas and to pick up some S. cerevisiae strains to use as our experimental organism. We learned from Rohinton Kamakaka that we could insert Cre recombinase into our yeast using a plasmid, so now we are in pursuit of a method to both express and remove Cre recombinase once we no longer need it. Our yeast parents have been growing our Y. lipolytica and amplifying the plasmids that we have received. Our wiki boys have almost finished formatting the website to their (or our) liking and are now adding more content about our project itself. A few of our team members scheduled an interview with a representative from Family Planning 2020, but due to timing issues, had to reschedule.

This week, our team wrote a thesis! Or, more accurately, finished writing it. The majority of us put our brains together to create a draft and we chose one excellent editor to take control of the paper. She enlisted grammar police, style monitors, and LaTeX formatters to help her revise our drafted ideas into one cohesive overview of our work to-date. Each of us also wrote about our own contributions to the project and personal reflections describing our feelings towards the journey thus far.
Also, our two captains and our PI met Dean Wolf, Dean of Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Roger Trippel, Senior Director of Development and Individual Giving, and Abigail Kaun, Special Assistant to the Dean. We discussed the project to-date, our outreach efforts, and shared ideas for managing both our and future iGEM UCSC team’s funds.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html," it suffered from the same pitfalls as many other parts of the project. If there had been more time to focus on this part of our project, another strategy for the assembly could have been attempted, such as a Gibson assembly. Alternatively, the PCR could have been performed with primers amplifying the BioBrick suffix, which would have allowed to simply digest the PCR product and ligate it into a backbone without another fragment, which might have improved ligation efficacy.
Demonstrating efficient Biofilm inhibition by EB
To demonstrate inhibition by EB, a crystal violet assay was performed with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms. Since we did not know whether EB is present in the pellet or the supernatant both fractions were saved and tested in this experiment.
With those assays it has to be kept in mind that crystal violet also stains bacterial cells so that part of the effect may be due to a bacteriolytic function. Given that EB however did not show a clear halo in Kirby-Bauer test, we believe that the decrease of absorbance int he biofilm assays is in fact due to biofilm inhibition or degradation.
Biofilm Assay, First Attempt [❓]
In this first attempt of demonstrating biofilm inhibition, the bacteria were incubated for 48 hours with different volumes of cell lysate before their absorbance was measured. Protein obtained on several different days was tested but for simplicity, only part of the data is displayed.
In this assay, EB did not show strong activity. For S. aureus, the results were erratic, including the negative controls (cell lysates of untransformed BL21(DE3) cells) and are not displayed here. The tests performed on P. aeruginosa, however, indicate a possible biofilm-inhibitingactivity by the soluble fraction of our cell lysates, with an absorbance consistently below the negative controls.
Figure 15. Absorbance at 595nm after incubation of P. aeruginosa with various cell lysates. Here shown a possible biofilm-inhibiting activity by the soluble fraction.
Based on those results, we were not able to draw any kind of conclusion given that the samples seemed inconsistent and the assay had only been performed using triplicates. Biofilm assays often need to be performed with considerably more replicates since they are hard to standardise and washing steps add the danger of unintentionally detaching the biofilm.
A next assay was planned in which more replicates would be performed and the outer wells of the plate were going to be left empty since they tend to dry out after longer incubation periods. Additionally"

Figure 2: Anaerobiosis promoter characterisation in LB. The bars show standard error.
Figure 3: Anaerobiosis promoter characterisation in water. The bars show standard error.
The results in Figures 2 and 3 clearly show that the colonies that were grown anaerobically produce a lot more fluorescence than those that were grown aerobically. This suggests that the anaerobiosis promoter is regulated in a very similar fashion in both E. coli and C. freundii. It also confirms that the BioBrick functions as expected.

Plasmid construction: RecA promoter + GFP. This promoter is activated when the bacterial SOS response is needed. This response occurs when DNA damage is detected in the cell and is responsible for repairing this DNA so it can still be replicated, although the repair process is error-prone.

Colonies were picked from Citrobacter and E. coli + Bac5 plates and inoculated into LB + chloramphenicol (1 μl/ml) liquid media and grown overnight at 37°C on a shaker. The following day, the ODs were measured and a normalized amount of these cultures was used to inoculate bottles of LB + chloramphenicol. The bottles were left to grow at 37°C with shaking until the culture reached an OD of 0.15-0.25 After this, 1 ml of culture was aliquoted into cuvettes and the cuvettes were exposed to UV radiation (254 nm wavelength) at a distance of 60 cm for 20, 40 or 60 seconds (unirradiated cuvettes were used as controls). The fluorescence was measured over the course of an hour using a blue filter.
This experiment was repeated but the distance was reduced to 10 cm. Close the method.
Results
The results from the first experiment (UV exposure at 60 cm over 20, 40 or 60 seconds) can be seen in Figures 4 and 5 below.
Figure 4: Fluorescence of E. coli + Bac5 plasmid after exposure to UV (254 nm) for various periods of time at 60cm
Figure 5: Fluorescence of C. freundii + Bac5 plasmid after exposure to UV for various periods of time at 60cm
These results suggest that there is no real difference in the level of fluorescence or in the rate of increase of fluorescence of the irradiated and unirradiated cultures. This may be due to the fact that no detectable amount of DNA damage"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,": The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset & Dunlap,; 1906 1906. .  The readers became aware of unsanitary practices in the American food industry. Sinclair was considered a whistleblower, having exposed the practices of the food industry. After the act of 1906, we can observe a rise in concerns over the purity of food, which in turn lead to a focus on maintaining a certain standard in foods. Over time, this concern became the driving force behind the development of pesticides, and to a certain extent, GMO. With the introduction of these solutions to food purity, a new and opposite response could quickly be observed in the public. With pesticides and GMO, the public quickly grew concerned that food would be unnatural, and thus we can observe what is known as a reverse halo effect Konnikova M. The Psychology of Distrusting G.M.O.s. THE NEW YORKER. 2013. .  A reverse halo effect is defined by the unconscious creation of a negative assumption based on a positive evaluation. In this case, the positive evaluation, would be the ensured purity and health benefits of GMO foods, where the negative assumption would be the concerns for unnaturalness.
So we detect a tendency in the public to follow a reverse halo effect, which is most often associated with GMO foods. The problem we face today, is the continuation of this reverse halo effect, where the public would receive any GMO device negatively, simply by association to the word GMO. So how do we change this dynamic between GMO and the public?
The conclusion we reached was that in order to change a tendency in public opinion, it was important to educate the coming generations on the possibilities of GMO. Another important aspect seemed to be a general perception of GMO as an unnatural element that would harm both humans and nature alike. As such, we wanted to illustrate how GMO could be used, not to harm nature, but to help lead it towards a more sustainable future. So, we set out to teach children of all ages about GMO in general, as well as about our own PowerLeaf, to show them that this concept, which is considered to be unnatural, could actually be used to help nature.

This year iGEM did not have any enrollments from other than us who are on the team. Although it was great to all who wanted to be with, it would be nice with some more attention to the concept. Therefore we decided to do a campaign to increase interest in iGEM at university.
Collaboration With the Team from Bielefeld University, Germany
In August we visited the iGEM team from Bielefeld University. They had invited us to be a part of their Street Science, which is a common day where most of the iGEM teams from Germany get a chance to stand on the street in their city and talk to people about synthetic biology, iGEM and their projects. Street Science is a way to educate and inform the general public about iGEM. In Bielefeld, this was done with microscopes, DNA isolations from fruits, pipetting of watercolors and competitions with eppendorf tubes and pipette tips. Both their team and ours had posters of our projects as well to tell people about our ideas.
In Bielefeld we also presented our projects to each other. Afterwards we gave feedback and asked questions to help each other. We discussed many things, but some of the key points were the modeling aspect, human practices, the wiki page and last but not least, different kinds of regulations for improving GMO safety. See the pictures in our Photo Gallery! Take a look at their collaboration page here!
Scandinavian Meet-up
Uppsala University chose this year to host the first annual meeting of the iGEM teams in Scandinavia. The invited teams were, Chalmers University from Gothenburg, University of Copenhagen, our university and the university in Trondheim. We met the first weekend in September both to get to know each other better and to prepare us for Regional Jamboree. The trip was therefore both social and scientific. During the visit, we presented our projects to each other and gave feedback and criticism to help the other teams. Later we also had a visit from Herbert Boyer where we made our presentations for him, he asked us questions and helped us with our presentations.
The team from Uppsala had also planned some workshops so the teams could discuss methods and results to get a better understanding of what other teams had done in the various subjects. The subjects were: How to build your team?, Sponsoring, Keeping track of the lab & Human Practices.

Introduction
Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments. Now there is an widely accepted feature about the microtubule that microtubule has highly complicated dynamic instability. Under the fixed vitro cultures conditions, on the one hand, subunits will polymerize automatically forming the required structure when the condition is above the critical concentration; on the other hand, the microtubule will depolymerize into subunits when the condition is under the critical concentration. Apart from that, the single microtubule will always in the stage of polymerization and depolymerization.
Fig.1 Our process
Tax(Taxol), the efficient anti-cancer medicine, can promote the polymerization of the subunit and restrain the depolymerization of the microtubule, which can make the microtubule be in a stable condition and restrain the mitosis. Therefore, it’s important to study the tax’s mechanism of action during the microtubule’s dynamic assembling process. In order to research tax’s influence on this dynamic procedure from the microcosmic level, we analyze the dynamic procedure and build our mathematical model by four steps.

By constructing the F-test statistics, we can use the one-way analysis of variance to study whether classification of the independent variable’s different levels can make significant influence on the variation of the continuous variable. If the levels have a significant influence, we can further give the 95% confidence interval of the dependent variable means under the different levels of the independent variable, and then we can analyze the degree of the different levels"

Those two plasmids are not compatible. Plasmids could have different origins of replication. That might be the reason why double transformation is unsuccessful.
Our system works. Our system perfectly works, but there is some leakage in the promoter leading to the expression of I-SceI meganuclease. In such case, it very efficiently cuts I-SceI restriction site, digesting the second plasmid with ampicillin resistance.
First, we decided to check the hypothesis 1, and verify if two plasmids are compatible with each other.
Control for plasmid compatibility
As control experiment, we decided to trasform two plasmids into NEB Turbo E.Coli strain. The first plasmid in this experiment is analogous to the one from the previous experiment, but with GFP insted of I-SceI meganuclease; the second plasmid is the same as in the previous experiment:
First plasmid: Low copy plasmid with encoded generator to express GFP meganucllease. Only the version with pLac promoter was tested, because they all have the same backbone plasmid, and consequently the same replication prigin.
Backbone: pSB3C5
Resistance: Chloramphenicol
Origin of Replication: modified pMB1 derived from pUC19
Second plasmid: High copy plasmid with encoded I-SceI restriction site, K175027 .
Backbone: pSB1AK3
Resistance: Ampicillin and Kanamycin
Origin of Replication: modified pMB1 derived from pUC19
We expected to have colonies on both type of plates: firstly, on plates with one antibiotic (Chloramphenicol & Ampicillin), secondly, on plates with both antibiotics.
Our expectations became true, and our cells expressed GFP, so we conclude these two plasmids have compatible replication origins, and there should be nothing preventing the I-SceI from being expressed in the previous experiment. That means that our circuits work, but there is some leaky expression of I-SceI meganuclease that leads to a very efficient digestion of the plasmid carrying the Ampicillin antibiotic.

We eventually came to realised that we had unconsciously been considering many aspects of the S.T.I.R. process every time we made a pivot. Many of the important “decisions” that we made over the course of our project, like building a web database for co-culture experimental design, only became clear to us over time. S.T.I.R. needed to be modified to work for the team. We realised that many of the most significant decisions were made in response to problems we were facing in the lab. For example,  “There is no current database for co-culture data”, “We need a better growth regulation module”.
Therefore, we reimagined the protocol as a problem solving tool with the added benefit of including dimensions that are not normally related to the lab in the problem solving process. We defined problems as:
Any discussion where you are unsure of the outcome that will have an impact on your project
We adapted the S.T.I.R. protocol to include elements from the problem-based learning (PBL) framework. The problem-based learning framework is a student centered style of teaching.  Students learn by solving open-ended problems.  After some team discussions, we felt the modifications made reflexivity easier to employ because it became more integrated in the development of the project.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria"
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," transformed competent cells with parts from the kit distribution that would be necessary for our projects. The parts we needed were pTet (BBa_R0040), TetR (BBa_C0040), and a strong Anderson promoter (BBa_J23100). We also created stocks of the pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 backbones by amplifying the linearized DNA also provided in the kit with PCR.
Unfortunately, only the transformations of the TetR was successful. We moved on to making overnights of these cells and extracting the plasmid DNA with a miniprep kit. We checked our progress for the week by running a gel with the amplified linear backbones and digests of the transformed plasmid DNA.
And... Success!
June 5 - June 9
Our first full week and what a scramble - the new members were forced to fend for themselves as the returning ones weren’t able to come in as periodically - it’s ok though, they managed. This week we attempted transformations of the pTet and Anderson promoter parts, this time only being successful with the pTet (later on to find out that the Anderson promoter had a different antibiotic resistance than we thought). We also combined the TetR piece we had transformed last week with a double terminator piece (BBa_B0015) we had from last year.  The successfully transformed cells were prepared as overnights and then later miniprepped. We then performed a 3A assembly of the pTet piece with the TetR/Double Terminator construct, transformed into competent cells, prepared overnights, and miniprepped the DNA. We also restocked our supply of agar plates. From this week’s work we have assembled this piece:
June 12- June 16
We finally got the Anderson promoter transformed and miniprepped! We also put in a ribosome binding site (BBa_B0034) at the beginning of last week’s construct using PCR reactions with primers that included the RBS sequence and inserted the product into a pSB1A3 backbone via Gibson Assembly. However, when we tried to verify this construct (both through running a gel and sequencing) we found something had failed. Suspecting there could have been an issue with the backbone we used, we tried to make more backbone stocks (pSB1A3, pSB1C3, and pSB1K3) with PCR amplification. We also transformed more plasmids from the kits into competent cells. These parts are to be used for the metal sequestration project as"
