Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," hemolysin signal sequence.  This signal sequence tags hIL-6 to be transported out of the E. coli by the hemolysin secretion system.
Thus, in an immunosuppressive context, excess Tregs due to dysregulated Device 1 activity results in reduced 5MT.  This signals Device 2 to produce and secrete hIL-6, which polarizes CD4+ cells away from the Treg fate.
Results and Analysis
This summer, the team built three of the four device subparts, namely the SoxR/SoxS sensor, the retinoic acid generator and the 5-methyl tryptophan mutant trp sensor.  All the sensors were built with GFP downstream of the sensor itself.  As a result, only the sensing capability, that is the ability of sensor to recognize inflammation or immunosuppressive signal molecules, was tested.  Of these three device subparts, the SoxR/SoxS sensor was characterized on both a high and low copy plasmid and found to be functional.  In the section below are the graphs relating OD to time and GFP to time for the sensor on both the high and low copy vector strains.
Note on Assays
In order to characterize our device, we needed to use an inducer which imposed superoxide stress within the cell. In vivo, this stress would take the form of nitric oxide, a downstream product related to increasing levels of Th-17 cells. However, in vitro, we needed an inducer which was more suitable for us to test. Thus, we used paraquat , which causes oxidative stress in a similar manner as nitric oxide.
Low Copy SoxR/SoxS Sensor
Fig 2.3 Low Copy SoxR/SoxS Data for concentrations of 20, 40, 60 and 80 uM of inducer
Experimentation done on the low copy vector indicated that our SoxR/SoxS sensor was not only capable of  inducible GFP (or another downstream protein) production but also that the downstream production levels can be modulated through varying concentrations of inducer paraquat.  In this case, our group demonstrated that increasing the concentration of superoxide inducer paraquat increased the production of GFP as expected.  Additionally, it was noted that at higher concentrations of the inducer, the rate of change of fluorescence increased as well.
However, it is interesting to note that the induction chemical paraquat, which can be toxic to E. coli cells at large concentrations, begins to have a negative effect on the cells at"

Heisig Lab
Gudrun Melles
Gudrun is one of the technical assistants of the Prof. Heisig’s lab and was a great help during our time in the S2 lab. She knows where everything is and the best methods. Her advice was especially valuable for the toxicity tests and the work with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosas. She gave us different strains and everything else we needed to work with them. Gudrun also showed us how to identify and classify bacterial strains. For many of us it was the first time in a S2 lab and she helped us to work our way through it to get comfortable.  She tried different DNA measurement techniques with us to see if it makes a difference (not really, but it was cool to try!). Not to forget she supported us during our rushed relocation to the pharmacy after the closure of our chemistry department and run some gels for us while we did not yet have security clearance and couldn’t work.
Philipp Groth
Philipp the second (seriously, why is every man in this lab called Philipp?) is also a technical assistant and a very cool guy. He helped us during our move to the pharmacy and with any questions and help with machines. He always found solutions and lightened our mood when nothing seemed to work out the way we wanted to. In the last stage of our experiments he supervised the chemists during their kinetic measurements of the complexation without despairing.
Anna Podolska
Anna worked on the same floor where our S2 lab was and our daily contact person in the Heisig lab. She explained to us how to use the machines, made us feel welcome in the lab and was always there for us when we needed help. She really is a sweetheart!

They all helped us after our sudden move from the chemistry department to the pharmacy department after the labs had to close and made us feel welcome and part of their group. They showed us around in the new lab, taught us how to handle the higher security degree and even shared their materials with us. Without their great support, we couldn’t continue working and would have been forced to give up the project or at least lost a great amount of time. Thank you very, very"

Diagnosis, the road to proper treatment
Disclaimer: This section is to give an overview of key steps in treating snake envenomings as per recommended from [6].  This material should not be used as a replacement for actual medical advice.
Figure 1:  Logistics, aims, priorities and objectives during the Course of treatment in case of envenoming. The circles indicate the patient’s course throughout the treatment. The Upper row of boxes priorities of treatment and the lower row of boxes the actionables or special attentions that the caregiver should give to the patient in care. Recommendations summarised from [6].
Snakes Bites are divided into dry and wet bites.
Dry bites are determined to be free from envenoming. In that case,  the victim is to be given assurance by enforcing the fact that no venom has been injected.
Wet bites, however, often require antivenom treatment as outlined in figure 1.
Diagnosis is established by inquiring the conditions under which the patient was bitten and from the clinical assessment. To enable the establishment of the clinical picture, expedient transport to the local clinic has to be carried out.
In case of systemic envenoming that shuts down breathing, the patient has to be resuscitated using lung compression and oxygenation before transportation is carried out.
At the clinic:
Upon arrival at the clinic the patient is examined by inspecting the body and bite site for marked local swellings. These symptoms will indicate the nature of the envenoming and sometimes even determine the snake responsible for the envenoming as proposed in figure 2.
The snake venoms involved in the envenomings are generally classified into two categories: Cytotoxic and neurotoxic venoms. These can include both local and systemic symptoms. The symptoms of the action of the venoms can help establishing a thorough clinical diagnosis, in addition to considering under which circumstances the envenoming took place.
Neurotoxic venoms interfere with the nerve cell membrane and subsequently the systemic nervous system through disruption of normal acetylcholine signalling, causing involuntary muscle control, paralysis and numbness.
Cytotoxic venoms here are applied as an umbrella term for action that ruptures the cell membrane indiscriminately, induce blood clotting and can lead to heart beat irregularity, cardiac arrest and cause damage to key internal organs. Cytotoxins can be hemotoxins, targeting red blood cells, and mycotoxins, affecting muscle tissue and their contractions.

Gold:
Integrated Human Practices: We changed our project as needed based on the advantages and shortcomings of our project. We started the project without knowing the best delivery method for our cerastotin, but after talking to the head of the Cowley Shock Trauma Center, we changed from a gel based project, which could have entered the bloodstream and been dangerous, to a cerastotin laced bandage, which is much safer Integrated Human Practices
Improved a previous part: The clot making team improved on the project idea of the Lethbridge High School iGEM 2016 team, which had a similar idea. We added His tags to the proteins and purified them to improve the safety of the system. We also incorporated human practices and math modeling into our project Improved Part

EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the end of the day, we were convinced that cell-free biology will provide    high schools with an amazing tool to explain certain principles of biology    (eg. gene transcription, translation and regulation, transformation, cloning,    energy of a system) all in a hands-on way, while at the same time developing    an intuition for biology that students cannot get from books. The idea of our    Mini-Kit was born: A small toolbox that would enable teachers to give a live    demonstration of various biomolecular processes. An easy to handle, high-impact    collection of experiments that poses no biohazard as it doesn’t contain living    cells, perfect for explaining the concepts listed before to high school kids.    A creative and novel way to stimulate each student’s learning process. The workshop    was ideal to give us a roadmap, as a lot of technical details were discussed,    and it inspired us to take this message home and implement it in our local context.
iGEM EPFL at the Curriculum Development Workshop
The Educational Cell Free Mini Kit project
Ever since the workshop in Cambridge, iGEM EPFL 2017 aimed to difuse cell-free biology as an accessible andexciting          scientific field for the younger. Thus arose the idea of the Educational Cell Free Mini Kit (ECFK) that consists in a set of five experiments intended for demonstrations at          local high schools. Leaving a footprint after the end of the competition was also something dear to the team, who          found solace in the distribution of the minikit to several high schools in the Canton of Geneva, set in the          francophone part of Switzerland. For this purpose, we reached out to several high schools   located in regions nearby EPFL to ensure they had interests in our kit and that they would   add it to their classes. A few days later we received many encouraging responses from high school and university          professors in Geneva: François Lombard, Alexandra Suter de Iaco, Bertrand Emery and Jean-Luc Zanasco showed great          interest in the implementation of such a kit in their theoretical and practical lectures and provided us with precise          counselling on how to improve it in order to make it as accurate and suitable for high school classes as possible.          Professor at the University of Geneva and manager of the plateform BiOutils Karl Perron also shared his          enthusiastic thoughts about the project and reviewed our protocols for the minikit. As BiOutils is a platform which          takes care of the production and distribution of experiments for high schools fo the whole Canton of Geneva, we          transmitted him our will to bring cell-free biology into"

Sec Translocation Pathway
The general secretory (Sec) pathway cotranslationally translocates unfolded proteins through the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria. The protein to be exported is directly translocated from the ribosome when coupled with the ~20-base-pair signal peptide DsbA (naturally optimized for E. coli), which allows the Sec protein complex to recognize the protein of interest. The protein SecB is a chaperone that guides the protein to the signal translocase situated on the cytoplasmic membrane (SecYEG “channel-like” protein), and maintains the protein-of-interest in an unfolded state 13 . It is believed that the driving force of Sec translocation is the ATPase from the SecA component of the Sec system. A potential drawback in this pathway is the possibility of incorrect Cas9 refolding once the protein has reached the periplasm.
Tat/Sec Promiscuous Translocation
The Tat/Sec promiscuous signal sequence simultaneously utilizes the Tat and Sec mechanisms previously discussed. Select signal peptides can direct proteins to the periplasm via either the Tat or Sec systems 11 .
INP-Cas9 Protein Fusion
Protein fusions are a group of proteins directly linked to each other with peptide bonds, forming a larger protein complex. A protein fusion we have explored is the ice nucleation protein (INP) with saCas9. INP is a membrane protein that will form a peptide bond (“protein decoration”) with saCas9 14 , 15 . When the cell secretes an OMV with the INP decoration, we proposed that Cas9 would be attached to the OMV’s membrane.
Releasing Cas9-Encapsulating Vesicles
A hypervesicular strain of E. coli, JC8031, was provided to NU iGEM by the DeLisa lab at Cornell with permission from Dr. Roland Lloubes, who originally designed the strain 9 . Elevated vesiculation in JC8031 is attributed to the deletion of the lipoprotein-coding nIpI gene in E. coli. OMVs secreted from this strain are reported to be 20–200 nm in diameter.
Future Development
The next step will involve using electroporation to insert gRNA into OMVs. It has previously been shown that RNA can be electroporated into OMVs 16 .
More modifications to E. coli have been investigated, particularly related to the septic shock-inducing effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on humans 17 . It has"

Gene doping timeline
2003: Genedoping
The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) puts gene doping on the list of prohibited substances.
2004: Marathon mice
Geneticists at Howard Highes Medical Institute engineered so-called marathon mice that could run twice as far as normal mice by changing only a single gene, PPARdelta. (Wang et al. 2004)
2006: German Coach (Thomas Springstein) Suspected of Genetic Doping.
Thomas Springstein was a one-time coach of the German Athletics Association (DLV). He was convicted partly based on e-mail conversations, which were aquired by the police during a raid on his home. These e-mails brought up references to Repoxygen, a banned substance meant to be used in gene therapy to treat patients with anemia. Repoxygen helps to induce a controlled release of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance that stimulates the production of red blood cells, thereby increasing the amount of oxygen the blood can deliver to the muscles. It was under preclinical development by Oxford Biomedica as a possible treatment for anaemia but was abandoned in 2003. ( Michael Reinsch, 28 January 2006 ).
2008: Chinese Doctor Offers Gene Doping to Athletes
A German television report was brought out on the availability of gene doping in China shortly before the Beijing Olympics. In this documentary produced by ARD television, a Chinese doctor offers stem cell therapy to a reporter posing as an American swimming coach in return for $24,000, according to a translation provided by the ARD television. The documentary broadcast does not offer evidence that the hospital has provided gene doping to other athletes, but it does provide a shocking insight into the doping development scene ( NBC News 2008 ).
2010: Gene Doping Detection: Evaluation of Approach for Direct Detection of Gene Transfer using Erythropoietin as a Model System
In two mouse studies, blood was positive for a plasmid in some animals for 1–2 days and up to 1 or 4 weeks after intramuscular or intravenous administration. The sensitivity of PCR methods used in these studies was 100 or 1000 vector copies per mg of gDNA. In another study with mice injected rAAV intramuscularly, 12 whole blood samples from a high-dose group tested positive foxr viral DNA until day 28, but viral DNA in plasma was"

We clearly see band - not the best but not the worst either. The band are over 12kb according to the ladder which does not match up with the around 9102 we expected from the primer design. We rand a blast on the primers to see if there where other possible binding sites in the chromosome. No good match was found so we purified and will run the purification on a new gel.

Overview
USTCers believe that scientists must take the responsibility of science and technology propagations among the public. Our iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for the popularization of science among children in China.
This year Team USTC, along with ELA, delivered human practice activities for the public. In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, public engagement, education, biosafety, environment and society.
In our minds, human practices are not only to clarify what is our synthetic biology, what is our daily work or the common phenomenon of scientific reason, but also to take people into a more in-depth thinking.
If a human practice can encourage people to think further, lead them into a new field of scientific research, or even make they become the new scientists, the human practice would seem more precious. Human practice works can also climb up to the highest level of science hall. In fact, it reflects more scientific issues.
Poster Presentation and Survey
During the Science and Technology Week of our school, we introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to public and our schoolmates by showing posters about the iGEM projects that Team USTC had done, and we also conducted a survey about synthetic biology at the same time.
Team USTC members and Team USTC-software members worked together to give presentations to the public, including  professors, students, children and the citizens. Everyone showed great interest to our projects, and we had lots of discussions about the cutting-edge research of biology.  During the presentations, we surveyed the public about their knowledge of biological science, gene engineering, bio-safety  and in particular, synthetic biology.
Before holding the presentation, we had done a lot of research and basically"
Debrecen-Hungary,2010,Team:Debrecen-Hungary#Team meetings sum_-_-_TEXT.html,"ellow iGEM team, here is a summary of our last team meeting (30.6.10, 14:00):
1.   The following member attended the meeting: Kata S. Kata N, Timi B, Shun CL. Endre K, Ophir K, Lilla O and Balint LB.  The meeting took place from 14:00 to 15:00.
 
2. We discussed the following administrative issues (AKA agenda’s):
Feedback about working habits:
Notebooks- TDK student do not use their notebooks as       often as they should. This causes a problem in information flow,
End of the day- Students should make it a habit to       inform their team correspondent of their day’s work and it’s progression       before leaving for the day.
Meetings- The meeting delegate (lior) and the schedule       coordinator (ophir) will arrive at team meetings earlier (20 min) in aim       of better meeting organization.
Today’s work to be done was discussed (see action      items)            
Subteam’s students will have to undertake individual      responsibilities. This will promote each individual’s work quality. This      item will be expanded in the next end of week meeting. Eg. Timi from the      cloning team will be responsible for electrophoresis        
3. Action items:
A.    Change of working habits (end of day, notebook’s and pre- meetings) as described above should be undertaken by all of the TDK students
B.     Today’s wetlab work will be split into two teams:
I.                          The cloning team will make another electrophoresis to confirm the results of the maxi prep done on Monday (Kata N. and Timi B.) . An inoculation will be made from the biobrick transformation done yesterday (Ophir K., Dorka and Lior M).
II.                       The cell culturing team will do more plating, and a transfection with the plasmids isolated from the maxi prep done at the beginning of the week (Lilla, Shun, Endre, Kata S.)
III.                    A scheduale for the next week would be revealed on Friday morning on the gmail calendar, everyone should inspect it.

Nourishing Synthetic Biology in the Cradle of Culture
As the first collegiate team in Greece, we've encountered immense difficulties during our project development, as synthetic biology is dramatically underdeveloped in our country on the academic as well as the community level with public perceptions remaining in flux. For our outreach vision, we’ve zeroed in on two goals: - spark interdisciplinary student innovation intertwined with ethical debating around the world - expand public awareness regarding synthetic biology applications on human health, on a global scale by using intuitive learning methods and visual narratology principles We initiated four parallel campaigns, for the aforementioned goals:
PROMOTING YOUTH EDUCATION
Oxynous Theme Interactive Workshop
Oxynous Theme is an exciting educational initiative for High School students, with the goal to encompass student interests regarding scientific programs not limited to the curriculum. We were excited to be invited by Mr. Dimitris Siapkas, to present our work in a simplistic manner to a inhomogeneous group of students aged 14-18. We informed the students about the field of Synthetic Biology, its potential applications, our own project and the advancement that we already made towards achieving our goals. Through gamified activities, we explained the main sub-projects of the wet and dry lab and showcased quorum sensing using party favor noise makers (inspired by the “Quorum Sensing Activity” of the MIT/HHMI Teachers’ Workshop 2011) and an electrical circuit that simulates our RNAi classifier’s function, by using simple logic gates and LEDs. After the main event, we discussed with the students about our engagement with the project, decision making and problem-handling. The students also provided us with feedback on our presentation and on their understanding of Synthetic Biology, by filling a survey. Our most valuable feedback was that they increased their Synthetic Biology knowledge, however they also expressed their wish to participate and/or organise independent student-run research projects.
Everyone was enthusiastic about the experience and we were more than happy to take part in such an event, that introduces the students to a fresh mindset, that of a team-oriented"

Obtained confirmation of the molecular targets for our project: Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
A handshake with our President
All these opportunities to learn about air pollution and get feedback from experts of various fields nourished a constant reassessment of our project. Aether wouldn’t be the same without the people we met.
A global questionnaire
How is the air pollution issue perceived by citizens, and what potential solutions could be considered?
We conceived a survey in order to grasp the public’s knowledge about air pollution, and the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, for which we received more than 2 300 responses worldwide. We obtained 1 874 answers from Europe, 213 from Asia, 97 from North America, 71 from Africa, 24 from South America and 9 from Oceania.
The aim was to better understand the expectations of people regarding air pollution, and if the idea of using synthetic biology as a solution was well perceived and accepted. Another purpose for this survey, was to teach people and sensitize them on the subjects of synthetic biology and air pollution.
Design of survey
We separated the questionnaire into three sections: the first part collected information about the participant's profile; the second asked the participant about his knowledge of the different pollutants and sources of air pollution and the impact, if there is one, of this disaster on their everyday life; measures that they take to protect themselves or expectations on protection from it by authorities; the third part focused on synthetic biology, its perception by the general public, and its potential usefulness to find a solution based on this field of biology.
Spread of the survey
We used the following method to spread the questionnaire around the world:
We began by sharing the questionnaire on social networks (Facebook, Twitter), but we soon realized that this method would be insufficient to obtain broader representative results from our own social perimeter: friends and similarly trained science students. Indeed, after 500 responses, 90% were from people between 18 to 26 years old, in Europe.
Therefore, we changed our approach. We contacted French embassies in 40 countries around the world, and several of them (including Russia, Japan, Canada, US, New Zealand, etc.) shared our questionnaire on their social networks. We also spread the questionnaire through the alumni networks of our Universities. Finally, we distributed the questionnaire in several companies through our friends abroad and our families.
Participants profile
We obtained the following profiles for our participants:

Collaboration
☁ Southwest Union
As the ""Southwest Union"" (iGEM team in Southwest China exchange seminar, UESTC-China) founder, we actively participate in mutual exchanges and academic discussions on a yearly basis and meet with other research teams in the region so as to seeking for new cooperation and breakthroughs.
☁ CCiC
This year we have also participated in the CCIC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee), and communicated with other iGEM teams from all over China.
☁ Peshawar University
We received mails from the Peshawar University team in Pakistan, and learned that their project also dealt with pollutants. We communicate through internet in order to keep track of each other's progress and difficulties during the project, and offer inspiration to each other.
Demonstrate our project
More often than not, UESTC-China iGEMers are asked a question: what do you do? After explained to some of our friends several times, we found that one single sentence can’t clearly show the significance of our project. So we recorded a music video called Believer, to better elaborate on our projects and teams. Our MV has gotten more than 1000 hits on video websites.

Ms. Liu taught us plenty of tricks and tips for doing safe and effective lab work, and helped debug the experiment procedures when things go wrong. When our transformations were unsuccessful, she looked at the protocols we use carefully, compared them to what she normally used, and pointed out steps that might require modification. She taught us how we can contact biotech companies, purchase the right reagents, and send in samples for sequencing. She and Mr. Nian took turns to supervise us in the labs. When building our hardware, she helped find all the necessary materials from different labs in our school.
Other Teams and Organizations:
Peking University
Yihao Zhang, instructor of the Peking iGEM team, invited us to synthetic biology course in Peking University. He provided us with tutorship in forming possible project ideas (for instance, he encouraged us to think about fun and applicable topics). Then, he and Dr. Xuan Wang assessed the quality of our initial project idea regarding surfactin. He identified an unrealistic project goal:  applying CRISPRa to our chassis. He also helped us connect with the entrepreneurs in Bluepha. During the InterLab, Peking University team provided us with the transformed bacteria, and instructed us on how to perform the study.
SDSZ-China
They kindly provided us with seven gene parts when our distribution kit was temporarily unavailable.
Lab of Dr. Tao Chen, Tianjin
They supplied our Bacillus subtilis 168, and provided us with transformation protocols.
Bluepha
They kindly showed us their wonderful lab, and provided an opportunity to communicate with the SHSBNU team. Dr. Xuan Wang provided us biological parts from the distribution kits in the previous years.
UCAS
They have also provided us with a biological part from distribution kits in the previous years.
We have also collaborated with many other teams, where we helped each other. For information on our collaboration efforts, see: https://2017.igem.org/Team:RDFZ-China/Collaboration
Team Oxford
Their dry lab coordinators, Chun Ngai Au and Helen Ren, kindly provided help in modeling. They wrote a document about how to create ODE(ordinary differential equation) functions to analyze pathways inside the cell. Besides, they answered many questions related to this through communication with Zeyu Tang by e-mail"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," amount of oil. As a result, the product can merely solve the problem of sugar content, but it still makes users ingest even more harmful substances by changing their attitude. 
Leona Sun :
I do not agree with it. The above referred preventing sugar as the clearest solution to avoiding obesity, so there are two ways to reach this goal--not to eat sugar or utilizing the transgenic bacteria. Why do we have to spend so much time on creating special bacteria when we already have a direct and easy way, which is to consume less sugar? Isn't this holding a candle to the sun and what we got eventually is the same outcome as the former?
   
 Next, if we no longer suffer from obesity due to consuming sugar, then everyone will consume sugar unrestrained. Think about this, we may be able to eat a lot of sugar without gaining weight, but what is the benefit for human beings on general? Isn't embracing our own desires without any negative effects going to facilitate more desires?  We all know that smoking may lead to lung cancer, and drinking too much can lead to Gastric Ulcer. So does it mean that we are going to fulfill all our desires blindly by creating more transgenic bacteria? 
             
  Furthermore, the ones who are now wealthy enough to eat sugar will as a matter of course consume huge amount of sugar without worry after the commercialization of this bacteria. It indeed will boost the dessert and food industry, becoming a great benefit for countries producing sugar. However, we should also be aware of the labors that might be exploited under the progression of sugar industry. I mean stories of child labors at Ivory Coast being exploited aren't uncommon. Plus that erecting laws and restrainments to stop these sad stories from happening takes long time. It will inevitably cause great impact on these labors.
                  
  To conclude, I reckon that the transgenic bacteria may be useful on medical perspective, but it may not act the same way when it comes to the cultural side, suffice to say that there are a few nomadic people who view being plump as beauty. I would like to share a story with you  related to what I've just said: When expertises from Taiwan come to aid of several african countries in order to improve their  agricultural condition, it doesn't really help much, because most meetings are for men only owing to their tradition, but the ones that do agricultural work are actually women. This prove that what we think are great for the world may not be that great in reality.

1 SFLS
We met the Shenzhen Foreign Language School IGEM team at the Shenzhen IGEMers meet-up and presented our projects to each other. Both teams applied CRISPR system in the projects, so we contacted the SFLS team and hoped to receive some insights on how to model our project. The modeling process was arduous, but we helped each other out and got satisfying results. At times, their projects were facing a crucial problem of off-target effects, and after comparing several articles on predicting off-target effects in mathematical ways, we recommended them a better method named ""Cutting Frequency Determination (CFD) scoring method"" to help improve their model. We also supported their modeling group by introducing biological theory to the math-work members. In addition to modeling, we also engaged with them on safety and integrated human practice. We shot a BSL videos: SFLS provided the Chinese scripts and edited the videos while BGIC-Union provided the English scripts and resources for the content of the footage. The video was posted on bilibili .The SFLS team also kindly offered us the chance to join them in the several lectures educating high school and primary school students on synthetic biology, cancer and CRISPR, and was able to present our project to more promising teenagers that may become future IGEMers and contribute to the synthetic biology community. See human practice session for more info.
We appreciated the responsible and capable members from Shenzhen Foreign Language School () and the constructive help they offered very much. And we were glad to be able to help them with uploading the wiki and answered some questions on the details of the competition such as poster design and plasmids drying and delivering.

Foodborne diseases are often detected in undercooked meat, raw milk, and raw produce. In these scenarios, these pathogens may be unknowingly and exponentially spread throughout the food chain. In the food industry, it is important to prioritize food hygiene and prevent the sale of contaminated food to potential buyers. Our device is well-suited as a surveillance method for food vendors, ranging from small-scale individual sellers at traditional markets to large-scale supermarkets selling meat and produce as well as cooked food. Its rapid and easy method allows users from all kinds of background to interpret its results and discard the contaminated food accordingly. This device offers a simple solution to easily prevent and stem outbreaks.
As a proof of concept, we have acquired specific amplification of the target gene rfbE specific to STEC O157:H7 by using four LAMP primers, rather than the usual pair of primers in PCR. In the future, the LAMP primers can be designed to target the Shiga toxin stx1 and stx2 gene as well, which we deliberately chose to exclude in this project due to our consideration of the iGEM safety standards and of the health standards in the United Arab Emirates. We have also shown that our device is able to detect other pathogens by testing our device for the detection of malaria by targeting the Plasmodium falciparum mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene. The versatility of the technique and the design of the device allows for a broad range of diagnostic uses.
By using a 12.5µL total reaction volume, we have shown that our lower limit of detection is 106 cells/mL. Improved limit of detection can also be attained by using a 25µL reaction volume. Additionally, our device only requires a swab of the food sample to attain such sensitivity.
Another major concern for most diagnostic methods is the high cost per use. Problems arise when a device is accurate but expensive to use or, inversely, cost-effective but not reliable. We aim to solve both problems by bringing the"

Ligations
HO-pcyA, ompR, CDF
All three ligations yielded >50 colonies on the TOP10 cell plate with a 5 minute ligation in all combinations (HO-pcyA and ompR with P1 and old P3; CDF with P3). The P90 (CDF+P3) did not fluoresce. The DH5α cells did not have nearly as many (<5) and ligation times (10min, 30 min) did not appear to be significant.
Colony PCR 8-6
We picked at least 18 colonies from each ligation set, patched a master plate, inoculated liquid cultures, and performed 12.5 μL colony PCR reactions. The BBp/sfx primer pair was used, annealing temperature was 50°C for first 10 cycles and 54°C for rest of the cycles. 2 controls were performed: one using a picked P20 colony, and another with miniprepped P20 plasmid.

The PYY 3-36 Module
     The first module is a simple means for  generating the peptide of interest.  A  Biobrick protein coding sequence encoding PYY3-36 is inserted into  an translational unit.  A constituatively  expressed promoter (the team selected J23102 for its high RPU) and a ribosome  binding site (B0034) are placed upstream of the coding region (K373000),  triggering the transcription of PYY3-36.  A double terminator  (B0015) signals the end ofthe sequence.  This module is as fundamental as possible,  ensuring consistent expression of the target protein while allowing for  interchangeability with other peptides without affecting the operation of the  second module in the genetic circuit.
 
The Population Control Module
     The second molecule of the genetic  circuit is intended to regulate the expression of PYY3-36 .  Overproduction of the peptide needs to be  prevented.  To accomplish this goal, the  team chose to couple cell death with a quorum sensing system.  The module is divided into two parts.  In the first part, a promoter and ribosome  binding site are inserted upstream of an AHL coding sequence (F1610).  Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) is  expressed.  This molecule serves as an  inter-cellular message system, diffusing through the cell membrane along  concentration gradients and giving each cell a basic means of detecting its  colony's size/condition.   Quorum sensing  of the AHL molecule allows a cap to be placed on the population size of the  engineered E.coli colony by enforcing cell death once the colony has  reached a sufficient size.  This is  accomplished by way of the second part of the Population Control module.
     A cell-signaling promoter (F2620)  specifically active in the presence of AHL begins transcription.  Then a sensitivity tuner is inserted into the  circuit.  This component acts as a  precision activation mechanism, a gateway that allows downstream transcription  only if the Polymerase per Second (PoPS) input falls within a specific  range.  Any of the various sensitivity  tuners developed by Cambridge 2009   (K274370-K274395) can be integrated into our device to achieve the  desired result, population capping, and variation of which tuner is used will  yield different limits.  The higher the"

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Modelling#Gold Recovery_-_-_TEXT.html,"elftibactin titer of 61 mmol/L) is the cost we will assume in the next section.
Cost estimation for whole procedure
Having estimated the cost for produced delftibactin, it is now possible to also calculate the cost for the whole gold recovery process. Similarly, to the cost calculation for the gold procedure and using the aforementioned costs for aqua regia and NaOH, we calculated that for recovery of 1 mol Gold approximately 5 Euros are required in addition to the necessary delftibactin. Under the assumptions that 1 molecule of delftibactin binds and reduces exactly one gold ion, one can then quickly calculate the cost for the whole process (175.5 Euros for 1 mol Deftibactin, hence 180.5 Euros total per mol Gold). The current gold price, as well as the price for recovery from electronic trash with the different methods has been summarized in the table below.
Gold price
6828.9  € per mol
Chemical gold recovery cost
176.8 € per mol
Delftibactin gold recovery cost
180.5 € per mol
In summary, our engineered bacteria, assuming optimality of delftibactin production and a laboratory scale bioreactor can recover gold from trash at similar costs with state of the arts methods and significantly cheaper compared to gold price.
Discussion
Proposed workflow
In order to recover metals from electronic waste, several different methods have been developed and are industrially utilized. In some of the common processes, the trash is incinerated, thus releasing toxic dioxins [15]. Pyrometallurgical processing, based on smelting, is a very common process, but also one that is often considered to be non-selective, requiring huge energy inputs and releasing harmful products in an uncontrolled manner [16].
Another commonly used method is hydrometallurgical processing, in which diverse chemicals are used for the leaching of the trash in order to dissolve the metals in aqueous solutions. Traditionally, cyanide has been used , but due to environmental accidents, it is increasingly avoided [17]. Still, the hydrometallurgical method is often considered to be highly selective and have to have a good recovery of gold.
Aqua regia used in our proposed pipeline also falls into the category of hydrometallurgy associated chemicals. Note that aqua regia is not necessarily the best choice of leaching agent to be used at industrial scale, because of the high cost of the necessary equipment"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," than one or expand the detection to any toxic Shiga producing strains?
In addition to searching for a pathogenic E. coli marker, we also started working on the TALE sequence and its construction. The TALE sequence chosen has a truncation in both N and C terminus. The truncated N terminus has 111 residues and the C terminus has 42 residues (Meckler et al., 2013). The sequence was codon optimized for E.coli. NEBCutter 2.0 was used to screen restriction sites for PstI, EcoRI, NotI, XbaI, SpeI, NgoMIV and AgeI, all present in the RFC 25. Cut sites for BsaI and Esp3I were also removed to pave the road for Golden Gate Assembly method. The original TALE sequence has 11 cut sites: BsaI (3), PstI (1), EcoRI (1), Esp3I (4), and AgeI (2). The restriction sites were then eliminated with silent mutations, based on a E. coli codon usage table (San Diego State University, 2012 modified from Maloy et al., 1996).
The large size of the TALE prevents simple cloning, therefore we looked to Golden Gate Assembly. Golden Gate Assembly is a subcloning strategy that uses type II restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence allowing ligation into a final product that lacks any specific scar sites (Engler et al., 2008).
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
This week was also mostly spent on literature research.
The next step after optimization of TALEs and their target sequence is to locate this system’s niche in the beef industry. Many of the current high fidelity methods for pathogenic E. coli detection require cell cultures, which increases turnaround time up to 4 days (Blais et al., 2012 & Gill et al., 2013).
A paper by Jeon et al. (2013) explores the genetic and physiological effects of the cattle on the amount of the O157:H7 E. coli it excretes. According to this paper, 90% of the bacteria excreted from the cattle comes from the super-shedders. Super-shedders are cattle that excrete more than 10 000 CFU/g and have long term recto anal junction colonization. Higher excretion is detected in bulls, pen raised cattle, and certain breeds with a seasonal peak between late spring and early fall. Preharvest detection of pathogenic E."

Very few additions to the wiki today, mainly due to a boomerang session held by our personal Crocodile Dundee (Professor Forster).
July 24, 2012
Finally got the contact form up and running. However, the host only allows for 20 submissions a month but hopefully that will do for now. I also altered the size of the link menu, added a Tweet-button and changed the Home -button into this icon:

Collaborations
Engaging Experts
High impact projects with consequences affecting whole humanity should always be discussed with professionals with different scientific backgrounds. To meet this goal we talked to theologists, legal professionals, safety representatives, astrophysicist, and experts in the field of medicine, agriculture, information technology and many more. Check out the professionals who shaped our project!
Expert Interviews
Safety
Although phages are volatile and challenging to work with, it is feasible to handle them safely provided that they are handled with good laboratory practice and great awareness. To do so, we informed ourselves about environmental and personal protection measures and created special phage-spaces in the lab to reduce contamination risk.
Safety and Security
Education
Arousing interest of young people to shape the next generation of scientists is a core mission of our Human Practice activities. Wa gave an iGEM seminar at a local high school and hosted a school class from Berlin for a course on responsible genetic engineering in our lab. On top, we educated a high school student  for a two weeks internship at our lab.
Education
Public Engagement
The iGEM competition inspired us to reach out, listen, talk and engage with the public. In this spirit, we hosted an inspiring public lecture by Kevin Esvelt, went to TEDx Heidelberg and engaged with the people via our game “evolutionary wheel-of-fortune” and our “Synthetic Biology Wishing Box”. Finally, we created an animated video, explaining evolution and our project in a broadly comprehensible way.
Public Engagement
Responsibility
Developing and improving powerful and high impact techniques in the field of directed evolution requires responsible scientists. To encounter ethical concerns and ensure that our project is not endangering the environment or humanity we thoroughly confronted ourselves and experts with critical questions according our iGEM project.

Restriction digest of PUC19 and the photosensor in pKJ606 with Nde1
Start date: 2/08   End date: 2/08
Methods: Restriction digest, gel electrophoresis
Protocol: RD1.1
Experiment done by: LC
Notes: Since all PCR attempts with VF2 and VR had failed until now, we wanted to see if there was an insert at all in the physical DNA we received. Therefore we cut PUC19 and the photosensor to compare their lengths to each other, since the photosensor should be longer than PUC19 uncut and the cut photosensor should consist of two pieces, a 900 - 1000 BP piece and a 3600 BP piece.

3: Photosensor uncut
4: Photosensor cut
Results:
Analysis:
We can clearly see that the photosensor uncut is longer than the uncut PUC19. We can also see multiple bands on the cut photosensor, which are the expected lengths. This indicates that the photosensor gene should be inserted between VF2 and VR, so we are still unsure why the PCR is not working.

Exopolysaccharides and Lysostaphin
Key Achievements
Assembly and expression
Testing of bactericidal activity on E.coli and S.aureus
Testing of biofilm-dispersing activity
After initial formation, when the biofilm enters the maturation phase of development, intercellular aggregation initiates the formation of the 3D biofilm structure, characterized by cell ‘towers’ equipped with fluid-filled channels.
In staphylococci, these structures are predominantly supported by an intricate network of beta-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) and other polymers including teichoic acids. These exopolymers are partially de-acetylated which generates a positive charge on the network. Since cell surfaces are naturally negative in charge, the electrostatic interaction between the cells and the exopolymers reinforces the build-up of the biofilm structure. [14]
A strategy to disrupt the formation of biofilm would be to eradicate the production of S. aureus mediated PNAG exopolymers. Hence, to perform this particular action we chose lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase, as one of our combat proteins.
As a Gram positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus is encapsulated by a thick layer of peptidoglycan. Lysostaphin works by degrading this peptidoglycan layer which in turn results in cell lysis and death. [15] According to Sabala et al [16] , lysostaphin achieves this by cleaving the pentaglycine bridge cross-linking the parallel stems of the peptidoglycan polymers.
Figure 2: Cleavage site of lysostaphin, modified from Sabala et al [16]
In order to manipulate and express lysostaphin in this project, we used an existing Biobrick, BBa_K748002. This truncated and mature form of lysostaphin was first developed by Team HIT-Harbin in 2012. With its specific-target mechanism as well as its relatively small size, lysostaphin can potentially be conjugated to spider silk as a combat protein to treat S"

Imagine a situation like this: team members are working together and need to search for bio-bricks. Once one member receives the result, others will be able to scan the QR code and view the details about the bio-bricks. Besides, the QR code also works as a syncing tool. Since we had cooperation with team SKLBC-GDSYZX, we allow the Forum users to scan the QR code pop up automatically in the “Favorite” section of SKLBC-GDSYZX’s website and sync their marked bio-bricks data to the website.

NTHU_Formosa,2018,Team:NTHU Formosa#Human Practices-test_-_-_TEXT.html," Why watch?
It’s true that watch is not the only available option for bioluminescence detecting devices.As Singular Wings Medical suggested,manufacturing a portable handy bioluminescence detector for our project is a way easier approach than trying to alter current smartwatches or come up with new brand of watch to compete with the existing smartwatches on the market.
We totally agree that, at the developing stage of a company, launching a portable device instead of smartwatch will become great help to the company’s finance. However, the idea of BioWatcher was partly inspired by smartwatches and we are still aiming at this incredibly huge wearable markets. According to International Data Corporation (IDC), PMR and Gartner, in 2017 alone, there are 121.7 million shipments in wearable market, in which smartwatches took up half of the shipments. The predicted 2017-2021 CAGR of smartwatches and wristband combined is up to 24.9%, while their predicted 2021 market share is 89.7%, the highest among all wearables. ""Smartwatches are on pace to achieve the greatest revenue potential among all wearables through 2021, reaching $17.4 billion,"" said Angela McIntyre, research director at Gartner.
All in all, we are targeting a vast market and, hopefully, we can bring BioWatcher to the real life.
Being a successful startup owner, the manager of Singular Wing Medical, Mr. Lee, generously share his experience in starting a company. Transforming lab experiments into real product need to take up dozens of years. Even after we overcome all the biotechnology and ethic issues, hardware development will spend us quite awhile.
Therefore, he encouraged us to make plans gradually-- before our whole non-invasive real-time report blood test system become mature, we can take a step back by developing an improved and optimized blood test system and devices in the current diagnostic industry, such as micro-measurements or electrochemistry approach, to support the startup when developing our ultimate goal—BioWatcher.
We greatly appreciated this chance to learn a lot about the experience from a successful senior and we hope to have more discussion and mentor in terms of entrepreneurship.
Presentation skill is one of the most crucial parts of promoting ideas and attracting corporate sponsors. Before the meeting ended, the importance of delivering a good presentation is emphasized many times. Singular Wings Medical pinpointed the weak point of our presentation and devoted a great deal of time carefully teaching us how to make a brief persuasive pitch that catches the listeners’ attention.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," use calcium citrate which is physiologically compatible and has a relatively high solubility. Physiological compatibility was important because we didn't want anything that could potentially harm our bacteria. Unfortunately, the pills contained a lot of filler, therefore we had to crush several  pills before we got the desired concentration of calcium. The calcium solution made using the pills was cloudy and contained a lot of debris. Transformation with this solution was successfully but had very low efficiency. We tried again, but this time we centrifuged the solution in order to obtain a clear solution.
We performed our experiment with 4 different concentrations of calcium from the calcium citrate tablets (5mM, 10mM, 50mM, 100mM). For our positive control we used 50mM calcium chloride. We followed the protocol we use in our lab to make competent cells, this protocol is available under “general protocols.”
Below are three photos of three different treatments of E. coli to produce competent cells. We tested competency by transforming with RFP (BBa_J04450) , which yields red cells. The positive control/standard (50mM calcium chloride) showed efficient transformation, which was replicated in the 50mM calcium-citrate treatment. For comparison, the 10mM calcium-citrate treatment yielded only a few colonies, though they were not red. Based on the results from this experiment and from our previous attempt, we're confident that this method has potential. Ampicillin-resistance was used as a selection marker, the plasmids containing RFP also contained a gene for Amp-resistance. The lack of red colonies does not necessarily indicate a lack of transformation, since cells were still able to grow, chances are that they did not express the somewhat toxic RFP.
We believe this protocol is cost effective, as the calcium citrate tablets cost us approximately $0.21. We submitted our data to the University of Columbia ‘s iGEM team and received  a collaboration sticker. The winner will be announced in Boston, we can’t wait to see what other teams came up with!

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," maybe. There is a lag between research and regulations. This lag must not get too big. For glowing pets, perhaps they don't mind, but suppose a modification made them suffer?
[Note: glowing pets really exist, e.g. GloFish .]
Fionn asked whether regulation hindered research and the growth of synthetic biology.
Nicolas said regulations must strike the right balance. It is a very difficult balance. Furthermore, because regulations differ from country to country, research that is banned in one country will occur in others. He said that, for the sake of being able to combat bioterrorism and other problems, its best for a country to be at the leading edge of the research.
Yassen asked about the effect commercialisation has on science.
Nicolas said commercial potential leads naturally to an influx of funding, which is good.
He mentioned the conflict between ""open source"" approaches and patented approaches. Patents might block people from doing certain things. Again a balance is needed. Things must be commercialisable so that funding comes in. But people must not be allowed to just patent everything.
Fionn asked whether the motives of science become skewed due to commercialisation.
Nicolas said no. While commercialisation can lead to science becoming more focused on certain things (i.e. not researching interesting side projects) this focus can be helpful.
Yassen asked what (in general) would solve the world's environmental problems.
From an industrial point of view, the planning of industrial processes is important: knowing what waste to expect, for example. He said biological processes might help reduce the footprint of certain industries, using less energy or producing less waste.
Fionn mentioned that early attempts at making genetically modified foods produced a bad public reaction, due to companies mishandling things.
Nicolas said that there had been miscommunication and misunderstanding between industry and the public. This inhibited the development of GM in Europe. The good news about synthetic biology is that social scientists have been involved, thinking about the larger implications of synthetic biology, so hopefully the communication with the public has been, and will be, better.
Yassen asked what advice Nicolas would give to future synthetic biologists.
Nicolas said we should not lose our ethical perspective, but must balance it with thoughts about commercial potential.
Yassen asked how hard it would be, practically, to start a biorefinery in Scotland.
He said investors would only be interested if there was a new, outstanding process. Then perhaps venture capital funding would be forthcoming. Another option would be to partner with an industrial group. But it depends on how revolutionary the technology is.

All constructs were cultivated under the same conditions as described under Cultivations . BPA concentrations were measured using HPLC . Figure 11 shows the percentage of BPA degraded in 24 h of cultivation and the specific BPA degradation rate calculated with the regular model and in the case of <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> with the model for the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB .
Figure 11: Results of the BPA degradation experiments with BBa_K525511 , <partinfo>K525515</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525551</partinfo>, BBa_K525580 and <partinfo>K525560</partinfo> and the corresponding specific BPA degradation rates calculated with the model. The construct consisting only of BisdA shows no degradation activity as confirmed by LC-MS (the bar in the chart is within the margin of measurement error), which was expected since BisdA alone can't facilitate the degradation of BPA. In comparison the fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB degraded BPA considerably more efficent than the polycistronic construct, indicating that the fusing of the two proteins improved its activity. Regarding the constructs containing FNR the completely polycistronic construct lags distinctively behind the other two constructs. Again, the fusion of the BisdA and BisdB proteins improved the BPA degradation activity. Using the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB we measured the highest maximal specific BPA degradation rate of all constructs. Allthough it has to be taken into account, that a different model had to be used for this particular construct.
We are especially impressed that the fusion protein of FNR, BisdA and BisdB (<partinfo>K525560</partinfo>) not only was capable to degrade BPA but also was the fastest construct we employed. This also contributes to the feasibility of our approach for a cell free BPA biosensor since in a cell free environment fusion proteins are beneficial when compared to their non-fused counterparts.

When Varroa mites invade, the amount of BeeT present at larvae is saved for each invading Varroa mite in the variable BeeTLarvaeInvasion. Whenever a Varroa mite emerges from a cell its mortality is calculated based on BeeTcell, which is dependent on BeeTLarvaeInvasion. The total amount of BeeT moving to larvae is based on the amount of sugar water and pollen consumed by larvae. If BeeT is consumed by worker bees it is considered lost and is removed from the BeeT in-hive store.
All variables added to beehave can be found below, including how they are calculated, if applicable what their initial value is, units, in what procedure they are used, and any comments or references. The original variables of the beehave model can be found here .

Furthermore, some interesting guest speakers were present: Hyan Youk gave a very clear and inspiring talk about how he uses synthetic biology in his research to understand basic science. Rob Smith told us some things about reverse design and how this is useful in research.
We also participated in a short workshop ""Change of Perspective"", a discussion about the stakeholders of our projects. We had an interesting discussion with some team members from the team of TU Delft, they asked us some questions about what our gel could do eventually and also why people would use our gel instead of buying one from a chemical supplier.
European iGEM meet-up
07-07-2017
The iGEM team from Delft organized a European meetup, teams were present from all over Europe. On this day we started with some interesting talks. Cees Dekker started off with a presentation about synthetic biology and some hot topics in the field, like DNA origami. He also gave us some insights in his own research: synthetic cell division. Denis Murphy stressed us the importance of big data and how reliable knowledge and wisdom can be extracted from this. Finally Dirk Stemering had a more interactive talk about responsible research and innovation and asked how the iGEM teams present were incorporating societal embedding in their project.
After the break it was time for the poster session. The poster presentations were a good opportunity for us to practice our story and we noticed that our story was a whole lot clearer compared to the previous meetup. It was also very interesting to see the posters of other European teams and to see their projects.
TUe Information Days: Explaining and Discussing GMOs
17&18-03-17, 20&21-10-17
Four times a year, the TUe organizes Information Days for high school students who want to find out more about the Bachelor’s programs or about the student life in Eindhoven. Besides finding out more about the programs at the TUe, the high school students also have the opportunity to see what possibilities there are outside the regular program, like joining a student team.
We as an iGEM team had prepared some questions for the students-to-be and their parents about synthetic biology, to start a bit of a discussion about GMOs. During these discussions we noticed that a lot of people do not really know what a Genetically Modified Organism actually means. In first instance, a lot of people think about the danger accompanied with the the genetically modified. But, after we talked with them about the opportunities and applications of GMOs, most people became less sceptical about it. Furthermore, after"

After this the mixture was placed in the -20C freezer for use tomorrow.
In the meantime, 0.8% agarose gel was prepared in the usual way and poured into the gel tray. The only difference between this gel and others previously poured is that some of the comb was taped so that the wells formed were larger. Once the gel had set, 1xTAE buffer was sprinkled onto the surface and the gel wrapped up in cling film. The gel was placed in the fridge also for use tomorrow.

That is, if he's not doing some sort of studying or training for a triathlon.  This guy is the real deal when it comes to synthetic biology.  Just by looking at a bacteria, he can make any genetic modifications he wants.  Of course this wouldn't be fair for the iGEM competition, so he did it the old fashioned way this time.  Hailing from Spokane, WA, he takes the life head on and WINS.
Cameron Sargent
A sneak peak at the manuscript from the biography of Cameron Sargent, the latest work of Dr. Seuss (coming soon to bookstores worldwide):
Cameron likes syn-bio, but that is not all. He likes to play sports, sports like basketball.
He likes playing football and lifting weights too, in his free time that’s what he will do.
He’s traveled afar to places so cool you’d read about them in your textbooks at school.
He loves being an uncle and spending his time tucking nieces and nephews in at bedtime.
Cameron likes syn-bio, yes sir that is true. He likes to think of the things it can do.
Can it clean messes up? Can it strengthen your chair? Can it make things grow back, like an old bald man’s hair?
Can it do all these things and many things more? Cameron thinks so. Cameron thinks it’s a door.
But where does it lead when that door you go through? Let BYU’s iGEM project show you.
Cam Zenger
Cameron Zenger, also known as the better Cameron on the BYU Provo iGEM team, heralds from both Boston and New York City, depending on who’s asking. He grew up in Boston however, so is a lifelong Red Sox, Celtics, and Patriots fan. He attended Roxbury Latin (The One True School). He is a Microbiology major who is planning on Medical School. Other interests include skiing, Tanner’s personal life, and N. multiformis.

Gestion de Projet
Organiser au mieux notre projet  a été notre tout premier objectif. Définir l’ordonnancement des tâches à accomplir a été nécessaire pour élaborer au mieux notre projet dans les meilleurs délais, au meilleur coût  tout en tenant compte des contraintes imposées par le concours.
C’est pourquoi, il nous a fallu :
Planifier : pour déterminer les différentes opérations à réaliser, les dates correspondantes, et les moyens matériels et humains à y affecter.
Exécuter : en mettant en œuvre des différentes opérations définies dans la phase de planification.
Contrôler : en effectuant une comparaison entre planification et exécution au niveau des dates de réalisation.
Pour ce faire, chaque manager a assuré et contrôlé la coordination des acteurs et des tâches dans un souci d'efficacité et de rentabilité en fonction des délais grâce à l’élaboration de plannings de Gantt.

Diauxic Growth
When several carbon sources are present in a cell culture, bacteria will preferentially consume some types before others. As described by Monod [1], bacteria will preferentially consume glucose, and enter an exponential growth phase.  Once the glucose is used up, bacteria growth will first plateau off.  After a lag period, it will switch to consumption of secondary carbon sources and enter a second exponential growth phase. The most commonly studied example of diauxic growth is the preference of glucose over lactose. This also applies for several other carbon sources, as shown below (Image from [1]):
How it works- catabolite repression of promoter This is the phenomenon called catabolite repression, where a preferred carbon source represses other promoters by lowering intracellular cAMP levels. The key link here to the observed diauxic growth pattern is that the external glucose concentration is inversely correlated with the intracellular cAMP levels.  For a CRP-linked promoter, transcription requires help from an active CRP protein (responsive to cAMP).
When cAMP levels are low, the inactive CRP protein is unable to bind to the promoter.  Therefore, transcription does not start.  When cAMP levels are high, cAMP binds to inactive CRP protein and activates it.  This active CRP protein will trigger the start of transcription.

STEP System Test
""No road of flowers lead to glory.""
Partial Tests
Before fully test the STEP system, we first divided the whole transducer into two sections: the extracellular domain of ligand receptor & transmembrane domain, and the intracellular domain of transcription factor & protease. After testing both parts we were able to examine and optimise the whole system in both HEK293T and HeLa cell lines.
BiFC Test
A critical factor for the system to work is the ability of the transducers to correctly locate onto the cell membrane. To verify that we designed a test of bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC), split the N- and C-terminal of ECFP (BBa_E0020) at the A155 site and directly attached them to transmembrane linkers of the two VEGF-STEP chains.
After confirming the validity of our split ECFP in E. coli BL21 (see our parts page), we transfected HeLa cells using the two chains and added VEGF 24 hours later. After 12 hours of induction and 4 hours under low temperature for maturation, we successfully observed cyan fluorescence under microscope (Figure 1).
Figure 1. BiFC test. (a) The N- and C-terminal of split ECFP are attached to transmembrane domain of our VEGF-STEP. In theory the two chains can band together and emit ECFP fluorescence after adding VEGF.  (b) Fluorescent images of co-transfection of VEGF-scFv-nECFP and VEGF-scFv-cECFP with and without the existence of VEGF (after co-transfection 24h).

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#coli_-_-_TEXT.html," 53% oxidization of ABTS by the ECOL laccase at pH 5 (53 µM oxidized ABTS). The other tested pHs only led to a oxidation  of up to 17% of added ABTS, respectively. Figure 14 shows the results of the analog experiments with laccase that was not incubated with  CuCl2 before the activity measurements. Again, a pH optimum at pH 5 can be determined with 24 µM ABTS (24%) oxidized by ECOL after 8 hours under these conditions.
Figure 15 represents the negative control showing the oxidization of ABTS by 0.4 mM CuCl2 at the chosen pHs. The greatest increase in oxidized ABTS can be  seen at a pH of 5: after 5 hours 15% ABTS is oxidized by CuCl2 alone. Nevertheless this result does not have an impact  on the activity of the ECOL laccase at pH 5, which is still the optimal  pH. Therefore it has the same pH optimum as TVEL0 .
Figure 13: ECOL laccase activity measured in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer with a  range of different pHs from pH 1 to pH 9, 0.1 mM ABTS, to a final volume of 200 µL at 25°C over a time period of 12 hours.  The optimal pH for ECOL is pH 5 with the most ABTSox.
Figure 14: ECOL laccase activity measured in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer with a  range of different pHs from pH 1 to pH 9, 0.1 mM ABTS, to a final volume of 200 µL at 25°C over a time period of 12 hours.  The tested enzymes were not incubated with CuCl2 before activity measurements. The optimal pH for ECOL is pH 5 with the most ABTSox.
Figure 15: Negative control for pH activity test using 0.04 mM  CuCl2 H2O instead of laccase to determine the potential of ABTS getting oxidized by CuCl2.
With regard to our project knowledge of the optimal pH is useful. Since waste water in waste water treatment plants has an average  pH of 6.9 it has to be kept in mind, that a adjustment of the pH is necessary for optimal laccase activity.
ECOL CuCl2 concentration
Another test of ECOL was done to survey the best CuCl2 concentration"
Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," they were able to encode and decode a message containing a     little over 50k words and a few images [17] . To learn more about data storage we visited the archives of the city Groningen (figure 3).
Figure 3. A visit to the archives of Groningen.
Encryption
The original message is encrypted into a new message (the     ciphertext) by using the Rijndael algorithm [18] , which was     developed in 1998 by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and     Vincent Rijmen. In November 2001 this algorithm was selected by the     U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the     new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [19] . Since then, it has     been adopted by the U.S. government to secure highly classified     data and has been used worldwide. The process of encryption is represented in figure 4.
After encryption, the message will be converted into a binary     message, by making use of the American Standard Code for     Information Interchange (ASCII). ASCII encodes characters into     integers, which can be represented as sets of binary digits.
The encrypted binary message is translated into a sequence of     the nucleotides ACTG by using the following translation scheme: the     binary pair 00 will be represented as A, 10 as T, 01 as C and 11 as     G (see table 1). Subsequently, the obtained string of nucleotides     is integrated into the DNA of Bacillus subtilis, which will serve     as the carrier organism for our secret message. For example, table     2 shows the translation of the plaintext “Hello world” into a     sequence of nucleotides (encryption is not applied in this     example).
The same strategy is applied to the encryption key, which is     integrated into the DNA of a separate Bacillus subtilis strain in     the same manner. In order to retrieve the original message, the     message needs to be decrypted by using the same key that was used     for encryption.

NMGR526
1 μL PstI
1 μL EcoRI
1,8 μL of insert NMGR526 (at 504,3 ng/ μL)
4 μL H buffer
32,2 μL water
Ligation
After purificating the DNA using a simple etanol precipitation protocol, we resuspended the DNA into 12 μL of water. Then, we put both plasmid and PM2 in one tube, and both plasmid and NMGR526 in another one, using these amounts of components:
1 μL T4 ligase
3 μL pSB1C3
4 μL ligation buffer
Whole 12 μL of our DNA
We kept it O/N in the fridge at 4ºC.
Transformation
We transformed DH5α E.coli competent strain with our ligation product using a standard heat shock transformation protocol.
Miniprep
Before the tranformation ending O/N step, we noticed that we had grown colonies in cloramphenicol LB plaques, so we used them to make a plasmidic DNA extraction (Miniprep: High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit, Roche. 11 754 785 001). In order to check the process had been successful, we made an electrophoresis gel, putting  four careers:
Ligation product digested with EcoRI
Ligation product digested with PstI
Ligation product digested with EcoRI and PstI
Ligation product without any restriction enzyme

Collaborations
Cloning Guide with TU Eindhoven
First, we were very motivated to discuss the potential for iterative capped assembly to open the doors for other iGEM teams to explore new features of protein synthesis. To achieve this, we collaborated with the great members of the TU Eindhoven iGEM Team, for whom we developed a cloning guide for ICA.  Our entry in their guide discussing the background, process, workflow, and troubleshooting tips necessary to utilize this system.  Our collaboration has not only benefited iGEM teams who wish to learn the technique, but also helped us gain a better sense of the implications of our research toward advanced synthetic biology. We envision ICA as a cloning technique that can be widely adapted not only to those using our parts collection generate novel silk genes, but for any team who wishes to rapidly and controllably assembly long repetitive genetic structures for functional use.
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
First Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM was honored to hold the first ever Southern California iGEM Meetup on Thursday, August 6th.  Team members from the University of California, San Diego ( UCSD ), University of La Verne and La Cañada High School , and the LA Biohackers Community Lab attend our meetup at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA.  Here is a link to the powerpoint we delivered at the meet up, and below are pictures from our event.  Teams discussed their ongoing projects and offered advice to members struggling with certain aspects of their experimental design, and discussed the pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization and project design.  Additionally, we discussed the state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience"

East_Chapel_Hill,2017,Team:East Chapel Hill#Collaborations-Siyu-color4_-_-_TEXT.html," the applications and goals of the field.
Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.
Reddit Synthetic Biology Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange. Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations. Building with Biology’s mission is very similar to the our Human Practice’s mission: which is to go beyond the laboratory and delve into the underlying issues of projects in a social/environmental context. We worked all night and morning to research and rewrite the material, replacing all the information relating to Malaria"

FAT BUSTER - Artificial Futile Cycle
Abstract
Modules Description
Data Page
Parts
Result
Future Work
Characterization
While a low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought our attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lacking glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We intend to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequences of introducing such a nonnative cycle are not fully known, Dean et al. (2009) at UCLA recently introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cells to investigate fatty acid metabolism. They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing an inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acid uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells, cells expressing the shunt constitutively, and cells expressing the shunt in an inducible manner.
So, to sum up, we envision developing an inducible glyoxylate shunt that will serve to generate an artificial futile cycle in human liver cells. We hope our work will point to a future where obesity patients can increase expenditure of calories and thus alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.

Knockout
Tryptophanase-Knock-out Group
Goal: Indole and its derivatives are believed to be the important source of the E. coli odor. Our goal it to knock out tnaA, the essential gene for indole production in Escherichia coli for reducing odor of E. coli itself by RED recombination system. HPLC is introduced for testing the result.
Achievement: tnaA is successfully knocked out in the JM109 string of E. coli. Result from HPLC shows that the concentration of indole and methylindole are both evidently declined in the mutant strain, with the improvement of the smell and drug resistance declined.
Part: BBa_K1919400
Background:
Apart from the foot odor, the smell of E. coli itself is also a problem remained to be solved, which is imperative for gaining acceptability for our product. The smell mainly comes from the derivatives of indole which mostly originate from indole. Thus shutting down the production of indole becomes the key task. The direct way of indole formation in E. coli is the process that turns a tryptophan into an indole molecule by tryptophanase. As a result, turning off this process by knocking out tryptophanase will reduce the source of indole as well as the smell.
Deisgn:
Our biobrick is the homologous substitution fragment for RED recombination, which contains a chloramphenicol-resistant gene with a homology arm on each side. It is for replacing the tryptophanase gene.
RED recombination system is selected for the knocking out because it has already been a mature method of knocking out genes in the bacteria genome.
The steps are as follows:
1. Primers designing.
2. Amplify the drug-resistant gene with homology arms.
PCR. Using primer A as primer and pKD3 plasmid as template to build the Biobrick of a chloramphenicol-resistant gene with a homology arm on each side. Gel extraction was performed to purify DNA fragment.
3. Transforming PKD46 plasmid into the competent cells

Double transformation and InterLab study - Inoculation
Goal:
Transform both pdCas9 and pgRNA with anti-luxS into competent cells
InterLab study - inoculate colonies in LB-medium
Procedure:
Double transformation of pdCas9 and pgRNA with anti-luxS:
Both pdCas9(2) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS (isolated from day 11 – 05. July. 2018) were simultaneously transformed into competent cells (DH5α). The amount of added pdCas9(2) (5 μL) and pgRNA(2) with anti-luxS was 5 µL per/plasmid, and it was added to the same tube containing competent cells. The cells were plated on agar with both AMP and CM. A couple of steps were added at the end, and the purpose was to increase the cell concentration plated on agar, and probably increase the possibility of colony formation. The cell culture was therefore centrifuged for 3 minutes at 6800g, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was then resuspended and cells were plated.
InterLab – Inoculation of colonies
A colony from each agar plate was inoculated in LB-medium (5 mL) with CM (5 μL). The cell cultures were incubated overnight at 37℃ with shaker.

We filled out 19 surveys on various subjects.
#3: We carried out an ethical reflexion throughout all of our project, doing bibliographical research, meeting professionals and members of NGOs. Our major discussions and decisions are listed in our Human Practices Logbook .
Gold medal
#1: We performed an Integrated Human Practice reflexion on three levels to surpass the scientific achievements and use synthetic microbial consortium to real society profit. Upstream of the project we had many contacts with NGOs (Unicef and Doctors Without Borders) and industrials working with the impacted populations. Next, we gathered invaluable knowledge about our chosen microorganisms thanks to insights from scientists all over the world. Downstream of the project, we thought about an actual solution against cholera. We carefully analyze the lifecycle of our solution through the building of 8 ethical matrices and engaged in a concrete business plan which required us to meet industrials and startup leaders.
#2: The proposed synthetic microbial consortium is complex, with many biological entities interacting in a dynamic way. Modeling was thus vital to simulate its behavior, understand its properties, and ultimately support its design. We represented the different entities and processes using a standard graphical notation, which was used as a basis to develop a predictive, mechanistic model. Following an iterative approach, this model was feed with parameters gathered from the literature and exploited to verify ab initio the feasibility of the project. In turn, it helped us to design experiments that we performed to refine some key parameters. We implemented different mathematical tools (including an original extension of the metabolic control analysis framework) to evaluate the robustness of our consortium and identify parameters that control its behavior, hence driving rational optimization of both the system and the device. A user-friendly interface was finally developed for non-specialists to play with our system."
MIT,2012,Team:MIT#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,". With interests in drug design and biomedical applications of the biological engineering field, Robert felt that iGEM presented a perfect opportunity to learn about the research process and confirm that he wants to pursue biological engineering. Robert hopes to integrate the elegance of well-engineered systems into the framework of biology. Since students design their own project in iGEM, from the experimental process down to the individual DNA sequence, he feels as though it serves as a perfect test for future plans. Robert, undecided on a future career, plans to establish options to break into industry, graduate work, and medical school during his undergraduate career. In addition to the beauty of biology and biological engineering, Robert is also passionate about rowing. He spends innumerable hours on the Charles River rowing for MIT’s lightweight Crew team, and serves on the governing body of MacGregor House, his dormitory.
Linh Vuong
is a senior at MIT majoring in Biology and double minoring in Management and Chemistry. Her research interests concern cancer, cardiology and immunology. She feels as though synthetic biology is an incredibly creative field where the sky is the limit. From modifying the genetic code to a quadruplet code, to re-programming bacteria as a drug delivery device, synthetic biology will give rise to the next-generation technologies, which can be applied to a broad range of applications such as materials, pharmaceuticals, medicine and agriculture. As a member of the 2012 MIT iGEM team, she feels as though she will not only be able to enrich her knowledge in the field of synthetic biology, in particular RNA computing, but also gain significant research and leadership skills that will help her greatly in her aspiration to become a physician. Previously, Linh has worked at the Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie-Leon Berard in Lyon, France working on the role of TGF-beta signaling pathway in activation and expansion of autoreactive B cells, in the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research-Sabatini Lab on cell-based microarrays, in the Institute of Molecular Cell Biology in Singapore on the Characterization of PreS1 promoter of Hepatitis B virus and at the Institute of Molecular Engineering and Biotechnology on the Synthetis of biodegradable injectable hydrogel system from Hyaluronic acid Epigallocatechin gallate. Outside of research, Linh is an MIT Admissions Blogger, a sister of Sigma Kappa sorority, an MIT Ambassador, a Medlink, an Arts Scholar, on the MIT Ballroom dance team and a writer for The Tech.

Fundamental Tools
One thing we were hoping to make this summer but never got around to was a multi-species plasmid: a new BioBrick backbone vector that would express a fluorescent protein in both C. elegans and E. coli. This would make it possible to eliminate the coinjection marker from the microinjection process, and guarantee that the DNA was functional in the worm if an injection were successful. In order to be grown up in E. coli, however, it would need to reuse the coding sequence for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic translation in order to save space. Implementing this might require the crafty use of introns .

Abstract
Our Speedy RNA+protein reporter effectively skips protein folding when reporting, thus reducing the time for a fluorescent response.
More specific insights into molecular mechanisms and gene regulation are essential for improvement in synthetic biology. Understanding these mechanisms requires time. Our speedy reporter for reporting RNA and protein expression in a cell effectively skips protein folding when reporting -- the longest part of gene expression - thus reducing the time needed to get fluorescence. By speeding up the reporter, in both RNA and protein, we have also speed up the exploration for rules in the  biological system. We can not only generate more novel circuits but also explore gene regulations in synthetic biology.
Introduction
Recent studies of mRNA localization show that a great part of mRNA localize in specific cytoplasm position (Martin and Ephrussi, 2009). For examples, ASH1 mRNA localize at bud tip of budding yeast to allow asymmetric segregation from mother to daughter cell (Paquin and Chartrand, 2008). In the Drosophila the localization of mRNA at anterior and posterior of oocyte play an important role in the developing embryo (Johnstone and Lasko, 2001). Local translation of mRNAs in axonal growth cones helps axon navigate to it synaptic partners (Lin and Holt, 2007). β-actins mRNA localize at sites of active actins polymerization, cytoskeletal-mediate motility need mRNA translation (Huttelmaier et al., 2005). All the examples above is studies on eukaryotic system. Recent studies suggest that the mature mRNA transcript remain confined within subcellular regions (M"

The protocol asks for 125 ng of each primer. Since the primers all had the same 1 ug/uL concentration, we used 8 uL of each primer. The mutants were the following:
Y42F
V36F
P29Q-Y42M
P39Q-LV41
P39K
Since the total strand is about 5 kb, we used 150 seconds at 68 C for the second segment of thermal cycling. The resulting cycling products were put in the fridge over night, since it was too late to start the digestion.

Plates with yesterday's Gibson assemblies were not concluent, as there were few colonies without RFP and not more than in the negative control. Alessandro and Nadine made a gradient Gibson assembly for reporter plasmid and a negative control (=only backbone), we will transform them as soon as the competent cells are ready.
The mutagenesis cycling products were digested using 2 uL of Dpn I restriction enzyme. The transformation of XL10-Gold cells was done normally. The ampicillin LB plates were melting, making beading a problem. The plates were put overnight.
Lilia run MITOMI on spotted de Brujin library with GFP-wtTetR expressed off-chip with SP6 ITT. Before the last scan, the chip was washed by mistake with opened buttons, so the interactions unfortunately might have been washed on the next images.

Henrike and Alessandro designed primers to put the T4 lysis cassette (BBa_K112808) under the control of the T7 promoter using as backbone: pSB3C5, pSB3K1, pSB3K5. This device will be used to test plasmid DNA recovery after lysis.
Nadine designed primers to add Ptet-LacI in the pSB3K1-Pconst-TetR palsmid, also adding a terminator before LacI. We decided not to inculde the ssrA degardation tag in LacI, to be sure that the cells won't lyse.
Since the pSB3K1 plasmid contains RFP, Nadine tried to cut it out by digesting it with XbaI and SpeI. Tomorrow we'll make a ligation, and as soon as the primers"

International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM)
Since 2003, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the most important universities of the world, organizes the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), in which students from world renowned universities gather together to apply genetic engineering techniques in solving the most pressing problems known today in industry, environment, health and other research fields. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," show what this really means, suppose the bacterium     stops propelling itself. How long will it continue to move relying only on its inertia?     Assuming Stokes' law, we obtain (B2.2) as the equation of motion.
$$      F=m\cdot \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \;\;\; \text{(B2.2a)}      $$      $$      -6 \pi \eta a  v=m\cdot \frac{dv}{dt} \;\;\; \text{(B2.2b)}      $$
Solving this differential equation yields (B2.3).
$$      v=v_0 \cdot \text{exp} \Bigg[      -\frac{6 \pi \eta a}{m} \cdot (t-t_0)      \Bigg]      \;\;\; \text{(B2.3)}      $$
The characteristic time constant is $\tau = 6\pi\eta a/m \approx 0.1 \cdot \mu s$,    from which we calculate that the total distance traversed is $\Delta x < 2 \cdot pm$.    This coasting distance is 6 orders of magnitude smaller than its size. Moreover,    the time spent coasting is extremely short. Thus, once the    bacterium stops propelling itself, it is safe to assume that whatever kinetic energy    it had is immediately absorbed by hydrodynamic friction, instantly halting the bacterium.    Therefore, we can neglect the inertial term in Newton's second law (5).
Stochastic Differential Equation
When we try to calculate the physical “chemotactic force”, propelling bacteria towards       chemoattractants or away from chemorepellents, we find that it is not easily       measured nor derived. Therefore, as a workaround       we base the equation of motion                          on (6), a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that describes the motion                         of a single particle in a N-particle system that is governed by a Keller-Segel       type PDE in the limit of $N \rightarrow \infty$. This Keller-Segel type PDE (7)       describes the evolution of a bacteria density field $n$ moving       towards some chemoattractant $S$.

Why should ethics concern animals?
We will present two ways of integrating animals in our moral community with the different consequences drawn for animal experimentation. The two authors, Tom Regan and Peter Singer are generally considered as classics or foundations of animal ethics.
“The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been with-holden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But they were otherwise, what could it avail? The question is not, Can they reason? Nor Can they talk? But, Can they suffer?” [1]
Before entering into the various theories we wanted to quote this famous reflection of J. Bentham, an utilitarian philosopher of the XVIIIth century. Bentham theory of moral is widely recognized as one the first hesitation to rationally integrate animals in our theory of justice . This quote introduces the basics references on the debate: the parallel made with racism and slavery, the disqualification of reason and languages as pertinent criteria to determine the limit of the moral realm, the temptation to define justice as the equality of human and non-human animals, equality based on the following criterion: the ability to feel pain. The parallel made with racism and slavery will be drawn again in 1970 with a semantic consequence, the creation of a neologism: speciesism. The analogy is drawn with racism and sexism. The term has been introduced by Ryder in 1970 in Oxford, and exposes the discrimination between being on the arbitrary criteria of their species. A quite simple case can illustrate this concept: many people would prefer that animal experimentation is done on rats rather than on cats on the simple basis that rats are disgusting and cats are cute. This is a case"
