Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#ScienceSam_-_-_TEXT.html," people when they go and see these clinics they think “oh yeah I read in the Globe and Mail that this is a thing!” Did I answer your question? Yeah, adding the “but were not there yet is important”. Yeah and the “hope without the hype” has to be stronger. Can I add one more thing? I would want my legacy to be stop teaching biology about health. Biology and medicine are different, biology and health science are different. What you’re studying, what I’m studying, were just asking the why and how? And if people care about space and it’s so far away, people should care about the why and how of their bodies. We just always do the health spin because we’re lazy. Its easier. So if we stop giving the health spin all the time we won’t even have to say “but we’re not there yet” because we’ll always be framing the story as what it really is. I get that all the time in my research. I was just recently at CSM conference, which is why I’m in the area... Ed yong was there! Yeah! I’m actually getting a phone interview with him for this project. OMG can you share that with me! Yes of course! Can you share this [current interview] with me too? Yep! Of course. Even in our field, I had people coming up to me – and I study very basic “How viruses build proteins and infect the cell and take it over”- and even then people were like “well what’s the clinical spin on this? And I had to say “there isn’t one, sorry”. I have to be like “drug targets…maybe?” I think it’s an epidemic in science, especially biology. Even when I’m communicating-and I’m sure you do this too- I do the health spin because you’re trying to pull people in. But I strive not to, if I can get away without it, I don’t. But it’s kind of an epidemic specific to biology. No other field is that way. Space is about space-people love space science, NASA does so well but it’s relatively…like it’s usefull! I’m not saying it isn’t...but it’s not as useful as some biology things could be. But I think it’s also the funding crisis that has people trying to pull medical relevance out of their biology which kind of exacerbates the issue actually. And this is what I blame the media for. Giving the health spin, not over hyping. People in their recreational time don’t want to hear about the ways they’re going to"
BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is finalized, they can move on to the manufacturing stage of the workflow. Most microfluidic fabrications methods, such as soft lithography, require a high initial startup cost, technical agility, time investment and more educational investment to learn how to correctly manufacture the chips.
After manufacturing their device, the synthetic biologist can then move onto implementation and testing. However, there are many difficulties that may arise when testing a device. For example, certain chips may require some external apparatus, such as off-chip metering or electronic components. These can vary from design to design, adding additional costs and time investment in learn how to use them.
Even after investing time and money into this microfluidics workflow, success is not guaranteed. The process may need to be repeated dozens of times to get a fully functional microfluidic chip.
These difficulties with replicating and testing microfluidic devices was experienced first-hand by the BostonU HW Team. While replicating chips from journal articles, similarly to our synthetic biologist, we noted three repeated issues:
Lack of thorough documentation of experimental procedures
High level of design specificity and a lack accessibility of design files
Lack of standard evaluation system to grade devices against
As a result, the final chip manufactured cannot be run correctly due to lack of protocol documentation. Additionally, it is not possible to use a quantitative system of evaluation to ensure the device is working as intended. We have classified these limitations as barriers in the “implementation” stage of the microfluidics workflow.
Our Project
The CIDAR Lab at Boston University has tackled many of these design and manufacture shortcomings with an easy to use software workflow, including last year's iGEM Hardware project Neptune , and a low-cost rapid prototyping manufacturing system Makerfluidics . However, this system does not address the barriers we had identified under “Implementation” which limits the accessibility of microfluidics to everyday synthetic biology labs.
This year’s iGEM Team, decided to focus on removing these barriers in the implementation stage of the workflow which led to the creation of our project MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio).
MARS aims to increase the accessibility and relevance of microfluidics to synthetic biology through three defined goals:
Increase the ease of access of microfluidics to synbiologists
Design chips relevant for day to day use in synthetic biology
Create a standardized method of evaluating chip functionality
These goals have been built on and expanded to create the three branches of MARS which are:
Microfluidics 101
The MARS Repository
Fluid Functionality

Protein Expression
The first step of our experiments is to get the target proteins. And we have expressed what we need successfully.
 
Janus Expression
The bacteria ( E.coli BL21) were cultured in 5mL LB liquid in 37℃ for 6-8 hours. The antibiotic we used in inJanus-m and sJanus-m is kanamycin, and for sJanus is ampicillin. Then we used 500μM IPTG to induce in 37℃ for 4h.
Figure 13. Pre-expression. We successfully expressed sJanus, sJanus-m and inJanus-m.
Expression condition:
1. Mix the supernatant after centrifugation with the GST medium and incubate them in the shaker for 1~2h.
2. Add the intermixture to the column. Collect the flow-through and add it to the column again. (You can repeat the procedure for 2~3 times if necessary.)
3. Wash the column by 20ml 1xPBS for three times (more if necessary).
4. Add Prescission Protease to the column (the mass ratio of PP and your protein is 1:10). Then incubate them in the shaker overnight.
5. Collect the flow-through which is your sample. Purify your product by using UPLC.
6. Wash the column by GSH and recover the column.
Neo-Protein Design
Pre-expression:
The bacteria were cultured in 5mL LB liquid medium with kanamycin in 37℃ overnight. After taking samples, we transfer them into 1L LB medium with kanamycin.

- Performed a cesium chloride gradient purification on T7 mutated phage from the large phage team.
8.7 CsCl Gradient
8/9/13
- We performed dialysis on T7 mutated phage from the cesium chloride gradient on 8.7.  Because the gradient only showed one band, we decided to not do an EM as we most likely had mutant phage mixed in with wild type.  We discussed a gradient to run in the future that will be able to further identify where the phage band.  We decide on a CsCl gradient of concentrations 1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, 1.6.  We hope to be able to identify exactly where the phage bands so that we can make small variations in the gradient at that point.  This will allow us to separate mutant phage from wild type.

Parts
BioBricks are nucleic acid coding molecular biological functions, along with the associated information defining and describing the parts.  You can find more information about this on the website of The BioBricks Foundation . Using these molecules any synthetic biologist or biological engineer can program living organisms. All our parts are available to anyone for free via MIT's Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
In the context of our project, we have designed, constructed, and characterised 7 new parts, which have been sent to the Registry. You can find a detailed explanation on how we made our biobricks below.

We also considered making our own artificial restriction enzymes in order to cut DNA off-site. To do so, we would have made zinc fingers to bind DNA and combined them with enzymes capable of cutting away from the binding site. This would allow us to cut as close to the gene as possible.
Biobrick Fusion Standards
When designing our flagella construct we examined a number of different ways of creating fusion proteins. Using the original BioBrick assembly standard does not work for fusion proteins, as it results in a frame shift and stop codon in the scar. At first we worked on creating a new method of fusion protein production, however we ran into many of the same problems as the standards that were already present. We went through the various fusion standards present on the openwetware web page, analyzing their different merits, eventually settling on Tom Knight’s BB-2 standard. You can follow this link for some information on the various standards we examined.

The Biofusion standard slightly adjusted the original BioBrick standard such that the scar would now code for arginine instead of a stop codon, and the fusion would be in frame. Also, this standard uses the same enzymes as the original, so no new enzymes must be purchased. However, some issues do arise.These include the fact that the arginine present in the scar may be problematic in some cases due to its large size and the fact that it is coded by a rare codon. Also, Dam methylation may block cloning if the fused protein begins with Serine.

If we are able to meet their requirements in the longer term, they will consider adopting our product (Study visit J Olsson 15 Aug 2018). On the other side, AstraZeneca representatives are open to newer and cheaper alternatives to be potentially implemented in their private WWTP (Study visit P Gruvstedt 18 Sept 2018).
Macroenvironment Analysis
In order to track the environment we are planning to operate, we conducted the following PESTLE analysis.
Political
National elections last September may influence the funding of projects aiming to solve this problem.
The Swedish Green Party (Miljöpartiet de Gröna) has current representation in the Swedish Parliament and could encourage the promotion of a cleaner environment. Environmental politicians can significantly affect the WWTPs’ procedures and the associated regulations.
The Government is aware of the situation; however, money seems to be the problem. Since the existing techniques to treat pharmaceuticals are expensive, politicians are not interested in developing any regulation. Municipal WWTPs would have to face big expenses when implementing these techniques (Personal communication M Ryen 7 Sept 2018).
The Swedish EPA was requested by the Government to investigate the prerequisites for using advanced treatment [11].
Over the Swedish history, the Government has granted environmental improvements [10]. In particular, there is sufficient funding available for advanced treatment (Personal communication M Ryen 7 Sept 2018). The Swedish EPA is responsible for the grant distribution process, and the funding is worth SEK 45 million for 2018, SEK 50 million for 2019 and SEK 70 million for 2020 [10].
Economic
National elections last September may affect economic trends and, therefore, change consumer spending and buying behavior.
WWTPs face high investments when introducing big modifications in their process (Study visit T Mörn 30 Jul 2018).
Municipal WWTPs’ finance comes primarily from loans and a variable tariff (depending on the size of the client, the amount of water they consume, etc.) charged to households and industries connected to their plants (Study visit E Kusoffsky 15 Aug 2018).
The income municipal WWTPs receive from these tariffs is spent in facilities expenses. If there is a new investment in the plant, there will not necessarily be an"

PARAMETERS
The values of the coefficients used and the reference where they were taken are detailed in the next file.
In the absence of reliable experimental data, we chose some of our parameters based on expected reaction times and reactions equilibriums. Some others were taken from the bibliography cited at the end of this work. Although our simulations show that qualitative behavior of the solutions is similar for a large range of parameters. Therefore, we present here results obtained for the particular choice of parameters.

ASSUMPTIONS
- No physical interaction between cells. This statement means that cells are completely surrounded by liquid, which leads to the assumption that all they have the same interfacial area.
- The diffusion though the cell membrane by chloroform is supposed to occur by Simple Diffusion.
- Time delay and stochastic fluctuations were not studied.
- Constant amount of cells during the incubation time in chloroform.
- In all models done the basal transcription rate has been assumed negligible.
- Concentration of RNA polymerase is constant. We don’t take into account the fact that a fraction of these RNA polymerases are occupied.
- Other possible regulations are neglected. Not modeling the entire regulatory factors network.
- pH dependence is described by the following equation: (1+10^(a-pH)+10^(b*pH-c)). For more information see the model equations.
- There is no external mass transfer resistance. The overall reaction rate is slow enough to not take into account the film that surrounds the cell membrane, as well as the fact that the cell volume is much larger than the volume of the hypothetical film.
- Three dimensional spatial distributions are neglected.
- The culture was done in a perfectly stirred batch reactor.
- The value of the mass transfer coefficient from bulk to gas is system dependent, other systems will have different values of the same coefficient.

THE PROCESS
The main objective of our project is to accomplish a verbal communication with our microorganisms. To do that, we need to establish the following process:
The input used is a voice signal (question), which will be collected by our voice recognizer.
The voice recognizer identifies the question and, through the program in charge of establishing the communication, its corresponding identifier is written in the                 assigned port of the arduino.
The software of the arduino reads the written identifier and, according to it, the corresponding port is selected, indicating the flourimeter which wavelength has                 to be emitted on the culture.  There are four possible questions (q), and each of them is associated to a different wavelength.
The fluorimeter emits light (BioInput), exciting the compound through optic filters.
Due to the excitation produced, the compound emits fluorescence (BioOutput), which is measured by the fluorimeter with a sensor.
This fluorescence corresponds to one of the four possible answers (r: response).
The program of the arduino identifies the answer and writes its identifier in the corresponding port.
The communication program reads the identifier of the answer from the port.
""Espeak"" emits the answer via a voice signal (Output).
You can see an explicative animation of this process here:
In the following sections we analyse in detail the main elements used in the process:

Gel Purification
Excise the area of the gel containing your desired DNA fragment using a clean, sharp razor blade. Minimize the amount of agarose surrounding the DNA fragment.
Weigh the gel slice containing the DNA fragmen, then place the gel into a 1.5- or 5.0-mL microcentrifuge tube.
Note: The maximum amount of starting material (gel) is ≤400 mg per tube. If your gel slice exceeds 400 mg, cut the gel into smaller slices so that no one piece exceeds 400 mg. Place each additional gel slice created into separate microcentrifuge tubes. For ≤2% agarose gels:
Place up to 400 mg of the excised gel containing the DNA fragment (previous page) into a 1.5-mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube.
Add 3 volumes Gel Solubilization Buffer for every 1 volume of gel (e.g., add 1.2 mL Gel Solubilization Buffer for a 400 mg gel piece).
Place the tube(s) containing your gel slice and Gel Solubilization Buffer into a 50°C water bath or heat block.
Incubate the gel slice and Gel Solubilization Buffer at 50°C for at least 10 minutes. Invert the tube by hand every 3 minutes to mix and ensure gel dissolution.

They connect young women and men in STEM by building a community to share ideas and learn new skills. They empower young minds with the skills to become forward-thinking and driven leaders. They advocate for women in STEM fields, educate, and raise awareness about the growing community. iGEM Waterloo has partnered with WiSTEM in the past with excellent results; this established a great relationship, so we decided to team up once more! For more information, visit their Facebook page or their website .
So what did we do?
The event was intended to provide a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere to foster productive discussions on the subject of gender inequality in STEM fields. To help steer and fuel this discussion, we invited four STEM field panelists who are passionate about gender equality to answer a few thought-provoking questions. Members of the audience were encouraged to chime in at any time with their own thoughts, experiences, and questions. The moderator of the event had previous experience hosting gender equality and STEM field related panel discussions.
Who were our panelists?
Colin Pierce -  Lead of iGEM’s Policy and Practice team. Sweetest person you’ll ever meet; exemplary ally to women and non-binary individuals.
Dr. Elizabeth Meiering - Chemistry professor and researcher at the University of Waterloo. She has expertise with protein folding, dynamics, function, engineering, and design. Jawad Khan -  University of Waterloo Biochemistry student, founder of Cultured - Synthesizes environmentally friendly, chemical-free, and affordable meat with in vitro meat production technology. Krishna Patel - University of Waterloo Chemistry student, working on co-op for Grand River Foods. Passionate gender equity activist with Women in STEM (WiSTEM).
What did we discuss?
Could you give a little introduction of yourself? What are you studying/areas of research?
Have you had any experiences concerning gender inequality in the STEM fields? If so, how has this affect you/your work?
What do you wish your male counterparts knew about being a woman/non-binary person in STEM? For males on the panel, what advice do you have for other male advocates?
What do you do to cope with/deal with gender inequality, do you have any tips for women in the field?
What tips do you have for moving the field of synthetic biology and related biological fields forward?

Motivation
     Thirty years after Paul Berg—the father of genetic engineering—first made the suggestion that bio-scientists should explore potential hazards of their work[1], the regulation and legislation processes about GMOs seem to be keeping up just fine.[2] However, despite the regulation and legislation that GMOs are subject to, GMOs are still met with global resistances that range from underlying doubts and outright boycotts that have landed scientists and the general public on antagonistic sides.
     Considering Zimbabwe who rejected GMO food aid in the early 2000s[3], China’s GMO fiasco where debate between camps con and pro has mounted to new heights in recent years which is described by the PheonixNet as, ``probably the fiercest GMO debate in the current world'' in 2013 [4][5], and the EU-US trade impasse over GM corps[6], one would say that genetically modified products still have a long way to go before claiming its commercialization rights, rightfully or not.
     When it comes to whether GMOs should be used at all, any opinion fundamentally belongs with either pro or con, and the clash of view is vicious. The scientists’ camp generally sneers at the general public under the facade of ``education'' and ``clarification'' for their unscientific stubbornness, and the general public who seem to draw odd inspirations from everywhere sneers back at their insulting patience to ``educate'' and would not relent whatsoever—just take a glimpse at the responses in various online debate websites [7], media [8], or the surveys done in different countries"

Cambridge-JIC,2015,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," emission filter and the dichroic mirror. Note the high contrast (ratio of peak intensity to background intensity) - it is essential for successful imaging.
Fig. 4: The excitation light that reaches the CCD. This occurs because the dichroic mirror in practice is not ideally reflective. The intensity of this signal is very low, which enhances the quality of the image: had it been higher, blue artefacts would haver been observed.
With this setup we managed to capture images of GFP fluorescent beads and some GFP-expressing E.coli. The filters used, supplied by Comar Optics , are:
excitation filter: cat.no 495 IK
dichroic mirror: cat.no 550 IY
emission filter: cat.no 515 IB
Another Worked Example: RFP Filter Set
(Note: this did not work in practice)
We wanted to image RFP (exictation: 584nm, emission:607nm) with OpenScope, as a part of our Collaboration with Glasgow iGEM Team. However, it was difficult to find low-cost dichroic mirrors that are transparent to wavelengths around 607 nm while being reflective to wavelengths around 584 nm. In addition, sourcing bright LEDs (for excitation) with an emission peak in the region of 584 nm was not possible. As such, the LEDs used had an emission peak at 591nm, which is closer to the transparency region for the dichroic mirrors. Overall, RFP imaging has not yet been demonstrated as a proof of concept. Perhaps this could be a starting point for future iGEM teams looking to build on the OpenScope project.
Above is the analysis of the filters we tried to use. The problem with the set is clear from the second plot: low intensity of excitation light (yellow) reaching the sample. This, in turn, means that less fluorescent molecules are excited, so actually the fluorescence output (red) is also scaled down.

$$6CO_2+6H_2O\longrightarrow(CH_2O)_6+6O_2$$
We know that the coefficient of the carbon dioxide which is consumed by carbohydrates is \(\frac{44}{33}\ g[CO_2]\ g[CH_2O]^{-1}\). If the increment of the carbohydrates’ dry weight is influenced only by the content of the organic matters and mineral substance, and the proportion of the two is 1:9 approximately, the coefficient of the consumed mineral substance, k2, is:
$$k_2=0.1\frac{g[M]}{g[\mathcal{A}]}$$
The coefficient of the consumed organic matters, k3, is:
$$k_3=0.9\cdot \frac{g[(CH_2 O)_6]}{g[\mathcal{A}]}$$
From the above, what can be seen is that the main idea of these ordinary differential equations is element conservation. They work out the growth velocity indirectly by analyzing the transform of the substances in the fixed space.

Introduction
We want to detect paclitaxel by using microtubule which expressed in E.coli. As we all know, microtubule is the cytoskeleton in eukaryotes which is assembled by α-tubulin and β-tubulin, but E.coli is the prokaryote, so it is very important to verify whether microtubule assemble successfully or not in E.coli. If microtubule assembles successfully, it means α-tubulin and β-tubulin have biological activities"

a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab
The biological parts and devices that we designed and constructed do not pose any risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab. In this project we work with organisms and cells that are widely used in laboratories and generally regarded as safe, namely the E.coli strain DH5α, and the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. One part of the team worked with these two organisms in a biosafety 1 lab. The other part of the team worked with the human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS in a biosafety 2 lab. To avoid cross-contamination the part of the team working with the microorganisms were not allowed to enter the mammalian cell lab.
There are potential risks in a number of standard practices performed in the lab, therefore appropriate measures were taken when preparing media and buffers, performing gel extractions, and using molecular biology kits for DNA purification etc. In general nitrile gloves, labcoats, and goggles were worn when required to ensure the safety of our team members in the lab.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
Our standard assembly system is intended for research and development only and does therefore not pose a threat to public safety. If the biological parts or devices should be released by accident there would be no apparent risks, since the biological parts we are working with are not hazardous. They would not constitute any danger or other negative effects, if they were released by accidents. Furthermore our working strain E. coli DH5α does not thrive outside the laboratory, because it is an auxotroph and cannot transmit plasmids to other strains (it is a F- strain).
We have constructed resistance marker cassettes expressing"

Introduction Attending the BGI Workshop Visiting iGEM team Hong Kong HKUST Visiting Team Hong Kong CUHK Asking feedbacks from other iGEM teams Back to Homepage
Introduction
With the spirit of open and sharing, our team joined several communication activities with other iGEM teams, including attending BGI workshop, visiting iGEM teams Hong_Kong_HKUST and  Hong_Kong_CUHK. While communication with other teams, we exchanged our opinions and discussed our projects thoroughly. Eventually we had learned a lot from these communication activities and gained many constructive perspectives to improve our project.
Attending the BGI Workshop
On May 26th, we attended the workshop arranged by BGI iGEM teams. Seven iGEM teams attended this workshop, including Shenzhen BGIC 0101, Shenzhen BGIC ATCG, SCUT, SYSU-China, SYSU-Software, SUSTC-Shenzhen-A and SUSTC-Shenzhen-B. We all presented our projects and shared opinions with each other. And we got great help and lots of beneficial advice from this workshop.
Visiting iGEM team Hong Kong HKUST
On August 18th, we visited HKUST and had a meeting with iGEM team Hong_Kong_HKUST. Professor Kim Chow was pretty nice and welcomed us go to HKUST and had an open communication. Therefore, on August 18h, all our teammates had a pleasant discussion with the members of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST and got to know their beautiful campus.
Both teams gave a presentation of their project and introduced their team members. Then we expressed our opinions on each other’s projects and discussed our projects in depth level. Their opinions are really beneficial for the further improvement of our software.
Visiting Team Hong Kong CUHK
Our communication with Team Hong_Kong_HKUST was very helpful to us. So we contacted the team leader of Team Hong_Kong_CUHK and organized another outreach communication on August 24th. In this communication activity,"

User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

BBa_F2620
Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :

Figure 1. lacp module
Promoter, Repressor and Inducer Specification
Promoter name: lacp (Lac repressible promoter)
Length: 200 base pairs
Strength with:
Weak RBS (BBa_B0032): 290.27-195.5 (+17.7) RPU
Medium RBS (BBa_B0030): 11.347-9456(+487) RPU
Strong RBS (BBa_B0034): 1.126-7648 (+152) RPU
In gram negative bacteria, LacI represses lacp which regulates the binding of RNA polymerase and inhibits transcription by binding to the lac operon.
Repressor name: LacI (LacI repressor)
Part Length: 1153 base pairs
Structure: Homo-tetramer
Binding affinity: To lacp, very tight, 60.145M
The LacI repressor is an allosteric protein exists in 2 states: silent and active. In the absence of inducers, the active state of LacI binds to the lac operator sites of the lacp promoter and interferes the binding the RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting transcription. In the presence of inducers, however, LacI undergoes allosteric rearrangement and switches to its silent state, resulting in its release from the promoter, thus allowing transcription to take place.
Inducer name: IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside)
Effective Concentration : 20 ng/ml
In our project,  Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to induce lacp driven expressions. IPTG is a lactose metabolite, lacp’s native inducer, which has shown stronger binding affinity to LacI. On top of that, it cannot be metabolized by Escherichia coli so it concentration remains constant during the experiment, making it a more suitable inducer for our Tristable Switch system.
Mechanism of lacp - LacI - IPTG Interaction

We could simplify our experiment by putting into competition a strain of E.coli that contains the microcin B17 with the integrase against a strain of E. coli that contains the immune gene that protects it against the microcin B17. This immune gene must be under the control of an inducible promoter to be able to modulate its rate. Some times after the beginning of the experiment, we could increase the expression of the immune gene of microcin B17 to exert a stronger selective pressure in order to favor the best gene rearrangement of the microcin operon. The same experiment should also be done with microcin C7.
Team Slovenia 2010
     By reading previous iGEM projects, we saw that the Slovenia team from 2010 wanted to improve protein production like us, but in another way. In their project, they use DNA like a scaffold to bring together all the enzymes involved in a biosynthetic pathway. In fact, they fused each of these enzymes with a zinc finger motif, whose are able to bind DNA. The zinc finger motifs used were specific to some nucleotide sequences that were close to each other. The results of their experiments shown an increase of the rate of the protein tested.
     Our approach could complement them by making sure each enzyme in the pathway was produced at an optimal rate.
Could our system do better than « nature »?
     Our entire goal was to prove, using microcins, that the integron could optimize any biological pathway. We did not manage to build all our biobricks and assemble them in the integron. However, we can still try to answer the following question: Could it be possible to use the integron to increase the microcin production to a higher degree than what is found in the environment? There are evidences to back up and debunk our hypothesis.
     Firstly, there is a pattern in the way the original microcin B17 and C7 operons are built. The gene coding for the pro-microcin is always first, followed by genes crucial for microcin maturation and finally immunity genes. This gene arrangement has been selected over a very large period of time in the environment and therefore we could consider that the microcin operon is already a highly optimized pathway. Using the integron in this case could have been useless.  However, the way our competition experiments have been thought does not strictly represent what is found in nature. Putting 2 microcins producing bacteria in direct contact would"

Opinions about gut inflammation
As we turned the focus to their thoughts about intestinal health, we found out that most people (80%) would sometimes doubt or consider their intestinal health, while significantly fewer people would never think about or very frequently think about their intestinal health. As for determining intestinal health, many people tend to link intestinal health to defecation – they think regular defecation or unobstructed defecation means that their intestines are healthy. Somewhat fewer people think that good face complexion or not having diarrhea indicates healthy intestines, and relatively few people think that just not having a stomachache is a sign of health. When asked about the seriousness of gut inflammation in their opinion, most people said that diabetes, depression, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer would be more serious than gut inflammation, while fewer people thought that obesity is more serious. Comparatively few people thought that catching a cold is more serious than gut inflammation.
Their previous experience with gut inflammation
We next turned to ask about people’s previous experience with gut inflammation. About 80% of them have had gut inflammation less than three times, and surprisingly, 6% of the people we surveyed had it more than 10 times in their life. This made us consider that if we can cure gut inflammation with a single treatment, and safely keep the probiotic bacteria in patients’ intestines to prevent future inflammation, there would be a population that need it. An astonishing 35% of the survey respondents have had an examination in the hospital regarding gut inflammation, and the methods used in their examination (from the most frequent to the least frequent) were stool examination, blood testing, and colonoscopy. Moreover, an unexpectedly large proportion were administered some other methods except these three, which means that unconventional methods are being used in gut inflammation testing, and all of these might be our product’s future commercial competitors.
People’s opinions about our probiotic treatment method
In the end, we asked about their opinions and focus on detecting gut inflammation using probiotics. Their average rankings of importance (from most important to least important) of their considerations about probiotic detection were: safety of the product, degree of trauma to human body, sensibility, price, and the required time to obtain the result. From this, we can easily see that people put safety in the very first spot, the product’s quality (sensibility) the next, and then follows the cost, so that the most important thing for us would still be ensuring its safety."

Comparison of Different aaRS Based on the CFP-YFP FRET-System
Figure 9 shows the emission spectra of the CFP-YFP system when cotransfomred with three different aaRS cultivated without their specific ncAA. They differ from each other in form and location of the emission maximum. The Prk-RS has its emission maximum at 520 nm, which is very close to the YFP-emission maximum. This indicates that the Prk-RS is relatively broad range enzymes, and couples native amino acids on the amber tRNA, which leads to a high amount of the complete CFP-YFP fusion protein. The emission spectrum when cotransformed with the CouAA-RS also has its maximum near 525 nm. It is also a bit shifted to the lower wavelengths and has increased values near 475 nm, which indicates that more solely CFP-units are present. The 2-NPA-RS leads to an emission spectrum where even a little peak at 475 nm is visible, which indicates that this aaRS produces the a lower amount of the whole fusion protein. We thereby showed, that different aaRS cotransformed with our improved test system lead to distinguishable emission spectra. The ratio of CFP-signal (emission at 475 nm) to YFP-signal (emission at 525 nm) gives information about the ratio of solely CFP-units to whole CFP-YFP FRET systems when excited at the CFP absorption maximum of 430 nm. This information is crucial to estimate how often amino acids are coupled to the amber tRNA by the investigated synthetase.

All cultivated without their specific non-canonical amino acid. Maximal emission of CFP at 475 nm (blue). Maximal emission of YFP / FRET at 525 nm (yellow).

In this stage the udder looks red and infected”. Paul is able to check himself whether or not the cow has mastitis in early stage. “If the cow has mastitis, the milk texture is different. In this early stage, Ice Mint, a treatment salve, can do the trick and cure the infection”.

Need for argumentation to start with second choice antibiotics
Need for pathogen detection causing the disease
Changes
Look into pathogen detection
Look into developing a method for future milk robots (producer: Lely )
Summary
During this interview, we gained knowledge on current methods to identify pathogens and determine the sensitivity of these pathogens. These detailed methods will be necessary to follow trends and to validate current treatment and diagnosis. Furthermore, mastitis can be caused by different pathogens and it hard to identify which pathogen cause the disease and subsequently, identify which resistance genes this pathogen has. The milk robots are the new technologies in the field to detect and count cells in the cow's milk. The amount of cells (>25.000) is an indication for mastitis.

For the majority of people, suggested by the data above, they tend to take                     yogurts as a preventive solution rather than Chinese medicine, giving us some clues to our project design.                     It is likely for us to insert the gene of antimicrobial peptides into a certain kind of probiotics. Thereafter,                     the genetically modified probiotics can be made into a daily yogurt product that can later be manufactured,                     which is likely to benefit thousands of patients who suffer from serious bacterial enteritis.

Activity: Visit to Nanjing General Hospital
China has a higher rate of antibiotic use and abuse than many western countries. One of the most dangerous potential consequences                 of rampant antibiotic abuse is the rapid rise of antibiotic-resistant “superbugs”, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for example, that can turn into a global health issue. Hence, to figure                 out the real situation of antibiotic use in clinical practices and to better understand gastrointestinal                 diseases and their treatments, on the 28th of June, we invited an expert Ms. Hui Shi from the                 Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology in Nanjing General Hospital to conduct a field investigation                 on the situation of antibiotic abuse, colonization of bacteria in the intestine and the universal treatment                 of gastrointestinal diseases.
Figure 5 iGEMers in Nanjing General Hospital
In accordance with Ms. Shi’s words, the abuse of antibiotics in China, though has been improved a lot, yet still not negligible.                 Just in the case of Nanjing General Hospital, the patients can be treated with antibiotics only after getting                 doctors’ prescription. Fortunately, we got the data concerning the use of antibiotics from the survey and                 showed below:
Figure 6 Interventions to diarrhea ordered by treating physicians
From the survey, the most common intervention was rehydration therapy (62%) and the most common drugs are antibiotics (61%),                 which is followed by dioctahedral smectite (59%), probiotics (48%) and herbal medicine (32%). Therefore,                 this shows that there exists an extreme misuse of antibiotics in the clinic and this data also serves as                 a reminder that nationwide education in the rational use of antibiotics is essential.
In addition, Ms. Shi shared with us the stories about the antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In the early 1940s, the introduction of penicillin in staphylococcal infection dramatically improved the                 cure"

The Problem
Snakebite is a grossly neglected tropical health complication that, in addition to causing death, it can also lead to disability and disfigurement.
It is so serious that the World Health Organization, since late September 2017 has raised it to a Category A neglected tropical disease after appeal from Costa Rica and 17 other member countries at the tenth meeting of the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory group for Neglected Tropical Diseases [1]. The true impact of envenoming, the severity and the morbidity it carries with it, are unknown due to underreporting in almost all affected areas [2].
However, it is conservatively estimated that up to five million people are bitten every year by snakes. Out of these 5 million people, about 2.4 million are estimated to be envenomed, resulting in 94,000-125,000 deaths annually [3].
Additionally, it is estimated that about 400,000 of the envenomed patients suffer either amputation of limbs, or display other severe health consequences, such as renal failure, necrosis, spontaneous bleeding, panhypopituitarism, diabetes, chronic neurological deficits, deformity and amputation of limbs.
The majority of snake bites occurs in South- and South-East Asia, Africa and South America. They are more common in rural areas, inhabited by people that depend on farming and other field working occupations for subsistence.
Agricultural and plantation workers, women and children are the groups mostly affected by snake bites. In these resource poor settings, people often have limited or no access to healthcare or antivenom, which increases the severity of the injuries and their outcomes [3].
Moreover, the socioeconomic impact on families and communities is adding to the burden of these injuries. In many occasions, the victims are the wage earners or care providers of the family, and child victims that suffer disabilities caused by snake bites are in need of greater support throughout the rest of their lives from their families. This has further important implications for the nutrition, growth and economy of the countries.
Antivenom remains the most effective antidote for snake envenoming, but is expensive and in short supply. As a consequence, it is unpractical or unavailable to rural and underdeveloped countries to carry due to challenged public health systems or poor infrastructure.
Furthermore, the proper antidote to apply is not straight forward, as the snake responsible for the envenoming is long gone and identification of such snake species is not the specialty of the medical personnel at the clinics.
Hence, if the clinic does carry ant"

WAM-1 (BBa_K1162007)
An antimicrobial peptide from the cathelicidin family of peptides, isolated from the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). WAM-1 is one of several identified peptides that are produced in the mammary gland throughout lactation in order to supply protection from infection to the young wallabies that have underdeveloped immune systems. This is evident through the down-regulation of these peptides in the tammar wallaby milk at around 100 days after birth, the same period that the wallaby young develop immunocompetence (Wang, et. al 2011). Similar to other members of the cathelicidin family, the WAM-1 antimicrobial peptide has been shown to be effective against a broad range of bacterial pathogens (Kastin, A. J. 2013). Specifically, a group of researchers from Australia (Wang, et. al 2011) have tested this peptide, isolated from its natural source, against several gram-negative (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, among others) and gram-positive (B. subtilis, S. aureus, among others) bacterium with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values that indicate highly effective antibiotic activity. To our knowledge, this antimicrobial peptide has not been expressed and purified recombinantly in E. coli.

A member of the cathelicidin family, OH-CATH Cathelicidins in general have been well characterized and are known to have a diverse C-terminal antimicrobial domain connected to a conserved cathelin-like N-terminal domain (Nizet et al 2003). Specifically, OH-CATH has been studied for its toxicity against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive bacteria. OH-CATH has also been characterized for its potent activity against multi-drug resistant bacterial strains including MRSA (Li et al 2012).

Because of the unexpected high volume of attendees, we ran out of materials more than once, having to make three rushed trips to nearby stores to replenish supplies!
The feedback we received from this event was immense. Numerous parents, many of whom were leaders of robotics teams, elementary school teachers, a couple of school counselors, and many professionals with biology, science and other tech backgrounds, told us that their kids enjoyed learning from the activities, how much they appreciated us working one on one with their kids, as we shared passionately and patiently our love for science, and how they valued the efforts we took to explain the science clearly and knowledgeably. We received high commendation from Laura Siko, the event’s main organizer for handling a continuously large crowd throughout the day and for our positive contribution. Given our success, Ms. Siko eagerly invited us to exhibit at the next Loudoun STEM Day, which we recently did, in October 2016.
“It was so great having the Broad Run team at STEM Day. Their activities were engaging and popular! I will be sure to include you on the invitation when we host another STEM Day next year!”
Seeing how we reached out to younger students, an elementary teacher who visited our booth, Mrs. Karla Paulson, invited us to run the same activities at her school’s upcoming STEM Night, STEM-mania.
Through Loudoun STEM Day, the largest science expo in our region, we engaged and worked with over 400 students introducing them to the basics of genetics and biology and engaged in conversations about synthetic biology with over a hundred adults.

We were invited by Tolbert Elementary school teacher, Mrs. Karla Paulson, after she saw our fun learning activities at Loudoun Stem Day. In a fun-filled night, our iGEM team taught students and families about DNA structure, inheritance and how a plasmid works. These activities were modeled off of William and Mary’s iGEM team’s synthetic biology curriculum.
Kids and adults alike enjoyed the activities; a set of twins made the exact same DNA trait bracelet and were exhilarated by the concept that their DNA was identical. Another little girl had an ‘aha’ moment when she realized that the order in which she put the different colored marshmallows to make a “twizzler DNA” encoded the information contained in every living thing.

A 55bp HaeIII restriction fragment from the genome of a (HPV16) was chosen as the target for detection.  Oligonucleotides corresponding to this target region were synthesised and a plasmid containing this target was generated in order to test our HPV detector.
Background
Human Papilloma virus
HPV is a common pathogen worldwide. The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a small double-stranded DNA virus with a genome of 8000 base pairs. It infects the epithelial cells of skin and mucosa (Cutts et al., 2007). Theses epithelial surfaces (squamous cells) include all areas covered by skin and/or mucosa such as the mouth interior, throat, tongue, tonsils, vagina, cervix, vulva, penis (the urethra - the opening), and anus. Transmission of the virus occurs when these areas come into contact with a virus, allowing it to transfer between epithelial cells. Over 170 HPV types have been identified and, each HPV strain is denoted by a number. Of all the HPV variants, HPV16 is one of the most carcinogenic ""high-risk"" HPV stains. HPV16 is implicated in oropharyngeal (throat) cancer, while it also plays a role in cervical cancer (Muñoz et al., 2003).
It has been postulated that HPV16 infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions of epitheliums; here HPV16 partners with receptors located on the basement membrane such as alpha integrins and laminins. This leads to entry of the virus into basement membrane cells. HPV16 accomplishes entry via clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis (Laniosz et al., 2009) . At this point, the viral genome is transported to the nucleus where it establishes itself at a copy number between 10-200 viral genomes per cell.  HPV Type 16, causes the most incidences of cervical cancer cases worldwide, hence a target from this genome (Ref: NC_001526) was chosen.
HPV16’S L1 gene codes for the L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV16. By spontaneous self-assembly, five of these L1 proteins form a homopentamer called a capsomere (Heino et al., 1995).72 of these capsomeres come together to form a capsids. The caps"

My undergraduate degree is Engineering Bachelor of Science: Chemical Engineering from University of California, Santa Barbara. I have done completed my first 2-month internship for M1 in neurobiology, and iGem will serve as my second internship. I discovered the topic of synthetic biology by taking Jake Wintermute’s course for the AIV Master. In contrast with biology students, I have more knowledge of mathematical modeling and chemistry. I am particularly interested in metabolic engineering. I hope to do what I can to make us all synthetic biology champions.
Zoran Marinkovic
1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
I studied Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb (Croatia) and did a semester long exchange at Uppsala University (Sweden) where I studied Microbial and Evolutionary Genetics and Bioinformatics. Currently, I’m doing a 5 month long internship at INSERM U1001 under the supervision of Jake Wintermute tackling the question of bacterial aging using the synthetic biology approach.  My primary interest is application of synthetic biology for creating bioproducts as well as using synthetic biology in fundamental research. Also, I’m quite interested in developing synthetic biology as a tool for creating living organisms from scratch as we build many non-living constructs today.  I joined iGEM because I would like to experience and observe the process of generating ideas and creating a science project with a group of people which, I hope, will be interesting and fun to do. Of course, it has to be the Grand Prize winning one.

Finally, Dr. Alison Smith of Cambridge University kindly offered us the promoter sequence to use, given that it wasn’t possible to be found in literature references. This saved us an enormous amount of time.
The place of sacrifice: Puchuncavi
As the press points out , Puchuncaví is full of thermal power plants, which have a high environmental impact in the zone. Due to this, our first action was to contact the environmental affairs of the town council. They told us that the resources they had to their disposition were little and there are a few environmental NGOs working in the zone, but the people were very willing to help revert the situation and improve their life conditions.
But not all the scene was devastating in Puchuncaví. Clean Energy, leaded by Andrea Irarrazabal, works day and night capturing the emissions of Ventana I power plant. As Andrea indicates, it has been possible to reduce up to 80% some of the emissions, and algae generate an important biomass volume.
State organizations
Initially inspired by our collaborations , we went to talk with personnel of SAG and Energy Ministry. Once discovered the information that they manage, we decided to investigate more with the sources that were given to us. That is how we obtained the total emissions of Chile from thermoelectric generation (0.83 ton/MWh od CO2, 0.000054 ton/MWh of PM, 0.0013 of NOx and 0.00099 ton/MWh of SO2), learned about carbon credit regulations, decontamination plans, regulation of GMOs, forms of operating GMOs in a safe way, and we could think about the regulations that were missing in our country so that we could progress in a harmonious and safe way.

Puchuncaví and, in general, the other areas that are in the commune, are one of the many emblematic cases of our country referred to environmental conflict, becoming one of the denominated “Sacrifice Zones”.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU#DesignSpace_-_-_TEXT.html,", and the gRNA expression vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.
Phase 2 Results
With our parts of our project well characterized, we began experimenting with achieving a variety of consistent expression levels with our dCAS9-VPR activator. Our first strategy was to attempt multimerizing the target operators, placing two and then three operators up stream of the gene of interest using two of our operators. During this experiment, we also tested the effect of spacing the target operators with a different number of intervening base pairs. We tested with 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 intervening base pairs. The results of these experiments yielded a predictable, linear correlation between the number of operators and the expression level and the number of base pairs in the intervening sequences. The results can be found below:
There were some anomalies within this data set. The target operators with 0 and 12 base pair spacing had lower expression than expected. One explanation is that when the operators are at 0 and 12 base pairs apart, they are on the same side of the DNA helix and crowd each other out. Once we eliminated these results, were able to create a smooth progression in expression level across several levels of expression, as seen below.
Finally, we realized that while we could achieve a wide range of high expression levels, it is sometimes favorable to lower expression levels below the standard single operator expression level. In order to accomplish this, we mutated our operators, replacing a base pair at a time. We tested 20 versions of 2 of our operator plasmids. Each version had one of the twenty base pairs in the twenty base pair operator mutated, so that there was a single mismatch between the operator and the guide RNA attached to the dCAS9-VPR system. By changing the location of the single mismatch, we were able to create another smooth curve of changing expression levels, this time lowering expression levels. The expression levels can be found in the graph below.
Phase 3 Results
Now that we could achieve a variety of expression levels, we began integrating our system into recombination based circuitry. The circuit we used could release a different gRNA for every combination of drugs introduced. Before integrating our multimerized plasmids, we first tested the circuit by making each gRNA correspond to a different fluorescent reporter. The data for"

I. Dilute inoculated cultures. (2 hours)
Flow Cytometer Preparation
Day Before: start overnight cultures of your strains to be tested in SD complete media (NOT YPD, since it has fluorescence background and is problematic for FACS testing)
Day Of: 1. Dilute overnight cultures to final ~OD 0.05-0.1 in the 96 well shaker plate (the saturated overnight cultures should be ~OD 7, so this is approximately a 1:100 dilution. Also, where are the plates? If you don't know, ask and make a note.). Again, use SD complete media and the total volume of each well should be 1 mL. Make a plate map!
Allow cells to enter growth stage by putting on plate shaker for 3 hours at 1000 rpm, 30 degrees C.
Induce with alpha factor. The stock alpha factor in the freezer is 3 mM, and we used it at final concentrations of 0, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 uM. **Please include your concentrations for making the dilutions we used to pipette so that you can quickly and easily refer to this for next time!** Alpha factor cannot be refrozen, so throw away stocks after use.
Allow induction to proceed on plate shaker for 90 min to 2 hours, no longer.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

We therefore accomplished to transfer our artificial Pex5 ‘artico’-receptor including our modified binding pocket region recognizing our modelled PTS1 peptide (PTS1*). When fused to the fluorescent marker protein mTurquoise, our artificial Pex5 facilitates peroxisomal import of the mTurquoise-PTS1* fusion protein indicated by 3D-Sim microscopy.
In return to the help we received from team Aachen we were able to provide them with different plasmids to significantly improve their final project. In the beginning of our collaboration with team Aachen we heard about their problems with building optimized yeast plasmids. For that reason, we introduced them to the yeast toolbox we used which enables the possibility to simplify the process of engineering yeast by creating completely designed plasmids facilitating optimal gene expression and translation for particular purposes in S. cerevisiae. With our golden gate cloning assembly, we designed four different plasmids enabling testing of different promoter strengths for a chloride channel from Arabidopsis thaliana (ATCLCc). We successfully built three yeast optimized plasmids containing the ATCLCc gene with different promotors (Gal1, Sac6, RPL18B) and a fourth plasmid for genome integration containing URA 3’ and 5’ homologies. Correctness of each plasmid was verified by performing restriction digests and sanger sequencing, respectively.
Once we finished the cloning and verification of each plasmid we gave them to team Aachen, allowing them to improve their project results significantly by providing the availability of another vacuolar anion transporter. Thanks to our effort, iGEM Aachen was able to utilize this chloride channel in their yeast based system used for water preparation properly.
Optogenetics seminar
Optogenetics offers high spatiotemporal control of well defined events within living cells and therefore qualifies for a broad range of synthetic biological applications. Duesseldorf's last team successfully used optogenetics to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and given that experience, we decided to arrange an optogenetics seminar to share our knowledge with other teams. With that, we hope to reach as many iGEM teams as possible in order to provide essentials in performance of optogenetic experiments. Additionally, we wanted to extend our iGEM teams “toolbox” with one more tool of control.
Our offer found international approval by the teams of Darmstadt , Heidelberg , Paris and Taiwan . Since the teams of Paris and Taiwan could not attend the seminar"

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,", but they taught us that the beauty of science truly lies within the messy yet fun aspects of scientific experimentation.
Below is a general outline of the 7-week lesson plans during our collaboration with YOURS.
Every lesson began with a mentor-mentee game and recap of the last week.
The mentees were also given this survey at the beginning and end of the program.
Week
Lesson Plan
1: What is science?
We gave a lab tour of the iGEM space. Then, we taught a mini-lesson about working with DNA and plasmids.
2: Why should we care about DNA?
We explained the forms of DNA in different organisms. We also talked about how scientists can manipulate genes, and then related that to what Cornell iGEM does. We extracted DNA from strawberries and learned how to pipet. The kids played around with different colored water, writing down the amounts of each color that they pipetted to create their own color. Then, they gave their recipe to a friend to see if that friend could make the color too.
3: How do we know we have the right one?
We learned about antibiotic resistance and compared two plates with colonies: one with antibiotic in the agar, and one without. Next, we explained how gel electrophoresis works and practiced loading a gel.
4: What are proteins?
We asked the kids what proteins were, and talked about amino acids, which make up proteins. Next, we delved in deeper into enzymes, which are a type of protein that causes chemical reactions. We explored the different kinds of proteins in everyday solutions. The kids mixed milk with an acid and soymilk with magnesium sulfate and saw the protein precipitating out. We measured the amount of protein and collected the data.
5: All about bacteria!
We gave a lesson on what bacteria is and what it can be used for. Next, each mentee was given an agar plate split into four quadrants, and was asked to pick four places around the building to swab bacteria onto the plate. Next, we explained the benefits of using bacteria to hold the genes that we want. We showed the kids how to grow bacteria in LB cultures, explaining that this was the first step to getting a plasmid out of bacteria. Finally, we gave an overview of our project and bacterial coldwater disease.
6: Fish Hatchery Tour
We took the kids to Bath Hatchery, where an employee gave us a tour. We were able to feed the fish, see where they were housed, and learn about the day to day operations at the fish hatchery.
7: Celebration!

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," beginning of our adventure. It was a great opportunity for our two teams to build relationships and think together about a collaborative project. After several exchanges we decided to start a collaboration around the LL-37 (a human antibiotic of the class of cathelicidins). Our ultimate goal was to clone LL-37 with an AviTag to be biotinylated in Pichia pastoris. The big idea was to use our Cerberus platform in the Montpellier project and include a new functionalisation of cellulose. We had a second project whose goal was to prove the biological activity of scygonadin on the vaginal flora. Some of the clonings have been performed but we did not have enough time for completion of this task.

Aalto-Helsinki iGEM Team
We met members of the Aalto-Helsinki team at the European meetup in Munich and after discussing both of our projects, we concluded that a collaboration was possible. We talked on Skype and found out we had the same construction with our Carbohydrate-Binding Module but we were not experimenting on the same material: they were using cellulose nanofibrils from birch and we were using bacterial cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter hansenii. We decided to perform our CBM affinity tests on both materials. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to test each other's material but it was a great opportunity to compare our projects.
iGEM France
Thanks to Grenoble ’s initiative, we were honoured to take part in the iGEM France journey. This newly created association aims to promote mutual aid between French teams and discussions about their difficulties. We had meetings every month through Skype to talk about the role of the association and define projects together to strengthen the connections between French teams. This experience allowed us to contact the teams from Montpellier and Laval (yes, we love french speaking teams!) with whom we have undertaken some great collaborations
Meetups
4th Parisian Meetup
On the 4th of July, we gathered with all the French iGEM teams to participate in the 4th Parisian meetup organised by the Pasteur Paris iGEM team . It was the first time that we presented our project to others and we got the feedback of a jury composed of various professionals. It was very interesting and helpful to receive advice from the jury and the other iGEM teams, so as to improve our presentation and our way to communicate about our project.

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," At first, the two genes LPE and GFP should be amplified to get the right overhangs. This is so, because the genes was ordered as the BioBrick standard. Therefore, primers were designed to incorporate a part of the vector to the 5’ end of LPE, a part of 5’ end of GFP to the 3’ end of LPE and a part of 5’ end of PCT to 3’ end of GFP. The reason for this is to make Gibson Assembly to insert all four genes into the vector pHT254. The PCR product showed that both genes were amplified, and gave a band as the correct sizes (Fig. 16A). Also, no unspecific binding was seen, meaning that PCR purification could be carried out for both of them.
After the initial PCR, the two genes had to be fused to make one construct. The reason for this is because Gibson Assembly will have a higher success rate with as few constructs, meaning that as few constructs as possible is beneficial.
The first time the fusion PCR was carried out did not show a band at the expected size of 2.4 kb (Fig. 17). Instead a band was seen around 1 kb. This could indicate that GFP along with a bit of LPE attached to its 5’ end. This could have been verified by sequencing - however, we choose not to, because the PCR protocol was tried to be optimized instead by looking into the PCR program, and especially the annealing temperature. These optimization steps did not work out as assumed, and no band at the expected size was seen after the PCR.
These not successful approaches to get the fusion between LPE and GFP led us to look into the primer design. We found that the overhang between LPE and GFP might have been too big, and therefore new primers were designed to reduce the overhang, and the thereby enhance the chance for success for the fusion PCR. The PCR products after amplification can be seen in Figure 16B. After purification, a new fusion PCR was carried out (Fig. 18).
As figure 18 shows, the fusion PCR did not work. Again, a band around 1 kb is seen instead of the expected size of 2.4 kb. The PCR reaction was then again tried to be optimized, however none of optimized PCR reactions showed the correct band - except for one. One of the fusion PCRs did work (Fig. 19). As it can be seen this is a very weak band that arose at the expected size. This piece was cut out, and a"

Project Management
Our team consists of more than 30 members who are involved into very different parts of the project. Of course, the larger part of the team is involved into the lab work at some point, but other tasks have to be covered: financial resources need to be acquired, collaborations have to be set up, digital solutions demand programming and networking, and last but not least our immense focus on science communication and public relations required some manpower (or womanpower) behind it.
How can such a large team work?
As a first and most important basic rule, we took the dictum “divide and conquer” to heart: no one can do everything, and even more, no one likes to do everything. Every member of our team thus associated to one or several subteams he or she personally felt most enticing. These subteams included the following affiliations:
Science Team, further divided into
In Vitro RNA sensor design (Team 0)
Sensor synthesis (Team 1)
Sensor screening/Cell free expression (Team 2)
Fundraising Team
Entrepreneurship Team
Public Relations & Collaborations Team
We embraced a strategy of low hierarchies: Henrik Sadlowski was named project leader, and each subteam also had a team leader. However, each team member had high personal responsibility and the authority to independently make decisions in his or her field of expertise.
In order to ensure the individual team members in their subteams working as interlocking parts towards one goal, another key feature was required: communication. Throughout the months, we set up several interlocking strategies in order to keep information flowing between and within subteams. One part of the communication took place online – Trello, a free web-based project management application, helps to divide tasks and set deadlines. Furthermore, the Science team used Benchling, a life science data management and collaboration platform, as means of a digital lab notebook. The digital communication in place, we also set up strategies for actual face-to-face communication.

Warsaw,2012,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," J63003 and K165002 Kozak sequence) and RFP (to confirm expression in mammalian cells). To confirm expression in E. coli cells, we used the construct with SF-GFP
Another main construct was devoted for using directly in mammalian cells. It was based on BioBricks from partregistry with our new part containing oriP. To allow the plasmid to replicate in a mammalian cell, we prepared a BioBrick containing oriP and coding sequence of EBNA1 gene (which is essential for oriP to work properly) from Epstein-Barr virus. We got the sequence of oriP from pCep4 commercial plasmid available from Invitrogen. We had been trying to receive this BioBrick using PCR method.
Unfortunately, the original oriP sequence had a restriction site of SpeI enzyme in the middle of the sequence. We decided to amplify this in two separate parts, because in this situation we could modify enzyme site by placing it in the middle of the primer for one of the parts. After amplification, we planned to ligate these two parts into one full BioBrick. Unluckily, we didn't manage to fulfill our plan. When we realized that we fail with preparing this part that way, we tried to get this BioBrick even with this illegal restriction site and just clone it without using SpeI enzyme. After several attempts, we got this BioBrick and ligated it with the construct containing CMV, RBS and RFP. Unfortunately when we received it, we were already running out of time and didn't manage to confirm the sequence of this part and test it in mammalian cells.
The design of the constructs looked like this:
Second step
Then we entered the wet lab and started preparing our BioBricks made of DNA, not only pixels on the computer screen ;)
We decided to achieve our promoters, RBS and terminator parts with method called in our laboratory “PCR without template”. It goes like this:
For each part we designed two starters that covered each other in about 20bp on 3' ends
Each primer had prefix or suffix (depending on the primer) on its 5' end
Then we prepared PCR reaction mixture
We used Taq polymerase MasterMix and primers in different concentrations
We didn't add any DNA template
We calculated the annealing temperature by oligocalculator
For first three cycles of PCR reaction temperature was calculated for primer without overhang
Then for thirty more cycles temperature of annealing was calculated for the whole long primer with overhang – that is because from this"

This configuration also allows the library to be used at any finger position because proline ends the OPEN linker.
Updates on the program
The program appears to run extremely slowly because of the computationally intensive step of checking the reverse translated sequences
In addition to checking for the primers and cutsites, we also have to check for 'GGGGGG' because it can lead to undesirable structures forming. In addition, we have to check for the reverse complements for all these undesirable sequences.
We decided on a similarity of 0.8 as the maximum acceptable similarity between the sequence the primer bind to and any other part of the generated sequence. If the sequences are too similar, the primer might mishybridize. We originally had a similarity threshold of 0.6 but that made the program run too slowly, so we decided on a threshold of 0.8.

Sequencing:
the following samples from 6/27 were sent to Genewiz for sequencing:
PyrF F, R (one sample with PyrF_F, one with PyrF_R)
rpoz F, R (one sample with rpoz_F, one with rpoz_R)
Lambda red results:
the colonies on the plates did not look promising, and the ones we chose and grew up in LB+kan did not actually grow.  Just to be certain, we choose 18 more colonies: 6 from 37.5µL arabinose 100µL plated, 6 from 3.75µL arabinose 100µL plated, and 6 from 37.5µL arabinose 1.5mL plated.  Three from each plate were grown in plain LB and three with kan. We will let it grow in 30˚C, overnight if necessary, and hopefully see bacteria for PCR.
Assuming this does not work, we prepared more ∆HisB∆PyrF∆rpoZ+pKD46 in two ways: we put 3 colonies in LB+amp from the 6/16 transformation plate, and we streaked a new amp plate from the glycerol stock
Another possibility is that something is wrong with our lambda red. We designed primers to verify that the pKD46 plasmid is really in the cells.

Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory elements. To sum up, we investigated all input elements for     promoters and classify these elements in terms of their function, affect     and required input element for them. So, we suggest that terminology     used for regulation of transcription should be defined clearly on iGEM’s     website and correct use of terminology should be enforced.
The second group of parameters was collected under the title “Output”,     which refers to products of functional genes. In contradiction, the     term “reporter” has also been described within the same list. Reporters     are also genes whose products, can be used for screening as an output.     According to our group, the usage of the term “reporter” for genes is     unnecessary and cause extra complexity for information distribution     and gives rise to discrepancies. Instead of using the term “reporter”,     predefined “gene” description should be used for genes, which can function     as reporters. The special information which is related with the characteristic     of that gene should also be presented on part info web page.
Furthermore, the same terminology “reporter” was used for both atomic     parts and composite bio-bricks. Also the overall image descriptions     for these were defined as “reporters”. We want to point out that using     same nomenclature for both atomic genes and for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both atomic     parts and for whole constructs is not a good practice. Instead, we are     suggesting the usage of other available terminology for the parts listed     as reporters, which most of the constructs, now known as reporters,     can be grouped into, such as “protein generators”, “composite parts”     or “inverters”.
Devices are whole constructs which are functional and have specific     and distinct functions. But, as we have observed, unfortunately, the     term “device” is also being used for parts which are not functional     and do not have specific functional at all. Moreover, within the classification     of devices, we argue that some terms are also being used unnecessarily     and ambiguously. Devices are classified into five types which are protein     generators, reporters, inverters, receivers and senders, measurement     devices. For example iGEM defines protein generators as:
Protein generator = promoter + rbs +gene + terminator
Though we accept the definition for protein generators, we observed     that there exist numerous parts"

--CB MM TR--Drafted an email to send to NEB in order to obtain the HindIII RM genes to put into N. multiformis for prevention of lateral gene transfer.
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi#alnHdr_490282362 : We did a protein BLAST of the gene immediately downstream from the Nmul_A0428(serA) gene and found that is most likely involved in UDP-glucose epimerase production.  We could find evidence either way for how vital it is for life of the cell, so we don’t want to include our own promoter on the gene we insert using homologous recombination in case that messes up the cell and causes loss of viability.

--CB MM TR--Dr. Grose received an email back from the NEB representative for our area which said we could get the requested plasmid if we filled out a Materials Transfer Agreement.  We decided that since we wouldn’t be able to put our work in the iGEM registry, and we should have all of our genes in the chromosome, that we are just going to forget about the lateral gene transfer prevention.

Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
Plating and growing cultures of mycelia
Mycelium is able to grow on almost any substrate, so long as the substrate contains sufficient nutrients and is not toxic to the fungus. Though various substrates were tested, a standardized substrate is required to observe the growth of mycelium in different conditions. It has also been found that the growth medium of Potato Dextrose Yeast Agar (PDYA) provides the optimal nutrients for mycelium growth [1, 2], without providing excessive nutrients that will encourage bacterial growth and contamination. The solid PDYA growth medium used in the lab consisted of 2.0% dextrose, 0.10% potato extract, 0.15% yeast extract, 1% agar, and 96.50% water. When growing the mycelium as a liquid culture, the liquid PDY growth medium is composed of 2.0% dextrose, 0.10% potato extract, 0.15% yeast extract, and 97.50% Water [3]. The mycelium can then begin to grow on the PDYA medium by extracting a small piece from the live fungus onto the plate, as shown in the sequence of images below.

Results
Figure 1 - We're interested in the largest slope (velocity) of the curve, here we see that the increase in slope stops after a certain increase in the starting velocity. A rate limiting step! Rate limiting steps
Articles have shown the reaction catalysed by Dxs to be the rate limiting step, Source: Sprenger GA, Schorken U, Wiegert T, Grolle S, De Graaf AA, Taylor SV, Begley TP, Bringer-Meyer S, Sahm H (1997) Identification of a thiamin-dependent synthase in Escherichia coli required for the formation of the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate precursor to isoprenoids, thiamin, and pyridoxol. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:12857–12862 (Link) and we asked the question: If we were to manipulate this step, which step would then be rate limiting? Simulating reaction kinetics often leads to stiff systems, and this is no exception. Traditional methods of solving differential equations therefore did not suffice, and MATLAB’s ODE15s, which is an L-stable solver, was used.
Simulations showed that the next rate limiting step would occur after an improvement in rate of conversion of 12 percent, and that this new rate limiting step was the reaction catalysed by IspG, as seen below. This result is worth keeping in mind when deciding on the design of the plasmids. Namely, if there is time to spare, then cloning ispG into the system might further enhance functionality.
Repeating the simulation with the increased velocities (i.e. post-modifying of Dxs and IspG), it is seen that IspF catalysed the third rate limiting step. IspF would thus be an enzyme of interest, if the system was to be further improved.
Economy
Figure 2 - Here we see how much DXP reacts to B1 vitamin. As it's reversible, it stops producing B1 vitamin faster, than the cell can use it, which is indicated by the horizontal line. But still what we throw exponentially more and more out as a function of the speed of the pathway. The second question posed concerned the economy of the system. That is, does the increase in velocity through the pathway result in increased product, or does the substrates exit the pathway at"

TB buffer for competent cells (Inoue)
Uses
TB buffer is used to make chemically competent cells by the Inoue method
Materials
PIPES buffer 0.5M solution pH 6.7  (sterilized, made with milli-Q pure H2O, store at -20C)
Manganese chloride tetrahydrate
Calcium chloride dihydrate
Potassium chloride
Potassium hydroxide 1M solution
Sterile 0.22 μm bottle top filter
vacuum source
clean glassware (no detergent residue -- clean with 70% EtOH)
Preparation
For a 1 liter solution add:
250 mM potassium chloride (18.65 g)
15 mM calcium chloride (2.2 g)
10 mM PIPES (20 ml of an 0.5 M solution)
to 800 ml of DI water.  Adjust pH to 6.7 with 1M KOH.
Dissolve
55 mM manganese chloride (10.88 g)
in 100 ml of DI water, add gradually to the solution of the remaining components.  Bring solution to 1 liter.  The pH of the solution will fall, which is expected.
Do not attempt to adjust the pH.  Adding base after adding manganese will precipitate a yellow/brown hydroxide.
Sterile filter with a pre-washed 0.22 μm filter and store indefinitely at 4 degrees.

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Eugenie
TOOL OVERVIEW
Eugenie is a multi-touch application for designing biological circuits using the programming language Eugene . The visual language we created for Eugenie allows synthetic biologists to harness the power of Eugene without having to write Eugene code. The application consists of three representations of the circuit: “TreeView,” “FlowView,” and “EugeneView.” The user can search through Clotho and iGEM databases to find the biological parts desired and can drag them to the workspace, graphically create Eugene rules, and view live-updating Eugene code for the circuit. After the user is done specifying a circuit, she or he can then view the search results, which display the possible permutations of a circuit based on a collection of parts. This process is meant to be iterative, so users can go back and add more properties and behavior specifications if they would like to prune the results.
Design
The design process is divided into three main views: TreeView, FlowView, and EugeneView. A user starts by searching for parts from the Part Registry or their Clotho database and bringing them into their worskspace. In the TreeView, users can specify the order and structure of their design. The behavior of parts in the device is specified using the FlowView. Users specify structure and behavior using a visual language that we developed specifically for the application; the language utilizes SBOL symbols, an open-source standard for in silico representation of genetic designs. The EugeneView updates automatically throughout the design process, and users may click on individual parts in order to see the corresponding code highlighted in the EugeneView. Finally, users may view and export their results to a CSV or Pigeon files in the ResultsView.
Create the structure of the circuit in the TreeView.
Define rules between parts in the FlowView.
View live-updating Eugene code in the EugeneView.
Generate and export results in the ResultsView.
Implementation

Overview
As the Wellesley College iGEM team, one of our principle goals is to reach out to the young population in and around Boston and educate them about the exciting field of synthetic biology. We also aim to expose young adults to computing, highlighting the power of applying computational thinking to problem solving.
Our goal is to spark the interest of middle and high school students in synthetic biology and in computing through a short presentation and an interactive installation. We created a presentation that provide students with a brief background in synthetic biology and gives them an opportunity to learn about the work that we have done over the summer.   The interactive installation provides the students with a more hands-on approach to the design and construction of genetic constructs. Our installation was designed to expose students to the concepts of biological parts, modularity, lab protocols, and safety. Through these activities we hope to encourage students to consider the possibility of entering the field of synthetic biology in the future.   We want them to see the current and potential future applications of this field and how rewarding careers in synthetic biology and in computing can be!
SynFlo
Description
We introduced the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound group to Synthetic Biology concepts and let them interact with the SynFlo project.
Framingham High School
This summer, we participated in the Wellesley College Science Outreach program and integrated Madeline Barowsky , a Framingham High School student, into our team. As part of the program she worked with team members for approximately 60 hours and helped to develop Synbio Search and the Moclo Planner.  She learned about the synthetic biology workflow, user centered design and the basics of programming using C# and XAML. At the end of the summer she presented in the Wellesley Science Center poster session.
Summer Poster Session
At the end of the summer research program, each student presented a poster summarizing the work they had done over the summer and explained it to the Wellesley College community and the Town of Wellesley.

Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer. All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team. Future applications of our genetic system could be in regards to bio-remediation.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and/or environmental safety?
The researcher is not being exposed to any sort of biological element that would cause serious harm to him or her in anyway. The strand of E. coli being utilized in our project would not be resilient in the human body, should contamination occur. Thus, there is very little risk of infection from our bacteria. All other researcher activities use standard biological engineering and molecular biology protocols and methods that pose little harm to the researcher when proper safety precautions are observed. Some testing involving radiation is involved, but that testing would be done independently of our research group in a controlled facility.   Our project idea could actually promote public and environmental"

In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under the presence of S. pneumoniae. In search for the suitable gene circuit, the discovery by Prof. Morrison on the competence for genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae which depends on quorum-sensing system to control many competence-specific genes acting in DNA uptake, processing, and integration has provided the ideal framework for this module. (Lee and Morrison, 1999) There is a link between this quorum-sensing system and the competence-specific genes, which is an alternative σx (ComX protein) that serves as a competence-specific global transcription modulator. (Luo and Morrison, 2003) In S. pneumoniae, competence (a state capable of being genetic transformed) happens transiently during the log phase growth, and is regulated by a quorum sensing system utilizing the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Upon stimulation by CSP, σx will be expressed and associated with RNA polymerase apoenzyme. The resulting holoenzyme will then be guided by σx to initiate transcription of a set of “late” genes enabling genetic transformation and other unknown functions. Characterized genes regulated by σx were found to contain an 8 base pairs consensus sequence TACGAATA known as the Cin-Box or the Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now able to produce the S. pneumoniae sensing device of high specificity by incorporating this system into E. coli.
iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST Team has cloned σx from S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 and characterized its ability to initiate transcription of two downstream promoters with different lengths: PcelA ( BBa_K1379000 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_K1379001 ), which have the consensus Com-Box sequence. Though much information about the promoters is readily available nowadays, its characterization of promoter activity, specificity, sequence, as well as the biomolecular mechanism can be greatly enhanced with further investigations and experiments. Hence, we were interested in reproducing this gene circuit with all the associated genes and promoters to be combined into a single transcriptional unit. Despite the suggested susceptibility to leakage and other factors that may hinder or interrupt the mechanism, researches have reported that the pathway was highly specific to certain environmental conditions and stress, suggesting minimal or no leakage"
