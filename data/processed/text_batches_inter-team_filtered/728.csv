William_and_Mary,2017,Team:William and Mary#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," emphasized the importance of supplemental materials like worksheets which reinforce and complement          the material presented in the videos, and we incorporated these suggestions into the design of LearnSynBio.
for a PDF of more examples of learnsynbio exercises, click here.
Because LearnSynBio is hosted on an independent domain, it is easily accessible anywhere by anyone and can easily          be maintained and updated with feedback from teachers who use it. This allows our outreach efforts to continue even          in places and times where we cannot be physically present!
Finally, we are taking measures to get LearnSynBio incorporated into actual classrooms: We have established a          collaboration with the high school team Broad Run iGEM (see Collaborations page) to incorporate our modules into          their advanced science classes and after-school science clubs. Additionally, we are working with some of our former          high school teachers to introduce LearnSynBio to VAST, the Virginia Association of Science Teachers, for incorporation          in classrooms all around the state. Lastly, it is our hope that the presentation of LearnSynBio at the Jamboree          will encourage the spread of LearnSynBio to schools all around the world!
BwB
In addition to LearnSynBio, we also completed several public outreach events. We were awarded a grant from Building            with Biology  to host public outreach events over the course of the iGEM 2016 season.
We held a science workshop          targeted at at local children and their parents which allowed them to get some hands-on experience with the exciting          world of modern biology. We had more than 70 people in attendance and together we extracted DNA from strawberries,          learned about synthetic biology and the benefit of standard biological parts, and discussed our questions and concerns          with GMO food.
We also held a forum on the topic of Genome Editing targeted at the general public. At the forum, we briefly discussed          the implications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool and explored various ways that it could be applied to real          world problems. Among the topics discussed were: stabilizing the Honeybee population by increasing expression of          ‘hygiene’ genes, engineering yeast for efficient biofuel production, and using CRISPR to decrease human susceptibility          to HIV infection. We had over 30 participants for the forum and we received great feedback from our attendees!

The most likely area of bacteria accomodation seems to be bioremediation. These oil companies are dedicated to preserve/restore the natural environment around their oil sands, and are looking for ways to improve on cleaning after the oils. There has to be some bacteria that mediates natural bioremediation because oil is sometimes naturally degraded over some amount of time. But where are they? Time for some hide and seek...

Movement of Lab Equipment to the Green Lab in Second Life
I did some further duplication of the lab equipment to the green lab. I found that I had to modify the DNA extraction activity scripts to match the new positioning and thus new coordination for the movement of the components involved in that activity. This took longer than I expected, as the rotations were also changed.
Navigational System in the Wiki
I did some modifications to the front page of the wiki:
There is now a navigational bar that directs people to the sitemap.
The navigational bar also will have a 'tour' that will guide people through important points on our webpage: such as the overall project, our team, etc.
The sitemap is still under construction, it will include a description of buttons which mark the work of different sub-teams in addition to the links and brief descriptions to all the pages.
A Clustrmap and stat counter has also been provided on the webpage for those who are interested.

Fort Mac- Oil Sands Tour
Today, we arrived at the airport at 7:00, waited for the U of A students and together we headed for the oil sands tour. We visited the Suncore and Syncrude buttemen lakes, fields where mining operations were taking place and few well known landmarks of these two companies. The tour guide thoroughly explained what was going on, where we were headed and gave us a little briefing about its history. We also saw some of the HUGE machinaries used to extract tar sands and take them to the separating factory. For example, one of the machines was a massive water wheel attached to a ridiculously long conveyor belt to transport the goods.
It was also interesting to find out how much truck drivers made, how much each machine cost and how expensive each tire cost. (Apprently, one of the huge trucks alone cost 6.5 million dollars and each jumbo sized wheel cost nearly $70 000 on top of that!!!). We took a lot of pictures of the land, machines, land marks and the team. We also"

Today the new prefix primer (Cage Prefix #2) came in. We resuspended it, made more agarose gels,  and ran a PCR with the first-round product containing the his-tag, the new prefix primer, and the suffix. We ran the PCR product on a gel, but got absolutely no bands at all. Tomorrow we will run another PCR with the new prefix primer and the first round suffix to see verify if the new prefix primer works. If it does, then the only problem is still the second suffix primer.

Phillip's notes
Introduction:  A PCR will be done to amplify the gBlock with the primers that incorporate NdeI and XhoI for pET22b.  This is in order to determine if a similar problem persists with the non-specific band and low product yield.  In addition, buffers for cell lysis will be prepared if the reagents are available.
Procedures:
PCR amplification with primers for pET22b:
Using the NEB Tm calculator, the annealing temperatures chosen were 64C, 68C, and 72C.  The following reaction components were combined in a mastermix, and 24uL were aliquotted to 3 reaction tubes. 5x Q5 buffer, 5uL 2mM dNTP, 7.5uL 20uM primer for pET22b forward, 1.875uL 20uM primer for pET22b reverse, 1.875uL 1ng/uL template, 0.75uL Q5 polymerase, 0.75uL ddH2O, 45.75uL
The thermocycler conditions were the same as on 07/24/15.  The PCR product was then ran on a 1% agarose gel for 20 minutes.

We constructed the promoter with dCas9 gene and the                         promoter of sgRNA, Snr52p, with the sgRNA in the plasmid as follows. The two                         different sgRNAs were designed to inhibit ndi1 and yno1.

The results of fluorescence intensity are as follows.
Fig 2 Fluorescence intensity before and 1 hour after adding H2O2.
As the experimental result of other parts, we added 2% galactose into                         medium, and added 1μl H2O2 before testing fluorescence intensity. We                         believe that the data after one hour of processing is the most reliable. We chose four                         promoters later, which were the strongest one, trr1p, the weakest one, glr1p, and                         two mild, sod2p and glr1p. We confirmed the promoter in next step of the                         experiment.
Construction of dCas9-sgRNA plasmid
We respectively replaced the original promoter of dCas9 with promoters                         mentioned above and transformed them into yeast cells. We observed that the yeast cells with                         promoter trx2p grew fastest so we decided to choose trx2p as the final promoter.                         We tested the inhibitory effect through growth curve. We used the ndi1/yno1 overexpressed strain and obtained growth curve through its OD600. As shown by the growth curve,                         the growth of the strain with the dCas9-sgRNA plasmid was similar to that of the original                         strain, and superior to the strain overexpressing ndi1/yno1.This result proves that our                         feedback part works well.

σx(BBa_K1379004)
Introduction
To test the functionality of σX, we first enable constitutive expression of σX in the σX Generator, BBa_K1379006 .  The generator was then assembled with the standard promoter measurement kit BBa_E0240 , with either promoter PcelA ( Promoter only: BBa_K1379000 , w/ BBa_E0240 : BBa_K1379002 ) and PcomFA (Promoter only: BBa_K1379001 ,  w/ BBa_E0240 : BBa_K1379003 ). E. coli colonies holding the resulting  constructs in pSB3K3 were observed under fluorescent macroscope with UV filter. Measurement kit for standard reference promoter BBa_J23101 ,  which is BBa_I20260 was used as a positive control; BBa_E0240 was used as the general negative control for background fluorescence. Measurement kits for PcelA and PcomFA without σX Generator were used   as negative controls for function of σX.
Results
Figure 1. PcelA and PcomFA promoters activated in presence of σX.
Only in the presence of σX would PcelA and PcomFA be turned on, as GFP expression could        be seen when σX is present. Therefore, σX is functional.  PcelA and PcomFA gave little GFP signal in the        absence of σX but has comparable activity as reference promoter BBa_J23101 in presence of σX. Scale bar = 5mm.
PcelA (BBa_K1379000) and PcomFA (BBa_K1379001)

Due to the low yield of our transformations and minipreps, we have now decided to troubleshoot our transformation procedures. To do this, we will be doing a transformation with Tarun, a graduate mentor to the team. We will be using Tarun's procedures and supplies. We will also have a control plate that will contain cells that had no DNA inserted. If these transformations succeed, then we will have narrowed the possibilities of what went wrong with our procedures. Tarun's transformation procedure can be found on the here . We performed these test transformations with BBa_I13602 (CFP).
Upon closer inspection of the AIDA-1 biobrick (BBa_K257018), we have found the following problems
the sequencing is bad
there are large gaps from the sequencing as compared to what was documented. Specifically, the sequenced biobrick was missing approximately 500bp
the sequence was supposed to be 1326bp long. We have decided that it would cost too much to have the biobrick sequenced ourselves
the gel is bad
For the above reasons, we have decided to not use AIDA-1. After reevaluating the other adhesion options, we have decided to use Curli (BBa_342003). Due to its inconsistant sequencing, we have decided to have the part found in the kit sequenced ourselves.

Ran 50uL restriction digest.  In each tube we put 5uL BSA, 5uL multicore buffer, 10 uL H2O, and 27uL DNA and 1.5uL each of two enzymes.  For J63001, this turned out to be 1001.7ng of DNA and we used EcoRI and SpeI.  For J63002, this turned out to be 796.5ng of DNA and we used EcoRI and XbaI.
Stuck in incubator for 2 hours.  After incubation, put in heating block at 70 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes to kill the enzymes.  Then stuck them in the freezer.
6/13/08
Discovered that our parts from Caroline were on the way.  As such, we decided to make a lot of plates in preparation for their arrival.
First batch:
BactoAgar 10.0012g + 10.0021g = 20.0033g
LB Broth 10.0345g +  10.0144g = 20.1785g
Added 0.1008 g of AMP to mixture
Put into plates (make sure mixture is cool)
Note:  The agar was slightly burned when stirring on the hot plate.  This was primarily due to using too much heat to boil the agar and also due to stopping the stirring within the flask.  Will have to be more careful next time.
Second batch:
BactoAgar 10.0190g
LB Broth  10.0113g
Added 0.0502 g of AMP to mixture
Put into plates (make sure mixture is cool)

Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year with the iGEM Calgary team and I have been involved primarily with the reporter , linker , and wiki design elements of the project. My main interest has been in testing the potential of chemically modified ferritin nano-particles as a reporter system for our project. Between working in the lab and harassing Keith about the design of the wiki you can find me on the golf course or ensuring that my car is spotless. Going into the future I am pursuing entrance into medical school to further my career. iGEM has been an invaluable experience for many of the trials I will face going forward with life.
Denny Hoang
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year in the iGEM team and I've largely played a role in the reporter part of the team. I've been previously exposed in a lab involving environmental microbiology, thus this experience has given me the opportunity learn many different techniques and skills used in synthetic biology.  In my spare time I've enjoyed playing soldier, snowboarding and reading novels.
Patrick Wu
Biomedical Technology (1st Year Masters)
After four years of undergrad (and three years of iGEM) I am now working on my Masters of Biomedical Technology here at the University of Calgary. This is now my fourth year as a part of iGEM, though I now act as a part-time advisor/consultant/distraction to the team. I am very excited to see how user-centered design can be applied to non-traditional fields like biology, and iGEM never disappoints me with all the cool ideas that come out. In my spare time, you can probably find me fiddling around with Photoshop and Illustrator, or asleep. Sleep is always nice.

Activity 1: Road show at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
What we identified and investigated:
Since the aim of our project is to build a mutagenesis library, we considered current application and the public ideas on mutation and gene modification.  Firstly, we investigated the trials and related products in recent years online. For example, space radiation is used to obtain mutants of green pepper. Wheat is treated with gene editing to stop the common wheat diseases. Furthermore, an online investigation was conducted to search for data and information about the general opinion of the public in China towards mutation and gene modified product. From a research of Zhang &Wang (2013), we found the general attitudes of the public towards gene modified food. We managed valuable information and generate a pie chart to briefly state the findings.
It shows that 44.90% of the public have a vague perception about mutation and gene modification and over 40% think gene modified food is harmful for health (Zhang &Wang，2013).
How we addressed:
According to the results we investigated, we try to address bioethics and safety about mutation and gene modification to the public to relief their worries on gene modified food. On April 16th, 2016, we planned a part in the Road show at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum to deliver related basic knowledge to promote the perception of the public. Four iGEM teams (SJTU-Shanghai, Tongji University, NYU-Shanghai and XJTLU-CHINA) made collaboration.
During the whole day, about 800 teenagers from 5 years old to 16 years old visited to the museum. We prepared lectures related to mutation and health based on teenagers’ level to broad their horizons and clear the public perception related to mutation and bioethics, such as genetically modified food. Extensive applications for mutagenesis library are elucidated on our team poster in Chinese, which attract public attention. Some people"

One statement says that ""life"" is just a description of a class of interactions, and therefore there is nothing special about it more so than the name. This is a rather materialisitic point of view, and shows a standpoint that is particularly assessed in question 16.
Some believe that the answer is a matter of cost/benefit, where the question depends on how much value life would lose compared to how many lives would benefit materially and intellectually. There is one argument stating that research should not aim for understanding life, but should rather focus their efforts on benefits for the public (in terms of e.g. medical research).
When interpreting the answers, it seems that the possible effect of the pursuit of understanding life as described in the question is not a reason to stop the research, mostly because people argue that the value of life cannot be changed or might even be enhanced by understanding the mechanisms of life. When including the other-answers, a majority of 90% would not pull back from fundamental research on the principles of living matter.
Graph 3.
3. In biology, evolution is the change in the genetic material of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. Should mankind modify organisms (direct its evolution) by the use of genetic engineering?
Yes, because it has known benefits
Yes, because we have the moral obligation to apply genetic engineering if it is possibly beneficial
No, because we cannot foresee the consequences and implications of our actions when we interfere with evolution
No, because evolution is a natural process that research should not interfere with
Other:...
Synthetic biology can be explained as (re-)engineering biological systems with the use of genetic engineering tools. Most iGEM teams deal with genetic modifications and constructing BioBricks to achieve their goal, which why we expected most people to vote yes to genetic engineering. 62% of the survey participants believes that mankind should apply genetic engineering  to modify organisms, mostly because it has known benefits, but also because of moral obligations towards the possible beneficial outcomes.
Nevertheless, 15% believes that the implications of interfering with evolution cannot be foreseen, and argues that mankind should not use genetic engineering. Only 4% thinks that evolution should not be meddled with because of its natural character. In total, 19% of the sample does not feel comfortable with genetic engineering in the light of interfering with evolution, which is more than we anticipated from a group expected to be involved in using genetic engineering principles.

One primary theme that comes forward from the open answers is the usefulness of applying genetic engineering"
British_Columbia,2011,Team:British Columbia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," fall. After my fantastic experience as a UBC iGEM team member last year, I decided to stay on the team for another great year of learning, research experience, friendship, and memories. This year, I am on the wetlab track once again and am working with the beta-pinene synthase to create a biobrick part and to overexpress it in yeast to characterize it under GPD and GAL promoters, with and without the erg20-2 and IDI1 gene.
Vicki Ma I completed a Bachelor of Science at UBC this year, and will be going to McGill in the fall to study Occupational Therapy with my fiance (we're recently engaged!) who is beginning his Masters in Medical Physics. This is my second year with UBC iGEM, and I am excited to share my experiences from last year as well as create new memories and stories from this year. My main wetlab role is to obtain limonene synthase from the biobrick registry and overexpress it in yeast for characterization purposes in order to meet the gold medal criteria. I am also assisting the beta-pinene synthase track to yield a variety of yeast plasmids for characterization purposes. At the same time, I am working on formatting and designing our wiki.
Joe Ho I am a 4th year science student at UBC, with the interest of virology and molecular genetics. I'm excited to discover what synthetic biology means to me, to my community, and to the world. For me, science is about making connections and iGEM is a great starting point! With previous lab experience in a medical science lab, iGEM offers another wonderful opportunity for me to explore other fields of science with the hope that one day both of these experiences will connect me to what I want to do in the future. My wetlab role for this project is on the cloning of alpha pinene monoterpene synthase into yeast cells while incorporating other parts to improve productions of monoterpenes. At the same time, I am part of the modelling team, using ArcGIS to simulate the spread of the pine beetle infestation upon introduction of our product.
Samuel Wu I've just finished my third year in engineering physics and joined the team to explore Synthetic Biology, a longtime fascination.  My role with the wet lab is to create a genetic construct for the dual expression of two genes (IDI1, HMG-2) encoding enzymes for the melavonate pathway, which supplies the substrate for the monoterpenes.  This construct will hopefully boost production of terpenes in yeast expressing a"

To facilitate this on every platform sequ-into formulates the call command                                     accordingly.
For a Unix system, this is simply:
var splitted_command = command.split("" "");
program = ""python3"";
programArgs = splitted_command;
useShell = true;
For Mac OS, the explicit PATH variable containing the location of the programs must                                     be added manually:
var np = shellPath.sync();
process.env.PATH = np;
On Windows, however, it is necessary to make the call WSL compatible:
var splitCmd = [""-i"", ""-c"", ""python3 "" + command];
program = ""bash"";
programArgs = splitCmd;
useShell = false;
Script Output
The output of each python call - that is for each file per reference - is collected                                     via another JSON file                                     data structure. More details here .
ContamTool.py
As mentioned above the functionality of sequ-into depends on the python script                                     ContamTool.py which assesses                                     the input read files, coordinates the alignment, interprets the alignment results                                     and allows for read                                     extraction according to the gained knowledge.
Read File Handling
All files that are pooled in a folder are handled as one FastQ file in the further                                     steps to make the                                     combined analysis possible.

os.system(""cat "" + ' '.join(read_file) + "" > "" + fastqFile)
HTSeq allows for an                                     efficient iteration over                                     all reads from the now single input file.

Calling the Alignment Tool GraphMap
The idea behind sequ-into that enables finding possible contaminations and deciding                                     if a certain target was                                     sequenced, respectively, is to map the raw reads from the sequencing files against                                     a reference. Thus                                     allowing to split the original joint read file into two categories: the reads that                                     aligned to the reference                                     and those that did not.
Nanopore sequencing data, however, comes with certain obstacles that complicate                                     alignments. On the one hand,                                     because of Nanopores high-throughput nature, the data size means that alignment                                     algorithms commonly used                                     are too slow - something that was overcome only with a tradeoff to lower                                     sensitivity. On the other hand,                                     the variable error profile of ONT MinION sequencers made parameter tuning mandatory                                     to gain high                                     sensitivity and precision.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," 5, 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture announced “Safety Assessment of Agricultural GMO"", ""Measures for the Administration of the Import of Agricultural Transgenic Living Things"", “Agricultural GMO Identity Management Approach "". These laws and regulations help organizations to stick to principles to prevent genetic pollution.
3. Improve the examination and approval system of gene engineering technology application
The system should require the genetic engineering technology pass the microbiology, plant and animal experiments, environmental experiments and human trials before put into application. We should prevent the abuse and industrialization or commercialization of genetic engineered product rashly. For example, some governments have made announcements to prohibit the production and sale of any crops with antibiotic resistance gene.
4. Carry out public science education
The lack of the biological safety awareness is one of the biggest reasons of the genetic pollution. The majority of Chinese people whose daily life are closely related to genetically modified food can't ever understand the genetic pollution. So it's necessary for us to carry out the popular science education so that more and more people can pay attention to the genetic engineering knowledge.
5. Implementation of a labelling system for genetically modified food
Food containing genetically engineered organisms
United Nations announce if we take people's health and the environment into account, every country has the right to restrict the import of genetically modified food. All genetically modified products in the shipment should be labeled, indicating “this product contains genetically modified material "". International Consumers Association believe that although it is uncertain that genetically modified food is unsafe, but in order to prevent potential hazard to human, we should take preventive measures and establish an identification system. The identification of GMOs can help consumers to make choices. Genetic pollution is really a big problem in the application of genetic engineering. But we must realize the great benefit of genetic engineering. It is likely to bring the best choice for us to solve the global food shortage. Therefore we cannot give up improving gene engineering technology for fear of a little trouble.
6. Risk assessment and management
Conduct the risk assessment and management of transgenic technique and analysis the adverse effects of its products in the trans-boundary movement process so that the importer can make choices easily.
Synthetic Biology
When it comes to our iGEM project this year, the regulation of gene expression systems can not only introduces a new way for protein-specific expression but also plays an important role in preventing genetic pollution. For example, if you want to transfer some exogenous genes that are harmful to the environment or human beings into cells, then biological safety is one thing we must consider about. To prevent harmful genes being expressed in uncontrolled cases, we must do something to"
Uppsala,2016,Team:Uppsala#Project#UnaG_-_-_TEXT.html," molecule and the compound seems to simply be an effect of bilirubin’s three dimensional structure. No indications that the diglucuronides are more biological efficient have been noticed so far. The human being´s survival is dependent on the monoglucuronides, but not on the diglucuronides (Gordon et al. 1976).
Hyperbilirubinemia, also called Jaundice disease or icterus (www.mesh.kib.ki.se), occurs when either the formation of bilirubin glucuronides or the excretion of these does not work in the correct manner. Consequently the concentration of bilirubin and glucuronic acid accumulates in the body (Buchan, 1826). High levels of bilirubin are toxic and it can result in neurologic harm that causes deafness, delayed development and cerebral pares (Benioff Children’s Hospital, San Francisco).

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," After several runs the different reproduction rates are transferred to the competition model, which translates these rates into growth curves.
First, the selection system was implemented (model I). The basic structure is based on iGEM Potsdam 's modeling work of 2011. The model I represents the [bacterial two hybrid selection system] and produces the reproduction rate r of a single cell with a given affinity under selection pressure with ampicillin (amp). The reproduction rate is computed for many different affinities and then transmitted to the competition model (model II). The competition model depicts the growth behavior of different adapted E. colis in one flask under multiple inoculations.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," in hydrophobicity or charge distribution among each other.
MstX was identified back in 2005 by Rooslid and colleagues. Interestingly, until this day little is known about how MstX promotes integral protein targeting to the membrane3. Recently it has found a novel application as a fusion tag supporting the recombinant production and bilayer insertion of other membrane proteins (MPs)1. MstX, when fused to the N-terminus of integral MPs, enables the cargo proteins to fold into their native conformations in the membrane, thus yielding high-level expression. It is known that MstX autonomously targets proteins to the membrane bypassing the canonical secretory apparatus, like Sec translocon. In addition to this, it was indirectly presumed that MstX lacks any recognizable signal sequence 2.
According to this, we have decided to implement the advantages of MstX into our project. In order to boost protein expression yield MstX was fused with target integral membrane protein Outer membrane protein A (OmpA). Prior using these recombinant proteins in cell-free system, it has to be ensured that proteins are expressed in bacteria. To do so, E. coli BL21 stain cells were transformed and induced for 2 and 4 hours with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Results were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This experiment was conducted in order to detect if there are any differences in protein production yield comparing native and MstX-fused proteins.
First of all, it was concluded that MstX-OmpA-X and OmpA-X (X - additional part of the construct) are expressed in cells (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1 OmpA-X and MstX-OmpA-X (X - additional part of the construct; shown with arrows) expression in E. coli; SDS-PAGE after induction with IPTG for 2 hours and 4 hours; K - control, M - protein ladder
Also, we checked if we could fuse MstX with other integral membrane proteins. In this case, IgA protein (Fig. 3).

Based on the integral form of the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid, at any given time, the sum of flow volume in each branch is equal to the total volume pumped in the whole chamber. According to the Kirchhoff's law, the accumulation of flow speed at the joint point must be zero. It is easy to get the equation that\begin{matrix} L_{AC}V_1=L_{AB}V_2+R_{AB} V_3 \\ V_2:V_3=R_{AB}:L_{AB} \end{matrix}
Consequently, we could reach the conclusion that the maximum velocity, average flow rate and the shear force on the bottom of each tunnel is at a ratio of 81 : 9 : 1. To verify the back-of-the-napkin calculation, we performed experimental calibration in the real microfluidics chip, and the testing result is very close to designing value (about 75 : 8 : 1 of the maximum velocity ratio in each tunnel) and the simulation result ( 80 : 8 : 1).

Wednesday 1.8.12
Aim: Today we commence the protocols for characterising salt tolerance.
Results: Our results demonstrate that out transformed cells are salt tolerant, compared to the untransformed W3110 cells.Our results reflect those of TU Delft 2010 who characterised the same BioBrick. However they did not show their results beyond the exponential phase, which we have included.
Conclusions: Growth rate during exponential phase is greater in the K398108 transformed E.coli W3110 than in the untransformed (same conclusion as drawn by TU Delft 2010).  Increase in growth rates significantly lower than original at highest salt concentration – could be explained by use of different E.coli strains i.e. higher growth rate of the non-transformed strain. We plan to repeat to strengthen conclusions.

Aim: Evaluation of the plates from 3A ligation. This should inform us as to whether we can proceed and do the colony picking of both A (J23119+BB0034) and B (Pcst + BB0034) constructs.
Result: Observations showed that 3A was successful for the construct A, as shown in the image below. However there was no growth assembled pCST+BBa_B0034 (construct B). The following table summarises the results.
Conclusion: Colony picking was carried out for the first construct (BBa_J23119+BBa_B0034), but not from the second construct (plasmid backbone PSB1K3 and Pcst starvation promoter).

Human Practices (Silver)
“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”
Ludwig Wittgenstein
When considering reasons for the lack of uptake of biosensors, we chose to investigate one of the most fundamental aspects for the success of any project: communication. Communication also affects how synthetic biology and the many projects emerging from the field are received. Because of this, many of our human practices, education, and public engagement activities are centred around sharing the research and activities we have completed in relation to science communication. Our human practises work has focused on addressing technology uptake, which is one of the challenges that we identified to biosensor development and deployment. This took place in three main stages. First, we determined the current state of dialogue by consulting previous dialogue studies and reviewing how language is used in the media. We then generated our own guidelines to help future researchers to develop dialogue in a constructive way. Finally, we put this into practise by creating activities and sharing our work in a way that established a dialogue and encouraged discussion. Attending the N8 conference made us aware of the barriers which must be overcome to increase uptake of biosensors. Alongside other factors which we have identified and tackled through experimental and design adaptation, communication between scientists and the public is an aspect which we have considered in our aim of increasing uptake of biosensors and synthetic biology. In our work, we used different perspectives and methods to investigate science communication. By gaining advice from academics working in the humanities and social sciences, and completing our own engagement and research, we have taken a journey through science communication and considered how this can"

7. The plasmid design: After finishing our design, we clicked on the bottom, then the shape of our plasmid came out. So we had a system that will produce AmilCP, a kind of blue protein when it detects UV.
Validation experiment
Confirmation
After we constructed two plasmids, Escherichia coli DH5α was transformed with plasmids and positive clones were identified by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction endonuclease digestion. Photo.1 and 2 show the confirmation result. Further confirmations were finished by sequencing.
Photo 1. After incubating for about 18 hours, the positive clone turned blue.
Photo 2. The Colony PCR showed the result of Transformation.
Experimental data
After the sequencing confirmation, Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with plasmids. We didn’t have Liquid culture systems with UV light, so we used plate cultivation. We placed the dish on a 10-15W weak intensity UV lamp at a distance of about 30 cm and took samples every few hours. 22 hours later, we got the blue bacteria moss (Photo.3 ). The bacteria had been broken by ultrasonic crusher, and then we used the OD588 to measure the concentration of the blue protein (Photo. 4).
Photo 3. One of the plates after exposure to UV for 22 hours.

Simulation validation and result analysis
But unfortunately, collecting bacteria from plate may cause some system error, and because of this,  reproducibility of OD588 was not so good. Using it to validate our simulation is meaningless. Hence, we decided to collaborate with  SCUT-China_A and used their project's data to prove the accuracy of our simulation. Picture.2 and 3 show the simulation result and the experimental result of their project.

Compared with experimental data of SCUT-China_A, our software simulation showed preferable performance (Picture.4). The result proved that our simulation works. After 7 hours, the experiment data was higher than predicted value, potentially caused by bacterial reproduction.

Uppsala-Sweden,2010,Team:Uppsala-SwedenProject_-_-_TEXT.html," the band detect.
Proof of Concept and Characterization:
Generally speaking, there are two type of constructs to characterize: the sender system and the receiver system. The sender cells secrete AHL, causing the receiver cells to emit fluorescence in the designated band-detection fashion. In order to obtain a fully functional band detection sensor, it is vital to characterize each component by itself before putting together the entire system.
The sender system can be characterized either quantitatively, in term of the amount of AHL it produces, or in a qualitative fashion, by checking its effect on a reporter construct. This reporter construct could be as easy as two parts consisting of a regulatory promoter coupled to a GFP-gene. The quantitative measurement involves usage of equipment from the analytical chemistry discipline, e.g. HPLC and mass-spectrometry.
The receiver constructs can be characterized using commercially available AHL. AHL can be applied to receiver cell cultures with concentration gradient. Their fluorescence intensity can be measured. Using concentration gradient is also crucial to our original band-detection concept, as different receiver constructs should only react to AHL in certain concentration intervals.

TetRDBD - a novel two-hybrid screening in E.coli
Figure 2: Novel two-hybrid screening: TetR DNA binding domain fused with the target proteins A,B or C.
TetR is a transcriptional regulator, controlling the expression of tetracycline resistance in E.coli. TetR binds as a homodimer to the operator and acts as a repressor. Each monomer consists of a DNA binding domain at the N-terminal end as well as a core domain, important for the dimerization, and a ligand binding domain.
To our prediction, dimerisation is needed for TetR efficient DNA binding due to cooperativity, thus the fusion of monomeric truncated TetR (TetRDBD) version with an extraneous dimerization domain, should restore TetRDBD DNA binding.   This can easily be used as a two hybrid system to detect homo/heterodimers in E. coli, and, in principle, one can use these fusions to turn protein-protein interaction into the repression of transcription. To do this one can fuse the target proteins with the TetRDBD and if the proteins (A,C) can interact the output is repressed (see figure 2). Furthermore, inducible dimerization can lead to a novel switch like behavior of the system.
You can find the split TetRDBD containing a BamHI restriction site which can be fused to any protein of interest containing the corresponding restriction site in the DNA sequence. This allows you to test if a protein of interest is able to dimerize.

Current biosensors are limited in the sense that they produce digital outputs (either 0 or 1 output) in the presence of an inducer. In order to create a more useful biosensor, analog devices with wider ranges of outputs are necessary. In contrast to digital sensors, an analog device can measure an inducer across a spectrum; for example, an analog device could be used to pinpoint the concentration of iron in groundwater, whereas digital devices could only register whether the concentration exceeded a pre-defined threshold amount.
Our device, the bacterial tape recorder, will generate such analog outputs by converting chemical inputs into DNA based memory. Using the SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events) system developed by Timothy Lu’s lab at MIT, we aim to standardize a device that can characterize the intensity of and duration of events and store them for later retrieval. The SCRIBE system works by integrating plasmid DNA, later becoming specifically ssDNA into genomic DNA upon stimulation.  By population analysis of cells that express the analog marker, we will use this system to monitor hazardous environmental factors such as heavy metals, which are known to be detrimental to groundwater in urban areas and developing countries.
We aim to introduce a degree of modularity that will allow  future synthetic biologists to choose what inputs are the stimulus for analog recording."

The growth of bacteria in its exponential phase can be represented in the following exponential growth equation:
where:
x is the bacteria concentration (dry weight mass/unit volume) at time
t
μ
is the specific growth rate
td
is the doubling time (time required for the concentration of organism to double)
Monod showed that there is a relationship between the specific growth rate and the concentration of a limiting growth substrate that can be represented in this equation:

Ks is the saturation constant – the value of

Bacterial  growth and utilization of substrate is depicted by the Monod by the equation:
where Y is known as the yield constant.

From the idea to a rough plan
After finding all members for our team in January 2011 we began thinking about an idea for an iGEM project. We had many different ideas, from carbondioxide eating E. coli to a biosensor for dioxines. But in the beginning of February we noticed an online article about the ban of the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) in the European Union for the production of baby bottles. We thought that if it would be possible to detect BPA at home using a test that everybody could use, all parents on this world would have one concern less. So we decided to build a BPA biosensor. To ensure an everyday applicability this biosensor needed to be cell-free, non-toxic and easy to handle.
Concretizing the plans for our device
Talking about an approach for this cell-free biosensor, one of our team members said that it would be great to have a surface which could be functionalized, just like the team from Slovenia did 2010 with DNA - but two-dimensional instead of one-dimensional. We wanted to go further in this direction and did literature research. This led us to a species of proteins that forms periodic two-dimensional structures on their own in a so called self-assembly: the crystalline bacterial surface layers (abbreviated S-layers). These proteins became our system of choice: usable as a nanobiotechnological scaffold for a lot of different cell-free applications, providing S"

Important Notes
If the balance liquid turns turbid, incubate it at 37℃ for several minutes.
When cutting the gel, keep the UV irradiation time period as short as possible, otherwise DNA would be damaged.
For those DNA fragment shorter than 100bp or larger than 10kb, the sol solution volume should be increased as well as the time period for adsorption and elution.
Recovery depends on the initial DNA amount and elution volume. The less the DNA, the less the elution volume, the smaller of recovery.

Three-step method：         Predenature           94℃，2min         Denature，annealing and extension           94℃ 30sec             {          （Tm-5）℃  30sec           72℃  60sec/kb           } × 25-45 cycles           4℃
Important Notes
Pfu enzymes should be operated in ice.
Two-step method is preferred if primer Tm is relatively high.
1.2% agarose gel is used to separate 1kb-5kb DNA; 0.8% agarose gel is used to separate 3k-10k DNA; 2.5-3% agarose gel is used to separate DNA longer than 100bp.
PCR reaction system varies from 20uL to 100uL. Under most cases, 20uL system is preferred as long as PCR is for identification only. However, when subsequent experiments such as tailing, digestion which require certain amount of DNA are necessary, 50uL system is usually preferred.
Pfu enzymes are preferred if the purpose of PCR is for gene amplification. At the same time, PCR for identification or tailing usually requires taq enzymes.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," density of a suspension might give a good indication for the initial cell concentration, but after applying the E. coli on the agar LB plate the E. coli continues to divide. This can be observed on the agar plate over time with the naked eye. Besides cell division a part of the explanation might be the growing of the individual cells over time (5), hence the cell counting by tracking the expanse of the culture is more difficult.
Even though the determination of the number of cells was inaccurate we can still get an idea of what the production rate of lystostaphin for a single cell could be. Results of method 1, were steady state was assumed, in the end did not differ much from the results obtained by integration.
The reaction rates per cell from this experiment are expected to give a fairly good insight in what the thickness of the hydrogel will need to be, therefore the production rate will be implemented in the finite element model that describes transport of lysostaphin to the skin.
Finally, the total amount of lysostaphin that was produced by the colony during the entire experiment, does not depend on the cell count itself and is therefore considered to be more accurate. To really prove the accuracy of the setup and model a similar approach should be investigated for different sizes, incubation times. Also comparison with different approaches to determine this total production of lysostaphin could give insight in the accuracy of this approach that was used.
Conclusion
Due the poor accuracy of tracking the numbers of cells during the experiment no accurate production rate could be obtained. This result is nevertheless a reasonable assumption of the real production rate, that in reality also varies over time a per cell and could be used for further exploration. The total amount of produced lysostaphin by the E. coli colony is expected to be more accurate since the calculation does not depend on determination of the amount of cells.

In conclusion, we know that sfGFP expresses in our e. coli. But we don’t know if it is attached to the external side of the membrane, or if the HIV-1 protease works as expected. As this secretion system seems to be failing, we chose to try other alternatives.
June 25 – July 1, 2012
The Gibson Assemblies of our iGEM team had been failing in the last weeks. This week new enzimes arrived. We hope that this will solve our problem.
Also, this week we tried to redesign our project. Our first task is to continue with our attempts to make a biobrick with the spider silk monomer ADF-3. We ordered the primers that we need to do that. Now we are exploring the possibility of improve the product of the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig in his paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers”. One idea is to attach a growth factor (e.g. recombinant human BMP-2) to the molecule of ADF-3. But the problem with the secretion system developed by Christopher Voig is that it works on salmonella, and we cannot work with such an infectious bacteria.
July 2 – 8, 2012
This was a week of exams. Therefore, no major advances were accomplished during this week.
July 9 – 15, 2012
This week we made important advances in our wiki. We will start with the template of the iGEM team Johns Hopkins 2011 as a base.
Furthermore, we studied carefully the paper “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” and its supplementary information. We realized that each protein secreted with this system comes with a 3x FLAG (DYKDDDDK)3. It is a priority for us to find if someone can share us a little of the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Cat# F3165). That way, if we use this secretion system we will be able to quantify the production of our protein of interest. But, if we want to use Voigt´s system, we need attenuated salmonellas with their pathogenicity island 1 intact.  Something similar to Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. After some research we found a professor of our University that works with salmonella (Dr. Susan Bueno). But she was out of the country and we could only send her some"

Terms reflecting the lab materials show the evident switch of iGEM teams to genome engineering. We can see a clear increase in the use of restriction enzymes, electrophoresis and DNA purification columns, miRNA and sRNA. This change may also explain why “tube” is now less used. Another explanation is that a “tube” has been replaced by more high throughput containers like “well plate”. We also observe that “ethanol” is now mentioned as “alcohol”. We also observe an increase in use of fluerescence techniques (“red ligth”). Surprisingly we did not pick up an increase in"

The students thought that synthetic biology was an interesting concept, and we even answered a few questions about starting a high school iGEM team. We learned that synthetic biology is not covered in traditional high school classes, so we have to go more in-depth when explaining it. Students in AP Biology already have an understanding of basic genetics, but it was helpful to go over the material again when introducing new content.
Download the Powerpoint in PDF format
In the future, we would want to have more interactive parts in our presentation when we would ask the students questions and have discussions during the powerpoint, rather than saving all their questions until the end. A good idea we would like to try to encourage more productive discussion is to split students up into small groups and have them discuss their views of GMOs and the applications that they know, and then share with the class. This would ensure more student participation and help us understand what they already know and any misconceptions they might have.

This conference was initiated in Seoul in 1985. Since then, ASAAQ has been held in Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Seattle, Beijing, Taipei, Tsukuba, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Jinan, Seoul and Kobe. The ASAAQ Conference covers broad topics on atmospheric sciences from the observation, analysis, to the simulation of air quality on all scales (from urban to global), including emissions, transport, diffusion, chemistry, removal processes, impacts, and air quality management.
ASAAQ 14 took place in Strasbourg, France on 29 - 31 May 2017, and fostered scientific discussion and exchange of information on the latest research and practical applications of atmospheric science to air quality issues. Three of our members attended the ASAAQ conference and presented the aether project to air pollution experts from all around the world. After the conference, we were able to talk to researchers. Our discussions allowed us to confirm the relevance of targeting PAHs.
7th morning of the HEIQA college of experts"" (Health Environment and Indoor Air Quality)
On October 26th, two of our members, Azéline and Juliette, participated in the working morning of the HEIQA panel of experts. They attended a series of conferences on indoor air quality and could interact with allergy health professionals and people working on the development of indoor air cleaners. This conference confirmed us on a statement that we made: there is still little work and studies on indoor air while it is the most polluted. Creating an indoor pollution database would be an excellent initiative. Azéline and Juliette then attended a conference on air purifiers with a state of the art of existing models. It turned out that systems that have the most sense for the future are those that do not consume energy (passive), that do not have the risk of rejecting pollutants after and that are not too expensive. Azéline and Juliette then had the opportunity to present our project aether, which received very good feedback.

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"histidine tag added to the protein. The HER2-inbound column would then act as a affinity column binding the constructs. In the second experiment an ELISA would be performed by first binding HER2 to the plate and then the construct (sandwich method). The last experiment was a FACS analysis on E.coli spheroplasts. We would also like to prove that our construct was unresponsive to osmolarity changes as this would interfere with any signal we get from binding HER2. For this a CFP/YFP read-out strain was transformed and tested for fluorescence at different osmolarities. Finally we would test if the read-out system could be activated in spheroplast E.coli. This would verify the that the link between the BAR and the intracellular signaling would be functional.
Intracellular signal transduction
If activation of the histidine kinase on the BAR is successful, it will phosphorylate the response regulator OmpR. The aim then becomes to carry this intracellular signal from the receptor to the readout strain, together with quantification of the signal. The main idea is to build/assemble a BioBrick with two OmpR-dependent quorum synthases that will produce two different quorum sensing molecules depending on the levels of phosphorylated OmpR inside the cell. Finally, these quorum sensing molecules are detected by the readout strain and quantified accordingly.
Figure 5: Signaling pathway for ABBBA
The whole signaling system is divided into two parts: i) Fluorescence signaling system (consists of OmpR-Regulated-RFP, MicF-Regulated-GFP and OmpR-Regulated-RFP/GFP) to check if the BioBricks are functional and ii) Quorum sensing signaling system (OmpR-Regulated-RhlI, MicF-Regulated-LuxI and OmpR-Regulated-RhlI/LuxI) to replace the fluorescence output with the quorum sensing output as final outcome.
Regulating protein expression with OmpR
When EnvZ (histidine kinase) exhibits its kinase property, it leads to phosphorylation of OmpR which is an osmoregulatory protein in E.coli. Activation of EnvZ- OmpR two-component regulatory system is the main focus of this signaling pathway. Phosphorylated OmpR regulates differential transcription of two porin responsing genes (ompC and ompF) Activation of the BAR can either lead to kinase activity or phosphatase activity of EnvZ (depending on the conformational change in the receptor and the"

2.3 Simulation results ▼
Using the values presented in the tables above, the deterministic model was simulated to see how much P(3HB) could be formed inside the cell.  However, with the single cell model, it would be difficult to reflect how much of the plastic could actually be formed on a macroscopic scale.  Therefore, modifications to the simulation algorithm were needed to give scaled-up simulation results.
In the scaled-up regime, though, new limitations were encountered.  For example, growth, cell division and the concentration gradient that each cell encounters and how much can be taken up by the cells.  Given the data available, what could be done was to assume that the bacteria were in a bioreactor, with constant nutrient and oxygen supply, and that they were in the phase of stationary growth (please see assumptions and explanations under the graphs below).
Here, three graphs are presented to show P(3HB)formation over time.  The first two graphs are (i)single-cell model results, concentration in mM and (ii) single-cell model results, concentration in g/L.  The first graph was the original graph produced from Simbiology as all concentrations were expressed in mM in the model.  However, to gain a more intuitive sense of how much could be produced g/L was used.  The third graph is the scaled-up simulation result.

This data thus suggests that with the IrrE the E.Coli is better adapted to living in, which would allow further studies being conducted on the maximum concentration of Lubricant it can be grown in. Furthermore once that has been determined the pathogen detecting aspect of the concept can be realised.                             Thus overall this experiment has allowed us to show that IrrE increases the growth of the E. Coli in the Superdrug Lubricant containing: purified water, glycerine, Carbopol 940, Triethanolamine and Sodium Butyl Paraben. This supports the previous experiments that concluded that IrrE allows for better growth in saline conditions[iv], except this time in Superdrug Lubricant.
For further conceptualisation and experimentation it should be taken into consideration that within a commercialisable product the bacteria will not be under ideal growth conditions and the nutrients will be a limiting factor, especially when considering that the lubricant concentration will have to be a lot higher than in this experiment.
SILVER: Lycopene BioBrick
mNARK-Lycopene Device Characterisation
mNARK lycopene enables ecoli growth under Hypoxia conditions
Hypoxia is a condition in which cells are deprived of oxygen due to low concentration of oxygen in the extracellular milieu. In humans, low oxygen levels in the blood affect tissues. Oxygen is essential for diverse cellular functions, such as catabolic and anabolic processes, and low intracellular concentrations have a negative impact on cell functions and survival.
Oxygen deficit can have a severe impact on cellular function, as seen in cell stress. The inability of cells to effectively manage cellular stress over time has been linked to cellular ageing and age-related diseases (Haigis and Yankner, 2010; Poljšak and Milisav, 2012). Cellular stress leads to deregulation of intracellular processes, as both the structure and function of macromolecules are compromised. Furthermore, high amounts of ROS have been implicated in cellular stress and ageing (Poljšak and Milisav, 2012).
We performed an additional assay expressing lycopene under the mNARK promoter, to test if the cells could survive longer under hypoxia-induced stress. E. coli cells transformed with this construct were compared with the wild type TOP10 E. coli (W/T) monitoring growth and division via optical density (OD) at 600 nm, at specific time points – 3 hours and 16 hours following withdrawal of oxygen.

WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration. It is a function of number of theophylline receptors and external theophylline concentration. The function ?(T) and T(T) denote the theophylline-governed regulation ay the transcriptional and translation levels respectively (equation below [2]). KF is the equilibrium constant at transcriptional level and KT is the equilibrium constant at translation level.
F(T)= K_F/(K_F+T)
T(T)= K_T/(K_T+T)
Varying the parameter ?(Text) of above model could help us to understand how the number of receptors and external theophylline concentration effect the intracellular concentration of theothyline and hence the expression level of CheZ. The results are shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2 below.  In addition, the response curve of CheZ against theophylline concentration with different theophylline transport rate was illustrated in Fig 3.
Both the expression of CheZ and intracellular concentration increases with increase of transport rate. The bacteria will produce more CheZ and therefore higher level of directed movement. The CheZ response curve shows that the transport rate can be used to tune the CheZ response, as the threshold intracellular concentration of theophylline required to trigger the CheZ response increases with transport rate.

Introduction
From crops to cattle to dogs, humans have always sought to improve their living conditions by adapting plants and animals of their surroundings to their needs [1]. However, these occur over a lengthy selection processes over hundreds, possibly thousands of years. New developments in the field of biology has enabled us to progress much faster, by interfering with an organism’s DNA directly.
Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific and biotechnological field that uses these developments at its core. It combines biology and engineering principles, with the aim of designing and building new biological systems and functions.
Synthetic biology has been gaining interest among ambitious science students who are seeking to bring their research outside the lab and be involved in more application-based solutions. The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition brings together thousands of students across the globe to develop synthetic biology solutions and  collaborate with one another based on the common passions.
Among hundreds of teams that participated in this year’s event, Team Toulouse-INSA-UPS, Team NUSGEM (Singapore Team-A), and Team ULaval came together to exchange ideas about relevant issues regarding synthetic biology. Before writing this report, we discussed different topics ranging from ethics, environmental impact, public engagement, repercussions on public life, and more. We chose three main subjects to discuss: bioethics in synthetic biology; economic aspects; and society’s perspective of synthetic biology.
Bioethics in Synthetic Biology (Toulouse)
A lot of factors have to be considered when evaluating the benefits and risks of using synthetic biology. To develop a new production method for example, one must first closely study the available techniques that do not employ synthetic biology. If something can be produced chemically, then a comparison has to be established between this process and the potential new synthetic biology based process. Once this comparison is made, and if synthetic biology can offer an advantage (less costly, quicker, more environmentally friendly, etc), then it is sound to develop a new method based on synthetic biology.
The process of bringing a new product from the lab"

Salmonella is one of the principal microorganisms that cause food poisoning. It is a major concern for the food industry as it contaminates a wide range of food products quite easily. The impact on public health is considerable because Salmonella can be found in every country, so it can be considered a global public health issue. Developing countries have trouble keeping the sanitary conditions to prevent salmonellosis and typhoid fever that is why an effective method of detection is needed.
There are several methods for salmonella detection. Traditional methods such as the use of selective agar or standardized ISO methods can take up to 5 days. There are other rapid methods for detection and confirmation of Salmonella such as immunomagnetic separation, molecular methods like DNA hybridization and PCR assays, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Some of these are claimed to give results within 48 hours.
The goal of this project is to develop a faster detection method using colorimetric techniques. Taking the base of the E. chromi project developed by the Cambridge 2009 iGEM team where there is no need to perform fluorescence microscopy.
A proposal is to develop a method to recombine Salmonella (if present) so that it produces a pigment visible to the human eye.
With the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), the immunologic system will attack the healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This creates damage in the joints, skin, blood vessels and some organs. The SLE is one of the most common Lupus and it tends to affect a lot of parts of the body. The SLE is an autoimmune disease that causes the attack of the T cells to the healthy body cells, this causes"

SAFETY
As we all know, industrial bacterial can secrete several chemicals that has considerable significance for us. However, they are also easily stolen by thieves. What’s more, the pathogenic of bacteria can’t be depressed at this time. The threat of bio-weapon cannot be ignored. Recent years, it is reported that a new form of biology is rising: “Biohackery”. Biohackery allows everyone operation the genome of bacteria in their home or garage with themselves. Without the regulatory of an International Association of Synthetic Biology, we can’t make sure that there is no threat coming from someone’s house or garden, isn’t it?
That’s our work in safety. In fact, we not only followed all the rules in order to make sure that our operation is absolutely safe, but also made some contributions to safety. What we made this year is to provide a new method preventing miss, lose or theft in biology lab.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q1: What if sequencing does not aim at your lock but the function gene? If so, you lock will lose its function.
A: On sequencing problem, it is obvious that nobody will do nothing but sequence the sample at the first time. Them sample must be nurtured and tested to be the right one, which cannot be realized because our system will prevent that happen.
Q2: If cell division inhibition system comes from engineering bacteria, will it be easy for the bacteria to evolve a method to fight against it? If it is exogenous, will it be harm to the production progress?
A: We plan to use system from bacteria themselves, there is no need to worry about evolution. In fermentation progress bacteria will not be used more than once, there will always be the origin strain in the fermentation tank, the rest will be disposed.
Q3: The difficulty of unlocking the E.co-Lock. (Which aspects of the E.co-Lock have anti-theft and anti-crack function? )
A: First, you must know the E.co-Lock genetic pathway. Second, at the beginning of culturing cells, the medium must be added a certain amount of AHL. In addition, when you add three inducers to try to unlock it, you must know the following: what the inducers are, the order of added inducers, how much each inducer you should add, and how long you should wait until you add next inducer. In a word, the complexity"

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," that our project can be applied and the target end users are companies focusing on fermentation industry. To get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production, we visited COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute.
The company’s manager said that plasmid instability was really a troublesome problem and affirmed our potential use in large-scale production.
What’s more, COFCO provided us with some financial help. They encouraged us                                 to polish our project and reminded                                 us of considering more about connecting our work with the realistic needs.
It’s not the end of our project
From winter camp, we firstly invited our instructor                                 to draw a map of synthetic biology and all of us shared our personal views about how we engaged ourselves into the competition and community. Younger students in our school from                                 different majors raised several questions and discussed with us.
At the brainstorming stage, team members proposed several ideas. We hold weekly meetings to discuss these ideas and assess the                                 feasibility as well as some design details. The miniature of our project was gradually formed.
Through communicating with other iGEM teams in Asia-Pacific conference                                 held by team NCKU Tainan, we shared our                                 ideas to more people and received some kind advice on how to improve our project.
During the talk with other iGEMers, many teams have the some confusion about how to start a human practice project and how to build the collaboration relationship with other teams.                                 That’s why we started the HP union and tried to gather teams which have same needs.
The visit to our end users opens a new door. We can just know the problem on                                 the paper from the literature research, while the dialogue with COFCO staff and their managers let us know how the problem we focused on will affect the fermentation production.

Team lookup
Who are team CLSB?
Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.
Privacy
You can find out how we use data provided to the app in our privacy policy . We think it’s truly a gripping read.

GSR2

Assuming no reaction has taken place yet.
Procedure
1. After building this differential equation model in Mathematica, we change the initial starting concentration of GSR, and numerically solve the equations.
2. The output will be a the concentration of H2O2 as a function of time. Integrating this function over 50 years using the definition in Model 1 returns the total crystallin damage.
3. We repeat this procedure from 0 to 100 uM of initial GSR, and graph the resulting crystallin damage against the initial GSR inputted (Figure 4.3).
Assumptions
In this experiment, we made the following assumptions:
Crystallin damage is linear with respect to both concentration and time, as evidenced by cysteine’s first order reaction with hydrogen peroxide (Domínguez-Vicent 2016). (see Model 1 for full explanation).
The amount of total GSR ("
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"11 packages, each with about 40 aliquots needed to be prepared, labeled and wrapped individually took a lot of manpower and patience to pack. We can’t imagine what a logistical nightmare working with 340 teams would be. Preparing the InterLab earlier would have been better. Tasks you never thought about will have to be completed and something will inevitably go wrong, so it is very important to leave margin for error while planing. Also sending the kits out when there was more time until the wiki freeze might have given more teams, not just NTNU (thank you!), time to repeat experiments.  Having undergraduate students test out your protocols, not team members who know the organism, would have been beneficial to find where small tips that we see as general knowledge at this point should be inserted into the protocol. We thought the language barrier might present a problem, but were pleasantly surprised by how easy understanding each other was. It was still difficult to communicate with the other teams at times. Email is somewhat formal and because we are young and inexperienced it still takes effort to compose emails (especially in a foreign language), which leads to much slower communication. It would have been better to have instant messaging where we could reach the teams fast and casually instead of email. To help with the experiments a group chat for all teams to exchange tips would have made getting information out faster, easier and possibly yielded better results. Another problem we encountered was that teams didn’t fill in our excel sheets instead making their own with the data we asked for. Maybe if we had explained how we would interpret the data the participants would have known to fill in the correct excel sheets.
 
Shipping
From this experience we learned that there is much room for improvement. Not only should we have packed the plates in a more secure manner, sending duplicates would have made the experiment less susceptible to human error. Unfortunately our lack of experience combined with our lack of resources made it so that we didn’t have boxes big enough to accommodate extra bubble wrap and duplicates. We didn’t realize we needed those until it was too late, at which point we had already bought the shipping containers.
 
Outlook
If we were to conduct an InterLab type experiment again, we would take all that we learned and mentioned above, and implement it.  If the team next year works with Vibrio natriegens aswell, they could examine if teams that have worked with V. natriegens before had better results because of their experience with the organism. Probably by then we would have the VibriClone strain that can live in colder temperatures, eliminating the fridge problem.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," in the     Registry for designing their own genetically engineered biological systems.     In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will contribute     back to the information and the data on existing parts and will submit     new parts they have designed in order to improve this community resource.
As an expanding database partregistry.org needs to be more organized and the standardization template needs to     be improved. Additionally, the potential of multiple ways of using each     part in different construct combination brings out the necessity for     an application to search through the database. BioGuide is the first     designed software that organizes over 1000 parts in partregistry.org as possible     atomics parts to build new biological device and systems for specific     input and outputs based on graph theory. The requirement of similar     applications and software tools are now inevitable in the emerging field     of synthetic biology. The innovative approach that makes the partregistry.org easy to use     for synthetic biology applications is the collection of standardized     parts that can be used in any combination with minimal effort under     one database. But while working on our algorithm to search for possible     combinations of parts depending on the given input and output, we have     realized that present standards are inadequate and parts registry form     must be improved.
In very near future a new format for parts registry form is needed     and few additional features should be implemented to have more control     on the database. We are planning to suggest a new format and features     for the parts registry based on the survey results we have received.     And planning to build the next version of Bioguide based on the revised     parts registry form. Along with using new parts registry standards we     will be improving the algorithm, so that the software can search through     more complex relations and returns all possible functional constructs.
Project Introduction
As the field of Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM is growing     up very fast and the number of parts in the parts registry is increasing     with the addition of more complex parts each day. After facing some     difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry, the need     for more effective standardization of parts entry was apparent. We have     investigated the information on parts in iGEM’s 2010 distribution and     reorganized the information on the parts registry forms according to     the needs of our algorithm. Then we have used graph theoretic modeling     to visualize the relations between iGEM Parts and to standardize the     representation of the parts as much as possible by graph theoretical     methods. This helped us to find input output relations between the parts.     Furthermore, our program BioGuide is now able to provide"

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," which is of course not in our interest. ENA1 and NHA1 code the main efflux mechanisms resulting in salt efflux as a reaction to salt stress (Figure 1).
Fig.1: ENA1 and NHA1 code the 2 most important efflux mechanisms in     the plasma membrane of S.cerevisiae. They use ATP (ENA1) or the H+ gradient (AVP1) over the plasma membrane to active pump sodium out of the cytosol.
The native transporters of higher interest to our project are highlighted in the graphic below (Figure 2).      How we alter these and which additionals genes we integrate will be explained in the following graphic.
Fig.2: The left graphic contains a selection of transporters     that are connected to the salt stress response and ion homeostasis in general. We alter the three most important parts of this system:
ENA1: the primary active sodium pump is responsible     for most of the sodium/potassium efflux over the plasma membran
NHA1: the secondary active antiporter uses the proton gradient over the plasma membrane to pump out sodium and is the second     most important part of the sodium efflux mechanism.
NHX1 is responsible for the sequestration of sodium in the prevacuolar compartsments which convers salt tolerance.
Our approach to increase the intracellular sequestration of ions in S. cerevisiae involves the alteration of the native salt- response and the implementation of the salt- tolerance mechanism      of the plant A. thaliana. Therefore, we modified our yeast in the following three ways:
- 1. The knockout of the native efflux mechanisms for sodium
- 2. The overexpression of the native mechanism responsible for the sequestration of ions in the prevacuolar compartments
- 3. The integration of the efficient mechanism that causes the sequestration of ions in the vacuole of Arabidopsis thaliana into the  vacuolar membrane of S. cerevisiae
Beginning with the explanation of the alteration of the native- salt response we want to explain our general design. Figure 3 shows the native yeast cell with the three important transporters before alteration.
Fig.3: native yeast cell with ENA1, NHA1 and NHX1
- The primary pathway for the extrusion of sodium ions in the plasma membrane is the P-type Na+ -ATPase encoded by Ena1 [1,2]. Knocking this gene out is the first big step to avert the efflux      of sodium out"
NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"
After optimizing our device for the 12-well plate, it was time to scale up and create devices for petri dishes and Erlenmeyer flasks. These two items of standard laboratory equipment were chosen based on feedback from research fellows in NUS. To provide users a more integrated solution, we produced a single device which can be used for both, DF-LA!.
As such a device had not been designed previously, there was no existing structure to improve or draw inspiration from, and our team started from scratch. This resulted in many design iterations (Figure 13).
Figure 13. The various design iterations, from left to right. This illustrates the design features that have persisted through testing and user feedback.
The first iteration is for a single petri dish, which can be illuminated from top and bottom. Users wanted a system with the additional option to test two petri dishes at once, and the second iteration was conceived.
The second iteration was designed such that the components to illuminate a single petri dish from the bottom could be stacked with another set of the same components to create a structure that could expose the petri dish to light from the top and bottom. This symmetry is advantageous as the functionality of a single unit doubles, and was therefore retained and developed in subsequent design iterations.
After that, we attempted to design a separate device for the Erlenmeyer flask, but realized that it would be much simpler and more elegant to adapt the second iteration to also accommodate the flask. The third iteration thus has an extra ring in between the devices for the petri dish. This acts as a holder for the flask. Also, the “teeth and slots” feature used to join the components together has moved from the center of the walls of the cylinder to the outer edge of the cylinder. We intended to shake the flask, and were thus concerned that the walls of the slot and the teeth would be too thin and might break due to shear stresses. We thus modified this feature for the third iteration.
Major changes from the third iteration to the fourth iteration are the increase in the height of the flask adapter so that the flask could also be illuminated from both top and bottom, the increase in the number of LEDs available to illuminate the flask or dish, and modifying the shape of the electronics container so that the whole structure could be cylindrical. The reason for the last change was fivefold - firstly, to reduce the material expended during 3D-printing, secondly, so the device would occupy a smaller area, thirdly, for the user’s comfort during transport as the inconsistency in shape made the structure unwieldy to"

     In the generation of Big Data, biology could be completely different from the past by making good use of the advantage of the information processing and analyzing, and further, making our lives better.
     The creation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) has changed the world. With such a great tool, we are trying to build an AI system to select functional proteins or peptides for all kinds of applications, such as environmental,                     medical science and industry. This is to maximize the benefits of interdisciplinary and to ameliorate the disadvantage of traditional engineering with biology.
A Bridge between Computer Science and Biology
     To begin with, building up the bank of information is the groundwork for artificial intelligence. From the collection of data to how to integrate themselves, it is totally different to the traditional way like searching papers one by one artificially. The establishment of a database bonds the information processing and the biology. Bioinformatics could make the biology knowledge reorganize systematically and high efficiently.
Dr. Hsien-Da Huang - Vice Dean of Department of Biological Science and Technology, NCTU
     The visit was an eye-opener for us to know how extensive the database could do. During the conversation with the professor, whose major is ISB (Integrative System Biology), we became more familiar with the knowledge of biological information processing from how to classify and collect the data, to the analysis of vast data in details and make functional arrangements. After learning the processes and applications, compared with traditional methods, we realized bioinformatics much more…

We would need to produce materials in bacteria that could be used for a balloon membrane.  These materials would need to be thoroughly purified and separated from live cells before balloon construction.
We would need to come up with atmospheric sensing and UV protection mechanisms that could operate in vitro and attach to a balloon membrane.
The problem of how one might operate a Mars onsite synthetic biology lab and sterilize the resulting materials remains an area for future research. However, we have intentionally designed our bioballoon so that it might be compatible with future protocols.
Earth Applications: The Problem of Environmental Sustainability
Figure 2: The Stanford Space Initiative's latex balloon after a successful launch
Biologically produced materials and sensors have important applications closer to home as well.  Latex, for example, is used in a variety of commercial products (including balloons).  We decided to use our latex project example to frame questions about the feasibility and potential benefit of our work for Earth manufacturing.
We found ourselves asking, “What would be the real benefit of being able to produce latex in bacteria for Earth applications? We tend to assume that we’re working on an environmentally friendly technology, but would our method really be more environmentally friendly than growing latex in Southeast Asia?”  We started reaching out to people who might be able to help us answer these questions.
First, we met with Dr. Anne Schauer-Gimenez of Mango Materials, whose company produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable plastic, by a novel method. Like other biomaterials companies, Mango Materials depends on bacteria to produce their plastic; however, their bacterial ecosystem runs on methane gas.  In theory, the Mango Materials plastic should create a closed-loop cycle: methane fuels plastic production, the plastic releases methane upon degeneration, and the same net methane is used to produce more plastic.  The Mango Materials PHB would replace polypropylene, which is made from fossil fuels.
When I (Amy) met with Dr. Schauer-Gimenez, she explained that her company was in the midst of the difficult scale-up process.  There are many stages to this process: biomaterials manufacturers must adapt their procedures to increasing scales of production, and there are many decisions to be made along the way.  Take one example: Dr. Schauer-Gimenez mentioned that the USDA facility, where Mango Materials does pilot testing, houses eight different industrial-scale centrifuges.

To store the sensor data the Arduino connects to a web server via WLAN. The sensor measurements are encoded as GET parameters and sent to the server in a HTTP request, then save.php stores them in a MySQL database. The data can be viewed by visiting index.php , which accesses the MySQL database and plots the sensor data in a graph. To view new data sets in real time real.php periodically requests new data from the server by using AJAX. An example of this setup can be viewed at http://igem.wzw.tum.de/arduino .
