B) BBa_K562002 . This is a microcompartment targeting tag (PduD40) driven by the tat promoter from BBa_K562000 . The Pdu40 tag is the first 40 amino acid residues of the PduD protein, which is normally inside the microcompartment. Part BBa_K562013 is a further modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and GFP. We hypothesized that the Pdu40 sequence would target GFP to the microcompartment  and that this could be shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy. GFP was found to localize in the cytoplasm and within the microcompartment.  The GFP also carries an HA tag in case future synthetic biologists need to follow its production.
C) BBa_K562019 . This is a further modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and GFP carrying a C-terminal ssrA tag. This targets the protein for destruction by ClpXP. We hypothesized that the Pdu40 sequence would target GFPssrA to the microcompartment  and that this would protect GFP from degradation. Some GFP was found to by protected by-coexpression with the microcompartment.
4. Proof of Principle
A) BBa_K562010 . This is a further modified version of BBa_K562001 that produces a fusion between the Pdu20 tag and mCherry carrying a C-terminal HA tag. We hypothesized that the Pdu20 sequence would target mCherry to the microcompartment. Some mCherry was found in the microcompartment upon purification.
B) BBa_K562011 . This is a further modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and mCherry carrying a C-terminal HA tag. Some mCherry was found in the microcompartment upon purification.
5. Application - magnetic bacteria
BBa_K562014 . This is a further modified version of BBa_K562002 that produces a fusion between the Pdu40 tag and bacterioferritin (Bfr) from Escherichia coli. The Pdu40-Bfr fusion also carries a C-terminal HA tag. We hypothesized that the Pdu40 sequence would target Bfr to the microcompartment. Bfr forms a large storage protein for iron and iron oxides It was hoped that targeting Bfr to the sphereactor would concentrate iron in large particles in the cytoplasm.

PyeaR is usually repressed by NsrR, however when nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, NsrR is sequestered thus preventing its repression of PyeaR and allowing the production of GFP. We can therefore, utilise this function in order to show levels of nitric oxide via GFP expression.

Today was the day of our road trip to Cambridge where we would be meeting the Cambridge iGEM team and visiting their labs as well as attending 'The Business Hub' program om STAR radio to give an interview on iGEM and synthetic biology. Before leaving the UEA Campus we finalised everything for the interview and gave mock interviews to Khadija and Pascoe, the two members of the team that would be speaking on air, in order to help prepare for the kinds of questions they may be asked. We also organised what our aims were for our meeting with Cambridge's iGEM team, and decided that as their project appeared to be of a similar like to ours that we would look into collaborating with one another.

Beginning Research in Non-Model Microbes with Concordia University iGEM , Cornell University iGEM , Northeastern University iGEM , University of British Columbia iGEM , University of La Verne iGEM , and Utah State University iGEM
Over the past few years, iGEM has increasingly centered around non-model microorganisms—organisms which are less well-characterized and have fewer resources for genetic manipulation than the model E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Despite a prevalence of non-model organisms in iGEM competition projects and the potential impact which these projects may have, few resources exist for teams hoping to initiate research in non-model strains.
The 2015 Yale University iGEM team has collaborated with several other teams working in non-model strains to design a set of considerations for future iGEM teams in order to reduce the barrier to entry into non-model organisms. We synthesized the experiences of other teams into a handout, which has been made available on our team wiki and will be available at out poster at the Jamboree.

Using this set up we will be able to show that our software is capable to support time consuming methods like SELEX, to identify Aptamers that bind specifically to small molecules. As an interesting target, we will sense the small molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in biochemical reactions. A common method that is performed in thousands of laboratories is a in vitro transcriptions To study the function of ribonucleic acids, RNA is generally prepared by in vitro transcription
Beckert2011
. Using bacteriophage DNA dependent RNA polymerases (T7, T3, Sp6), a variety of different RNAs can be enzymatically synthesized in the lab. In this context we want to establish a new biochemical readout method, called real-time SMS, to record simultaneously small molecules (ATP) and enzymatic kinetics (RNA polymerase) using Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system.
AIMS AND METHODOLOGIES
Common techniques to sense small molecules in biochemical reactions are most likely connected to radioactive labeling. The exposure to radioactive sources is known to result in damage of the genetic information and is therefore more and more banished from lab work. However because of its sensitivity, radioactive chemicals are needed to monitor small changes of those molecules.
A common method that is performed in many laboratories is an in vitro transcription (Fig. 1A). This method is usually performed in a black-box manner. To analyze the decrease of nucleotide trisphosphate over time as well as to determine the success of the in vitro transcription, scientists use radioactive labelled nucleotide triphosphates and perform time demanding acrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Fig. 1. in vitro transcription and fluorescent RNA Aptamers.
A
A DNA template is transcribed by and RNA Polymerase (RNAP) into RNA. Tools to analyze the kinetic of the polymerase or consumption of the nucleotide triphosphates during the reaction in real-time are still missing.
B
Secondary structure of the Spinach Aptamer. The Spinach RNA consists of three stem loops that are important for the binding of the dye DFHBI. In presence of the dye a fluoresced signal is emitted.
C

To establish such tool box, two different fluorescent RNA constructs will be applied: The first construct is a fusion of an ATP aptamer

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Lab#Methanol#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,"21 Gold (DE3) showed the highest formation of formaldehyde proving the strongest activity of the Mdh compared to the other strains. Neither in the respective cell fragments nor in the supernatant of the lysed cells a similarly high activity could be observed. This indicates that the Mdh functions best in its natural environment within the cell and the cell membrane possibly representing a barrier protecting the Mdh from the harsh assay environment.
Achievements
Proving the catalytical activity of the Bacillus methanolicus methanol dehydrogenase 2 in E. coli via Nash Assay despite the formation of inclusion bodies
Expression verification & localization of the Mdh
The expression of the Mdh was verified by doing an SDS-PAGE. To localize the Mdh not only whole cells were used but also the fragments of lysed cells and the respective supernatant. The expected bands were clearly visible in all samples proving the expression of the Mdh. However, the Mdh specific band had the highest intensity in the sample of the cell fragments whereas the same band was only of slight intensity in the supernatant. This indicates that the Mdh is incorporated into insoluble inclusion bodies.
Expression test of #IGEM#
An SDS-PAGE of the whole cell, the cell fragments and the lysate supernatant of the Mdh expressing BL21 Gold (#IGEM#) and the GlgC expressing BL21 Gold (#OHES#) as a negative control was run. The expected band at the weigth of the Mdh can be clearly seen in all #IGEM# samples. The according band with the strongest intensity occurs in the lane with #IGEM# fragments indicating the formation of inclusion bodies containg the Mdh.
To avoid the incorporation of the Mdh into inclusion bodies, the alternative E. coli strains SHuffle T7 Express and C43 were used. SHuffle T7 Express allows more efficient protein folding in the cytoplasm and lacks proteases whereas C43 allows the expression of toxic proteins. Additionally, cultivation at a lower temperature of 30°C was tested. It was shown that all strains were able to grow on M9 medium, however, another test for the expression and localization of the Mdh did not reveal major differences between the strains. In every case the Mdh was still incorporated into inclusion bodies.
Functionality of the expressed Mdh
To test if the expressed Mdh is functional, we modified a colorimetric and fluorescent formaldehyde assay described by T. Nash. In the presence of formaldehyde the yellow and fluorescing diacetyl-dihydro lut"

As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring, I want to handle the ideology of maths to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life. iGEM provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization.
In this group, I am the unique girl among nine boys, and the most frequently spoken of mine is ""Oh, it's my duty to get some soy sauce! "" Strange, huh?  The  connotation of it is not words but meanings. Those guys are too gentle to arrange me doing something of coding.So I am more involved in clerical works, I design the team uniform and our logo,arrange the scheduling and get in touch with sponsors and alumni connection.

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

Meet-Ups
In this summer, our team attended several meetings organized by other iGEM teams. We have learned a lot from these meetings by interacting with other teams. We are also benefited from exchanging ideas and initiating collaborations during these meetings.  On the other hand, our idea about the synthetic biology platform also synergized with other team’s project.
July 30, 2017：The fifth Asian iGEM Conference
The fifth Asian IGEM Conference was held in National Ciao Tong University in Taiwan in early August this year. Around 15 Mainland teams including our team, together with 20 Taiwan teams, 1 Japan team and 1 US team shared ideas and thoughts with each other, and enjoyed wonderful and unforgettable days in NCTU campus.
This conference held by team NCTU_Formosa was originally an internal meeting between teams in Taiwan, and now it has become an important activity for pan-Pacific iGEM teams. Our team members enrolled in this conference to communicate with other teams with different culture background about our project’s idea and philosophy.
We received several valuable feedbacks about the poster and presentation of our project from other team members and instructors. Those great suggestions turned out to be essential for our later work, mostly for human practice and hardware design. During the conference, we also reached a cooperative intention with team USTC, and we finally made an effective collaboration.
Thoughts were spread, and friendship were made in this 4-day-conference, we also enjoyed fantastic city tours in Hsinchu and Taipei. We would like to extend sincere gratitude to the host, team NCTU, and all the participator of this unforgettable midsummer voyage.
August 19, 2017: Fablab open night for iGEM

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"-component signaling pathway and senses copper and silver ions. In the presence of copper, CusS phosphorylates the response regulator CusR, which in turn interacts with a copper responsive promoter element, activating gene expression (Munson, Lam, Outten, & O’Halloran, 2000). We chose this configuration because it would allow us to test the possibility of generating hybrid receptors using a simple transcriptional readout, without having to be dependent on Aim 2 (generation of a functional BRET pair).
To test the functionality of our receptor, we generated a new BioBrick (BBa_K2736105 ) consisting of a copper sensitive promoter followed by the coding sequence of the red fluorescent protein (RFP, from BBa_K516032 ) (Figure 2). By measuring the intensity of RFP emission in a photospectrometer or by fluorescence microscopy, we can determine both whether the receptor functions, as well as to what degree it transduces a signal.
We transformed E. coli strain DH5α with plasmids encoding the RFP reporter, as well as our hybrid receptor. As a control, we transformed E. coli with the reporter alone. We grew both strains overnight in LB, which contains Aspartate and hence should result in RFP expression when our hybrid receptor is present. After overnight culture, we assessed the presence or absence of RFP by fluorescence microscopy. We observed bright RFP expression in bacteria transformed with both receptor and reporter encoding plasmids, but only very low levels of RFP in bacteria transformed with the reporter construct alone (Figure 3).
Figure 2:  Reporter construct consisting of RFP under control of the CopA copper-sensitive promoter (BioBrick BBa_K2736105 ).
To further test the responsiveness of the Hybrid receptor to Aspartate, we attempted to grow our E. coli strain in a minimal medium lacking Aspartate (M9 + 0.4% glucose), which should not induce expression of RFP. However, we were unsuccessful at culturing bacteria in this medium. As an alternative, we grew bacteria overnight in LB (causing RFP expression), and then transferred them to M9 + 0.4% glucose for 8 hours to allow part of the RFP to degrade. We then split the bacteria over two tubes, and added 250 uM Aspartate to one of these samples. After 4 hours, we quantified the levels of RFP expression using a spectrophotometer. Even after 8 hours in M9, levels of RFP were still very high. Nevertheless,"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code"

Public Engagement & Education
Synthetic biology and the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) is not familiar to the public in China. Therefore, we took this opportunity to promote synthetic biology and our CUPID projects. In the last two years since the team was founded (established in 2016), we have hosted and participated in many exciting events such as university open day, general science festivals and booth display to engage with the public about our project, iGEM and synthetic biology.
Next we divided into two parts: Public Engagement and Education to demonstrate the dialogues of the public with our project and related social activities.
Public Engagement
Laboratory Open days
The Lab Open Day is a traditional activity of our school. In the lab open days of 2017 and 2018, we opened our iGEM. There we talked with high school students, college students, teachers, parents (...) who explained what iGEM is and what is synthetic biology. In addition, we also show what our project is trying to achieve, and its practical application and show our work in the lab.
Many of the people we have contacted are very interested in our projects, iGEM, and synthetic biology. We have also left our contact information and some of them have a deeper discussion. We like to raise and answer questions with the public. Sharing our projects in this way is a very rewarding experience.
Graffiti Wall
In order to promote our project, we have prepared the graffiti wall on the campus for non-biology major students to know more about iGEM and the project. Dedicated to our vision of our project, this art work creates an oasis in the desert with the words ""Painting the Desert"". In order to make our project known by more audiences, we also attached with the most popular social media in China - the QR code of Wechat which contains more detailed introduction of the project and iGEM.

Nanomachine Detecting Microbiotics
Abusing antibiotics has caused severe antibiotics contamination and resistance issues worldwide. Therefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with OD detector and optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.
In NDM, there are two bacterial systems for measurement:
ROSE, an engineered bacterial reporter system integrated with permeability modification, logic amplification circuit and quorum sensing, is able to adjust EGFP expression level, and NDM reads fluorescence intensity from ROSE to send results in high resolution.
CACCI, chemotaxis and transmembrane protein-modified bacteria, are chemically covalently adhered to a polymer membrane. Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample can be accurately told.
Hope with our project, antibiotics issues can be solved in an accelerated way.

What is Antibiotics?
Antibiotics, or microbiotics, in narrow sense, are a various type of artificially constructed or naturally existing chemicals containing the capability of killing bactiera or inhibiting their growth, which are implemented widespreadly around the world. Patients who got bactieral or protozoan infection from surgical wound like war field, empyrosis and previously regarding severe diseases such as general cold, tuberculosis(TB), sexual transmitted diseases(STD), dysentery, anthrax, even cancer and so forth are able to cure treating with antibiotic substances. Since the discovery of penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has been enlarged a lot. With properly administration of antibiotics, millions of people were saved in evidently alleviated symptom. There was a time when antibiotics, along with oil source for automobile, was indispensable for human beings.
Antibiotic substances containing several mechanism, rendering them to kill and inhibit bactieral growth in their own ways. Those mechanisms including:
inhibit the synthesis of cell wall.
influence the function of cell membrane.
inhibit the biosynthesis of nucleic acid.
inhibit the biosynthesis of proteins.

Our system includes two main parts one is CotA laccase and the other is biofilm containing SpyTag. So our experiments were mainly divided in three periods, verifying both parts individually and verifying Biofilm x Laccase system as a whole.
The first period was to construct our biofilm containing SpyTag. We fused SpyTag to the CsgA, which is the major component of our biofilm. We successfully verified that protein fused with spycatcher domain could be fixed on our biofilm.
Then we isolated CotA gene of B. subtilis WT168 and successfully expressed this laccase in E. coli cell. We confirmed its oxidation function. Furthermore, we attached CotA coding sequence with several signal peptides and tested the efficiency of secretion.
The final period is mainly focused on combination of the two parts above. Experiments were conducted to measure the laccase activity of the total Biofilm x Laccase system. A significant difference was confirmed between the experiment group and the control group. Thus, our system is successful.
II. Period 1 - CsgA - SpyTag
We appended peptide domain SpyTag to amyloid protein CsgA, the dominant component in E. coli biofilms [Fig 1.1]. The sequence of this fusion protein was constructed on pET28a plasmid and was promoted by a Ptac promoter. Since there is already a copy of CsgA gene on MG1655 wild type’s genome, we need to knock out this wildtype gene CsgA. Using CRISPR, gene CgsA successfully knocked out the gene on MG1655’s genome (ΔCsgA-MG1655 strain, done by Yiming Dong from Bluepha). The strain ΔCsgA-MG1655 would then be used as chassis cell in afterward experiments.
Fig1.1: Assembly and function of CsgA-SpyTag
Verification of biofilm forming
Amyloid protein, like CsgA, could be colored by certain protein pigment. For instance, brilliant blue and Congo red. To verify the biofilm forming after IPTG induction, we compared the biofilm configuration between different experiment groups.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," we are still waiting      to hear from 33 teams. 74% teams participated with one or more members      to the survey.
75% of participants were interested with synthetic biology field      for academic purposes.
Browsing the Registry of Standard Parts
56% of participants think that it is not easy to search      for the parts in Registry of Standard Parts. Many comments      indicate a need for a better search engine and more flexible keyword      search options, especially excepting aliases. Also many are longing      for recognizable parts names, which will ease searching with keyword.
Partnership with Google and enforcing standardized parts names     are suggested
As a global organization iGEM can offer the Parts Registry in     different languages and more illustrations describing how the system     works.
Content of Registry of Standard Parts
57% of participants agree that the number of parts registered      in the Registry of Standard Parts is not enough for their projects.
55% of participants think that there are enough and      useful parts distributed in iGEM Plates that we can use in our projects.
Even though most agree the number of parts in the registry is impressive,     still they find it limited when it comes to design different devices     for diverse applications especially in different species other than     E. Coli. Participants believe that if there are more functional standardized     parts, especially protein coding sequences and promoter-RBS , they can     design devices according to the needs of the community instead of designing     what can simply be assembled into a device.
Encouraging development of vectors and standards for new species     and new standardized parts in different research areas is suggested.
Enforcing submission of right DNA sequences and working conditions     for each part is suggested.
Few recommend expanding iGEM into a collaborative effort rather     than an undergraduate tournament, which will increase the number and     the diversity of the parts designed and submitted all throughout the     year.
Submission to the Parts Registry
52% of participants said that they have not encountered      difficulties during submitting parts. Even though participants      are satisfied with the web interface of the registry, most complains      about the pSB1C3 as the new standard plasmid to submit DNA.
71% of participants are like minded with our team's      opinion, which is that The nomenclature of part IDs such as construct,      device, composite parts, protein generator, is confusing as there      is no consensus on how to use them correctly.
Terminology and categorization used on iGEM’s Parts Registry should     be re-described and correct use of terminology should be enforced during     the submission process.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane UV_-_-_TEXT.html," peptides capable of binding melanin. We sought to create a binding domain that would retain large quantities of melanin by engineering a repetitive gene construct containing many copies of the most successful small melanin binding peptides from various studies. Our team decided to pursue the decapeptide known as 4B4 and a hepaptide called 4D, along with irrelevant control peptides PA1 and P601G for reference. [12] [13]
Repetitive Nucleotide Sequence Assembly
Figure 5: Electrophoresis Gel of the Melanin Binding Proteins.
Assembling large chains of repetitive DNA sequences is a difficult process due to the high probability of improper annealing during construction. In 2015, our advisor Kosuke Fujishima published a novel method for repetitive DNA strand assembly using small dsDNA blocks with overlap-based redundancies. [14] We designing small chunks of DNA, each coding for a single deca or heptapeptide, with identical 3' and 5' single stranded six nucleotide overlaps. By phosphorylating the DNA blocks' 5' ends with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB), and allowing the strands to ligate overnight with T4 DNA Ligase (NEB), we were able to generate up to 30 repeated segments per strand (shown in gel image, see protocol ). Elongation is halted when a building block has a deletion, insertion, or substitution on its 5' overhang, which prevents further DNA blocks from annealing to its sticky end. These errors led to much higher concentrations of strands with fewer repeats than our target length, which we defined as around ten repeated binding domains. Although we were able to form repetitive strands that could be visualized in a gel with all four of our peptides, along with a randomized hybrid of 4B4/4D, we ran into difficulties in gel extracting all but 4D and P601G at a high enough concentration and purity for insertion into plasmid backbones via Gibson Assembly Protocol.

Repetitive 4D and P601G strands were assembled into pSB1C3 backbones with an upstream flanking constitutive promoter and strong RBS. Downstream of the genes, a cellulose binding domain (CBD) extracted from the 2016 distribution kit part BBa_K1321357 via PCR was included as a proof of concept membrane binding domain, separated from the melanin binding module by a GS linker to"

However, as of the creation period of the kill switch, neither are available from the iGEM registry. For this reason, we chose to isolate both genes directly from E. coli genomic DNA via PCR amplification. In order to simplify the construction process, the forward primers we synthesized included BBa_B0034 , an RBS, between the iGEM prefix and the"

A Suitable Chassis
We need a chassis in which to house our system. Given that we intended to get our sensory element from either Pseudomonas or microalgae, and that these organisms are both naturally present within tailings ponds, we chose to focus on them. As such, we contributed and characterized several parts for future work in microalgae, and to move plasmids efficiently from E. coli to Pseudomonas. Click the chassis to learn more!
The Vision: A Naphthenic Acid Biosensor

Activation of astrocytes in this way does not fully mimic the process in vivo. Although there is evidence that these three cytokines are enough to induce reactive astrocytes, it is possible that other factors are involved in vivo which may affect the phenotype.
In Liddelow, 20171 primary astrocytes are activated, while we are working with C8D30 cell lines. Therefore, the protocol may not correspond exactly.

HZAU-China has designed the OmpA-RGD protein to achieve this goal because of the need to enhance the targeting of engineered Salmonella they use. RGD is a well-studied tumor homing tripeptide that specifically binds to αvβ3 (αvβ3) integrin, which is widely overexpressed on cancer cells. So there is a cell line called MDA-MB-231 that shows the αvβ3 needed for their further targeting and safety experiments. So we helped them contact the channel from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology to get the cell line.

Based on the problems encountered in the advancement of the previous issues, we developed an APP in order to solve the problem of communication between the teams on the subject, real-time understanding of the dynamics of each team, and seeking help.
The following is an introduction to our app:
We developed iGEMCloud to solve some of iGEM's current problems, with immediacy, openness and interactivity. Currently, information about iGEM comes from many websites. They are scattered, chaotic, and unfriendly to individual users. So we created this app (until now, it is based on android, we hope to launch iOS version in the future), we hope it is an information collection platform, receiving the latest information of iGEM, this is a microblog user who allows everyone to personally or The form of the team is involved in the discussion and the community built for iGEMer around the world.
In order to better get feedback from our app and improve accordingly to make it more suitable for team use, our ideas are more perfect. We contacted China Pharmaceutical University to help us test the software.
They help us fix the software by sending post updates and more.
Based on the posts they sent, we conducted another software fix upgrade.
China Pharmaceutical University gave us affirmation and help, and put forward corresponding opinions on the user's feelings, etc., not only give us encouragement, but also let us have a direction for the improvement of APP in the future.

The models allowed us to ensure that it will be valid to use our modified system. Our cloning strategy hence focused on taking this brick apart and using its constituent parts in a new arrangement (Fig. 2). To test our system, we used the two compounds potassium chromate, and potassium dichromate. We also used two control substances, chromium(III)chloride and the isostructural potassium sulphate and observed if it had any influence on the level of fluorescence. Chromium(III)chloride was chosen to probe the system's specificity for Cr(VI), and potassium sulphate was chosen in order to test the structural selectivity for Cr(VI). All additives were tested at concentrations between 10nM and 100µM as recommended in the literature. (5) .
Before testing the complete system, we first checked if we can detect both individual parts of it. For this purpose, western blots against both, GFP, and His-6 - ChrB were done (Fig. 5 and 6).
Figure 5. anti-GFP: Single colonies of JM110 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (A) and MC1061 + pSB1C3-Pchr-gfp (B) were prepared for western blotting against GFP. pSB1C3 was included as a negative control, and PmanA-gfp as a positive control.

The newly designed system was investigated firstly by comparing the GFP output for the different concentrations of the respective additive. At the same time the results were compared to the original biobrick. Furthermore, the cell density was measured at the same time (Fig. 7).

For information about the 2018 iGEM Sustainable Labs Challenge, click here!
BostonU 2018 is tremendously excited about sustainable lab practices. Laboratories are massive consumers of energy and sources of waste production. Energy and resources are put to good use in the pursuit of science, but BostonU believes that it is our scientific responsibility to maximize efficient use of our planet's resources. In doing so, we not only can reduce our energy consumption, but can ensure our results are ironclad.
Here, we present GreenGEM, an online resource that builds upon the work of TU Dresden 2017, the makers of iGEM Goes Green . GreenGEM aggregates a collection of resources to generate a streamlined, user-friendly guide to implementing best practices for sustainable science. Many of the suggestions contained herein are chosen to minimize energy consumption and waste production while prioritizing robust scientific results.
Action Areas
After reaching out to Sustainability@BU and conducting a review of sustainable science literature, we compiled a list of sustainable actions for labs. We identified four Action Areas in which scientists can improve their environmental impact while preserving the quality of their results.

If the concentration of a few inputs is in the ON range, while the others are in the middle range, should the device show an ON or an OFF state? It may show neither, as we have seen above, leaving the researcher confused as to how the results must be perceived.
Figure: input AND gate which can act as a biosensor, sensing a particular environmental condition, and generating an output such as fluorescence through GFP.
High Cooperativity Repressors – A Possible Solution
The solution to the problem lies in the cooperativity of the parts that are used as actuators in these digital devices. These are mostly created using repressors or activators, which can repress or activate their respective promoters. Cooperativity is basically the phenomenon where the repressor (or activator) molecules do not act independently of each other, and two or more molecules of the same are needed to first bind to each other, before binding to the promoter that they are to repress.
What this means is that if the cooperativity of the repressor is “n”, then unless n molecules of the repressor combine, they would not be able to repress the promoter and control gene expression. This kind of behavior becomes desirable, since when low quantities of the repressor are present, we would expect lesser repression in the case of a high cooperativity repressor. This would generate a response that would be closer to the digital output, which is desired. This is further explained in the modeling section, but just for a brief idea, here is what the picture looks like, for increasing cooperativity.
Figure – Variation of output with repressor concentration. As can be seen, the response for n = 1 is the furthest away from a digital response, while as n increases, the output moves from 1 to 0 in a more digital fashion.
The Square Wave Generator
With the goal of searching and employing high cooperativity repressors, we looked at a paper by Voigt et al (Nature Chem Biol. 2013), in which they reported 73 analogs of the TetR repressor, of which 16 of them were found to be perfectly orthogonal to each other. A few of these repressors had really high cooperativities, with the highest n value being 6.1 for the Orf2 repressor.
We therefore decided to use repressors which were orthogonal and had the highest possible cooperativity, to demonstrate computationally, how these could be used in simple devices such as NOT gates and novel collapsible AND gates (where once the output switches from "

III. Add the multichannel
This design has four sampling channels and two detection channels. It enables us to have two channels of the detection the signal which will make it a less-error equipment.
IV. Add the valve
In this design, we make a valve in the chip so that you can control which sampling channel to add the sample.
We also have this design of two sampling channels and four detection channels. You can control which detection channel to output.
In this section, which of those two designs is more practical needs more experiments to test.
V. Add the Modularization
This chip should be assmbled into two parts of “1-2-3-4-4.4” and “4.6-5-6”, which we name as partA and partB. You can use partB with different partA in which we have added different engineered bacteria.

Summary of Week 7: July 18 - July 24
Part of the team worked on creating protocols for a robot liquid handler to run the usual lab reactions that we run. We are hoping that the robot can replace us and do our liquid-related lab work for us. Various dry test runs were done. We transfected various DNA parts that we have into Hek293 cells, and results show that most of our DNA works. We investigated the TRE-rtTA3 system as well as the UAS-Gal4 system. Both seemed to be functional.

POST 2 | A General Overview of Intellectual Property in Synthetic Biology: Part 2
The Basis of Patent Law in Synthetic Biology: Software
Synthetic biology research is pushing the bounds of what we once thought was possible in biology. Because of this, synthetic biology is also pushing the limits of how we as a society have defined ownership and property. While sixty years ago the question was inconceivable, today it is completely reasonable to ask, “can I patent a genome?” or, “can I own the property rights to a living creature?” These are big, important questions! Interestingly, the best answers the U.S. courts have to solving these questions comes from, of all places, the world of software.
Prior to the development of computers, intellectual property could be protected by trademarks, copyright laws, and patents. These classifications proved robust and effective up until the emergence of software applications. Software, unlike anything seen before, is a written programing language that results in a function or utility. Thus, it makes sense that one could copyright the contents of their code, and patent the functionality of their software tool. As some examples, Mario is a copyrighted character in Nintendo games, and the functionality of the Excel spreadsheet is patented under Microsoft.
People studying intellectual property rights in synthetic biology quickly realized that the closest example from which to draw a conclusion would be software. Software is similar to synthetic biology for multiple reasons; namely, developers (or researchers) create programs (or biological parts) that code for high level functions (such as transcriptional regulation). Therefore, today many of the intellectual property rights that define synthetic biology are drawn from software laws. As we compare intellectual property in synthetic biology to that in software, it is important to be aware of the differences between the two, the most important being that you can patent both DNA and software code for its function, but you cannot copyright DNA code, as you could for a piece of software.

The major differences between the results and our theoretical values was the later maximum GFP concentration and the difference between the measured maximum and the theoretical maximum for 9×10-9moles/dm-3 of miRNA. In order to delay the peak in GFP concentration the rate of RNA decay had to be decreased. We also introduced a term for GFP degradation, to account for the peak in fluorescence. We then tried to fit the data by changing the parameters with these ideas in mind. The new values for these parameters were:

Educational Package
Relevance
Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology are two emerging fields of Australian research, both of which have the potential to make significant contributions to the health, environment and agriculture sectors1. In order to reflect this, the Education Department of the Australian state of New South Wales has recently rewritten the syllabus to include ‘Biotechnology’ and ‘Genetics’ modules in its an elective two-year biology course for high school juniors and seniors (American equivalent Grade 11 and Grade 12). Previously, these modules could be chosen as part of an intensive elective study, however, they now must be completed by all students taking the course, which is one of the most popular in the state. As a result, resources relating to the ‘Biotechnology’ and ‘Genetics’ topics are limited.
Universities have been supporting the syllabus changes, running workshops and educational activities to provide support to educators. Our team similarly wanted to get involved with this and as such, have focused on assisting with the syllabus changes by running a high school excursion and creating an educational package. Not only has this allowed us to meaningfully help science educators, but it has given us the opportunity to inspire high school leavers with current biological trends – and thereby encourage the next generation of scientists and engineers.
Research
In deciding to create an educational package based around our school workshop, we looked to previous iGEM teams to get ideas on the best way to construct such a tool. We took inspiration from the William and Mary 2015 iGEM team , who developed a comprehensive booklet of experiments and activities relating to synthetic biology for schools in the state of Virginia, USA. Other iGEM teams have pursued similar ideas, including Aachen 2016 and Toulouse 2016 , however both of these documents were seen as difficult to adapt to an Australian context, due to language barriers.

NTHU_Formosa,2018,Team:NTHU Formosa#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in this portable device! NCTU_Formosa introduced their system of balancing varieties of bacterial growth in the soil by applying corresponding amounts of bacteriocin. NTHU_Taiwan intends to regulate the population of bacteria Vibrio, which possess great potential for commercializing.
All projects are pursuing a better future for human or industries. This seminar helped all teams to re-examine the feasibility and comprehensive aspects of their projects for further improvement.
Fig. 3. Delightful seminar with NCTU_Formosa, NTHU_Taiwan and Mingdao.
Questions about BioWatcher asked by other teams in this mini-seminar:
1. Bioluminescence is too weak to penetrate tissue?
The bioluminescence used in BioWatcher has an emission wavelength of 490 nm. Although bioluminescence at this wavelength can be absorb by chromophores, experiments proved the successful               bioluminescence penetration through captured under imaging system. Besides, the fact that this mild intensity of this bioluminescence is invisible to the naked eye can ease the users’ concern of turning into green-glowing lamps.
2. Concerns about applying engineered cells in human bodies
The application of our system can be widely used in detecting soluble and insoluble ligands in the environment, living organisms and, our ultimate pursuit, in human bodies which post serious concerns. In terms of delivering engineered cells                 into human body, invasive and noninvasive measures, such as injection, nasal delivery and viral therapy, are considered. However, we faced our biggest challenge--choosing the proper cell to be applied. Several aspects need to be evaluated                 including lifespan of the cells, its amount in the circulating system, possible immune rejection…etc. As hard as it is, existing cellular immunotherapy is keeping our hopes up. Undoubtedly, this project is still immature. However, white blood                 cells and mesenchymal stem cells are our candidates so far.
Industry
Industry
On July 16th, we visited Singular Wings Medical, a very successful award-winning biotech wearables startup, to learn about biotech industry and how our project--BioWatcher is perceived in industrial and commercial point of view.
BioWatcher is a very novel and tentative idea, though; we believe BioWatcher has potential in the diagnosis industry. Entrepreneurship is the ultimate goal where biologists bring biotech into the real world and make the world a better                 place. Therefore, we presented BioWatcher to Singular Wings Medical, a very successful award-winning biotech wearables startup.

SEU_A,2012,Team:SEU A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," is no such ‘up and down’difference inside one site in this 2.5D model. The thickness of nutriment is 0. The reasons why we set this model like this are as follows: 1. The model abstracts the thickness of bacteria into three levels, making the modeling and simulation able to be built and operated in several lattices, which greatly reduces the difficulty of modeling and the time of simulation. 2. Some three-dimensional properties are added to the SDTC model. For example, the filial generation comes out randomly around the parental generation. If the two layers of the neighborhood were taken over, the division will however be controlled. In a word, the SDTC model is a 2.5D model. 3. The model also largely simplifies the judgment of donor cell and receptor cell in conjugation (the conjugation occurs only when the donor cell and receptor cell are at the same site). We introduce the conception of ‘neighborhood’ in our plane domain and divide it into ‘bacteria neighborhood’ and ‘nutriment neighborhood’. As to any point, the bacteria of the bacterial neighborhood mean all the bacteria in the center of the 3 × 3 square area; similarly, the nutrition of the nutrient neighborhood refers to the nutrient in the center of the 7 × 7 square area. The detailed reasons of setting like this were discussed in Reference [2]. It is considered that bacteria can reproduce and transfer only within a certain distance due to the use of agar medium, but bacteria and nutrients cannot move. This is the fundamental difference between this model and the model in solution. 2.2 Bacterial and nutrient system E. coli can be divided into three categories: D-donor, R-receptor, T-conjugative transfer receptor. Considering the bacterial horizontal conjugative transformation and reproduction, their speeds are related to the quantity of nutrients in the neighborhood, which is conformed to the beta function (a sigmoidal function). Specifically, there are two thresholds - the lower one C1 and the upper one C2. When the quantity of nutrients in the neighborhood C
C1, reproduction and conjugative transformation will do at a highest speed Ψ2 and γ2 respectively. Ψ2 of the three bacteria D, R and T are different. When C2>C>C1, the speed of reproduction γ and the speed of conjugative transformation Ψ obey the distribution of C Linear within the minimum and maximum. In the condition that there are nutrients in the nutritional neighborhood, D and R that are at the same site on the layers of different thicknesses"

Steps 6 and 7 (involving solutions II and III need to be carried out in quick succession (adhering to the short incubation time) to ensure good results. It is advisable to do these two steps in pairs as in step 6 the tubes need to be tightly capped once solution II is added.
After addition of solution II, the waiting time before proceeding to the next step should not be more than 5 minutes.
The precipitate formed in following addition of solution III does not pellet well after centrifugation in step 8, and hence the suspension needs to be removed immediately to prevent resuspension.
The inversion in step 6 needs to be done gently so that genomic DNA of the bacteria are not extracted along with the desired plasmid DNA.
50µL of elution buffer per tube was used at the end because plasmid DNA is being eluted.

University of Aachen
We worked with the University of Aachen, Germany on a collaboration that was focused mainly on human practices. Their project, similar to ours, centers around the depleting access of clean drinking water to people around the world. Unlike our project, which focused on lead contamination, Team Aachen focused on salt contamination in drinking water. Our collaboration was sparked due to mutual interest in how our project inspirations affected other countries around the world. In our collaboration, Team WPI researched salt contamination in the United States. We explored where and why salt contamination was a problem along with how it impacts citizens of the United States. In exchange, Team Aachen researched and translated information on lead contamination in Germany. From this information, we learned about the political policies that have lead to the country's overall lack of lead contamination in their drinking water. This information further helped us develop the Human Practices component of our project by giving us a global picture and broader understanding of what causes lead contamination in water as well as a system to look toward when developing a set of policies to lessen contamination.
Boston University: Hardware
We worked with Boston University Hardware to begin developing a microfluidic chip that could be used to increase the accuracy and efficiency of our gold-nanoparticle lead detection assay. Boston University’s project is focused on improving the ease and ability of developing and building microfluidic chips without the need of a middle man. Our project’s Lead Assay had several components that BU’s Hardware Team was hoping to improve in microfluidic chips. It was an ideal collaboration because making the lead assay automated would improve its accuracy, and it would challenge BU’s team.
Over the course of the collaboration, members of WPI iGEM traveled to BU Hardware iGEM’s lab in order to test the reproducibility of our lead assay with a different set of equipment. This experiment allowed both teams to understand what aspects of the assay are susceptible to change and should therefore be optimized in the final product. Our team ended up realizing that the assay was not appropriate for our project, but we still worked with BU’s Hardware Team to see if it could be automated.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," The acetyl CoA is phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate, and then de-phosphorylated to produce ATP from ADP. The ATP is used as energy to drive translation of mRNA.
Figure 1 Diagrammatic overview of CFPS supplement roles in transcription and translation.
Energy can also be derived from glutamate in the supplement solution (Jewett, et al., 2008), which is added in the form of magnesium glutamate and potassium glutamate. Glutamate is a metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which generates NADH. In whole cells, NADH is used in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation relies on membrane bound proteins and proton gradients across a membrane. It has been shown previously that extracts prepared using French Press or sonication contain membrane vesicles which have ATPase activity (Futai, 1974), and that oxidative phosphorylation can be activated in CFPS systems (Jewett, et al., 2008). Sodium oxalate, another component of the supplement solution, is also used to help increase energy generation by the system. PEP synthetase, an enzyme present in E. coli, converts pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) in a reaction which consumes ATP, thereby wasting ATP and directing it away from protein synthesis. Oxalate inhibits PEP synthetase by acting as a pyruvate mimic, and hence limit the energy wasted by this reaction. The ribonucleotides ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP are also components of the supplement solution. They are used in the synthesis of mRNA for transcription of desired genes encoding on exogenous DNA added to the system, and ATP can also be used directly as energy for translation. The polyamines spermidine and putrescine are two other supplements which are added to aid with transcription. It is thought that they can bind proteins and DNA to help recruit polymerase for transcription. Polyamines may also increase translation fidelity, aid ribosome assembly, and activate tRNAs (Jelenc & Kurland, 1979; Jewett & Swartz, 2004b; Algranati & Goldemberg, 1977). To enable translation to occur, amino acids (added separately from the supplement solution) and an E. coli tRNA mixture are added to the CFPS system. Folinic acid is also added as it can be used as a source of folinate for the synthesis of f-Met; the amino acid required for initiation"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Toxicity Theory_-_-_TEXT.html,"., 2015; Kehrer, 2000). Haber-Weiss:     Fe3+ + •O2- → Fe2+ + O2 Fenton:     Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + •OH In order to neutralize the ROS and repair the occurred damage bacteria have different mechanisms they can rely on. Two types of superoxide dismutase (SOD) dismutate O2- into H2O2: MnSOD and FeSOD (encoded by sodA and sodB) (Broxton & Culotta, 2016). Catalases (encoded by katE and katG) are able to disproportionate H2O2 into the nontoxic components H2O and O2 (Chaithawiwat et al., 2016). Further detoxification is achieved by the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase Ahp (encoded by ahpC and ahpF) which scavenges various free organic hydroperoxides (Kamariah et al., 2016). These genes are in E. coli under the control of various global regulators such as OxyR and SoxR. The regulators also promote the expression of genes involved in the repair of the damaged cell membranes, DNA and proteins and are activated by a conformational change induced by oxidative stress (Dubbs & Mongkolsuk, 2016; Seo et al., 2015). Furthermore, the tripeptide glutathione plays a vital role in the detoxification of the cell regarding the decomposition of radicals to deal with oxidative stress. The enzymes encoded by gshA and gshB are responsible for the synthesis of glutathione. However, the crucial part in fighting oxidative stress via glutathione is executed by the glutathione peroxidase BtuE, encoded by btuE, and the glutathione reductase GSR, encoded by gor. BtuE uses glutathione as a reducing agent to scavenge hydrogen peroxide and peroxide radicals. ROOH + 2 GSH → ROH + GSSG + H2O GSR then recovers the used glutathione by reducing the generated glutathione disulfide under the consumption of NADPH. The phytochelatin synthase (PCS1) or also called glutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase catalyzes the formation of phytochelatin out of the precursor glutathione in plants and fungi (Grill et al.,"

13. This time, the cells were resuspended with 2 mL of 20% glycerol.
14. Quickly, the solution was aliquoted in 55 µL of solution into the pre-chilled centrifuge tubes.
15. The cells were stored in the -80C fridge until they were needed to be used.
Making Agar Plates
Purpose: In order to make antibiotic resistant plates in order to test and make sure that cells have incorporated the desired plasmid.
Procedure:
1. The autoclave was turned on to warm up.
2. 300 mL of distilled water was measured and put in an appropriately sized beaker.
3. 7.5 g of LB miller and 4.5 g of Agar powder were measured and added to the distilled water in the beaker.
4a. The bottle was autoclaved for sterilization purposes.
4b. While the autoclave was running, ~16 Petri dishes were labeled with the date and the type of antibiotic that would be added to the plates.
5. The bottle was removed from the autoclave and then allowed to cool to about 60 C.
6. When the bottle was cooled, 300 µL of the desired antibiotic was added to the solution.
7. The bottle was swirled to ensure that the antibiotic was mixed equally in the solution.
8. Approximately 50 mL of the solution was distributed to each of the Petri dishes, under sterile conditions, and allowed to cool.
9. Once the agar had solidified, they were placed lid side down and stored in the refrigerator. *Note: Lid side down is important so that any condensation does not collect on the agar. This could affect the quality of the plates.
Transformation
Purpose: This procedure is done in order to incorporate new genetic material into a cell. This lab uses transformation on bacterial cells to insert plasmids. Once the desired plasmids have been constructed and isolated, they are inserted in to the cells by electroporation or heat shock. Once these cells have the new genetic material introduced, they are allowed to grow and recover in a shaker and then are plated so that cells without the incorporated antibiotic resistance and the new gene will die.
Procedure:
1.A 50 µL aliquot of electrocompetent cells were allowed to thaw on ice.
2. An electroporation cuvette was put on ice to chill.
3. 2-3µL of the desired plasmid was added to the electrocompetent cells and mixed gently by pipetting.
4. The cuvette was wiped and"

For mercury ion adsorption, the E. coli BL21 DE3 containing the recombination plasmid was cultured in LB medium until the OD600 = 1.3. Then, an appropriate concentration of mercury ions (0, 6.5, 12.5, 25 mg/L) was added to LB medium. To measure the metal ion adsorption ability of GFP-MC displayed on E. coli, the cells were harvested from LB medium by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 3 min) and then washed twice with saline. For mercury analysis, cells were dried and digested with 70% nitric acid. Total mercury was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (analytikjena, Germany). To measure the selectivity of the E. coli to adsorb mercury ions, 6.5 mg/l Hg2+ and Cd2+, and 12.5 mg/l Cu2+ and Zn2+ were added in place of the mercury. After the treatment, the metal ion content in the samples was measured by AAS.
TEM-EDX Analysis of GFP-MC-Displayed Cells
After mercury ion adsorption, the GFP-MC-displayed cells were washed twice with saline and dispersed in ddH2O. The sample treatment method used was adapted from Wei et al. Surface adsorption was analyzed by TEM (TECNAI, USA). Elemental analysis was performed with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system attached to the transmission electron microscope. All transmission electron microscopy images were recorded.

Nagahama,2014,Team:Nagahama project_-_-_TEXT.html,"id becomes the thing with the function to trap cadmium on outer membrane if construction of this plasmid is completed. It is fusion protein with metallothionine(MT);SmtA and adventitia protein;Ag43. The genetic origin of SmtA is Synechococcus PCC. 7942.
Modeling
We consigned modeling of our project to UT-Tokyo .They readily compiled with our requests. Their model is ideal.We really appreciate their jobs We wish a friendly relationship with UT-Tokyo.Thank you so much!! The detail of their jobs are lists below!!

This is random walk of Escherichia coli on ""swarming plate"".The vertical axis means arbitrary unit.The horizontal axis means to spatial axis. We culture E.coli on ""swarming plate"". ""swarming plate"", a solid culture plate containing lower concentration of agar, on that plate, E. coli can swim.
Fig.2
This is positive chemotaxis by E.coli.Assuming that spoted aspartic acid center of ""swarming plate"". E.coli has positivechemotaxis for aspartic acid. E.coli gather to spoted point.

This is negativechemotaxis by E.coli.Assuming that spoted cadmium center of ""swarming plate"". E.coli has negaitivechemotaxis for cadomium. E.coli run away from spoted point.
Fig.4
This model describes our project. Assuming cadmium was spotted on center of swarming plate (spatial axis 500). E.coli run away from spotted point (spatial axis 350~450 and 550~650). Then cadmium promoter of transgenic E.coli operates. So aspartase produced (spatial axis 350~450 and 550~650).

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," stage starts once cells reach the age of 7 days and continues until cells differentiate into Erythroblasts at an age of 13 days.
Erythroblasts
The proliferation of erythroblasts does not depend on the concentration EPO. However, the population of cells entering the erythroblast stage at an age of 13 days depends on the concentration of EPO due to the CFU-E stage coming before.
$$ Erythroblasts_n = Erythroblasts_{n-1}\times e^{\beta_{Erythroblasts} \times \Delta t} \tag{28}$$
$$ Erythroblasts_{n+1} = Erythroblasts_{n}\times e^{\beta_{Erythroblasts} \times \Delta t} \tag{29}$$
Upon reaching the age of 18 days, erythroblast cells differentiate into marrow reticulocytes.
Marrow Reticulocytes
For the marrow reticulocytes, where the marrow transit time varies with EPO concentration, the same mesh method is used. Even with sufficient iron supply, a constant fraction of marrow reticulocytes is phagocytosed ( Fuertinger et al. 2012 ). This is represented by a constant apoptosis rate independent of EPO concentration.
$$ Reticulocytes_n = Reticulocytes_{n-1}\times e^{-\alpha_{Reticulocytes} \times \Delta t} \tag{30}$$
$$ Reticulocytes_{n+1} = Reticulocytes_{n}\times e^{-\alpha_{Reticulocytes} \times \Delta t} \tag{31}$$
The amount time it takes for marrow reticulocytes to leave the bone marrow and enter the blood decreases as the concentration of EPO increases. A faster marrow transit time means marrow reticulocytes spend more time as blood reticulocytes. The oldest marrow reticulocytes will become RBCs first when marrow transit time decreases. To account for the change in transit time, the stage boundary between reticulocytes and red blood cells is allowed to shift depending on the concentration of EPO.
Figure 17. The effect of EPO on reticulocyte marrow transit time.
The logistic equation that governs the marrow transit time can be seen below.
$$ \mu_{Reticulocytes,max}(EPO(t)) = a_2 - \frac{b_2}{1+e^{k_2 \times EPO"

Minutes of the Meeting
Assessment of Action Points
Model of Metal Intake
James has done some of the work but needs more help from biologists!
It was discussed that we first of all need to model cadmium only and THEN we can consider other metals - start from the basics.
Need to find out how much cadmium binds to the promoter/protein per second
Need to measure how much protein is expressed by promoter activation
Using this data, work out how much cadmium is taken in by the metallothionein
It was decided that the whole team (students) should meet up after lab sessions to work together on getting relevant data and get this model working.
We need TWO models - 1) A model for Bacillus subtilis response to cadmium in different scenarios and 2) A model for cadmium influx in B. subtilis
Model sinI operon
Goksel has made model based on a paper on stochastic switches without changing parameters.
Question: Should we leave the model sequence as it is?
Model comK sequence
Jane has done model based on given equations on paper
Not quite sure on the layout of the model (in diagram structure)

Amsterdam,2012,Team:Amsterdam#practices#results_-_-_TEXT.html," focuses on the whole water cycle. Waternet is responsible for cleaning wastewater, making water drinkable and monitor and clean surface water.
Ron van der Oost was really interested in our multi-sensor idea. Right now they use 20 different sensors for different groups of compounds. These bioassays are not optimal. They are really expensive and it is hard to normalize the data (at what point does a certain concentration become toxic?). Therefore it is often necessary to get a toxicologist to look at the data from bioassays, what makes it even more expensive. He pointed out some crucial issues regarding the potential use of our Cellular Logbook:
The output of our system would have to be easy to interpret.
He also put emphasis on the possibility to register concentrations of compounds, using our system. What concentrations can we measure?
The sensitivity of the multi-sensor has to be good; you don’t want the system to register the presence of a toxic compound only when the concentration of this toxin is already high.
The sensor should be able to monitor it’s environment for quit some time; the system needs to be ‘up and running’; a lot of systems they use now can be in the water for weeks/months. The time-indicator is an interesting feature -> let the system be in the water for 4 weeks and register when a certain compound was registered.
What groups of compounds can we measure?
Maybe most important: how do you want to put the GMO’s in the water? By using some sort of filter, where the bacteria can’t escape from, but can sense their environment. He mentioned passive sampling.
Points of action
Check which (20) compounds we could detect
Develop the concentration and time indicator
Biosafety Officer
Some safety and security questions were already addressed during our talks with scientist and companies. But for a more extensive and fundamental way of addressing these kinds of issues, we contacted dr. Cécile van der Vlugt, from the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) . She is specialized in the risk assessment of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). We were interested in what she would think about a possible application and thereby controlled release of our Cellular Logbook into the environment.
Biosafety
Dr. van der Vlugt stated that although the positive intention of synthetic biology (SB) is clear, the developments in SB raise new questions concerning biosafety. “You may never exclude unintentional risks, but these risks should not impede progression”, she continued. On the question whether SB required a new legislative framework, she answered that a new framework"

Plan: Finish EPF-Lausanne database, finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Settle the DB format for good(hopefully). Summary: As our simulation program becomes more and more mature, we encounter more problems in consistency of our database. We all want to make major changes and make it right this time, but sadly we don’t have the time. So we make minor changes, add patches to fix the bugs, but we have to let go of the unconsistency in substituent, compartment and other places. Now the DB looks not beautiful or elegant, but usable. This is good enough since our first goal now is to make our software work, and a DB that can properly describe simple reaction networks should be enough. We plan to leave major changes to further development. Most of our team members work intensively during the 7 days off, and the achievement of their work is rich. DB of both EFP-Lausanne and Synchronized Ecoli are basically finished. Tables and graphs on DB structure has been published. Our software core seems finally begin to function right. UI is under constructing. All the codes are now on github. We schedule our trip and book plane tickets to Beijing, Chicago and Boston. Jue Wang is now in charge of money and team wear. We dined together on Oct 1, but without a relaxed mind, it was not fun for me. What actually thrills me up is to"

The model was changed in a way only one enzyme, the Tryptophan Hydroxylase gets expressed (Fig. 4)
Figure 4 Simbiology overview of the changed model. Only Tryptophan Hydroxylase is expressed
If the model is simulated, the rate of 5HTP production is 424.58 µmol/h/L or 93.5 mg/h/L (Fig. 5).
Figure 5 Simulation of 5HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) production over time
Dopamine
Dopamine is another important neurotransmitter which, produced by gut bacteria has some positive effects neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. The Modeling of the dopamine/L-Dopa pathway (Fig. 6) was done by iGEM Manchester-Graz 2015.
Look into: https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Modeling
Figure 6 Overview of the Dopamine pathway. Tyrosine is converted in two steps to Dopamine either via Tyramine or L-DOPA. AADC= Amino acid decarboxylase, CYP2D6= Cytochrome P450 enzyme D6
iGEM team Manchester-Graz modeled the pathway also in two ways. In one model, all three enzymes were introduced, in the second model only Tyrosine Hydroxylase was introduced, because Dopamine has positive effects when expressed in the gut, but only L-DOPA can pass the blood brain barrier.
GABA (Gamma amino butyric acid)
γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the body and hence GABA-mediated neurotransmission regulates many physiological functions, including those in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GABA is located throughout the GI tract and is found in enteric nerves as well as in endocrine-like cells, implicating GABA as both a neurotransmitter and an endocrine mediator influencing GI function. GABA mediates its effects via GABA receptors which are either ionotropic GABA(A) or metabotropic GABA(B). The latter which respond to the agonist baclofen have been least characterized, however accumulating data suggest that they play a key role in GI function in health and disease [2].
GABA is produced by a two-step pathway from"

Despite its simplicity, the fluorometers are expensive equipaments and not so easy to use, so, there is a necessity to develop simple and cheaper model.
Based on previous iGEM projects[1] we design and build a portable and low cost fluorometer, that could be used with the Cardbio bacteria. The first version is based in the project of the Cambridge Team 2010 (Eglomer), but we use a cheaper light sensor: the TSL235, it´s a light-to-frequency converter that outputs a square wave (50% duty cycle) with frequency directly proportional to light intensity (irradiance). As you can see in the video below, which uses an open hardware oscilloscope to test the sensor:
In the second version, we inserted a color sensor in the previous project (ADJD-S311, able to discriminate different light frequencies), we remove the keypad and use a larger screen for easier reading. More testing needs to be done to make the device suitable for the needs of the project.

Besides, after the days of hard work in the lab or outside of it, turning the human practices ideas true, nothing better than some music to relax. Even better if it becomes part of the work, telling the history of an iGEM team, making our days more happy and taking all team members even closer for the chorus...

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar,"
