KK Yesterday's transformation of pIG12+CRO insert into E.Coli yielded several colonies on both the plate inoculated with 50 microL and the plate inoculated 100 microL. We plated 8 separate single colonies and will wait until Friday, when we will plan to PCR verify which of the colonies has our vector and insert. Afterward, we discussed what we will do on Friday. We'll spend the hour preparing samples for PCR and a few hours later Clarisse is going to drop by to run the samples on a gel.
Also, I streaked lines and waves of V.cholerae today on a plate and for curiosity streaked E.Coli with pIG78 next to it in lines, and in waves intersecting the wavy cholera lines. We want to see if there are varying degrees of fluorescence.
KP 5/15/13 Today I re-streaked our ligation products. I re-streaked the control (pLat vector only) and the test (pLat vector and cro insert.) The hope, is that we can get individual colonies from the plates, so that we can sequence our plasmid to see if the vector took up the insert and if we have what we think that we do. We we will need primers IG57 and IG58 for our sequencing of this plasmid on Friday.
5/17/13
KK All our singles grew up well, so today we set up 10 PCR reactions + our control to test which, if any, had our vector + CRO insert construct. We also checked the plate that we streaked with Cholera and E.Coli with pIG78 next to one another. We wanted to see if the E.Coli would fluoresce at all in the presence of cholera. Under a UV light we didn't observe any noticeable difference between the streaks of cholera and the streaks of E.Coli
Ran PCR with 10 singles we got from our ligations with pIG12/13 + Cro insert. See gel below. The bottom band in the ladder in the first lane runs at 500bps. Lanes 2-11 are the 10 strains we tested and the last lane is our control. What we get from this gel is a little unsure.

Establishing and characterizing hypervesiculation
We performed a series of tests to determine if we successfully induced hypervesiculation by the deletion of TolA in the E.coli BW25133 strain from the Keio collection (KEIO) and the overexpression of TolR ( Baba et al. 2006 ). The following combinations of plasmid and cells were used (Figure 34): pET-Duet with and without the insert of TolR, both in the E. coli BW25133 strain with (KEIO) and without (WT) the deletion of TolA.
Figure 34: Scheme of hypervesiculation. Scheme of plasmids and strains used in characterization of hypervesiculation.
By measuring the size distribution of the vesicles with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), we wanted to confirm vesicle production and determine vesicle size. Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS) measurements were performed following the DLS protocol . Vesicle size distribution in the KEIO strain and WT strain with either TolR or pET-Duet were compared at different time points after induction: three, four, five hours and overnight (approximately 20 hours). In Figure 35, the raw data of both TolR and pET-Duet in the KEIO strain clearly show a distribution of larger particles compared to the WT strain. Demonstrating that the WT strain produces a very low amount to no vesicles. Therefore, we decided to only focus on analysing the DLS data of the KEIO strain.
Figure 35: Raw data of the DLS experiment. Raw data of the size distributions of the pET-Duet and TolR in the KEIO (a and b) and WT (c and d) strain, measured with Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS). The samples are put against the size in nm and the colour represents the size distribution in percentages.
In Figure 36, the analysed data of the KEIO strain is shown. In this graph the mean and width of the size distribution is plotted per time for TolR and pET-Duet. Overall, neither time nor the presence of TolR shifted size distribution of the vesicles. The only exception is the time point after 4 hours, which might possibly be a statistical st. Therefore, the KEIO strain is mostly responsible for vesicle production. Pertaining to size,"
OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," make suggestions to ensure the safety of the biolab.
In order to let more members be aware of the importance of biological safety and lab safety, we are going to set up our own community about promoting biological safety and laboratory safety. We hope to arouse attention to biological safety and laboratory safety in every laboratory in our college.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Before our team took part in iGEM , our teachers educated us on the safety aspects of experiments, and all the members have learned about the safe use of instruments in order to proceed the experiment safely. We recommend that each laboratory write its own laboratory safety management manual. Our members do a safety check daily as special duty laboratory technicians. The laboratory also arranges a security officer to check the instruments and to manage the security of the laboratory.
In order to ensure that genetically modified bacteria from the lab cannot survive in places where it shouldn’t, we suggest that the bacteria used in the experiment be nutritionally deficient and be developed in nutrition supplemented culture medium. As a result, leaked bacteria would die of nutrition deficiency. For instance, 2011 OUC-China iGEM team used auxotroph bacteria to achieve a multiple symbiotic system. The effect is that one colony is not able to live independently in the in the system of symbiosis. (https://2011.igem.org/Team:OUC-China)
As for the selection of strains, we suggest that each iGEM team replace pathogenic strains with non-pathogenic strains. Bacteria implanted with toxins genes can be added with LVA tags to speed up toxin protein degradation.
In addition, we also suggest that some kind of characteristic sequence be added to standard plasmids, to make standard plasmid DNA easy to identify through DNA barcode technology. In this way we can determine whether or not a certain kind of bacteria has gone under standard plasmid reconstruction.
5. How to prevent the floating bacteria from turning into ecological disaster?
To prevent our floating biosensor from propagating to be a ecological disaster in ocean,here we adopt cell lysis system coupled with quorum sensing system as our cell density restrainer.
When cell density overweighs a fixed value in biosensor, the self-lysis system will be induced by quorum-sensing signals such as AHL, initiating cell death program to restrain the propagation.

Why do we collaborate
Collaboration is one of the core values in scientific pursuits. Famous Biologist and evolutionist Charles Darwin once said, ""Those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed"". Thus, neither science nor human progress should be constrained as the responsibility of an isolated group of people. As high schoolers, this is our first year to delve deep into synthetic biology and doing iGEM project. We have encountered multiple technical problems. Thanks to two collegiate problems that the problems in the end were resolved with their enthusiastic help
1. team ""ShanghaiTech 2018""
Because our laboratory was super closed to the lab of the team ""ShanghaiTech 2018"", it was very easy for us to ask for help when we realized we happened to lose the PSB1C3 plasmid.  Not only did ""ShanghaiTech 2018"" provide us with PSB1C3 plasmid, but they wholeheartedly provided us assistance in molecular cloning.

If you would like to know more about encapsulated bacteria in Peptdisomes and boosting the production of a compound of interest check out our: Signal Peptide Toolbox and Peptide Secretion sections.
To address these major biological and technical questions, the TU Dresden iGEM team presents EncaBcillus. Using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism we introduce a new fundamental approach for the cultivation of bacteria: Peptidsomes. These Peptidosmes are built up of self-assembled Fmoc dipeptide phenylalanines (Fmoc-FF) and they are able to form spherical cages. The cages encapsulate the bacteria and prevent them from escaping into the surroundings, but the Peptidosomes are freely diffusible for smaller molecules. We show, that B. subtilis is able to grow, while entrapped inside of the Peptidosomes and additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of two (fluorescence and luminescence) reporters for the use in conjunction with Peptidosomes.
While evaluating this new method of bacterial entrapment, we established two applications using Peptidsomes:

Figure 1: Chemical structure of Fmoc-FF
Nanostructures are gaining great attention due to their vast instrumentalities. In general, nanostructure clusters are ordered within nanoscopic dimensions. In some cases, the building blocks of the nanostructures (which can be of organic or inorganic sources) can self-assemble. This process can be driven by non-covalent forces (e.g. hydrogen bonds, van der waals forces or aromatic interactions) that dictate the organization into supramolecular structures [1] . For our project EncaBcillus, we investigated the encapsulation of bacteria by the self-assembling building block Fmoc-FF (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine) (Figure 1).
While studying the mechanisms that direct the self-assembly of amyloid fibrils by short aromatic peptides, it has been observed that the dipeptide diphenylalanine (FF), the core recognition motif of the Alzheimer’s β-amyloid polypeptide, self-assembled into nanotubular structures in aqueous solution [2] [3] .

FREDsense Technologies: Our Vision
Our mission is to Build Better Biosensors by providing a diverse platform technology to the world, with a focus on monitoring water samples - faster, cheaper, and more reliably than competing technologies on the market.
Executive Summary
FREDsense Technologies Business Concept.
We are FREDsense Technologies, a Calgary-based venture developing biosensor detection systems to rapidly determine toxicity in water samples. Our first product is a sensor for general toxicity. Capable of reporting an output in under five minutes, it is cost effective due to the simple materials used in its construction, and highly robust through built-in control systems. Currently, we have submitted a provisional patent on our technology, which has a wide variety of uses as a platform technology with numerous different potential markets beyond this first iteration.
Our product fits into the environmental monitoring market, a market that has been established as a byproduct of the oil and gas sector, which produces over 200 million litres of waste water per day. This waste is contained in massive lakes known as tailings ponds, which pose a serious concern to both the environment and to industrial processes. Alberta’s Provincial government enforces a zero discharge policy of water from these ponds, and government regulation requires that oil sands companies monitor their tailings ponds. As well, regulation enforces monitoring water quality in the surrounding lakes,"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

Results
1. We optimized the culture medium by changing the proportion of yeast extract, for controlling cost, we chose 2.0% concentration of yeast extract as the maximum.
We start inducing when OD up to 0.5 (Which is proper time to induce expression of dsRNA), then, the population will increase slowly and at this time the dsRNA production is nearly proportional to the cell density. So it could be deduced that dsRNA increases with inducing time.
Taken together, when yeast extract concentration is 2%, the cost and dsRNA output is the most optimistic scenario.

2. After settling the idealest culture medium, we induced dsRNA expression with iPTG ( make final concentration at 0.5Mmol/L), and we got a range of dsRNA output (between the red line).

Based on this figure and Gaussian distribution, we got the most possible dsRNA concentration: 0.00204g/L.

Again 9 of the 12 colonies were positive here. The PCR product was sequenced and corresponded with the expected sequence for the plasmid. 3 of the 8 colonies were selected to be grown up and Plasmid Prepped to remove the plasmid and allow restriction digest and sequencing of the plasmid for further verification.
Restriction Digest
The pUS203 plasmid was further confirmed with restriction digestion. Spe1, Pst1 and EcoR1 are in the prefix and suffix and should cut.  An Nhe1 restriction site was added into the gBlock code and so a cut with this enzyme would indicate the gBlock had been inserted. Sac1 should not cut and should be identical to the uncut control lane.
The digest results were as expected using SnapGene’s Virtual Digest tool. We were satisfied with these results despite the Sac1 error because the other fragments were as expected and most importantly because Nhe1 cut, which could only have occurred if the gblock had been incorporated into the plasmid. The Sac1 sample was heat-treated to inactive the Sac1 enzyme and used was used as a template to PCR the BioBrick. The results were still as expected which showed that the unexpected action of the Sac1 seen in the gel for the digest of this plasmid luckily didn’t reflect an error in the biobrick code.
Biobrick PCR and sequencing
The final check for this plasmid was to PCR the entire biobrick fragment using iGEM16 and iGEM25 and sequencing the product.
Back to top
Validation
To validate our araC-pBAD/IntI1 BioBrick it would need to be present in a low copy plasmid in order to reduce the amount produced as it is potentially toxic to the cell at high concentrations. Our intial plan was to insert the BioBrick into pUS202 but it turned out not to be low-copy after validation. The back up option was to ligate the BioBrick into pSB6A1. The initial attempt was not successful and due to time constraints we decided to try and test the integron construct in the pSB1C3 it was currently in even with the potential toxicity.
To test for the proper expression of our integron gene in the BioBrick we wanted"

dDrawing Abs600-time curve under different inducers
The population and growth condition can be reflected by Abs600, so through the curve of Abs600-time, the effect of CbeA and CbtA towards bacteria can be displayed. ( read more in protocol )
1. CbtA function validation: L-Arabinose was added into TA group bacteria to induce the expression of CbtA and Abs600 values were measured along culturing. The Abs600-time curve was drawn according to the values. To exclude the impact of L-arabinose towards bacteria, we used the vector group as the control.
2. CbeA function validation: IPTG was added into TA group bacteria to induce the expression of CbeA and Abs600 values were measured along culturing. The Abs600-time curve was drawn according to the values. To exclude the impact of IPTG towards bacteria, we used the vector group as the control.
3. The recovering effect of CbeA towards CbtA validation: L-Arabinose was added into TA and vector groups bacteria to induce the expression of CbtA. After the bacteria displayed poisoning features, IPTG was added. Abs600 values were measured along culturing. The Abs600-time curve was drawn according to the values. To exclude the impact of inducers towards bacteria, we used the vector group as the control.
Cellular morphology observation
Two significant changes will happen when Geneguard takes effect. One is the delaying in bacterial growth, the other one is transformation in bacterial morphology. The two experiments we designed above certified geneguard's function through delaying in bacterial growth. We also wanted to demonstrate it through transformation in bacterial morphology. However, we lacked appropriate equipment for observation. Thus, we seek help from our partner NKU( read more ). We designed the morphology experiment according to our pervious work. Groups of control, 0.2% arabinose induction, 0.2% arabinose and IPTG co-induction were set. Bacterial morphology was observed in 1.5, 3 and 6 hrs.
Results and Discussion
plate streaking and colony growth observation
Result:The results show that addition of arabinose, leading to the expression of toxin, can greatly suppress the growth of bacteria. In the contrary, the addition of IPTG or both inducers show no significant effect, which confirm that the expression of antitoxin can relieve the"

The overnight colonies were pink, save for a single colony. This suggests that RFP was produced, meaning the plasmid switch was unsuccessful. Upon checking the original plates, even the colony that did not turn pink in the culture was pink. Baffling, no doubt, but the conclusion is clear: continuing to use XbaI and SpeI as plasmid insertion sites will definitely be much more trouble than it is worth. Therefore, we ordered in a new reverse primer that also contained the NotI and PstI sites. This will hopefully make the plasmid switch directional.

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Project Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," microscopic plastic particles.
Accidentally, some spores could loosen from the surface they would be affixed to and float into the sea. Therefore, we would have to ask the ZKBS ( Zentrale Kommission für biologische Sicherheit ; “Central Committee for Biological Safety”) for permission to release of the spores. They would require details about our spores and check whether our spores would be safe for environmental release. Another application could be the removal of plastic particles in paper recycling facilities. The applicable laws and regulations should be similar.
Virus binding:
Viruses bind specifically to certain proteins and domains to infect cells. To capitalize on this mechanism, the Sporobeads could be coated with such domains. The viruses would then bind to the spores and could be removed from liquid samples. This could be used to filter human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from blood for transfusions, or even to help people with deadly virus infections by dialyzing their blood and thereby lowering their virus titer.
Of course, permission from the ZKBS would be necessary, but because virus binding would be a medical application, rules from the medical field must be taken into account. The Robert-Koch-Institute in charge of hospital hygiene and infection prevention would check for the hygienic methods of such an application and whether it would work according to the Infektionsschutzgesetz (“prevention of infections law”).
Consideration of medical laws would also be necessary, if our Sporobeads were to be used to filter viruses from drinking water.
We are planning to ask the ZKBS how they would decide about the release of our spores in case we made an application.

Goals
The goals we defined are differentiated to the specific audiences, as discussed below.
Scientists
We want to inform the scientists who are interested in Synthetic Biology about the iGEM competition, our participation in the iGEM competition, and our project. This is important because we need their knowledge and some of them could be potential sponsors.
In science interested public
We want to inform this audience about Synthetic Biology in general, about the iGEM competition, our participation in the iGEM competition, and our project. We want to have a contribution to the public perception of Synthetic Biology by informing this audience about the possibilities and more importantly the impossibilities of Synthetic biology.
Sponsors and potential sponsors
We want to  inform potential sponsors about our project and inform our sponsors about our progresses. We also want to show them that their contribution to our team, by sponsoring us, is useful and even indispensable. We also would like to interest them for sponsoring next TU Delft iGEM teams.
Students
Life science & Technology students are also able to participate iGEM competition instead of a design course or industrial internship. In order to interest students for the next TU Delft iGEM teams it is important to inform them about the iGEM competition and the possibility of participating iGEM instead of design course or industrial internship. We also want to have a contribution to the next TU Delft iGEM team by recruiting students and promoting iGEM competition among Life science & Technology students. Promoting iGEM competition among students should start earlier and be more intense than past years.
Future students
We want to inform high school students about Syntehtic Biology and our project. We also so want to gain their interest for Life Sciences in general by showing them one of the many possible examples which is our project.

Genome region to exclude for off-targets: none
Benchling identified 682 targets in the unmasked genome and *275 in the masked genome. These targets were exported to Excel using Benchling's export tool. Some gRNAs identified in the masked genome contained 'N' nucleotides (i.e. were flanked by a PAM site but were partially masked) so there were only 235 true gRNA candidates in the masked genome. Note that Benchling has updated their algorithms since our design was carried out so that such partly-masked candidates are not assigned scores.
The gRNA found in the masked genome are in one sheet and the gRNA in the unmasked genome in another. Each off-target score in the Benchling interface is a link, which brings up the matches found:
Benchling screenshot showing matches that lead to an off-target score.
For every gene accession number provided, we used NCBI Nucleotide to see which off-targets were most important since, as we mentioned before, off-targets in e.g. tDNA insertion sites are less concerning than off-targets in genes. We didn't want to go                             through this searching for all 682 gRNA, so we subset them based on the criteria of Designs I-IV before looking up the off-target scores:
Design I: To induce early frameshift mutations, the masked candidate gRNA targets were subset to start coordinates within the first 40% of the genes, i.e. nt 364-757 (P1), nt 1830-1985 (P2), nt 3633-4440 (P5), and nt 5756-6380 (P6). No targets in this range we found for P3 in the conservation-masked genome, so gRNA targets from the unmasked sequence were selected. Five top candidates were identified for each gene based on their position and (mostly) their off-target score. One gRNA for each gene was then selected based on BLAST results.
Design II: Four sets of 5 gRNA candidates were chosen for further inspection: the 5 P6 gRNA from Design I, gRNA near the beginning of P6 found in the unmasked genome, gRNA in the middle of P6 and gRNA near the end.                                 One from each set was selected based on BLAST results.
Design III: The noncoding region stretches from nt 7339-7366. Four gRNA near the beginning and five gRNA near the end of the region were found in the unmasked genome (none"

1st solid idea: respiratory system using spike protein & HNMT
We have to make two plasmid, which would be a guide plasmid and a functional plasmid. We put spike gene in the guide plasmid and HNMT in the functional plasmid. Then, bacteria will get spikes on the outer membrane and HNMT inside the cell. After that, if we can pack HNMT in the vesicle, we can make a DDS. And we can check if HNMT works by using quantum dot or GFP.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," treatment). From an economic angle, a quantitative light input will correlate to a desired complex output from a single customizable organism strain, vastly increasing production times from current processes. Attractively, laboratories will have reduced chemical usage and only require a single processing machine, as light is a cheap, easily manipulated, and mostly harmless resource. High spatial and medium temporal control over each output should also be possible by the use of multi-wavelength lasers. This has many potential applications from the manufacturing of composite materials to control of engineered organisms in an environment.
As a sideline, we’re also going to test a new way of preserving and presenting bacterial culture using pouring plastics. Unfortunately, this would kill the bacteria, but should give academics a new way to physically present colonies and cultures they have been working on. For us, it will allow a way of easily transporting our “photographs” without unwieldy plates and gels.
Considering the relatively short time frame of an iGEM project, we have had to simplify several aspects which, given more time, would have been logical to elaborate on within the bounds of our project. We would have liked to have had all three light modules (Red, Green and Blue) expressed in a single bacteria; we have had to have each module expressed in separate bacteria which are then homogeneously combined on our agar plates. As each module currently produces their corresponding pigment at different rates, we also would need to fine-tune the system to get cohesive and cooperative pigment synthesis. It would also be useful to find a red light sensor protein and intermediate protein for the Red Light Module that aren't involved in any other processes within E. coli, as our current system is also linked to osmo-sensing regulation within our competent cells.
Modelling Future
As mentioned we will be using additive and subtractive colour combinations to allow synthesis of the correct pigment output, corresponding the colours of light the bacteria are exposed to. For example the NOT gated input of red light represses synthesis of cyan pigment enabling an output of yellow and magenta pigment. We hope to analyse the absorption spectrum of each pigment, both alone and in combination. Visualisation of light sensitivity throughout the system will enable calibration of the light input ensuring reliable output. Further to this other teams reported their light sensing systems working better at temperatures less than 37 degrees, which we will also investigate.
For the blue and red light sensors, the presence of their corresponding wavelength of light causes auto-phosphorylation of an intermediate protein. Phosphorylated intermediates then freely bind as repressors to the corresponding output gene (cyan for red light, yellow for blue light)."

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Project Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,") able to transfer their genetic material (actively, e.g. by proliferation). Our SporoBeads do not meet these criteria, because they are unable to germinate and grow (none from 2*107 spores). Furthermore, even if some spores would germinate, the strain would be unable to grow due to its tryptophan auxotrophy.
For the individual applications, other laws must also be taken into consideration. In any case, the spores have to be generated, separated from living cells and prepared for their application in a standardized way. The following are some exemplary ideas for Sporobead applications:
Kumamolisin:
This is an enzyme that cleaves peptides and was produced by the iGEM-Team from the University of Washington last year. The substrate includes a specific sequence of amino acids which causes celiac disease in sensitive people when they consume food containing gluten. Our beads could carry that enzyme and offer a protected passage through the stomach, so that the enzyme can work where it is needed in the intestines. The GerminationSTOP we will put in place in our spores would ensure a correct dosage. This project is a pharmaceutical application and therefore would have to fulfill the laws for pharmaceuticals. This includes several verification steps of non-toxicity and efficacy.
B. subtilis spores are part of several dietary and health supplements and have a GRAS (Generally regarded as safe) status. Theoretically it might be possible to use the Sporobeads for dietary applications, but this includes several years of work and studying regulations. The GCP Verordnung (“Good Clinical Practice ordinance”) has to be followed and the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute would have to permit all the studies.
CPX:
The CPX-peptide generated by MIT (2007) can bind to Polystyrene which is a common plastic. The waste from Polystyrene is currently a big challenge in the field of environmental protection and remediation. In the ocean, large piece of Polystyrene litter are ground by sea currents into very small pieces, so called plastik plankton, that are consumed by fish, filter feeders, and other organisms living in the oceans. Such plastic uptake leads to poisoning, sterility and death. To remove Polystyrene from the oceans, huge filter boxes could be put into place to mechanically filter out large pieces; our CPX-Sporobeads could remove the microscopic plastic particles.
Accidentally, some spores could loosen from the surface they would be affixed to and float into the sea. Therefore, we"

NYMU Summer Camp
iGEM has always been a way to convene intellectual thinkers and scientific enthusiasts together for an exchange of ideas. Extending our collaboration with NYMU, we continued to work with NYMU by exchanging ideas and assisting one another.  On August 15th, the members of NYMU_Taipei held a summer camp to teach out 2016 iGEM team about what it is like to start an iGEM team.  They NYMU team members actually contain some of our own TAS students (Huiru, Alvin and Fiona).
Teaching Synthetic Biology to TAS Biology Classes
We were fortunate to have a chance to give an introduction to synthetic biology and the central dogma to an IBHL class of our school. Since genetic engineering is a dynamic method to view biology through the lens of engineering, we are able to teach them about the common methods employed in synthetic biology and spread awareness for synthetic biology.
NCTU Conference
To help us prepare for the Giant Jamboree, we attended the Asia iGEM meet-up conference at NCTU to share and receive valuable feedback from other college and high school level teams. The conference was extremely rewarding because it trained us to think critically and to challenge our own project.  We learned a tremendous amount because of the sharing of ideas and collaborative help from all of the teams.  This was one of our favorite aspects of the whole iGEM competition so far.
Meet-up with MingDao
After the NCTU conference, on August 27th, we gathered with the Mingdao high school iGEM team that we met from MingDao, Taichung and presented our projects to each other. In addition, we not only had a tour of our lab, but we also examined and determined improvements can be made to enhance the high school iGEM competition.

NEU-China-A
Overview
The goal of NEU_China_A this year is to design a biological system aiming to alleviate intestinal inflammatory         diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer. We chose E. coli Nissle 1917 as our chassis, a probiotic that         is safe for humans. On the one hand, when it senses an inflammatory signal in the intestine, it releases an         anti-inflammatory drug (interleukin-10) to put out the fire in the intestines. On the other hand, it can         release myrosinase to convert the glucosinolate contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane. The         sulforaphane can both alleviate inflammation in the intestine and prevent colorectal cancer induced by chronic         inflammation.
Intestinal homeostasis
There are a lot of microorganisms living in the intestines. The intestinal villi and the underlying                 tissueshave                 the largest immune cell population in the human body. Harmonious coexistence between the                 intestinalflora and                 the immune cells is critical to human health. Consequently, the intestine has evolved                 severalmechanisms.
In the crypt, the goblet cells secrete mucus covering the surface of the intestinal villi and                         Paneth cells                         secrete antibacterial peptides to inhibit bacterial invasion. In addition, the basal stem cells                         continue to                         proliferate and differentiate to renew the"

Overview of DIYbio
Are you still trying to build your own computers by assembling the CPU, memory, main board and so on which bought from markets? Maybe you are dated. At present, some amateur biologists are attempting to develop a new concept of DIY: they are setting about experiments on DNA under homemade lab circumstances, expecting to create their own plasmids and even novel life forms through genetic engineering.
It should be said that in the first place, it’s the improvement of biology itself gave birth to the appearance of so-called DIYbio. Nowadays, numerous biotech firms render service of sequencing and provide great quantities of protein tools such as restriction enzymes, primers, competent cells, varies of gene manipulation kits and so on, which making molecular experiments at home possible. In addition, powerful modern information technology also has prompted the progress of DIYbio. Ever-increasing scientific knowledge and information online (sometimes even free) made DIYbio even more convenient currently.

Complaining that the field of biological research is chronically dominated by professional labs in universities and scientific research institutions, some DIYers are eager to break with the tradition, “democratize” science and, as they say, to make life science more interesting and even more “sexy”. They declared themselves to be biohackers proudly, innovators to explore biological realms energetically as a hobby by applying biotechnics themselves. Meredith L. Patterson, a computer programmer, is one of the pioneers of biohackers. She is trying to modify the yogurt bacteria genetically to fluoresce to signal the presence of melamine.
Although the blueprint of DIYbio seems to be splendid, a number of difficulties are still waiting to be solved. For instance, though basic instruments, like refrigerator and microwave oven, are available at home, some apparatuses still face with difficulties in finding their way into families in a short time, like centrifuge and PCR instrument. To solve this puzzle, community lab seems to be a simple solution. At present, an organization called “DIYbio” in Cambridge, Massachusetts is just bringing the imaginings into practice. They are establishing a community lab to allow the general public making use of essential chemicals and apparatuses to conduct their own"

Cloning of expression constructs
1. Introduction
Our experiments were based on SIEC and SIECΔp1 bacteria transformed with plasmids encoding reporter proteins, Map20 and Chaperones (read more about the different components here ). We used both USER cloning and restriction-ligation to assemble the expression plasmids. Protocols used for molecular cloning can be found here .
2. Cloning strategies
The primers, that we used throughout the cloning process can be viewed in the bottom of this page.
The reporter genes were PCR amplified in two rounds. First to add a C-terminal 6x-His tag and secondly to add restriction sites. XmaI and PstI restriction sites were added to the reporters that were to be assembled with both Map20 the vector and XbaI and PstI restriction sites were added reporter genes that were inserted into the vector without Map20. The reporter genes were then inserted into a BBa_K228005 backbone with or without chaperones.
The Map20 part sequence was constructed using five different primers and assembled together in a PCR reaction. Restrictions sites for XbaI and AgeI were also added by PCR. This method gave a successful result in first try.
A vector backbone with chaperones genes was also constructed. We used USER cloning to insert the CesT and CesF chaperone genes into the pBAD vector as can be seen figure 1.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," strength are the basic requirements for a tristable switch. Furthermore, the Hill’s coefficient of each repressor-protein interaction are close to each other in our experimental design; hence, we assume that $n_1=n_2=n_3=n$. Accordingly, we derived a new version of ODEs of the system:
The main variables in these final ODEs are core parameters (a) and a Hill’s Coefficient (n). Through this model, we can subsequently analyze the system's stability and predict the system's behaviours.
(III) Overall Assumptions:
Degradation is a unimolecular reaction, depending on the concentration only.
The copy number of the plasmid (the amount of DNA) is constant.
mRNA reaches equilibrium much faster than protein, such that mRNA is at steady state when considering protein dynamic.
Compared to the cell division rate, degradation rates of individual repressor proteins are negligible. As a result, protein dilution rate due to cell division is used to replace the repressors’ degradation rates."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

The pathway shown in Figure 1 is already an improvement of the described way. The native protein IlvIH is replaced by the AlsS from Bacillus subtilis to increase the isobutanol production. ( Atsumi et al. )
As we want to integrate this pathway in E.coli we used and improved existing BioBricks from the iGEM team NCTU Formosa 2011/2012. We used gene coding sequences of four out of five required proteins for the isobutanol production.
These genes are
alsS ( BBa_K539627 )
ilvC ( BBa_K539621 )
ilvD ( BBa_K539626 )
kivD ( BBa_K539742 )
The coding sequence of the gene of Adh (alcohol dehydrogenase), the fifth required protein, was not available as a BioBrick but because of E.coli's own AdhE the pathway works (Atsumi et al., 2008).
As you can see in Figure 2 we have two approaches for our producing system.
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of our isobutanol constructs.
A BBa_K1465306 B BBa_K1465307
We want to reproduce the pathway from iGEM team NCTU Formosa without their temperature system ( BBa_K887002 ). In their system the first three proteins (AlsS, IlvC and IlvD) were generated while E.coli is incubated in a 37°C environment. During this the non-toxic intermediate 2-ketoisovalerate is accumulated. By shifting the temperature to a 30°C environment the missing KivD can be generated because of the non-active repressor. Together with the AdhE from E. coli KivD converts 2-ketoisovalerate into isobutanol.
In Figure 2A you can find our first approach where we also used the AdhE from E. coli. We disclaim the temperature system and put all coding sequences in a row behind a promoter separated by the RBS in front of each gene. We used Gibson as the cloning method for the part BBa_K1465302 . For cloning the ptac upstream the part BBa_K1465302 , the prefix insertion BioBrick assembly was used. This idea resulted in the part BBa_K1465306 .

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html,"ided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names: it is impossible to construct a universal name-based reaction database applying for different systems. The next is Template . A species with a certain structure is a template species, and a reaction occurring between several template species is a template reaction. The introduction of Template makes it possible to describe a group of reactions with same structure-determined reaction mechanism. Finally, based on our Chain-Node and Template concept, we propose an XML-based Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language (MoDeL for abbreviation) to fully characterize Species and Reaction in templates with clear definitions of elements and attributes in XML fashion. It is a database language for next generation when automatic modeling is widely used throughout the world. To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea of our modeling system.
Though we have no enough time to achieve our ultimate goal completely, we have successfully developed a MoDeL-based, automatic modeling and simulation software. Our program falls into 3 major components. The"

One of the main challenges of the iGEM competition is to find a suitable topic for our project. We wanted to work     on something that not only has a huge impact in the scientific world but is also important for the environment and the     general public. Due to it's presence in the media and the fact that it's the most widely used herbicide around the world, glyphosate was an early candidate in our brainstorming process. To collect background information about the topic and to understand the opinion of politicians and the public, we made ourselves familiar with journal articles, newspaper articles and media reports. Furthermore, we went to public panel discussions and talked to politicians to understand the impact of glyphosate and to build up the structure of our project.
The usage of glyphosate all around the world is a frequently discussed controversy that suffers from too much false or poorly carried out information published on the internet.
One of the problems concerning glyphosate is its accumulation in the soil and its detection in food items and beverages, such as beer.
Consequently, our first aim was to produce more independent research and to create a rapid test, that can be used by everyone to determine glyphosate concentration in food articles or soil samples.
During the course of our project, we talked to politicians coming from diverse backgrounds. By organizing a panel discussion, visiting schools, creating an interactive information booth, and performing a survey, we tried to"

Mating pheromone pathway model
We expected to use mRFP intensity to predict the sweetness based on our system. So we needed an insight into relationship between mRFP and sweetness. But lots of factor can impact the signal output so that we decided to divide our system into two parts, single cell model and yeast growth model.
Single cell model
Purpose
To simulate RFP intensity under different sweetness, we needed to set a model in a single cell firstly. By establishing this model, we could learn about how the sweetness signal transmit in the in yeast coupling pheromone pathway[3], and know each step of the signal transmit in detail, which provides supports for regulating the signal and  improving our bio-meter.
Single cell model:
In single cell model, we pay main attention to the signal transduction in pheromone pathway based on[4].And in order to simulate the signal transduction in mathematical way conveniently, we set some hypothesizes of this model:
1. We assumed that T1R2/T1R3 receptor does not have synergistic effect when it binds with sweeteners.
2. We hypothesized that the number of binding sweetener are consistent when binding to T1R2/T1R3 receptor or pheromone receptor.
3. We supposed that the combining rate and the initial binding concentration of sweetener are as same as pheromone receptor’s.
4. There is no influence between cell growth and protein expression in a single cell.
5. Only concern conservation relations of protein concentration in a single cell. The protein involving in the signal transduction is not considers its production or degradation.
Method and discussion
Fig 8． Sweetness testing pathway in Sugar Hunter
In order to simulate our project systematically, we divided our whole system into four blocks: (a) the activation of T1R2/T1R3 receptor; (b) the activation of G-protein cycle; (c) the cascade reaction of MAPK; and (d) the expression of RFP. And the simulating process and result of each part were shown below.

Terpene biosynthesis in plants is part of larger pathways that metabolize isoprenoid intermediates. Genes encoding for enzymes known as synthases catalyze the terminal step in these pathways, from a precursor (commonly farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) or garnyl pyrophosphate (GPP)) to the final terpene product. As it happens, two well established and genetically manipulable model organisms- the bacterium Escherichia coli and brewer's yeast"

Today, six major issues still unresolved:
- Stability,
- Toxicity,
- Targeting/specificity,
- Passage through the membrane,
- Immune system: resistance or stealth,
- Industrialization.
The stability is an issue concerning principally lipidic nanoparticles, indeed lipidic autoassembly like liposomes are stable in time. In vivo, this type of vector incorporates or disrupts, and then releases its content. Some molecules, like cholesterol, can improve its stability, but they stay the most fragile vectors and so, the less protector for the active principle.
The toxicity is an issue from two origins. It can result from a potentiality of some vector to become uncontrollable or from fabrication methods of some other vectors. Viruses are probably the best vectors, but they are the most dangerous as well. There is a great potentiality, even for defective viruses, of replication without control in a patient organism, and it is due to the genomic recombination phenomena, very common in this type of biological particles.
The other toxicity issue comes from nanoparticles fabrication methods. The use of organic solvent for their conception can be dangerous for the patient, because even with elimination steps, organic solvent dose injected is never null.
The targeting is considered as a strange issue, it is supposed to be a technological advantage provided by the vectorization, but the targeting is far from being optimal. Targeting is realized by the recognition of a membrane marker expressed at the targeted cell surface. A weak quantity of markers is specific to only one type of cell in the entire organism. So, even if the therapeutic agent dose is higher at targeted cells level, other cells in the body will suffer to the therapeutic agent effects.
The passage of the membrane is a key event for medicine; its efficiency is linked to its capacity to cross this barrier. The therapeutic agent, whose action is subcellular, should enter inside the cell to act. Prokaryotic vectors as well as polymeric nanoparticles are disabled by this crucial step in the medicine becoming.
The immune system is probably the principal issue. It can be both specific and non specific. Indeed, the immune system fixes all what is superior to 60nm and which is in the circulatory flow. It is able to adapt and react faster as one goes along the meeting with vectors. We know for a long time that viruses, phages and bacteria are detected by the immune system and are eliminated. The first detection is always late compared to the vector injection; this permits an efficacy of the first dose. But during the second injection, the clearance is so fast that the vector efficacy is"

Figure 2: This is all of the chromoproteins at a variety of different temperatures. As the temperature gets higher they all lose their color at different temperatures.
Interestingly, we also observed that if there were certain cultures that were not showing color on a particular day, the heat treatments as described above were able to cause the color we would have initially expected to appear (Figure 3, 4, and 5).
Figure 3: As can be seen above, the bottom row of five PCR tubes containing 30 µL of the cell pellet does not show any color. The chromoproteins in the bottom row are from DNA2.0: VirginiaViolet (left), MaccabeePurple, SeraphinaPink, TinselPurple, and DonnerMagenta.
Figure 4: After these previously colorless cell pellets have been treated at 55 °C for 30 min, 60 °C for 30 min, and 60 °C for 30 min, color can be observed. This color then proceeds to disappear again as the temperature continues to increase.
Figure 5: This time, the color does not return after heat treatments.
Using the results of the experiment above, it was possible to build a thermometer from the select groups of chromoproteins that respond to different temperatures. Shown in Figures 6 and 7 is a prototype of how that would work. Until the temperature reaches the temperature indicated on the right, the color remains constant. Here is an example of how the thermometer would look at 80 °C (Figure 6) and at 100 °C (Figure 7).

Figure 7
After the cell lysate heat tests, we moved towards testing the cell lysate in an exposed air environment. This was done based on the idea that the color change we were seeing was dependent on the interaction of water molecules with the barrel of the chromoproteins. Therefore, we hypothesized that in the exposed air system, the water molecules would not be trapped with the chromoproteins and we might see color change occur sooner. To test this we set up an apparatus that would heat a glass petri dish evenly and allow us to take a video of the cell lysate as it was being heated up as shown in Figure 8 to the right.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," we needed to re do our Gibson or our primers so we took 1.5 ml of our liquid cultures for the 8 that did not work and performed a small scale protein extraction and then ran a lumio green detection test and gel. If the lumio gel shows our protein that this means our Gibson was successful but we need to re order primers because they were not correct and somehow made the color our our chromoproteins go away. If this is the case then we will order sequencing to see what exactly is going. If our lumio gel shows no protein fluorescing then we know our Gibson failed and we should re do it.
9-7-16-8chromo-failed-real-1.jpg
Here is the lumio gel we ran today of our 8 chromoproteins that had not shown color in culture or on plates. The order from left to right is: Ladder, SO, DM, VV, DT, LO, SP, BB, MP. Because there was protein present in the gel once images we think our Gibson was successful but something went wrong with out primers which removed or inhibited the color producing part of our chromoprotein.
●
We are running heat tests on the cell lysate of the 12 chromoproteins + His-tag to see if the 4 colored chromoproteins lose color at a different temperature now that they have a His-tag and are in psb1C3. We are heat testing the other 8 chromoproteins to see if they gain color like we saw before they were Gibsoned where they did not have color originally in culture but when heated gained color. We added 30 ul of each pelleted chromoprotein to a PCR tube and 1 ul of EDTA to each tube. We started heating at 55 °C in 5 minutes increments and would raise the temperature 5 °C after each 5 minute increment.
Before Heat Added
These are the 12 chromoproteins before heat is added. The 4 chromoproteins on top are the ones that showed color in culture and from left to right are: VP, CP, TP, PP. The bottom 8 chromoproteins are the ones that did not show color in culture or on a plate and in order from left to right are: DT, DM, MP, VV, SP, LO, SO, and BB.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Human Practices#Law_-_-_TEXT.html," allowing market forces (and individual scientists) to capitalise on invention.
It also means that the research with the most funding is typically the research which is the most potentially lucrative – research which can present solutions to problems (like cancer) that affect wealthier societies who can pay more for medicine. This is as opposed to research for diseases almost exclusively present in poorer nations (like dengue).
Our team faced this issue – foundational technologies like the Assemblase system did not fit many of the grant opportunities that were available, being for things much closer to practical use. It did also mean we chose really practical enzymes for our model.
Accessibility & Availability
The law’s protection comes with a stipulation that the protected invention is revealed to the public. As a result, the public has access to that idea once the protected timeframe is over
4
.
It also means that researchers can, in the future, build off that idea to have higher quality research. Disclosure also means that scientists may choose to stop research in a particular area, and refocus on another.
However, that means that the law can render certain ideas inaccessible for a number of years. The challenge here is that science is a collaborative process, building on the research of others; and a period of years can stifle development and innovation.
Our team faced issues surrounding the availability of the protein SpyTag/Catcher system, because of its legal protection. However, these issues were avoided thanks to the research locations (and protection) being in two different jurisdictions.
Grants & Ethics Approval
Legal approval is being introduced as a preliminary requirement for research grant applications within Australia, similar to Europe. The grants we received were not dependent on ethics approval; however, we question whether they should be.
The availability of grant money to fund the research also determines what projects can be undertaken – a project ineligible for grant money is far less likely to go ahead.
There is also a correlation between the likely patentability of an invention, or area of science, and the amount of research funding which goes into the area. The Australian Bureau of Industry Economics 1994 Report stated that legal protection seems to ‘increase the incentive for investment in research and development, in a reasonably cost effective way’, and there has not been any significant change from this position in Australia

.  More evidence of this correlation comes from the US, where 80% of the money spent on non-commercial pharmaceutical research comes from public sources

Considered Analysis
The Assemblase system has posed a number of legal challenges for the team, with these challenges arising from the very beginning of the project.

NTNU-Trondheim,2013,Team:NTNU-Trondheim#ExamplePage_-_-_TEXT.html,"R to dimerize, activating the ctx promoter. By putting GFP after the ctx promoter, we can then detect if the ctx promoter is activated.
The first step was to validate that a ToxR based two-hybrid system could be expressed in E. coli and that we could cause dimer-dependent transcriptional activation using a chimeric ToxR with periplasmic domains of our choosing. We started by truncating ToxR to eliminate the periplasmic domain because the dimerization state of ToxR's cytoplasmic domain controls transcription. Next, we built a translational fusion of the constitutively dimerizing leucine zipper protein IILK to the ToxR truncation. The constitutively dimerizing protein IILK portion of the translational fusion is located in the periplasm, while the ToxR cytoplasmic domain remains in the cytoplasm. The constitutively dimerizing IILK periplasmic domain should dimerize, causing the cytoplasmic domain of ToxR to dimerize, activating transcription from the ctx promoter.
The initial ToxR chimeras under the pBAD promoter were toxic to the cell, were difficult to express, and behaved unpredictably. Even at low concentrations of arabinose, there was high toxicity and cells did not grow well. The graphs below show ToxR fused to Lambda-Rep, a different constitutive dimerizing protein (similar in behavior to IILK  with ToxR fusions) that we used as the periplasmic domain in ToxR chimeras. The left graph demonstrates decreased growth and the right demonstrates low fluorescence with increasing arabinose. Both poor growth and low fluorescence are a result of toxicity from ToxR based chimeras.
In order to resolve the toxicity of ToxR, we constructed a new design principle. Stress is a natural regulatory cue in bacteria that dictates changes in behavior or expression levels. We decided to look into the E. coli genome for stress-based regulatory elements. We wanted to find a promoter that would drive transcription while the cell was happy and health, but would shut down in response to cellular stress, behaving as a self-regulating expression system. Toxic over expression of ToxR would be down regulated with this negative feedback system. With this method, we are able to express ToxR chimeras at optimal levels without toxicity to the cell.
Stress is a common regulatory cue that allows organisms to adjust to variable conditions in the environment. As a result, stress-responsive"

iGEM Kobe is an iGEM team established by students of Kobe university. Since this is the first year for the team, iGEM Gifu had given some suggestions to improve their project and make it smooth to perform experiments.
On September 9th one of our team members went to Kobe to communicate directly.  Since both projects are common in Japanese traditional drink. we discussed the issue regarding how synthetic biology should be applied into food section. Furthermore, we talked about the importance of the fact that we have to perform inactivation of transformant after experiments. This year iGEM Kobe treats B.subtilis and we perform transformation of yeast and it was a good chance to understand how to conduct research and maintain bio-safety in cases of microorganisms but E.coli. Especially B.subtilis is said to be one of the strongest bacteria in the world because the species generates spore. This discussion was totally interesting for us.

Gifu and Nagahama had a meeting on September 24th. Both teams have similarities in that our projects are related to Japanese fermented products and we decided to transform yeast. Hence, we talked about the regulation of genetically modified food in Japan and how we should perform our projects functionally. At the meeting, we especially advised each other about the experiment of yeast. In addition, we discussed the characteristics of the promoters that each team decided to use and assure whether they are really the best choice for us.
We taught the research of terminatome to Nagahama that the expression level of mRNA can be regulated not only by the promoters but also by the terminators. Since they decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons, we suggested that they think about terminatome. We believed that this was really  useful information for their project to be improved.

Though we tailored our final system to the beef industry, the molecular components forming the FerriTALE have a myriad of other applications. These include detector TALEs which can be readily designed to other DNA targets, a ferritin protein shelled nanoparticle with interchangeable cores that impart novel function, and an interchangeable coiled-coil linker system to build intricate protein devices using ferritin as a scaffold. Together, these components form a customizable DNA biosensor, with individual components that could have diverse applications in future iGEM projects and beyond.
Detector
We selected Transcription Activator Like Effectors (TALEs) to bind and detect DNA in our system. These proteins were chosen because their DNA binding domains can be engineered to bind virtually any DNA sequence (Cermak et al., 2011). This means that we have built a DNA biosensor platform, where our system can be repurposed to detection of organisms in other applications by designing TALEs to different gene sequences. By combining alternative TALE proteins into our capture strip assay , our system could be relevant to other food industries, health care, bedside diagnostics, and biosecurity (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Our platform biosensor can be applied to many different industries and situations. Examples of this include the food industry, health applications, and biosecurity applications.
To enable the iGEM community to harness the FerriTALE to detect other DNA sequences, we added KasI restriction cut sites to the 3’ of"

The CesA 4, 7, and 8 genes were obtained from cDNA via the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center and tissue samples. PCR amplification from vector pDMC107 enabled the isolation of GFP and NOS terminator. Ultimately, the construct was tied together via Gibson assembly synthesising all tags and markers from the primers used.
Further Study
Due to limitations resulting from the lack of previous synthetic biology application within plants, we were unable to obtain any results. We have successfully isolated the desired CesA 1 promoter, CesA genes 7 and 8 and the Nos terminator parts. However, we were not able to isolate the CesA 4 gene needed for assembly of the plasmid. Thus successful construct assembly of these parts is still needed for bacterial and plant transformation. Following promising transformation, fluorescence testing and characterization must be done.

UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM 2018 submission. The traditional cloning would involve the methods of inserting gene fragments into MCS (multiple site cloning) of backbone or between prefix-suffix. The whole processes of gene cloning for further assays in this project are described in the Figure 1 and 2.
Figure 1. Principle methods of traditional cloning
Figure 2.. Original plan of how our lab team conducted the whole experiment in establishing parts for iGEM submission and characterizing our parts: DiphTox or DT (BBa_K2607000) and HB-EGF/Tar chimeric receptor or HT (BBa_K2607001).
Part I: DT and HT Cloning
Upon receiving our parts (in gBlocks) from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), we performed PCR to amplify the gBlocks. PCR cloning for all gBlocks used the hand-made designed forward (Fwd) and reverse (Rev) cloning primers (i.e. specifications could be seen in Parts page). Furthermore, cycling formula for PCR cloning and confirmation could be accessed in the lab notes, as we applied GoTaqTM Long PCR enzyme as the Hi-Fi polymerase. The amplified gBlocks were then used as inserts to plasmid vectors. For HT BioBrick, IDT was unable to yield the full sequence in high purity, so we had to split HT into two fragments (HT-1 and HT-2), which would later be amplified, restricted with SalI, and ligated to obtain complete HT fragment
On the other hand, we also prepared vectors for carrying our parts. Backbone pSB1C3-mRFP (BBa_J04450) has been used widely in our process of traditional cloning, for it provides much sensitive selection upon transformed recombinant plasmids. Since this plasmid does not contain any available expression promoter for the designed BioBrick, our supervisor suggested the usage of pQE80L expression vector belonged to IHVCB lab for functional assays and analyses. Therefore, we used pSB1C3 as cloning vector for submission to iGEM Headquarters and pQE80L as cloning vector for expression
We conducted traditional cloning (restriction-ligation) method to introduce our previously amplified inserts into prepared vectors. Restriction digestion was done sequentially with EcoRI and PstI in total of 8 hours by using the same buffer (i.e. EcoRI buffer and bovine serum antigen (BSA) 1X) with a minimum DNA template of 10 µg. Desalting and low-melting agarose (LMA) "

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

UConn,2018,Team:UConn#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ely, this pathway can be reversed so that, instead of the bacteria, an external power source provides electrons in place of a load using the current. Electrons flow to the bacteria in the cathode bottle, where they are used to reduce reactants of a reduction pathway, thus powering the pathway. The chosen genes are optimal for this use because both the mtrCAB + CymA and phenazine pathways are reversible; although originally designed to carry electrons out of cells, they are also capable of bringing electrons into cells which can reduce NADP+ into NADPH for use in the alkane synthesis pathway.
Future Directions
Currently, three out of the four parts for the alkane synthesis pathway have been created and those for microbial electrosynthesis are being troubleshooted. To continue our project, we will be implementing the microbial electrosynthesis system, and optimizing the alkane pathway.
Currently, alkane yields are relatively low due to restrictive genes in the pathway that optimize it for the use of the bacteria. In order to increase yield, we will knockout fadE and fadR using the lambda red system. The natural purpose of FadE in E. coli is to convert fatty-acyl, which is used in the alkane pathway, CoA to 2-trans-eonyl-CoA, which is not a part of the pathway, thus restricting the amount of input available for use by Acr and limiting the amount of alkanes produced. The gene fadR is also endogenous to E. coli and increases transcription of genes used in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis while decreasing the transcription of genes used in the alkane pathway.
To negate the effects of FadE and FadR, they will be knocked out using the lambda red system. This system, which has been utilized by other iGEM teams has the ability to replace segments of genomic DNA with a specially designed linear segment (using homologous overlaps). Our general strategy will be to replace the initial segments of the fadE and fadR genes with resistance genes, select for the engineered bacteria, and then to excise this resistance using loxP sites we design into the linear segment. Thus, any controls that FadE and FadR might otherwise exert on the alkane production pathway will be silenced.

Stage 3
The final stage of the collaboration was having the BostonU team test the final iteration of their chip design. Prior to visiting our lab, they were sent our Microfluidics 101 educational material, assembly protocols and chip usage protocols to review. This was in order to simulate the experience of a synthetic biologist using MARS to understand how our chips work.
Following this, their members practiced assembling and testing two existing microfluidic chips - PCR and DNA Digestion. Over the course of this they were able to feed back on the relevance of the educational material we had provided them with. This feedback was extremely valuable as it came from synthetic biologists with limited understanding of our hardware. Their feedback was noted and then integrated into our existing workflow. Finally, the BostonU Wetlab team assembled, tested and graded their chip design using a preliminary Fluid Functionality checklist. The results they gained through this testing, and the ability of the checklist to accurately represent the failures during the test, have been used to improve our grading system.
The chip design has since been added to the MARS Repository under “Fluorescence” and has been categorized as Quantification. For more information regarding the chip’s design and documentation, refer to its chip page on our Wiki.
Lead Assay Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | WPI iGEM
Our collaboration with WPI involved designing a microfluidic device that could perform a portion of their lead assay. This chip would use primitives designed by the BostonU Hardware team such as metering. Working on this chip emphasized the importance of coengineering microfluidics and synbio.
Stage 1
We first met the WPI iGEM team at NEGEM1, an event hosted by BostonU that invites New England iGEM teams to present their project plans and ideas to other teams. We discussed the potential for a collaboration between our two teams, and soon after we contacted each other via email. During our first Skype call we discussed some potential ideas for their collaboration. We decided that the goal of the collaboration would be to design a chip that could perform their lead assay. With this in mind, they sent us a PDF copy of their full protocol and we began planning a visit to BostonU. For more details regarding this assay, please visit the WPI iGEM team Wiki.
Stage 2
WPI’s visit to BostonU had two purposes. First, it would help validate WPI’s assay protocol"

Tuesday, 5/28: Today began with the Summer Science Research Orientation, and afterwards I attended the HCI Lab Summer Orientation where everyone was given a brief overview of Human Computer Interaction, as well as the design process that we’ll be following. Then, after a group lunch, we dived straight into the research. I was paired up with Heather, and our project is dubbed the “art project,” tailored towards non-scientists. Here, our goal is to communicate core concepts of synthetic biology, as well as showing off the excitement, risk, and promise of cutting-edge technology.
Wednesday, 5/29: Our research continued as we spent the bulk of the morning and afternoon reading about the various synthetic projects that are out there. Heather and I went through many different websites and articles, building up a reservoir of files as we familiarized ourselves with these projects and tried to draw inspiration. Later in the afternoon, we switched over to the more technical side of our project. Since we are trying to incorporate sifteo cubes into our project, we spent the bulk of the afternoon and evening playing with the code in the example files that came with the installation, and trying to make sense of the code.

Team Substrate Analysis:
Creating  and measuring of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation samples for the laccase TVEL0. Experimental setup: 2 µg substrate, 0.1 mM ABTS, 110 µL BR-buffer and 10 µg laccase in 200 µL reaction volume. Measured at t0 and after 10 minutes.
Team Immobilization
Started immobilization of TVEL0 to analyze the binding of laccase during the first 10 hours representative for following immobilizations.
Tuesday October 16th
Team Activity Tests:
Today we received the samples from Team Cultivation & Purification. We are really motivated to measure the activity of our new produced enzymes. But before that we have to prepare the samples. This implied the determination of the protein concentration in each fraction, which we did today. The results are listed in the following table:
Team Cellulose Binding Domain:
Transformed B0034 into KRX
Transformed J23100 into KRX
Plated both on AMP-select-agar
Plated one more Colony of J61101 + GFP_Freiburg and J61101 + GFP_Freiburg + CBDclos
Team Substrate Analysis: The Massspectrometry data showed two potential products after the Laccase treatment of Estradiol and Ethinyl estradiol but we unfortunatly could not identify them so we decided to do MS-MS on thoose. The products showed that after Laccase treatment both Estradiol and Ethinyl estradiol losses two H atoms which was new for us.

Team Activity Tests:
Before starting our activity assay we re-buffered the fractions we got from Team Cultivation and Purification. It took some time, that's why we had no time for activity analysis yet. But we prepared everything for the next day, including determining the protein concentration of the fractions after they have been re-buffered. This is what we got:

Due to the small number of colonies resulting from blunt end TOPO cloning the decision was made to repeat the transformation of TYR TOPO, TH TOPO and empty TOPO with the hope of achieving a higher number of colonies (a successful TOPO cloning reaction should yield hundreds of colonies). Repeated TOPO cloning of TYR and TH resulted in colonies on TYR TOPO as well as TH TOPO, both were inoculated and grown overnight. Overnight cultures only showed growth for TH TOPO which was miniprepped and analysed via digestion and gel electrophoresis. Gel analysis showed bands the size of the vector only for all digestion reactions meaning that no insertion had occurred.
We performed PCR mutagenesis on AADC in order to remove a PstI restriction site within the gene by replacing a G with an A in the sequence, conserving the original amino acid sequence (Fig. 4). The four PCR reactions were analysed on a gel and reaction 4 was selected for further work as it yielded the brightest bands.

Public recognition
We designed a questionnaire to get to know about the public recognition of energy crisis as well as clean energy. From the current data, we drew some conclusions as follows:
Ways to understand the current energy situation: Internet 83.33%, and 8.73% from newspapers, magazines, books, etc.
Confidence in the development of new energy: large development potential 68.25%, slow development 20.63%
For the ""new energy"" category of judgment: over 80% have a clearer understanding
Among them, biological energy and solar energy bear the highest expectations
More than half of respondents expressed willingness to try new energy drivers / related products, and 30% took a wait-and-see attitude
The application of new energy in society: more than 90% of respondents believe that the most useful way is to use electricity and provide transportation power
The price is too high, the quality of products is unstable and the use is inconvenient. It has become the first three reasons that prevent respondents from buying new energy products
Our vision
Green technology is the future, especially the biotechnology.
Our practice carried out practical investigation with multi-dimension, deeply explored current energy situation, the prospects for the development of a new focus on renewable energy. 
The team members actively interacted with professional expertise and conducted investigations of the energy enterprise learning its culture. Think about how to use synthetic biology methods to synthesize efficient and clean green energy.
Conclusion
What we have got through this part of human practice helps us have a better understanding of
1. The current energy policy in China
2. Investigations of energy enterprise operation mode and enterprise culture
3. Ideas on selecting the next experimental design to energy

Our basic Human Practices include the questionnaire, interview and policy survey. We expanded our Human Practices to many other aspects, during which we heard the voice from professors, veteran experts, entrepreneur managers as well as other teams. They represented some different views from the public and authorities, helping us to understand the project from different perspectives so that we could collect the feedback to interpret those results into our experimental design. Secondly, we set up our iGEM club to provide a platform for students to exchange academic knowledge.
Lastly, to improve public engagement of iGEM in China, we designed our own Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.

Resistant Germs: And how to fight them!
The world on the brink to a new age of infections
In the last hundreds of years mankind was ravaged by various mysterious threats. Infectious diseases, back then unknown, struck fear into the hearts of tens of millions of people worldwide while leaving more millions dead. One of the most prominent examples has been long forgotten in the western hemisphere, the pneumonic plague, an airborne infection caused by a bacterial strain called Yersinia pestis. Once one of the most prolific killers among men the plague got pushed back massively by new hygiene standards and antibiotic therapies.[1]
A more recent example still known to elderly westerners is tuberculosis, an even more threatening disease  present in most countries around the world, extremely virulent, lethal and hard to cure. Multiresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis might soon reclaim the top spot among life threatening conditions.  In some regions multiresistant tuberculosis already has a share of 20-50 % among diagnosed tuberculosis infections, adding up to 480 thousand cases in total.[2]
Current antibiotic usage breeding multiresitant bacteria
Now one might think: well, tuberculosis and plague are only two strains among a vast amount of different bacterial species and mostly present in the eastern and southern hemisphere, I could care less.
For those we have a dire warning, sure it is true the most proficient killers among diseases are still somewhat out of reach for the populations in Europe and the US but as we all know the world is growing closer together and the agglomeration proceeds undamped.
But we face another subtler danger. Worldwide the usage of antibiotics becomes less and less responsible: from patients who don’t take their medication properly to cattle farmer feeding vast amounts of antibiotics to their livestock and to contaminations due to unsafe production plants, the overall contamination with antibiotics of our planet proceeds quickly. And that becomes more and more dangerous for a very simple reason: evolution.
Antibiotic development stagnant
Resistances alone don’t pose a problem, shortly after the development of our first commercial antibiotics widespread resistances could be observed. As history shows we were always able to develop novel antibiotics or develop modifications for known antibiotics to cope with the evolution of bacteria"

Growth Model of E.coli
In order to figure out the kinetics feature of growth, substrate consumption and accumulation of metabolite in lactate producing E.coli, we construct kinetics model of fermentation process based on carbon balance. First of all, the fermentation process of lactate in E.coli under anaerobic conditions has been simplified and we make several assumptions as following:
① Except for carbon sources which serves as restrictive substrates, the growth of E.coli will not be affected by other nutrition in the medium.
② E.coli will use carbon sources to maintain"

Difficulty and Disadvantage of Pheromone Production
As mentioned above, pheromone is too complicated to be produced either artificially or bio-synthetically. Although the cost of artificial chemical synthesis can be lowered through massive production, the environmental damage it causes is fatal. With that said, we decided to find an easier and better way to reach our goal.
PBAN- The Solution
To solve the impossibility of biologically synthesizing pheromone with E.coli, we found a feasible solution. As mentioned above, our method should be pollution-free, efficient, insect resistance-free, and cheap. Combining all these advantageous elements, we introduce you PBAN.

Fig 1. The concentration of Hg-bound dimers can be ‘diluted’ by Hg-free dimers. Because both of them can bind to PmerT promoter but only Hg-bound dimer activates the transcription, the activation effect of MerR is therefore determined by the concentration of Hg (II), the binding affinity to PmerT (namely the sequence of MerR binding site) and the concentration of Hg-free MerR dimer (or the total concentration of MerR).
The model shown in Fig 1 indicates that the apo-merR and Hg-bound merR have a competition. Because both of them can bind to promoter but only Hg-bound dimer are capable of transcription activation, the regulation role of MerR is therefore determined by the concentration of Hg (II), the binding affinity to PmerT (namely the sequence of MerR binding site) and the expression intensity of MerR. We speculate that except manipulation at the dyad sequence of PmerT, the threshold of MerR response can be also manipulated by controlling the concentration of MerR in cytosol.
As with the bacteria in natural environment, the concentration of MerR is stabilized at a certain level. In order to verify the speculation, promoters from partsregistry constitutive promoter library with different strength were prefixed before BBa_B0034+MerR coding sequence to exogenously maintain MerR expression at different intensity (Fig 2). Tthe sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. Furthermore, we used pSB1A2 and pSB3K3 as backbones because of their different copy numbers which could also result in different MerR expression intensity (Fig 3), which was confirmed by an additional experiment.
Fig 2. The construction of the system used for MerR operation characterization. Promoters from the partsregistry with different intensities were selected, leading to varying MerR concentrations. The transcription of PmerT is controlled by the percentage of Hg-bound MerR dimer, thus the expression of GFP can reflex the concentration of Hg (II).
Fig 3. The strategy of backbones swiching. We used pSB3K3, a low-copy number backbone, and pSB1A2, high-copy, to differ the expression of merR.
We carefully tested every combination (the strength of constitutive promoter controlling MerR expression and the backbone copy number) under"

CLOTHO platform is a way that can be considered for making software. Also we discussed M4B (with its network structures, including a relatively new scoring rules for parts), and Synbioss. And we studied the python scripting language. This time, a new idea was proposed by Xiaonan Guo, which is to make a phone-based game in order to popularize synthetic biology and concept of biobricks. People can learn some knowledge on synthetic biology in their leisure time. The proposal interested us a lot and we need to check more information. Before we began to realize this idea, there are a lot of tasks to be done.
Room 341 Yifu Building   Wednesday  May 31, 2013
For the implementation of the idea we discussed last time, we also need to do a lot of work, and in which deep research is essential. We learned a lot from the game--USTC 2010 IGAME, such as the interface design, understanding a good sense from the perspective of a player. We also discussed AMDL (automatic modeling database language), the smallest gene design software. Last but not the least, we made the plan for the refinement of the game idea proposed last Friday, and discussed the direction and so on. Projects are in progress.
Room 341 Yifu Building   Sunday  June 2, 2013
We continued to discuss some software we’ve collected, including Plasmid Automatic Design Software. And from its idea and approaches we can think about how to combine our game and the concept of synthetic biology. Other pieces of software we discussed are BioBricks jtools, which is a small set of utilities; Biomortar, EvoGents, focusing on how to make gene circuits stable based on genetic algorithms; and Agent Based System. Then, we determined agenda for the next meeting. In addition, the coach told us that Gil-- MIT judger -- would come to communicate with  us in our college.

The notebook contains a brief summary of everything we did in the course of the competition, starting from the lab safety training at the beginning of the project to finalizing our Wiki at the end of October. In addition to working in the laboratory, we did not only do several team building activities, but also organized many different public events to make genetic engineering more popular and to raise awareness for the iGEM competition.
Week 1: 3rd of July - 9th of July
The iGEM team TUDelft organized an european iGEM Meet-up - the team of Graz, of course, could not be missing. We sent a delegation to join the meet-up. Interesting presentations about synthetic biology and talks with other iGEM teams, were a good start into a summer of work and offered us the opportunity to form collaborations.
Previous Next
Week 2: 10rd of July - 16th of July
The real journey started in july, when we decided that team building would be a good opportunity to start motivated into a summer of lab-work. That is why we made a trip to a so-called ""Buschenschank"", where you can enjoy very good self-made food and drinks.  As the days went on, motivation increased and everyone felt they could meet the challenges ahead. During the first week, we took part in a safety training about good laboratory practice – correct waste disposal, clean and decent laboratory work. In addition to this lab safety training, we further had a safety seminar where all people who worked at the institute participated. There we got used to all institute related safety questions. Both safety seminars took place before officially starting with the lab work.
Previous Next
Week 3: 17rd of July - 23th of July
Due to our work in the lab, we had one person who was in charge for the safety precaution. Our “safety authorized person” organized a training for all team members including fire drill and evacuation, how to behave in case of an accident and how to render first aid.  Slowly, everyone felt comfortable working in the lab."
