1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55"

Safety Device
Figure 24: Safety Device ( BBa_K1610404 ): We designed and constructed a safety device to ensure bacterial destruction if they escape our prototype. The device contains a T4 Endolysin gene controlled by a repressible promoter pDapA.
Our prototype (described above) is designed to contain bacteria within a bandage. However, accidents (almost always) happen. How can we make sure that bacteria do not escape into the environment? A safety device to ensure cell death outside of our bandage prototype.
There are two main components: a gene that encodes T4 Endolysin ( BBa_K112806 ), which is controlled by a repressible promoter called pDapA ( BBa_I718018 ). T4 Endolysin is an enzyme from the virus Enterobacteria phage T4 (Young, 1992). When expressed, T4 Endolysin can degrade peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls, which kills the bacteria (Young, 1992). The promoter we use is pDapA, a constitutive promoter that can be repressed by diaminopimelic (DAP) acid.
Since pDapA is always unless at least 300µM DAP acid is present, we will add the DAP acid into the LB agar in our bandage prototype. This way, the E.coli bacteria do not die within the bandage. If they escape the bandage, however, as DAP acid is usually not found in the environment, pDapA will be activated (Acord and Masters, 2004) and expression of T4 Endolysin will kill the bacteria.
Assembly into Final Safety Device
First, we inserted a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) behind T4 Endolysin, and the pDapA promoter before a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). Next, we wanted to assemble these parts together. Figure 25: shows a PCR gel check of the cloning products, where the correct PCR product is estimated to be ~1kb.
Our future plans include confirming whether we have the correct safety device through sequencing. We also want to test if the device works; if no DAP acid is present, the bacteria should die.

Our team worked on developing an educational pamphlet to help curb the negative effects of advocating for the use of pesticides. After meeting with farmers and NGOs we realized that our project could have negative health implications to the environment and the user if they spray pesticides incorrectly or in an unsafe manner. We met with several farmers and NGOs in Uganda and Ethiopia where pesticide application is notoriously poor. They provided suggestions on what to cover in our pamphlet. After talking with Dr. Parikh in the anthropology department at Washington University, we decided that it would be best for local students and community leaders to communicate these important ideas to farmers to improve the pamphlets effectiveness. We also will be presenting our work to several high school students at our alma maters and a middle school in St. Louis through the Studio Tesla program.

Summer School for High School Students
In order to promote iGEM project in a larger group, we conducted several welfare activities for high school students. We gave a public lecture in Shaoxing No.1 Middle School of Zhejiang Province. The theme of the lecture was about today's research of life sciences and the development of synthetic biology. We focused on the analysis of some well-designed projects, such as the Coilsweeper, which was presented by ETH_Zurich in 2014 iGEM Conference. Besides, we introduced a ""summer course"" for students in Zhixin High School, Guangzhou, Guangdong. Our activities were very successful as most of the students expressed their better understanding to iGEM. Meanwhile, some of the students gave their great thanks to us and decided to keep in touch with us in the future.
2015 iGEM Conference Hosted by National Chiao Tung University
NCTU-Formosa had successfully operated a conference last year and they did a better job this year! 2015 International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference was a great success and we are in great honor to be invited.
This year, SYSU_CHINA has presented in NCTU conference. We've prepared a and a poster to introduce our project. Our project named Micro-Timer has really attracted many attenders' eyes, which excited us a lot. It's a solid approval for our project. And the project of the host also left us a deep impression. It's a bold design to use E.coli as probes and the special design had really borden our horizon.
NCTU conference also provided us with a platform to communicate with other schools and teams. Thanks to the conference, we've found some drawbacks in our project when we communicated with other teams, and now we've tried to get rid of them. Besides, we've successfully established cooperative relationships with ZJU, SJTU & THU respectively. NCTU conference is a great communication platform for iGEM teams in Asian Pacific Region. We sincerely hope NCTU conference can attract more teams and become better and better.

In fact, both coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs, including some miRNAs, have been found in human saliva. Although mRNAs are highly degraded in saliva, miRNAs are stably and abundantly present in saliva. Recently, there are many reports on cancer-related miRNA expression in saliva. Featured miRNA expression are reported to be found in oral squamous cell carcinoma, parotid gland tumors and esophageal cancer, indicating potential salivary miRNA to be biomarkers for detecting these diseases. According to the test done by Zijun Xie group, there are three type of miRNAs significantly upregulated in the whole saliva from the esophageal cancer patient group in contract to normal control group – miR-10b, miR-144, and miR-451 (p value 0.001, 0.012 and 0.002, respectively; AUC 0.762, 0.706 and 0.756, respectively). And four miRNAs are significantly upregulated in saliva supernatants from the esophageal cancer patient group – miR-10b, miR-144, miR-21 and miR-451. Among them, miR-21 is the most frequently reported one for its high performance in specific expression level related to esophageal cancer (according to one of the reports, p < 0.05, AUC = 0.8820, sensitivity = 90.20% and specificity 70.69%; different tests may report different results).
Comprehensively considering the performance of each miRNA, we finally chose miR-144 as our biomarkers for esophageal cancer. To make our detection quick and convenient, we designed synthetic gene pathways based on paper. It will only require some saliva to complete the detection, which will do no harm to human body. And this techniques can be expanded to be used in the detection of many other diseases which has specific miRNA expression pattern in saliva.

The key laboratory of desert and desertification, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was founded in 1959. It has been well developed through the efforts of many generations, and plays important roles in the international desert and desertification research and control. In addition,the Lanzhou desert research institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, together with the former turkmen desert institute of Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Egyptian desert institute and the Indian desert institute, are regarded as the world's four largest desert research institutions.
Their laboratory discovered that the evolution of biological soil crusts including various succession stages have different ecological and hydrological functions. It puts forward that the development and evolution of biological soil crusts are essential driving force for the desert artificial vegetation system.
In October 2018, we consulted a series of questions to learn about the current situation of desertification, methods to control desertification, and problems encountered in the practical application of different methods. We also collected the opinions and advice from professional researchers on our project.
Summary
We learned that in Minqin, a small city in Gansu Province, the ecological environments in different areas are different. There are different types of ecological environment problems, which need to be solved with in various ways. The current problem of desert control is that desertification and salinization occur at the same time.We aim to apply synthetic biology together with system biology to optimize the current desertification control methods. Our project offers a new possible approach may be combined together with local practical ecological problems and other professional approaches to control the desertification.
Part II
Desertification is a serious problem and caused by complicated reasons. It not simply causes many critical environmental problems but also close relates with economy, agriculture, public policy and so on.
Environmental degradation in arid and semi-arid regions is often resulted from trade-offs between immediate and long-term needs. Immediate economic needs are often conflict, and excessive exploitation of resources may be necessary to the survival of subsistences. Useful and long-term exploitation should be more attractive to the local producers in their daily lives.[1] Our CuPID project applies a combination of genetic engineering with system biology to provide a brand new aspect for desertification control. Our porject has the advantages of low cost and sustainability(See our project page for details). We hope to take advantage of our projects to integrate with current approaches to provide a more efficient and low-cost way to not only for desertification control but also help improving the living conditions of people in the"

The infection of the eluted and incubated culture with M13 derived helper phages and the following purification of the composed phages leads to pelleted phages, diluted in PBS. The UV-VIS absorbance of an 1:50 aliquot at 269 nm and 320 nm was measured, to calculate the phage concentration, based on the following formula:
For the Monobody carrying phages we gained a concentration of  2.992 x 1013 phages per mL in an elution volume of 1.5 mL. For the Nanobody carrying phages a concentration of 1.599 x 1013 phages per mL was achieved in an equal elution volume.
These phages were used to accomplish one stage of phage panning on immuno-tubes, coated with several different proteins, from transcription factors to enzymes and protein domains. We explicit relinquished further panning rounds, to simulate the conditions of our system. Thereby just an initial binder is required to get optimized by in vivo mutation and selection. After an exhaustive washing procedure and the following elution of phages with affinity imparting binding proteins an exponential growing culture of ER2738 was infected and plated on LB agar, containing chloramphenicol.  After incubation at 37°C, several colonies were detectable on agar plates (Fig. 1).
Figure 1: Agar plate, showing E. coli ER2738 colonies after one panning round of phagemid display. Every colony carries a phagemid with the CDS for a Monobody with binding affinity to FGE protein
As an example, we isolated and sequenced one of the Monobody CDSs coding for a formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) binder (Fig. 2).
Figure 2: Example sequence of a Monobody, identified as FGE binder by phagemid display. Top to bottom: Ordered sequence, chromatogram and sequencing result.
Summarized, the phagemid display was a good opportunity, to screen our Monobody and Nanobody libraries at initial binding proteins for our directed evolution system. We could show, that in a small extract of 3.000 variable Monobodies, as well as Nanobodies, out of a theoretical library size of about 1 billion CDS contains some potential candidates for getting an optimal Evobody by directed evolution!

Introduction: A Cell-free, Paper-based Biosensor
We think drug testing kits should be safe, affordable, and readily available to those at risk. Where tests are affordable and understandable to the end-user, accuracy, and thus safety, is compromised. It is clear that the current methods for checking drugs are not adequate. To change this we envisioned a test designed and modeled around the fundamental needs of the users. This is a test built from their personal input and experience, to create the most useful and appropriate device possible.
The current methods available for home testing of drug samples consist of chemical-based tests. One of the main suppliers of these kinds of tests is EZ Test Kits, who produce everything from tests for cocaine purity to testing for the presence of certain cannabinoids. While these tests are a very important resource, they have two main flaws. Firstly, the detection relies on interpreting a subjective colour change by eye, and secondly that each test is specific for one compound only. There are other very accurate methods used to test drug samples. These include mass spectrometry and other tests which use gas chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. Since these testing methods are expensive and not portable they cannot be used as a home testing method, and are instead incorporated in the police and border agencies enforcement.
The utilization of a cell-free system was the most appropriate choice for this project, for it was conducive to the biosensor being used outside of the laboratory in a safe and effective manner. Indeed, it is paramount that users of the biosensor are not exposed to potential pathogens, and that that the environment is protected against the accidental release of genetically modified organisms. Since our device is intended to be used primarily by people with little or no training, the best way to provide this level of safety and security was to ensure that no live organisms were incorporated in the test.
Avoiding the use of live organisms also allows for a degree of portability, for regulation would have"

According to the reconstruction of TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway, our project is aimed at increase the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli (Top 10), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BY4742), and vectors based on them are frequently used throughout our experiments. Since we are intended to regulate the major signaling transduction network, expressions of hundreds of genes and a certain number of pathways will be affected, which may give rise to anxieties of safety regarding researcher and environment. Thus a whole set of experiment guidelines and safety rules are followed in every aspect of our project to minimize every possible threaten. Inside the lab, protective clothing, gloves and masks are required while performing experiments with latent danger such as gel cutting under UV, using toxic and volatile reagents such as phenol and chloroform in special areas. All researchers are required to clean up their working area and put back the experimental equipments. Furthermore, protocols for preservation and operation of common E. coli and yeast strains as well as the vectors are strictly adhered to, and make sure no pollutants are left unattended or take away from the lab, to prevent any toxicant or gene form spreading to the public or contaminating the environment.
None of our new BioBrick would raise safety uneasiness. Following BioBrick requirements, we provide standard biological parts in standard BioBrick shipping plasmid, which can be mainly divided into four types: operators, reporters, target protein mutants and modified vectors. They are primarily involved in the phosphorylation of intracellular protein, thus wouldn’t cause any pollution or contaminant.
Yes. Bio-safety group in our chemical engineering institute would operate safety checks of our experiment progress, monitor and evaluate the project periodically, at least once a semester, to make sure our operation won’t bring about safety issues and no pathogen would flow into the public. Besides, all the waste reagents should be specifically collected rather than directly throwing away in trash cans. iGEM laboratory construction of Tianjin University is always keep in paces with policies of state government and WHO, to take responsibility for safety of researchers as well as the public.
The most valid way to attract people to focus on dealing with safety issues is to remind them of the significance of maintaining"

no use of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in final test enhances biosecurity compared to cell-based biosensors
no use of toxic substances or expensive machines and chemicals compared to chemical analysis
higher durability, easier use and reusability compared to enzymatic tests
easy to handle and utilizable by everyone
In this sense, we also developed a ""Beacon Box"" which is inexpensive, easy to build and enhances the limit of detection of our biosensor when no fluorimeter is available, but only one's naked eye.
In the end, our BPA biosensor should be used as shown in the following figure:
This basic scheme visualizes how our cell-free bisphenol A biosensor could be used in the future.
In the future, when all methods are well-established and the production of the BPA detecting S-layers is low-priced enough, a small biosensor with BPA permeable membrane sticks may be in every food container to show the costumers that their food is free of bisphenol A and save to use.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," sum of the regression coefficient variance is minimized (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). The CCD-UP design has the highest D efficiency and the BB design has the lowest. The CCD design has the highest G efficiency and the BB design has the lowest. The CCD-UP design has the highest A efficiency and the BB design has the lowest. The last two values analysed to determine which design would be used were the average variance of prediction, for which CCD-O had the lowest and BB had the highest, and the number of reactions required by each design, for which CCD-O had the highest and BB had the lowest. Taking all of the information into account, the CCD-Orthogonal design was chosen as it has no correlations between non-identical terms, high Power for all terms, relatively high efficiency scores, and low prediction variation. CFPS reactions with salt supplement amounts according to the Surface Response experimental design (Table 2) were performed (Figure 5). Five reactions (12-16) were discarded from analysis. These were all repeats of CFPS systems with default amounts of salts and showed no CFPS activity due to an error during set-up. Discarding these results had a minor effect on the diagnostics of the surface response design, with some terms becoming more correlated (but all values were still below 0.2), the Power for terms decreasing slightly, and average variance of prediction increasing slightly. Despite this, the D, G, and A efficiencies all increased.

CFPS reactions contained concentrations of magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate, according to the table above. The pattern column shows how much of each supplement was present in each reaction; very low concentration (a), low concentration (−), usual concentration (0), high concentration (+), and very high concentration (A).

The global thermal system functioning
Overall, our device consists in an inhibition of an inhibitor to allow the essential genes expression. This situation happens only if the environment temperature is comprised between 32 and 42 degrees because it is the only range of temperature that allows the production of a functional dimer of repressor cI. Indeed, from 32°C the thermometer RNA allows the ribosome to translate the RNA. And secondly, with a temperature below 42°C, the cI protein is well-folded and can form a homodimer. This cI pair then binds to the cI promoter, thus inhibiting the Tet Repressor and allowing thereby the expression of the essential genes under its control. Finally, at temperatures comprised between 32 and 42°C, our system allows the production of the proteins essential for the bacterium’s survival.
Figure 3.3- First scenario : Permissive temperature range
On the contrary, if the temperature is under 32°C, the hairpin of the thermometer RNA is hybridized on itself and masks the SD sequence, inhibiting the translation of the cI protein. Thereby the Tet Repressor is constitutively produced and inhibits the essential genes expression, leading to the bacterium’s death.
Figure 3.4- Second scenario : Lower non-permissive temperature range
If the temperature is over of 42°C, even if the thermometer RNA hairpin is linearized and allows the ribosome reading of the cI RNA sequence, the cI inhibitor cannot form homodimers and is not functional anymore. Thus the Tet Repressor is also produced and inhibits the essential protein production leading to the bacterium’s death.

Results
In order to design a safety E. coli chassis, numerous test constructs have been made. Each of it is intended to check the functionality of one part of our final system.

To functionally characterize our parts, a fluorescent reporter: a Cyan Fluorescent Protein with a ssRA tag has been introduced downstream, to permit a fast destruction of the reporter and so visualize the fluorescent switch rapidly.  Finally 38 BB have been constructed, but due to a lack of time, only 2 biobricks have been properly characterized by fluorescence microscopy: the BBa_K1707026 which correspond to the ssRA tag test and the BBa_K170"

At last, according to simulation results, we propose the end time of degradation reaction as the reference to experiment design.
GFP is the fluorescent signal which means the existence of an amount of nicotine in the medium, so we first analyze the process of GFP signal production and attenuation. Figure 7 shows that the variation of time for reaching 100 a.u. is small among different groups and the average time is shorter than 5 min. However, the time for signal complete attenuation (under detection limit) varies a lot which increases greatly with more nicotine input. About the time for reaching maximal GFP intensity, it is interesting that more nicotine input and stronger promoter 1 may lead to longer period for GFP signal maximization, because more Vppa expression means more 6-Hydroxynicotine produced initially to release hdnoR repression quickly. Then we calculate the time interval, which is set to be the time for GFP intensity above 95% GFP maximum, for measuring GFP max intensity. The time interval changes a lot among various nicotine input and the maximal timespan is about 700 min.
Figure 7 Heat-map of signal start time
Figure 8 Signal stop time with s1, nicotine
Figure 9 Heat-map of signal max time
Figure 10 Signal max duration with s1, nicotine
The second signal is AHL molecule synthesized by LuxI. The lowest concentration of AHL to activate the transcription of Lux pR is about 0.1 nM, so we calculate the time in which AHL stays in a functional concentration. For nicotine input is lower than 0.1 M, the functional timespan is about 500-1000 min. With higher nicotine input, the state in functional AHL amount can last for over 2500 min.
Figure 11 Functional AHL duration heat-map
Figure 12 Product max time vs s1, nicotine
In the last part, to collect the final product 3-Succinoyl-Pyridine in highest concentration, the time for reaching maximal concentration is calculated. From figure 12, we notice that the range of time is from 0-30 h and the change of time is strongly related to nicotine input but the impact of different promoter 1 strength seems not significant. The possible reason is that the time of GFP signal activation does not vary a lot (0-60min) as described above which means the time for signal induction does not account for a large portion in the total time for nicotine degradation.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

Project Details
In Depth Description of our Project
We began work in May obtaining cDNA samples of Phanerochaete Chrysosporium.  We initially worked with the Mississippi State University Forest Products Lab, but we could never get any PCR results.  We contacted the University of Wisconsin Forest Products Lab (Jill Gaskell) and obtained samples of cDNA from PC (BKM strain and RP strain).  We got no results from this either.  At this point, we consulted Jill and she advised that we make our primers more specific for the noncoding regions of the gene.  This worked and we obtained our gene (LipA).
The Experiments
We were able to obtain a purified Lignin Peroxidase from PC by doing sequential PCRs of the non coding region and then the coding region.  There was difficulty in cloning the gene into the plasmids we used, pGEM and pPIC6alpha.  However, once we were able to clone the gene into pGEM, it was easily cloned into pPIC6alpha as well.  However, this work required the whole summer and we had to work around classes.  We have been able to BioBrick our part and get it into Pichia for testing.  At this point we are in the middle of testing the gene and the enzyme activity.
Results
We have isolated a Lignin Peroxidase gene from Phanerochaete Chrysosporium.  The gene is highly analogous to many other Lignin Peroxidase genes, especially Lignin Peroxidase A.  It was sequenced and uploaded to GenBank for comparisons and showed an extremely high degree of homology with other Lignin Peroxidases.  The gene has been put into standard BioBrick format, but it has not been characterized due to time constraints.  This, as well as development of a functional system will be part of our future work.
Our Part
We made a coding part for Lignin Peroxidase.  It is currently in testing and will hopefully be done by the Jamboree. "

pABA Elementary Flux Mode Analysis
We wanted to use elementary flux mode analysis to identify targets for gene knockout/gene overexpression. Elementary flux mode analysis allows us to calculate the elementary flux modes, which are analogous to the 'metabolic freedom' of the metabolic model. Using the EFMs, we are able to understand all of the ""potential capabilities"" of the organism. We then examine the metabolic network for different things we want to have done, and things we want to eliminate in order to increase pABA production. Using this, we select targets for knockout/overexpression.
In order to calculate the EFMs, we used efmtool [1] from ETH Zurich. We also used several MATLAB scripts from Dr. Nils Averesch to calculate product yields from the EFM model.
We were interested in finding ways to produce a larger amount of pABA. In a standard, unmodified metabolic network, the amount of pABA being produced is relatively little. The calculated product yield was:
Product_max_without_RX = 49.6064
The biomass vs. product yield graph is shown below:
We generated a metabolic network where R34 (Phosphotransferase system (EC 2.7.1.69)) was removed. Our reasoning was that glucose is preferentially taken up through the phosphotransferase system, which consumes PEP. In our case, PEP is also the precursor to the Shikimate pathway. By changing the glucose uptake mechanism, we expect to see an increase in the amount of pABA. With R34 removed, the results were:

This year, our project researches the issues of the field sobriety test. We visited the judges, the policemen, the wine tasters, and the health care workers, who we considered as experts who may give us advice. Surveys were designed for the public concerning the breathalyzer test. We also met iGEM teams (NCTU, NTHU, CGU) and attended 2016 iGEM Asian Conference to exchange project ideas and share experience. In addition, a biotech company, BIONIME corp., provided us with technical supports. This page particularly presents our efforts concerning the Human Practices events.
Scenario: One day, a man drove lively on the road after eating lychees. Suddenly, he lost his control and his car bumped into the tree on the sideway. And he fell into a coma. For a while, a police officer came up and asked him to take a sobriety test. It turned out that he exceeded the legal alcohol limit in a breathalyzer test. He felt upset and decided to take action. How could we help him prove that he was innocent?
After researching news concerning the field sobriety test, we found many debates against the breathalyzer test such as individual metabolic differences, diabetes, refusals, people dead or in coma. We studied the principle behind the test and believed that there’s a way more reliable. Therefore, we went to the judges in the court, the police officers in the police station, the health care workers in the hospital and the wine tasters in a working place to discuss the issues and seek for opinions. We also designed a questionnaire to survey the public about their experience in the sobriety test. On campus, we educated the younger schoolmates with biotech skills and engaged the school’s teachers to experience the breathalyzer test. To connect iGEM community, we met teams hosted by NCTU-Formosa and attended the Asian conference held by NCKU-Tainan that provided us opportunities to exchange ideas and share experience. To work with iGEMers, we collaborated with NCTU-Formosa and helped them to confirm a function of one of their BioBrick parts. To develop IGEM BLOOD AL"

Endosomal uptake
Varga et al. 2005
Upon reaching the target kidney cells, the gene doping viral vectors infect the cells. The infection process and production of gene doping EPO was modeled through a series of kinetic equation. Kidney cells have a mean lifespan of around 57 days. Upon their death, the infected cells release the gene doping DNA back into the bloodstream as cell free DNA (cfDNA). This increases the detection window of the gene doping DNA.
Figure 11. Cellular uptake of gene doping vectors. Figure was inspired by Varga et al. 2005 .
Detailed Intracellular Gene Delivery Model
Cellular uptake
After the uptake of the vectors in the tissue, the stage of cellular uptake ensues. In this process we modelled multiple steps as indicated in Figure 11 according to a model first developed by Varga et al. 2005 . The cellular uptake of gene doping vectors as depicted in Figure 11 can be dissected into multiple steps described by a set of coupled differential equations, for which the constants are given in Table 3.
First, the complex is taken up by endocytosis after which it is either degraded or taken up, as represented by equations 6 and 7.
$$\frac{d[vesicle]}{dt} = k_{bind\,uptake}[c_{tissue}]-(k_{Escape}+k_{deg\,vesicle})[vesicle] \tag{6}$$
$$\frac{d[complex\,intracell]}{dt} = k_{escape}[vesicle]-k_{unpack}[complex\,intracell]-k_{bind\,vector}[complex\,intracell]\tag{7}$$
Second, vector dissociation and either degradation or nuclear target complex binding takes place in either dissociated or complexed form, as given by equations 8, 9 and 10.
$$\frac{d[plasmid]}{dt} = k_{unpack}[complex\,intracell]-k_{bind \,plasmid}[plasmid]-k_{deg}[plasmid]\tag{8}$$

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

3.environmental safety?
A. No issues of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety raised up during our KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2011 project. All our work was performed fallowing the guidelines of the safety standards required by biosafety level 1. Rules of best microbiological practices were applied.In our project we are producing recombinant E. coli and transgenic flies under direction of guidelines established by KIT recombinant experiment committee. They will be produced and kept in P1 room and fly room in which fly trap and double-entry doors are equipped.

Q. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
1.did you document these issues in the Registry?
2.How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
3.How could other teams learn from your experience?
A. No.A new Bio Brick part we are making in our project is a Drosophila model for lymphatic leukemia. This part is no toxic, no infectious and completely harmless.
Q. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
2.If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A. Yes. We have bio safety group at KIT, and our project has been monitored by them. The leader of this biological safety group was Prof.Yamaguchi. Furthermore, there is an upper level committee of transgenic experiences at Kyoto Institute of Technology. Our project has also received accreditation from this committee. All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. It agrees with all safety standards requested by biosafety level 1. Therefore, Prof. Yamaguchi and other education stuff and instructors fully support the work done by this iGEM team.
Q. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices"

Evry Paris-Saclay
We were initially contacted by Jérémy Armetta from the Evry Paris-Saclay team as our team was working on a synthetic promoter library and they were wondering if we could work together as they aimed to make a psicose synthetic promoter in order to create a biosensor.
We organised a Skype call to discuss how our projects intertwined. After a little chat, it was clear that we were taking different approaches to achieving our synthetic promoters and therefore could not help each other in such a manner.
We suggested that, once working, we could take the biosensor created by the Evry Paris-Saclay team and implement it to our framework as a variant to the IPTG biosensor currently used as our proof of concept. By co-culturing this biosensor module to the framework's other modules, we would be able to come up with various variants of the psicose biosensor for the Evry team.
However, due to synthesis issues causing delays and therefore time constraints, we have been able to implement the psicose biosensor into our framework but lacked the time to co-culture this part with the Sensynova platform's multiple modules in order for the creation of variants.
Further details of the psicose biosensor implementation into the Sensynova platform can be found on our results page, under ""Detector Modules""."

Chitin is an abundant natural macromolecular substances in the             exoskeleton of arthropods. It could be converted by deacetylation to             chitosan, which is -1, 4- polymer of 2-glucosamine. Chitosan is             significantly soluble and bioactive, being widely used in medicine,             cosmetics, food industry, water treatment and chemical industry. Treated             with concentrated alkali, the current technology of chitosan production             is deficient, unstable, squandering of energy, and, especially,             contaminative.According to a currently promising technology of             deacetylation using chitin-active enzymes, we found out that Chitin             Deacetylase (CDA) could hydrolyze the acetamino group on chitin,             directly yielding chitin, and the only industrial-available source of             chitin is the especially high-crystallized chitin from shell of             crustacea like shrimp and crab. In order to applicate enzymolysis method             to industry, separation, identification and production of             crystal-chitin-active-enzymes is crucial, both promoting             industrialization and giving instruction to scientific research.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua#Achivement-Judging-Criteria_-_-_TEXT.html," introducing the genetically modified quorum sensing system from Gram-negative bacteria (LuxR-AHL controlled transcriptional activation system) to S. cerevisiae. The original LuxR-AHL system does not function in eukaryotic systems.
We have helped many registered iGEM teams in different aspects. First of all, we helped OUC-CHINA for the modeling part of their project this year. Our team and OUC-CHINA has established a long term collaboration relationship since 2012. A member of our team has been trained well in a lab focusing in bioinformatics and is adept in stimulating biological processes using mathematical methods. So this year we helped their modeling in resetting the parameters to stimulate their system better. Secondly, since our school has been participating in iGEM for several years, we helped several teams which planned to participate in iGEM for the first time this year by sharing our experiences on iGEM. We introduced the history of this worldwide competition, told them the procedures and rules of iGEM, and gave suggestions on how to solve certain problems that they might face, such as how to organize a team, how to get funding, and how to prepare for everything beyond mere wet experiments, especially modeling. We did this to several new iGEM teams including BIT, BIT-CHINA, and the students from Nanjing University (though we are not clear which team they finally formed).
We have created a novel portable pathogen detector which is useful in not only disease detection, but also environmental quality control, food safety detection and clinical diagnosis. The portable pathogen detector has a comprehensive application in many aspects of public health security.
To expand the influence of synthetic biology and Tsinghua iGEM 2013 team, we made three episodes of movie series, introducing basic biology knowledge and our team project.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html,"33204 but the gel did not indicate successful results, again only the positive control worked.  No positive colonies were found.
Decarboxylation
After preparing our production media 48 hour incubation sample for gas chromatography and extracting with ethyl acetate, we left our sample for use in the GC. Our results indicated a small hydrocarbon peak, indicating a possibility that hydrocarbon production had been a success, but it was not distinct enough to make this conclusion. The procedure would be repeated, this time creating sigma compound solutions as well. These sigma compounds would resemble naphthenic acids. In order to ensure that hydrocarbon peaks would be produced from these compounds and not from glucose, we prepared a new production media lacking glucose, in hopes that incubated bacteria could survive for long enough without a food source to decarboxylate a sigma compound to some extent. Since the sigma compounds we initially selected for our purposes had not arrived as of yet, we opted for others: Cyclohexanepentanoic acid (CHPA), cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. We performed 8 overnight cultures and prepared sigma compound solutions. Despite our many attempts, we were only able to acquire an OD of about 0.6 for these 8 tubes. We then performed our production protocol with the tubes, preparing them with the following reagents and inoculating them with the contents of our broth cultures:
Tube 1: Glucose
Tube 2: Glucose
Tube 3: Glucose and CHPA
Tube 4: Non-glucose and CHPA
Tube 5: Glucose and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
Tube 6: Non-glucose and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
Tube 7: Glucose and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid
Tube 8: Non-glucose and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid
In the above tubes, “glucose” indicated that glucose-containing production media was used, whereas “non-glucose” indicated that the production media lacking glucose was used. In each case where a sigma compound was added, it was present at a concentration of 25mg/L. Each production tube was then left for a 48 hour incubation over the weekend, to perform gas chromatography tests the following week.

Jurassic Wet Lab
David Urick discusses synbio and the corresponding need for increased security
A scientist creeps through the thick, tropical undergrowth of a remote island.  He wipes sweat from his brow as his eyes keenly search for any sign of his prey. His task: recover a genetically engineered specimen that is loose in the jungle and do so before said specimen can eat him.
It’s a scene straight out of the blockbuster Jurassic World, except this scientist is no movie star.  He is on the Cayman Islands, tracking the population of Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito that transmits the deadly Dengue virus. Several weeks prior, a lab-bred population of male mosquitoes were released on the island to compete with the native males for mates. These transgenic insects carry a gene that renders their female offspring flightless—a death sentence for mosquitoes—eventually depleting the population and preventing the spread of Dengue [ 1 ].
Not quite Chris Pratt.
However, these mosquitoes are an effective demonstration of where real life science stands in relation to Hollywood. While they lack the jaw-dropping qualities of a reincarnated triceratops, the potential for widespread destruction is all there. If an island can be cleared of a species in a matter of months, it is by no means a stretch to say that a more ambitious project could have dire effects on ecosystems worldwide.
Synthetic biology has opened the doors for a whole new world of innovation and discovery.  Microorganisms will soon produce drugs, fuels, materials, and probably everything else. E. coli will fight cholera and fluorescent cats will help cure AIDs [ 2 ]. A library of standardized genetic ‘parts’ and enhanced modeling techniques will only serve to accelerate progress. Heck, chickens might even turn into dinosaurs if we’re lucky [ 3 ].
Every possibility carries risk, though, and reckless advancement might carry grave consequences, as Jeff Goldblum cautioned way back in 1993.   In 2004, DNA from genetically modified corn planted in Mexico was detected in natural the natural population [ 4 ]. Like our Dengue-fighting mosquitoes, gene flow from transgenic crops can have unpredictable effects on the ecological landscape. Herbicide resistant plants can confer their immunity to weeds and other species. Long"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"
UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," make our project as centered around the beekeeping community as possible, we asked questions which gave us insight only beekeepers could provide about bees. We asked what product would be best for them and about the effects of Nosema.
It was making  the documentary that was the most rewarding experience in our attempt to produce the best possible research project . Beekeepers warmly welcomed us onto their factories, into their farms and spaces, into their homes and even to their families. Through our questioning we determined a few main goals. Firstly, we wanted to discover the ways in which our project would affect the community. Secondly, we wanted to find out how to improve our project meaningfully.   It turned out that most of the time these two things went hand in hand.  We approached our Integrated Human Practices in a questions, answer, and then application process.
Question: How has Nosema affected your operation? We asked this question because we wanted to gain a better understanding of how much of an impact Nosema could have on an operation, and determine whether or not our project was going to be impactful.
Quotes: “We’ve experienced crashing in the spring from bees that heavy Nosema Levels” - Curtis Miedema
Answer: Overwhelmingly beekeepers told us that Nosema has a very negative impact on their operations, because Nosema kills and as Curtis says, “less bees means less honey”. This means that a treatment for Nosema is desperately needed if beekeeping is to continue to flourish.
Application: This reassured us that our project was going to have an impact on our community because it is needed. This told us that we had accomplished out main goal for human practices as we were tackling a problem that was negatively affecting our community.
Question: How has the loss of fumagillin affected you and the beekeeping community? We wanted to ensure that beekeepers really wanted a new product, so that we could be assured our product would be useful.
Quotes: “ There is a lot of panic around what people are going to do. Getting your bees through the winter is pretty much the most important part of beekeeping in this area.” - Paul Greidanus
“It’s a little bit scary right now” - Randy Beaton.
Answer: When we spoke to those in the beekeeping community, they made it clear that the loss of fumagillin was a detriment to their industry. When speaking with beekeepers they said that there was panic, fear, and shock in their community, caused by the loss of fumagillin. The loss is threatening because it means that beekeepers are more likely to be affected by Nosema"

Aachen,2018,Team:Aachen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of saliva of one patient and uses five assays of ELISA.             It takes about one to two days from taking the samples to having the results.             The price for one sample measured with mass spectrometry is around 90-100€. With 5-6 samples per patient,             a melatonin measurement costs 600-800€ for only one patient.
Figure 1: Our interview with Dr. Acuña
Additionally, we asked Dr. Acuña about the correlation between melatonin and different diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.             He stated that for example, patients with Alzheimer’s disease have low levels of melatonin.             Melatonin can be used in those cases as a therapeutically drug. Dr. Acuña told us that there are different influences of melatonin on the course of the disease.             In the early stages of the loss of cognitive abilities, a dose of around 50-60 mg melatonin can help to stop the progression of it.
Besides, Dr. Acuña sees a desperate need for a more specific method. Except for mass spectrometry,             the current techniques are standard scientific methods but have a lack of sensitivity.             He believes that a device which is placed directly in the doctor’s office would redefine melatonin measurement.
Finally, we asked him about the future of melatonin measurement. He stated that society is gaining more awareness of the importance of melatonin.             It is entering the drug market and is used more often for patients. Therefore, he demands a better measurement method.
Our talk with Prof. Dr. Acuña had a deep impact on our project. After the interview,             we decided to measure the melatonin level in saliva as it is more accurate than urine and non-invasive compared to blood.             Furthermore, we decided to engineer a point-of-care-diagnostic to speed up the measurement process.             This was the very beginning of our hardware project.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

This is enough to justify the use of a biodetector (and, of course, the lyophilization conservation method) for the economic profile of the population involved in this problem over the world.

Figure 4: Lyophilizator: essentially a vacuum machine.
The lyophilization process is quite simple. It is ased on completely removing water from a sample by sublimation of ice by vacuum [19]. In matter of microbial cultures, the freezing process must be the most instantaneous as possible in order to form little and more dispersed ice crystals, that could lead to lethal or sublethal effects on cells [19][21].

UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB
We established a collaboration with the IGEM UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team , after realizing that our two projects had one component in common: we were both targeting air pollution.
We first organized Skype meetings and discussed through Facebook to improve our projects.
In a second time, we collaborated on our questionnaire. Indeed, we noticed that some of our questions were similar, so we sent the results of our respective polls. We then reflected together on how to analyze these surveys and defined a common method of analyzing these surveys.
We have gone further in the areas of law and entrepreneurship. Thus, we carried out for the Chilean team a study on French regulations and laws concerning air pollution. In return, the Chilean team informed us about Chilean regulations. We used their answers to improve our report on air pollution. Finally, the Chilean team helped us for entrepreneurship by carrying out the SWOT analysis of our device. We also had discussions on the development of a business model in the field of depollution.
Paris_Bettencourt
We had a very fruitful collaboration with Paris_Bettencourt iGEM team. We invited them to take part in the 3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup (see below) we organized in early July. In return, we took part to the great escape game they created. We betatested it and gave them feedback !  It was a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the view from the Montparnasse tower ! We also helped them by providing them with the silicatein biobrick our team designed last year. It was quite a struggle to locate it in our freezers but we are sure they made the best of it !
3rd iGEM Parisian Meetup
We decided to host an event where French teams could have the opportunity to present their project in front of a public and jury, just like at the giant jamboree! The goal of this meeting was threefold: 1) we both wanted to place teams in competition-like conditions; 2) we also wanted to socialize with the French teams and have a great time and 3"

From the beginning of the brainstorming, the main idea involved the expression of therapeutic proteins that would act as toxins for tumor cells. At this point, we realized that we needed more specificity if healthy tissue was to be unharmed. In the hypothetical case that our bacteria were liberated into the environment and some way it survived and maintained its plasmid without a selectivity marker, it would be a catastrophe. This imaginary scenario led us to the idea of implementing safety locks in the design of our project.
The first issue we needed to address was the potential harm of the bacteria triggered by the immune response against the lipid A and the Braun lipoprotein components of the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) membrane of the Escherichia coli. Thus, we devoted our <a href=""#tab_module1"" target=""_blank"">Module I</a> to develop a strategy to avoid this problem. Literature showed that the deletion of the msbB and the lpp genes can produce viable strains; furthermore, according to studies performed by he mutants of this strain by Stritzker et, al., the bacteria with the msbB deletion could still be able to reach and colonize tumours. This action also reduced the side effects in mice.
We wanted that the action of our therapy was site-directed; as a result, we designed our phages to internalize in the mammalian cells. The infection in bacteria is initiated when P3 binds to the F pilus on the surface of an E. coli which facilitates the translocation of the viral DNA into the cytoplasm. In our case the P3 will be binded with the peptide CTVALPGGYVRVC, that specifically binds to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Normally, GRP78 expression is maintained at low levels but is upregulated in stress environments and induced in tumor environments. Thus, the phages will only bind to this cancer-specific receptor that express this receptor protein, ignoring the healthy cells.

In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

Temperature-Sensitive (TempSens) Promoter
When chronic inflammation occurs, GzmB may be produced by a number of different cells (in additional to T cells and natural killer cells) (Boivin et al., 2009). This may contribute to the elevated levels of GzmB in inflammation. We wanted to avoid inhibiting all GzmB activity, since a normal level of GzmB is still an important part of the immune system. Our goal was to control the expression of our inhibitor protein, so that expression can be shut off when normal GzmB levels are reached (further discussed in Modeling). To achieve this, we looked for promoters in the iGEM parts registry that can be induced manually. We found a temperature-sensitive promoter ( BBa_K608351 ), a composite part designed by iGEM11_Freiburg. We ordered this from the parts registry, and immediately began assembly and testing.
Assembly into Promoter-Testing Device
The first goal with the temperature-sensitive promoter was to confirm that it was functioning. In order to test the promoter’s activity, we designed a testing device with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the reporter (Figure 4). We hypothesized that at lower temperatures the promoter should not initiate transcription; therefore, no GFP would be present. When exposed to higher temperatures, the promoter would then begin transcription and express the downstream GFP. As seen in Figure 5, we successfully inserted the temperature-sensitive promoter in front of a GFP generator ( BBa_E0840 ).
Figure 4: Design for Device to Test the Temperature-Sensitive Promoter ( BBa_K1610102 ): Using GFP as a reporter, we can test when the promoter is active and initiates transcription. The device also includes a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ).
Figure 5: PCR check of temperature-sensitive promoter and GFP generator: Using VF2 and VR, PCR was used to confirm that the promoter (~1kb) was inserted before GFP generator (~800 bps). Including the PCR product, the correct final product should be ~2.1kb (boxed in red).
Testing Activation Temperature
After successfully cloning in the temperature-sensitive promoter, we realized one immediate problem: the exact temperature of activation is unknown. In order to test this, we restreaked bacteria containing the promoter and GFP generator device onto several plates. These were incubated at different temperatures: 30⁰C, 32⁰"

Modelling
Modelling of the RelE-RelB System is Essential to Avoid Irrevocable Dormancy
Controllable dormancy is a feature that holds the potential to be applied in many different situations. However, inducing dormancy and bringing the bacteria back to a metabolic active state is like balancing on a tightrope, and to establish the basis of future implementations, the properties of this system would have to be investigated further. In an endeavour to provide this basic knowledge, stochastic modelling utilising the Gillespie algorithm was performed in an attempt to prognosticate the system and simulate the interactions between the toxin and antitoxin. The toxin RelE is inhibited by the antitoxin RelB through complex formation, and both proteins interact with their promoter in a feedback mechanism.  To consolidate the model, the capacity of the toxin-antitoxin system was assessed in an experiment, as the controllability of the dormancy system was studied through manual  regulation of RelE and RelB expression.
You can read more about the modelling here.
Figure 2. Left: The time required for the bacteria to enter dormancy varies with the expression level of RelB. The percentage of dormant bacteria, defined as containing RelE amounts above 40 molecules per cell as a function of time in minutes. Right: Only one of the tested configurations, RelB2:50-RelE:35, causes the bacteria to regain their activity within the modelled time. The percentage of dormant bacteria, defined as containing RelE amounts above 15 molecules per cell as a function of time in minutes. The data is based on the simulation of 1000 independent bacteria.
The simulated data revealed, that when enhanced RelE production is implemented, in order to induce dormancy in E. coli, the effect come easily. However, implementation of RelB expression is also found necessary to ensure that the bacteria are able to enter an active state again.
The model showed that the system is sensitive to the RelE:RelB ratio, as well as the total amount of produced toxin. As seen in Figure 2, implementation with production rates in the vicinity of 50 and 35 molecules per minute for RelB and RelE respectively, was found to be suitable for balancing our system; the bacteria lay dormant within the computed time and re-enter an active state within minutes.
The simulated data made it evident that implementing an optimised dormancy system comprises a challenge, as the individual expression levels of RelE and RelB, as well as their interaction, has a crucial impact on the regulation of dormancy."

“No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world” – Robin Williams
For our system to ever become a product on the international market, it must be legal to produce and sell edible, genetically modified bacteria. We don’t know if this will ever happen, and if people ever will eat food  produced by bacteria. We believe that everyone should be aware of the fact that the world’s population will increase and double within the next 58 years, Source: Population media Center, 2009: Issue we Address. (Link) and that this might lead to lack of food for everyone in the future.
This is a worldwide problem and we need to find a new food source.
Are people aware of this, when they think of eating bacteria? As synthetic biologist and scientists we think that it is very important to inform the general public and make them understand, that microorganisms  might be an opportunity for solving the upcoming problems. We know that it sounds strange and unpleasant to use bacteria as a food source, but after working with this project we see a big capability and potential for microorganisms as a food source in the future.

Validated Part / Validated Contribution
We created a new BioBrick part as expected : BBa_K2616000 . This part permits to express pro-NGF and secrete it in the extracellular medium using E. coli type I secretion system. Since the export peptide is not processed when passing through the secretion pore, we separated pro-NGF from this 60 aminoacid long sequence by a cleaving site for TEV protease. This part also permits to secrete TEV protease, under the same promoter, via this same secretion system. We succeeded in characterizing our pro-NGF by sequencing, Western blot, mass spectrometry and activity.
Collaboration
We hosted the 4th Parisian Meet-up where we organized a Tiny Jamboree in the morning in order to practice with all the French teams for the Giant one in October. We also organized and attended round tables about bioethics with multiple professionals during the afternoon. We collaborated with other iGEM teams for the Interlab (Sorbonne U Paris), by sharing and testing protocols (WPI Worcester) as well as other non-scientific collaborations. You can read about them on this page .

Project Overview
What would it take to...
Build a circuit using microbially catalyzed metal sulfide deposition?
Background: SRB, H2S, and Copper Sulfides
The inspiration for this idea came from an ecological observation made of copper biomineralization by a species of Sulfate Reducing Bacteria. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) comprise a family of chemolithotrophic bacteria that use sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic metabolism. As a result of sulfate reduction, these bacteria produce gaseous H2S. Subsequently, microbially generated H2S reduces copper in solution and precipitates soluble copper ions in the form of insoluble copper sulfide (CuS). It was discovered that by this method, some strains of SRB formed a CuS compound nearly identical to covellite - a natural superconductor (Weber, 2009). If this activity could be enhanced under spatial and temporal control, bacteria could be harnessed to deposit metal sulfide in specified geometries for manufacturing and engineering applications.
Building H2S Production Activity into E. coli
Investigation of H2S production in bacteria has been well documented in E. coli. Work by Dr. Jay Keasling at University of California, Berkeley, has shown that a gene encoding Thiosulfate Reductase from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has previously been expressed in E. coli to overproduce hydrogen sulfide from thiosulfate.
The gene phsABC functionally encodes Thiosulfate reductase. The gene itself contains an open reading frame for each of the three genes phsA, phsB, and phsC. The resulting complex of three transmembrane proteins constitutes Thiosulfate reductase and catalyzes the reduction of inorganic thiosulfate to hydrogen sulfide.
This activity can be monitored by growing bacteria on Triple Sugar Iron (TSI) Agar . Evolution of H2S as a gas, results in the reduction of Iron Sulfate to an Iron Sulfide. Iron sulfide precipitates as a black solid and can be easily identified visually on the macroscopic scale. Bacteria that are actively producing"

Gel showed failed ligation of mut dCas9 and backbone, started new ligation process
Goal:
Analyze ligated mutdCas9 and backbone
Procedure:
Gel electrophoresis of enzyme digested mutated dCas9:
Ran tube 1, 2, 3 and 4 on gel electrophoresis.
Ligation of mutated dCas9 and iGEM-backbone:
Started ligation process of mutated dCas9 and iGEM-backbone from samples collected in the freezer.
How we did it:
Added (in order) 2uL T4  DNA ligase buffer, 3uL backbone, 9,5 uL mutated dCas9, 4,5 uL ddH2O and 1uL T4 DNA ligase (thawed in room temperature, no contact with hands)
mixed gently by pipetting up and down
microfuged tubes at 16^C, 10 rpm in one minute.
incubated at 16*C over night
Watered out DNA fragments from idt:
- Both DNA fragments from idt were watered out with 40 uL ddH2O till a concentration of 25ng/uL. stored in fridge.
Next step will be: PCR amplification->run gel and isolate -> nanodrop to find concentration -> Gibson assembly with primers (same primers as with RRvT biobrick)
Results:
Gel electrophoresis:
Had only two bands on gel, which meant that the backbone and the mutated dCas9 was not ligated correctly.

Collaboration Map
Nanotubes are a new way of communication between bacteria but it also highlights the importance of collaboration between bacteria in order to survive (antibiotic cross resistance for example). Our question is: do the iGEM teams make (nano)tubes between each other in order to succeed in this competition? Indeed, building collaborative projects, sharing biobricks, strains or protocols could give a selective advantage to the teams that collaborate. Nanotubes can create random relationships that can be of a long or short duration... Just the way it happens with people! Indeed, teams can exchange imformation and knowledge by collaborating, sometimes at an international level. Collaboration between teams can be a long-term relationship (like the one between Paris Bettencourt and PKU), or shorter flings as we will see.
Objectives
Extract data from wikis (collaborations, medals, prizes, geographic location)
Represent the collaboration between teams as a network
Relate success in the competition to collaborations and other parameters
This customizable tool allows us to have very good vizualisations of the collaborating network of iGEM and its evolution through time. The main asset is that all the parameters can be freely chosen and we invite you to give it a try, you can really find out surprising facts about iGEM that way.

Bacillus BioBrickBox
In 2012, the iGEM-team LMU-Munich began the task to develop essential BioBricks, like vectors, promoters, reporters and affinity tags, especially suited for the use in Bacillus subtilis in order to establish a new chassis in the Escherichia coli-dominated world of iGEM. Even after the finals of the iGEM competition in 2012, the project was pursued further since its importance for synthetic biology and resulted in a publication in the Journal of Biological Engineering about this so called Bacillus BioBrick Box .
This year, our team aims to enhance the Bacillus BioBrick Box  by adding new parts, like different colored fluorescent proteins, a RBS-collection, evaluating protein linkers for B. subtilis and creating a redesigned backbone for resistance free strain generation.
Resistance free strain generation
With BaKillus as an medical application it is most likely that it will be released - though in small amounts - into the environment. Therefore we sought after a solution in order to keep the final BaKillus free of unnecessary antibiotic resistances. In order to do so we developed a resistance free gene insertion"

"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Modelling#KinAExpression_-_-_TEXT.html," LacI concentration. However, upon a closer look, the KinA concentration did not increase due to the higher IPTG concentration. The KinA concentration is now higher than the LacI concentration because the LacI concentration decreased.
IPTG concentration = 5000 nmol/fl
Figure 3.1
Once again, as obsered in Figure 1.1 and 2.1, the concentration of LacI* in Figure 3.1 seems to reach the similar concentrations although the concentration of IPTG has been increased in each case. This seems to say that the concentration of LacI* has reached a threshold concentration.
Figure 3.2
The KinA concentration in Figure 3.2 is greater than that of LacI once again. However, KinA concentration seems to be stagnant at approximately 90nmol/fl, while the LacI concentration constantly decreases with increased IPTG concentration. Therefore, the IPTG concentration only seems to affect the LacI concentration.

SCSU-New_Haven,2016,Team:SCSU-New Haven#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," work on 1-MN. Once our “Detector” turns on Psal, another part the  “Color Reporter” lets us know.
How did you choose this part?
The mutant NahR came from a paper (10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.09.936) comparing the inducibility of Psal using various NahR mutants. NahR_R248H seemed to show the highest output while still being only inducible by salicylate compounds.
The Feedback
BBa_K2143000
More NahR mutants! The WT NahR and the mutant version we are using in our “Detector” part requires Salicylate to fully induce Psal. This version can induce Psal without salicylate.
How does it work in your system?
It is used as a positive feedback loop. In our system, we’ve placed this part just downstream of Psal. So, once Psal gets turned on, even if only for a second by a tiny amount of 3-MS, the feedback kicks on, binds upstream of Psal and now Psal is on even if no more 3-MS is present.
How did you choose this part?
One of our goals with this project was to be able to report very small amounts of 1-MN present on the breath of an individual. We also wanted the indicator to be read without sensitive equipment. Therefore, we needed a strong output using a very low input. With the feedback loop, the input only needs to activate Psal once and NahR_L154F makes more of itself and the reporter downstream. We’ve put two sets of NahR_L154F in this part because our salicylate dependent NahR is still being produced. We thought doubling the concentration of this version would ensure it is the one binding upstream of Psal.
The Color Reporter
BBa_K2143002
This is the tryptophanase gene from E. coli!
How does it work in your system?
One of the “Degrader” enzymes 1,2 -Naphthalene dioxygenase catalyzes the conversion of indole to indigo dye. Indole is produced when tryptophanase acts upon L-Tryptophan. We use a strain of E. coli with a nonfunctional tnaA gene, so when our color reporter is activated
How did you choose this part?
When looking at “Degrader” enzymes we came across the reaction involving indole to indigo dye. We liked using Indigo dye because it is insoluble, if the cells dye or time"

So glad to join the IGEM family! My name is Yajuan Xie,an undergraduate of Lanzhou university and I major in stomatology. This time my main work of the wet lab is about the fish, like feeding and dissecting.In the dry lab,my main task is about the human practice. In addition,I also assist other teammates in experiment and establishing our wlki.Although my specialty isn’t biology,but I much enjoy the time with IGEM,it taught me a lot which I can’t learn from my text book.And I thanks my team members sincerely.

Hi ! I’m Zhen Xie , an undergraduate of Lanzhou university who major in biology. As a newcomer , I’m poor at either theoretical knowledge or the experimental skills,given that, my major work is to edit a fraction of the wiki copy-writing.But fortunately, as I pour time and effort in learning as much as I can from the project,I’ve improved a lot.

’m a rising junior student at Lanzhou University. As I always hold that we students should not only learn lectures and textbooks, but also develop ourselves in all-around way,I take part in IGEM which provides opportunities for me to learn new skills in many aspects. In our team, I participated in part of the laboratory work and helping to establish Wiki.I learned a lot from my teammates and I also enjoy the time that everyone works together.

Lucky to join our team! We tried a lot together in order to come up with some amazing ideas to apply for real practice via synthetic biology. By reading papers and books, browsing webs and thinking constantly,finally we’ve managed it! I have to say that good teamwork is much important.My main task is to feed the fishes and assist other teammates in conducting experiments.In the meantime,I also direct the designing work of our team uniform. Anyway, I believe that “Do what must and should do indeed, and we will carry out one day!” COME ON!

#summer camp
    Apart from lab experiments and factory tour, we had a wonderful summer vacation by taking part in a summer camp together with OUC-China.
    Thanks for their invitation, we joined this summer camp devoting to teach high school graduates and first-year students in university some knowledge in life science as well as methods of reading papers and analysing biological questions, which would increase their interests in life and life science, we spent a pleasing and meaningful week together.
    During this summer camp, we have experienced many interesting activities like going for the sea, painting on the culture medium with E. coli and a small Jamboree. Two of our team members also gave two little lectures on metabolic engineering& fermentation engineering and insect taxonomy.
    Besides, as a new team, we were truly thankful for this opportunity to have a communication with OUC-China and we learnt a lot from them. We are looking forward to collaborate with them again!
#comic book about the production of bioplastic (PHB)
    PHB, a secondary metabolic product produced by a great quantity of bacteria, is regarded as an environmental-friendly material since it can be degraded through biological reactions, known as bioplastic. PHB is of great use in many fields and it might be the key to end white pollution.
    Public may have heard of the name “bioplastic”, but most of them do not know what the “bioplastic” is and how the “bioplastic” produces.
    Aiming at popularize the usage of bioplastic and the process of production of PHB using synthetic biology methods, we published a comic named “THE ADVANTURE OF GLYCEROL”.
#a small lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM
We were honoured to be invited by our Shandong University to give a small lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM competition. Our leader Jiao Jin gave an excellent lecture to the freshmen in our university to help them to have a primary recognition of synthetic biology and iGEM. She mentioned the researches of switches done that were very interesting and attractive to those freshmen. Besides"

I (Ruichen) added perish dish (10 bags) to the Hallam's Lab ordering list, using iGEM's name.
As for the organic solvent tolerance assay, indeed there has been no growing sign in the transformed culture (with 3I plasmid) for the first few hours, and it was left in the 37 degree room over night.
and for the controlled cultures, they were growing as expected when the organic solvents (Pentane and Octane) were not introduced, the experiment was continued (with the disruption of Jacob mentioned before). The organic solvent were added into controlled cultures at different concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%), and their growth were monitored roughly each hour for the first few hours, and when the disruption occurred the cultures were taken out of the 37 degree room and stored in the 4 degree room at 5 p.m.
I (Ruichen) returned to the Lab after dinner at 8:30 p.m., and each culture were examined for OD readings again, and the cultures with Pentane and Octane were incubated in the incubator with vacuums at 37 degree for 1 hour and 30 minutes respectively. Then the OD were read again at 9:30 p.m..
The detailed OD reading data will be posted later with analyzed results.

The Amp plates made the day before worked.  However, the Kan plates (negative control, EPI300 pIJ790, and DH5a pIJ790) showed unexpected results.  The negative control, which only had untransformed K12 cells plated, had more colonies growing than those from the plates with resistance-transformed EPI300 pIJ790 and DH5a pIJ790.  Even then, there were only a few small colonies on the EPI300 pIJ790 plate and none at all on the DH5a pIJ790 plate.  It looks like the Kan plates may not be working, and it is possible that the EPI300 and DH5a cells with the pIJ790 plasmid are not competent.

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," splitter superposes reference and object beam on the camera screen (picture taken from [17]) .
The inline flavor of the DIHM kicks in when neither lenses nor beam splitters are needed as in the typical DHM setup. Instead a point light source is used, which can be produced by passing a collimated light source through a pinhole. The point source creates a spherical wave, illuminates the object, and reaches the image sensor containing the joint wavefronts of both the reference beam and the object beam. This is due to the fact that the peripheral of the wavefront passes by and remains unaffected by the object, hence the reference beam, and that the wavefront passes through the object, forming the object beam.
Simple DIHM setup: From left to the right: camera, sample, pinhole and light source (LED).
In the above picture, a laser source of wavelength
λ
emanates from a pin hole, forming a spherical wave. A small object is typically placed a few thousand wavelengths from the source, reaching the image sensor much further away such that magnification is achieved. Small object means that the object should only block a small fraction of the spherical cone wavefront recorded on the image sensor. Otherwise classical diffraction dominates the image, where 3D reconstruction based on holography would no longer work as lack of reference beam.
The 3D reconstruction algorithm uses the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz transform, to reconstruct the wavefront one at a time, on several planes at various distances near the object. When the stacks of reconstructions are made, 3D image with depth information can be built.

Human Practice
Overview The aim of our project is to develop a computational tool solving pathway engineering problems with strong practicability and great interactivity. In order to achieve this goal, we did a great deal of human practices with researchers, iGEM teams and social communities throughout our project. Silver ""The most critical part of designing any solution is to understand the problem you're trying to solve."" To become that intimate with the problem, we devoted ourselves to interactive with our software’s end users -- the very people who have this problem -- to understand their workflow and how they think our solution should work. Moreover, we communicated with peers who have the experiences of developing software. From these communications, we got a great deal of suggestions about how to build a software that is user friendly, beautiful, responsive, reliable, secure, and scalable. Interview with Prof.Liu Qi At the early stage of our project, we had an interview with Prof. Liu Qi to learn about how bioinformatics could benefit the research of biology field. Prof. Liu Qi currently conducts bioinformatics research at the School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University. His biomedical Big Data Mining team (BM2, stand for Biological and Medical Big Data Mining) is dedicated to the application of evolving artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to mine high-throughput biometric data and drug data for biological problem mechanisms.
Fig. 1. Interview Prof.Liu and learn about applications of bioinformatics. During one hour communication with Prof. Liu, we learnt a lot about the applications and approaches of bioinformatics in many aspects. Here is the general information we got.
Fig. 2. Applications and approaches of bioinformatics in many aspects. Prof. Liu inspired us that development of bioinformatics software should encompass biological information acquisition, processing, storage, distribution, analysis, and interpretation that combines the tools and techniques of mathematics, computer science, and biology with the aim of understanding the biological significance of a variety of data. Biology Labs Visiting We visited some of the biology labs in School of Life Science and Technology of Tongji University to study general needs of researchers and knowledge of biosafety in wet lab. We found that most researchers view biological data from previous studies as a treasure. Utilization data rationally not only help experiment design a lot but also benefit discovery of biological mechanisms. This inspires us to develop a tool that gather, integrate and analyze data on a specific aspect in synthetic biology.
