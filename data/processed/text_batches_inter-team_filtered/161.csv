Under the induction of IPTG, L7Ae could be expressed with SpyCatcher and RFP modification and then be encapsulated into OMVs through ST/SC conjugation. OMVs labeled with RFP will be detected through HSFCM.

Figure 8 contains bivariate dot-plots of RFP red fluorescence versus side scattering (SSC) for our OMVs isolates. E. coli BL21 transfected with BBa_K2623028, BBa_K2623029, BBa_K2623030, BBa_K2623031 were incubated with OMVs-free LB culture for about 5 hours to get a 0.6-0.8 OD600 respectively, in which BBa_K2623029 and BBa_K2623031 were set as negative controls. Then IPTG was added to a final concentration at 0.5 mM and nurture the bacteria overnight. OMVs were isolated according to our protocols and then analyzed by HSFCM. It’s interesting to note that E. coli transfected with BBa_K2623030 (Figure 3c) could secret more RFP-OMVs than BBa_K2623028 (Figure 3a), indicating that ST/SC conjugation inside OMVs is more efficient with ST at the C-termini of OmpA. This result is inconsistent with the result shown in Figure 4, in which ST at the N-termini of OmpA (BBa_K2623028) has a higher efficiency to be encapsulated inside OMVs. We propose that GFP inserted to OmpA might interfere the transport of OmpA-ST (BBa_K2623021 and BBa_K2623023) to OMVs.

Incubate at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2-3 min to help dissolve gel.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn yellow.
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the Qiaquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes of >800 µl, load and spin/apply vacuum again.
If the DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection, add 0.5 ml Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
Centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min at 13,000 rpm to remove residual wash buffer.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time to up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

--Tuesday 6/14/11--
Today we tested out error-prone PCR on the LacI promoter.  We are adding MnCl2 to a few of the tubes and changing the nucleotide concentrations in other tubes.   We want to test out some different screening techniques for a rapid hunt.  Characterizing thousands, possibly tens of thousands of promoter mutants is quite a daunting task and we want to make it as easy as possible.  We are looking to using a fluorescent cell sorter on campus which could narrow down a few good candidates for more rigorous testing.
We began work on the actual wiki with some code that I (Tim) wrote over the weekend.  It works perfectly in an unrestricted webpage but once I put it in iGEM's wiki, it doesn't work.  We'll have to figure this out.    We cultured all parts and digested to check on a gel.  All parts checked out.  Sent out all hydrated parts to get sequenced.
We ligated mutants into screening plasmid to see if our error-prone PCRs had visible mutants.
Additionally, we rehydrated and transformed part C0080 (araC regulatory protein) as we had forgotten to rehydrate it on Monday.
--Wednesday 6/15/11--
Today we ordered primers for mutagenesis of LacI promoter, cI promoter and tet promoter.  They didn't have adequate overhangs on the forward primer which could make it difficult or possibly impossible to digest in order to put in a screening plasmid.  We also ordered primers to replace RBS (Bba_B0032) in Bba_E0240 to Bba_B0034.  Glycerol stocks were made of our hydrated parts.  We sent all of our parts in to get sequenced to avoid problems we've had in the past with incorrect things from the Registry.   We miniprepped and digested the parts that were cultured in order to do a rough check on a gel while we're waiting for our sequencing data to come back.
We miniprepped and digested the following parts with XbaI and PstI:

Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. The transfer curves of all seven groups are illustrated below. All values are in logarithm space. Note that for the convenience of plotting, the points where Dox=0 are plotted at Dox=0.01. (or the point will fly out far to negative infinity)
In the leftmost figure, EBFP2 without intein sequence show relatively low affinity and thus low expression level. Nevertheless, their leakage level is low as well, and Dox induction leads to approximately  fold change. As for the middle and right figures, both split EBFP2 with intein and intact EBFP2 have about  fold change when induced by Dox, but split EBFP2 have lower leakage level.
Meanwhile, if one half of EBFP is driven by constitutive promotor CMV, the leakage level remains the same but the induced multiple suffers. This is expected beforehand because with one constitutively-expressed part, the circuit can only sense the input with one half of the split proteins, thus becoming slightly less inducible.
Normalizing the curves lead to more interesting discoveries. Even though TRE-EBFP2N + CMV-EBFP2C leads to poor fold change, the transfer curve is significantly steeper when the dimerization process is reversible. This means better switch-like properties. With the presence of intein, the effect is weaker but still visible.
Normalize transfer curves to the range of 0 to 1, we can find that the shapes are different. Lines representing split proteins are later to rise and steeper.
If we normalize the initial EBFP2 level to 1, split EBFP2 with intein displays better properties than the other two settings. From fig. we can clearly see that it has the highest multiple among the three, even significantly higher than that of the intact EBFP2. The result shows that split proteins, with high binding affinity, can defeat original undivided proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," is incomplete because it does not include the protection of biosecurity relevant information such as important data or protocols. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) also states the Biosecurity relevant information in their definition. We suggest extending the definition of biosecurity as following:
Biosecurity: ""The protection, control and accountability for biological materials and their biosecurity-relevant information, in order to prevent their unauthorized access, loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release.""
Additionally, it is necessary to clearly differentiate between biosecurity and biosafety as there is a substantial difference:
Biosafety: “Biosafety describes the containment principles, technologies and practices that are implemented to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release.” (World Health Organization, 2006)
Biosafety focuses on the protection of people within a laboratory and the prevention of unintentional release of environmental or health hazards whereas Biosecurity sets the focus on the protection of laboratory material and relevant information against misuse.
While biosafety is well implemented in iGEM (e.g: Whitford,et al. Auxotrophy to Xeno-DNA: An Exploration of Combinatorial Mechanisms for a High-Fidelity Biosafety System for Synthetic Biology Applications. (2018), Zheng-jun Guan,et al. Biosafety Considerations of Synthetic Biology in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (IGEM) Competition. (2013), biosecurity is only mentioned occasionally.
Here you can access a table with all iGEM teams until 2017 that have designed a biosafety system. (Whitford et al., 2018)
Dual Use
Dual Use in the context of science describes the potential of knowledge or technologies to be used by third parties with both benevolent and malevolent intention. (European Commission, 2018)
Dual Use Research of Concern
Dual Use Research of Concern describes scientific work that is likely to produce knowledge, products or technologies that can be directly misused by third parties. (National Institutes of Health, 2018)
The Problem of unclear Definitions
To the best of our knowledge, there is no uniform international definition of biosecurity, Dual Use, and DURC. Different organizations came up with different definitions leading to confusion and different understandings. For example, in chemistry, the term ""Chemical Security"" is also referring to Dual Use issues. Therefore, it is necessary to establish international uniform definitions on suitable for further education. iGEM is the ideal platform for this purpose as its community is spread all over the world. That is why we are launching a call for international collaboration"

DISColi: 3D manufacturing platform for modular product synthesis
Systems evolved to respond to light exist throughout nature; from unicellular photosynthetic organisms, to the phototropism response in plants.  Light is an abundantly available resource, offering precise control over a system at little cost or effort, even in remote locations.
These are just some of the reasons why we have decided to exploit light. DISColi is a novel bio-photolithographic system for engineering biofilms, and the utilization of light allows the precise control needed to create functional 2D and 3D structures and devices. Such technology already has applications in fields as microfluidics, nanotechnology and tissue engineering.
Our work with light responsive constructs has allowed us to take full advantage of the modular nature of synthetic biology.  The main aims of our project can be separated into three light-controlled components: the designed sculpting of biofilms; 3D printing for encapsulation of cells; and the controlled modular synthesis of a variety of products.  We expect our technology to have applications for material synthesis and compound manufacture in remote locations, for example outer space.
System Design
The system we have designed for iGEM 2011 takes advantage of the modular nature of synthetic biology by combining relatively few parts to create a complex and highly regulated system of gene expression. This diagram shows how the biobricks we intend to create can be organised to allow for the bio-photo-lithography process.
Please take time to click our interactive diagram!
Use the switch and the different colours of light to choose which device is active! Mousing over the highlighted devices will display the biobrick constructs we have designed to perform the device functions. Clicking the Pattern Formation, Product Selection or the Structure Fixation tab will highlight the devices used for the selected stage. DEPENDING ON CONNECTION SPEED THE DIAGRAM MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO LOAD.

Day 4:
We had our bi-weekly meeting with our advisors. Chris submitted her reflective modelling essay. For the modelling, the graph depicting PG-1 concentration shows oscillations into the negative concentrations. This, however, cannot be correct. A variety of methods were deployed to see if  MATLAB’s code solver was taking inappropriate time steps at each iteration of the model, such as running the differential equation system in a different mathematical program. Also the model is going to be stopped once PG-1mRNA has reached the limit of 1e-4. to see what the values of the other parameters are at this point. Hopefully this should highlight some of the parameter values at that time. Returning to MATLAB, we decided to look at forcing the time-step for the model, to provide a smoother output. For human practices, we decided to provide graphs depicting the difference of the total advisors and the variation in awards. We also attempted to have each year side-by-side, to show the implication of the total advisors between each competition year. We also looked at different experimental methods to prove our biobrick works such methods included microscopy and staining. Sam preformed some more ligation, digestion and PCR.

We had our bi-weekly meeting with our advisors. Ogaga transformed the ligation made on Friday while Sam made another ligation and ordered some more ligase. We ran a gel on the ligation and discovered to our dismay another failure.
Day 2:
We found colonies today on the plates from our transformations but went on to discover that the ligation must have failed because the colonies were pink.

We talked about the upcoming Giant Jamboree, our  progress on the project and our motivation for choosing natural science as a career path and  applying to iGEM. You can see the article here.
.  In an effort to connect with as many people as possible, we also published a piece about our work  and techniques of synthetic biology on a popular internet platform Metina lista, which you can see here.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Traditional media is mostly aimed to audiences between 18 and 60 years of age, but we decided not  to be bound by the limitations of traditional media, and expanded our campaign to social media as  well, which is read mostly by our peers, but more and more by the rest of the public as well.  Most read was our facebook page (iGEM HS Slovenia), where we published weekly updates on our  project and interesting articles about advancements in synthetic biology we found as well as pictures  and anecdotes from the lab.  We also created a twitter account @iGEM HS Slovenia , Facebook site and a web site for sponsors and other people  interested in the details of our work.
PRESENTING TO POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS
While presenting our project to the public is indeed very rewarding, we also found it important to  explain the benefits of synthetic biology to the people who hold the most power in our country, and  are therefore most able to make a difference quickly.

Add water (volume dependent on objective) directly to the column, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min.
Transfer the column to a clean microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 1 min to elute the DNA.
Gels & Gel Electrophoresis
Reagents:
TAE Buffer
~ 50 mL per gel, more necessary for electrophoresis chamber.
NF Agarose (generally Seakem LE)
Grams of agarose : mL buffer = percentage of gel
Ethidium Bromide
~ 1 drop
**Don’t forget ladder.
Protocol (gel):
Mix the TAE buffer and agarose once measured in microwavable flask. Stir with stir bar in flask and magnetic stirrer.
Afterwards, microwave for 1-3 mins until agarose is completely dissolved.
Pause the microwave if the solution starts bubbling over, then stir the solution by slightly shaking the flask, and put the flask in the microwave again.
Let the flask cool until it is cool enough to carry with the orange heat “gloves.”
Add ethidium bromide and let gel solidify (10 - 20 min). Remember combs.
Usually, use the gel for gel electrophoresis right away, but if needed, the gel can be stored in a container filled with TAE buffer and 1-2 drops of ethidium bromide.
Protocol (gel electrophoresis):
Add reagents together (always at least ladder and sample).
This can occur in PCR tubes or parafilm.
# bp ladder - 2 uL
Loading dye - 4 uL (1:3.5 ratio)
Water - 8 uL
Sample - volume depends on objective. Remember: try to have at least 50 ng to visualize on gel.
Loading dye - 1:3 ratio with sample.
Place the gel in the gel tray in the gel electrophoresis chamber and fill with TAE buffer to max line.
Since DNA is negatively charged, the wells should be near the positive end (black) and DNA will “run to red.”
Put the ladder and sample(s) in the wells with the ladder in Well 1, etc. Close the chamber properly, and run the gel electrophoresis chamber at 100 - 130 V.
Wait for about 30 minutes before stopping the gel electrophoresis chamber and removing the gel tray.

We analyzed the data of the spectral absorption measurements versus time and compared the growth synamics and pigment production between different engineered indigoidine synthetases in interplay with different PPTases.
Controlling Indigoidine synthesis
Furthermore we co-transformed E. coli TOP10 with the lacI-Sfp-constructs and pRB22 to determine whether the indigoidine production is controllable.
The lacI-sfp-constructs were not functional because the transformed cells did not turn blue even if induced.
Instead we tried the E. coli NEB Turbo strain which overexpresses the lac repressor. In this way, leaky expression and thereby growth retardation might be prevented.
Week 23
Domain Shuffling – Indigoidine Synthetase Conversions
Besides the delH4 T-domain only the plu2642 T-domain resulted in a functional indigoidine synthetase when introduced to indC. We used our NRPS-Designer to predict the domain sequence of plu2642 and the selectivity of its A-domain and found that it is a single-module NRPS with the domain sequence A, T, TE. Its A-domain exhibits glutamine specificity, analogous to our indigoidine synthetase. Also the basic domain sequence is similar, whereas the internal oxidation domain of indC is missing in plu2642.
Another NRPS module which shows glutamine specificity is tycC2 from the Tyrocidine pathway (further described in the <a href="" https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project/Tyrocidine "">Peptide Synthesis Project Page</a>).
To take the domain shuffling experiment even one step further, we assembled every possible domain combination involving the indC oxidation domain and an A-, T- and TE-domain from indC. plu2642 or tycC2 and transform a given, naturally occuring NRPS module into a functional indigoidine synthetase.
Engineered indC – Quantitative Assay
This week we also repeated the spectral measurement of our engineered indC variants cotransformed with single PPTases to see which combination of PPTase and T-domain is most efficient in producing indigoidine.

Macquarie_Australia,2017,Team:Macquarie Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we again induced our Omega Ω E. coli and tested hydrogen production using the Clark electrode. One of the challenges with our Clark electrode is the analogue format of the readout.
Thankfully we have found someone with expertise in the area, Dr Ian Jamie, who will assist us in setting up connections to our system to record data in a digital format.
We will continue with our analogue readings in parallel to assist in estimating parameters for the digital data collection.
The twelve primers we designed to sequence our 8777 bp Omega Ω arrived this week so sequencing was set up and sent off.
HydEFG was sequence confirmed, so we did a backbone swap ligation to CAM in readiness to submit the part to iGEM.
Following this, there was a cell transformation with the newly created HydEFG CAM, followed by inoculation of overnight cultures for a miniprep. The miniprepped plasmids were then digest screened on an electrophoresis gel and behaved just as expected (Figure 7).
It appears all our constructs are completed and our focus will now move to the hydrogen production testing of our induced cells as well as demonstrating the presence of the hydrogenase enzyme using SDS page gel.
Meanwhile in the lab we tried out some cells with fluorescent plasmids in readiness for a fun activity with Chifley students. The Chifley event is fast approaching. Unfortunately, the cells were no longer viable but there is still time for us to transform new cells with fluorescent biobricks.
Figure 7. Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis of single (E) and double (E+P) digests on colony samples A, B and C. All three samples display expected band weights of ~7500bp for single digests and ~5500bp with ~2000bp double digests.  This gel indicates successful ligation of HydG and HydEF biobricks and validates the HydEFG biobrick.

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Project#Sensor#AbstractandBackground_-_-_TEXT.html," (autophosphorylation) of the partner RR. Phosphate and nitrate sensors[1].
Phosphate sensor----phoBR system[1]
The extracellular concentration of phosphate is sensed by the two-component regulatory system PhoBR, in which PhoR encodes the HK and PhoB the RR. PhoB, when phosphorylated by PhoR, would form homodimers and bind to the consensus pho-box sequence involved in the corresponding promoter and activate downstream genes expression. Generally speaking, phoBR system responds to phosphate limitation, when the extracellular phosphate concentration falls below 4 uM. Though iGEM-2008 team of NYMU-Taipei has submitted the information of that part BBa_K116401 , we couldn’t get it from MIT registry. So we have decided to acquire and characterize this part by ourselves.
Nitrate-sensitive sensor----NarXL system[2]
Similar to phoBR system, NarX serves as the trans-membrane HK and NarL serves as the RR. Once the extracellular concentration of nitrate reaches certain concentration, NarX autophosphorylates and acts as the phosphate group donor of NarL. Two phospharylated NarL molecules form a homodimer and act as DNA-binding proteins that activate the transcription of downstream genes expression. The nitrate-sensitive promoter is well-characterized by Edinburgh University iGEM Team 2009 and we plan to fine-tune that part in order to function desirably when applied to our design.
phosphate accumulation[3]
An enzyme responsible for polyP synthesis is the homotetrameric polyP kinase (PPK) ppk polymerizes the terminal phosphate of ATP into polyp. Acetate kinase (ackA) was employed as an ATP regeneration system for polyphosphate synthesis. Researchers have demonstrated Strain MV1184 containing ppk and ackA showed the highest rates of Pi removal from the medium.

Overview
In order to achieve portable and simple field allergy detection, we designed and manufactured the hardware testing equipment for this project - a small, inexpensive ($20) system, including a device can measure OD600 and fluorescence intensity, and a small automatic vibration device avoiding the sinking of cells.
The device supports battery or micro USB for power supply. According to the prompts on the display, you can get started quickly; the device will judge your allergies based on the cell concentration and fluorescence intensity after a certain period of reaction.
In addition to the detection applied to this project, this device can also be used in other environments where fast and portable spectrophotometric detection or fluorescence intensity detection is needed.
We refer to the design of Team Aachen, 2014, but our Devices are more automated and miniaturized.
Designed steps for usage
Activate the yeast.
Mix the blood and allergen, turn on our measure device (click the power button on the left).
After the time on the display is completed, or press the GO button to skip the timing, with another timer, add the serum (filter with a syringe and filter to obtain serum / if it is a hospital scene, the blood drawn from the vein can be centrifuged) and t yeast solution to the cuvette; cover with waterproof breathable membrane.
Open the lid, place the cuvette in the test hole, then close the lid, and press 'GO'.
When the display prompts, stick the vibrating device to the cuvette and insert the battery, press 'GO'.
When the oscillation time is up, remove the motor, then close the cover and press 'GO'.
Wait for the result to appear on the display.
Double-click the power button to turn off the power. Dispose of waste.

The tubes were labelled in pairs according to the strain's assigned TPA number.
150ul of DMSO solution was added to each of the 12 tubes under aseptic conditions.
1.5ml of each culture was placed into one tube in both sets of tubes (one tube for Phil's freezer and one tube for the backup freezer) according to the labelling. The cultures were mixed by pipettes under aseptic conditions.
The first set of six tubes were then placed in the -80C freezer in Dr. Aldridge's lab and the duplicates placed in the -80C freezer in a different location.
Transforming E. coli with BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076
Mathew timing the 'heat shock' step to precision
The decision was taken to abandon transformations in JM109 cells and instead to use DH5-alpha E. coli cells for transforming with BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076.
This meant that we used Dr. Aldridge's Transformation protocol to carry out this procedure. There were a few changes to the protocol:
Step 4 - the team are adding the remaining 1ul of BioBrick DNA (BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076).
Steps 2 and 5 - the waiting times were changed from 30 minutes to 15 minutes.
Step 9 - the team plated out 50ul of each set of E. coli transformants onto LB plates.
Extra Step - the team then spun down the remainder of the two sets of E. coli cells and resuspended them each into 200ul fresh LB solution (under aseptic conditions). These were then all plated on LB+kan plates.
The plates, which were appropriately labelled, were then stored in the 37C incubator for overnight growth.

STRUCTURE MODEL
STRUCTURE MODEL
Purpose
In order to confirm whether this “radar” T1R2/T1R3 can “sense” the sweetness of different sweetener, we simulated the model of receptor's structure[1] [2]. It was helpful to observe how the sweeteners binding to T1R2/T1R3 receptor visually. Moreover, we expected to find some unknown sweeteners binding sites based on this model, even some ideal sweeteners are still unknown.
Methods
To make the signal input more accurate and reliable, we simulated the T1R2/T1R3 receptor's structure model through SWISS-MODEL. Meanwhile, according to Chemdraw 2D and Chemdraw 3D, we constructed some sweetners' model. And the docking process was performed by using Autodock Vina.
Results
We used homology modeling to obtain the structure of human sweet receptor T1R2/T1R3. According to the crystal protein structure of similar receptor in mice, we only simulated ligand-binding-domain of our receptor.
Fig. 3 The simulated structure of human sweetness receptors' ligand-binding domain (LBD)
Then, taking advantage of software Chemdraw 2D and Chemdraw 3D, we established some natural or artificial sweeteners' structure.
Fig. 4 Three dimensional structure of some sweeteners
Docking process was carried out under Autodock Vina (Fig. 5-7).
Fig. 5． Docking result of different sweeteners Fig. 6． Docking result of aspartame Fig. 7． Docking result of stevioside
Discussion
Our docking results estimated that ligand-binding domain (LBD) of human T1R2/T1R3 receptors could bind with almost all kinds of known sweeteners. It provided evidence that this receptor has an ability to “taste” the sweetness. Meanwhile, our results also helped us to speculate that the number of both binding-site and binding-molecule also might influence the sense of sweetness.
However, our model still needs optimization. We plan to enhance the docking model"

The plan for the movie is to finish the script by tomorrow, record the audio on Thursday, and make the thing over the weekend. Paper animation is slowly winning out over the claymotion which, let’s be honest, would have been a real pain.
The modellers matched all this with a breakthrough of their own. Their ongoing self-taught learning of ODE bore fruit today as they successfully modelled the original toggle switch. Cesar says soon they will be ready for the real deal. We should probably make sure we have something for them to model when that time comes...
Wednesday 25th
The PCR products from yesterday were transformed into cells, and Yuma did some research into the kind of neglected population control side of our project. Philip also made the good point that it’s high time we just picked a pathway for the wiring and started transforming it in the lab.
Thursday 26th
There were some setbacks in the lab today, and it looks like the MABEL work will need to be redone. However we were able to transform yesterday’s ligations into some competent cells.
Friday 27th
Today was movie production day – the script was finished, the dialogue recorded, and Brian the bacterium was born. It took a long time.
The rest of the team cracked on with the actual science. We got some primers designed for the metabolic wires, and the lab team made some progress with our RFP construct, though they had some trouble with a PCR run.
Weekend 28th-29th
The movie was bolted together from the pictures taken and audio recorded. We may not have any metabolic wires yet in our project on metabolic wiring, but at least we have an animated movie about a bacterium called Brian.
Week 6 (30th July– 6th July)
Monday 30th
Today was a successful day in the lab, with a particularly successful miniprep being accomplished.
The video was sent off to Biofiction after a few last minute edits, and also uploaded to YouTube and Vimeo.
Population control mechanisms were discussed with Jon, who suggested using either RNAi, or a little known mechanisms for inducing quiescence in bacteria, used to make them more productive.
Tuesday 1st July
A slow day today. Some primers were designed for the metabolic wire stuff, human practices strategies were discussed (the festivals are coming up...), and we received word that the deadline for submission of movies to the film"

What we are doing differently
Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix
Bees experiments and protocols
Oxalic Acid Gradient:
In 15 mL falcon tubes, 5 mL of sulfuric acid, 2 mL of Potassium Permanganate, and x amount of oxalic acid.
The solutions would then sit for 10 minutes, being inverted every few minutes.
The optical density with a wavelength of 528 nm was taken for each falcon tube. The results were recorded.
Mite Trials:
Pouches were made using parafilm. This was done by stretching out the parafilm very thinly with the experimenter’s hands.
Using a pen cap, the parafilm was arranged so that there was a small pouch at the bottom for the mite and solution to fit in.
The pen was removed and the top of the parafilm was left open.
A Varroa mite was then placed into the pouch along with a solution such as water.
They were left overnight in the 27 ℃ incubator.
Bee Trials:
Bees were obtained from a bee hive.
The bees were then fed RFP producing E.coli with glucose and sucrose sugars. The bees were then observed to determine if they were drinking.
Mites were added to Petri dishes following a sugar shake. Paper derivatives were soaked in different treatments , water and RFP E.coli and were in the bottom of the Petri dishes.
The Petri dishes were then placed into the incubator for 24 hours at 27 ℃.
The bees were euthanized using EtOH, surface sterilized in bleach, opened using a razor to expose the gut, and placed into the shaker overnight at 37℃.
Biofilms experiments and protocols
Growing biofilms
In the lab for biofilms, our first focus was on trying to see if our team could grow biofilms. We successfully did this using the following protocol:
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µL of RFP, and 21 μL of KAN were added. This solution was then mixed more thoroughly by putting the cap on the falcon tube and inverting it a few times.
3 mL of this solution was pipetted"

Fig 9: Reducing 12% SDS-PAGE of control with pet3a, PM is protein marker.
Analysis of the UV-visible absorption spectra for the purified protein samples, revealed absorption maxima at 407 nm for all proteins (figures 10-12). Out of the three proteins MamX displayed a significant peak at this point while all the other proteins displayed 407 nm peaks at a similar magnitude to the control experiment where proteins were purified from cells lacking a Mam expression vector, presumably due to low protein concentration. The presence of a 407 nm peak in the control experiment is probably due to the ccm helper plasmid facilitating the overproduction of native periplasmic c-type cytochromes, which are binding nonspecifically to the resin.
Chemical synthesis of magnetite nanoparticels
Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were synthesised through a simple co-precipitation of a base to ferric and ferrous salts. This method used a 2:1 ratio of ferrous to ferric ions; the size, shape and composition of the magnetite depends heavily on Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio, reaction temperature, pH value and ionic strength. 1 If all conditions are standardised this method is completely reproducible but tends to produce rather"

The species-specific sensitivity of TRPV1 can be ascribed to about eight amino acids in the vicinity of TM3 ( Jordt an Julius 2002 ).
Figure 10: Molecular determinants of species-specific vanilloid sensitivity. Sequence alignment of rat (top), human (middle) and chicken (bottom) VR1 within the TM3-4 region is shown. Conserved residues are indicated by black background. The chimera V3/C contains a minimal segment of rat VR1 that is sufficient to confer vanilloid sensitivity ( Jordt and Julius, 2002 ).
We further aligned the TM3 region of the TRPV1 receptor to the ligand binding region of the native VirA receptor from Agrobacterium by the use of the tool MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation ( Muscle ).

Screening system
Development of a high-troughput screening
The screening of randomly mutagenised genes for a desired function or application is always a very time-consuming procedure ( Beaudry and Joyce, 1992 ). It requires a huge amount of material and might takes several months or even years to result in a promising new version of a gene ( Hanczyc and Dorit, 2000 ). As we faced the challenge to modify the VirA receptor in only a few weeks we designed a strategy for a fast high-throughput screening by using subsequent steps of different read out systems and a strategy with two different plasmids.
In the first step after mutagenesis of virA it is necessary to separate thousands of transformants with minor or unwanted changes in the virA gene, from few bacteria that included interesting virA variants. Thus, we wanted to construct our system to lead in the expression of a kanamycin resistance after the induction of the VirA receptor, enabling the quick exclusion of all unwanted virA variants.
For that purpose a kanamycin resistance cassette should be set under control of the virB promoter, leading in the expression of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH) that can inactivate kanamycin. The mode of inactivation is the transfer of the y-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group at C3 of the antibiotic ( Wright and Thompson, 1999 ). This phosphorylation results in the loss of binding capacity of the aminoglycoside"

Currently, no specific treatment is known. This means that for the patient it does not matter if the disease is correctly diagnosed. However, on a global health scale this is significant for monitoring the disease.
Dr. Robert-Jan Hassing mentioned that assays against obscure diseases are difficult to obtain. Most of them are stored in only a couple of locations in Europe, most notably in Marseille, France. Due to cross-reactivity with other viral diseases, antibody-based tests are not convincing enough. The current “golden standard” is the Serum Dilution Test.
Several small outbreaks of Alphaviruses have been found in Europe, mostly chikungunya in France and Italy. This has to do with increasing globalization and climate change. CHIKV shows many similarities with MAYV. It can be lethal to newborns and elderly (encephalitis) and this disease has already been found in the Netherlands. Mayaro can become dangerous when it changes vector to the Aedes mosquito which is urban dwelling and can thus reach more people. This seems unlikely at the moment but it has occurred before with similar viruses. Finally, the lack of immunity in Europe to diseases like Mayaro and chikungunya can improve likeliness of an outbreak.

From earlier conversations, we were advised to implement our device in large-scale screening during epidemic outbreaks. Is this more applicable before, during or after the outbreak? We wanted to discuss this with an epidemiologist.
Dr. Marianne van der Sande
Head of the center for Epidemiology and Surveillance, RIVM Centre for Infectious Disease Control
We found out that, depending on the disease, a diagnostic is applicable both during and after the peak of the epidemic. Predicting epidemics is hard, hence a robust diagnostic is needed to identify and monitor the spread, and to make evidence-based interventions.
We are now certain that Mantis can be applied in new epidemic situations!

Dr. Marianne van der Sande is an expert in epidemiology. She told us about the successful use of diagnostics during an epidemic. Diagnostics are continuously used throughout the progress of the epidemic. It is required to assess how it spreads and to decide on the appropriate measures that have to be taken, like treatment and monitoring. Also after the largest peak of the epidemic, when the number of cases starts to drop, diagnostics are still relevant"

Overview
A new form of green energy, based on our production of conductive nanowires from harnessing an endogenous amyloid export system in E.Coli, will soon be paving the way towards renewable energy sources in commercial products and residences.
From the very beginning we have engaged politicians and professionals in the science community towards our research, in order to develop a wider understanding of how they conceive the use of our product in the real world and its success. As you browse through our policy and practices, you will come across the interviews we conducted with these professionals and the conclusions we were able to come to.
Our continuous efforts to reach out to the public were rewarded when the University of Kent invited us to present our findings at the Stacey Symposium, a public event where we were able to reach a large audience of esteemed lecturers, investors and alumni and explain to them the importance of our work within synthetic biology and the community. This led to us hosting a public workshop, where we were able to demonstrate our work and provide AFM demos to further engage the public.
From educating and engaging the public to interviewing politicians, our human practices and outreach work was fundamental to developing our research. With this said, you can find out more below.
Interviewing Politicians
Summary
Procedure and Rationales in contacting members of Parliament (MPs)
We started by finding a list of Members of European Parliament (MEPs) from the UK and selecting the ones that deal with energy, conservation, environment or industry. Our rationale in deploying such a strategy was because we felt that they are dealing with issues that are similar to the ones we are trying to solve with our iGEM project. We have also targeted MPs and MEPs of different parties, to see if their outlook on subjects like renewable energy sources differed. The list of MEPs to target is mentioned below.
We then drafted a letter containing 10"

She knew biomedical engineering was a subject she needed to pursue when she saw a brief news report that cardiac tissue had been synthesized in a lab and was able to pulse like a human heart. Now, she wants to mass-produce synthetic tissues to replace malfunctioning ones. When she is not playing the role of a student researcher, you can find Marisa in a theatre designing lights for her next production. Fun fact: the first time Marisa traveled away from her home in Southern California was for her freshman orientation at BU. Marisa's work with the iGEM team focused on our outreach projects, including coordinating with the Living Computing Project, and editing all written work, scientific or otherwise. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.

In Kenya, there is a push to promote a “special program by the Biotechnology Development Co-operation of the Netherlands Government, the Kenyan Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, and the small-scale farming system stakeholders” (Machuka). For this collaboration to work, all three parties must work together to prevent crop failure; “quick-fixes” will not do. Scientists, with the aid of farmers, develop new techniques to improve soil health, create drought-resistant crops (and to enhance those already naturally so), and to make decisions based on not only scientific trial and error, but also indigenous experience.
In Nigeria in 2006, the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB) was established to bring together lobbyists, civilians, scientists, and industrialists to “share knowledge and experiences, make new contacts, and explore new avenues of bringing the benefits of biotechnology to…Africa…”   The goal of the forum is to not only drum up new ideas for progress in Nigeria, but to also dispel some common misconceptions about biotechnology.
Despite the successes of biotech companies and scientists in some parts of Africa, there are some heavy failures. In 2009, South Africa lost more than 80,000 hectares (approx. 200,000 acres) of corn, affecting 280 farmers. Monsanto, one of the leading firms in biotech, paid for all affected, however, “Mariam Mayet…the director of the African Centre for Biosafety… has been raising concerns about genetically modified crops for several years. Ms. Mayet declares the recent crop failures to be the most significant development in the debate over GM food. She says biotechnology has failed”.
Monsanto has defended the failure, stating that it was a simple mistake; that their seeds were underfertilized. The proverbial silver lining, however, is that most farmers affected, even spokesperson Nico Hawkins of the local farmers, states that they still support genetically modified (GM) crops. One may raise hypotheses as to why the seeds failed; as Monsanto stated, underfertilized seeds, non-responsive soil, or even the weed-killing, yield-increasing genetic alteration held unknown side effects.
Perhaps, even, education (or lack thereof) played a significant part. In the examples of Kenya and Nigeria, education was a vital part of the process; the scientists teach the farmers, and in turn, the farmers relay information to the scientists. Perhaps in the case of South Africa, education would have been"

After being accepted into Cornell in 2007 (he is currently a senior BEE major), Ben set his sights on curing all the world’s problems.  How did he plan on doing this? Well, establishing a universal dictatorship solely under his control did not work out so well, so he decided to join the Cornell Genetically Engineered Machines team instead.

She graduated as a valedictorian from Bakersfield High School in California, where it never snows, and then found herself attending Cornell University, where it often snows, making her surrogate penguin parents quite happy.   After making 3D movies of embryonic organogenesis via micro-CT (X-ray imaging) in Dr. Jonathan Butcher's lab and hanging out with the CU GEM team for almost three years, she has found that not everything can be reduced to black or white.  (Cells can fluoresce in different colors.)

When he applied to the GEM team as a freshman, the team leader at the time was hesitant about taking him on because he couldn’t handle a pipette, let alone clone stuff. However his awesomeness shone through and he was let in, which was a good thing because he has continued to be awesome ever since.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,". In order to eliminate the error brought by the different amount of cells picked up from the media, the survival rate equals the value of the number of the colonies developed on growth media after immersed in copper solution for a certain amount of time divided by that of the colonies developed on growth media after immersed in copper solution for 10 minutes. Mean values are shown in the graph. The error line stands for the standard deviation.
Fig.3-7 Picture of survival rate experiment results. Growth media: YPD. Experimental strain: S5; control strain: synX. Cells were plated onto the media after immersed in 50 mM copper solution for 10 minutes, 30minutes, 1 hour, and 2hours.
The Fig.3-6 and Fig.3-7 showcase that the survival rate of S5 is higher than that of synX after yeast cells are immersed in copper ions solutions of identical concentration for the same amount of time. The quantitative results are that compared with the control strain, the experimental strain S5's ability to tolerate copper ions has increased by 74% (1 hour), 72% (2 hours), and 698% (3 hours). It also can be extrapolated that the gap of survival rates between the mutated strain and synX strain will continue to widen as the immersion time increases. The results are consistent with the dilution assay too.
EXPECTATIONS
We are exhilarated to see that SCRaMbLE is really a feasible technology to enhance the yeast's ability to cope with adverse environmental conditions. Not just heavy metal ions, we are looking forward to seeing its future applications, be they, for example, alcohol tolerance or heat tolerance.

I am a Junior majoring in Biological Sciences at Nazarbayev University, Astana. I am planning to pursue a medical education. To be honest, I have never thought of becoming a physician until my final year at high school. It was the turning point in my life as in lives of many other school graduates; it was the time to decide. After giving much thought to my plans for the future, I realized that the profession a person chooses should be worth spending the most of his/her life. For me it is life sciences and medicine. I want to become a physician, who will be able to do clinical research, understand the disease with all the underlying mechanisms, and to be able to tackle the problem in the most advantageous for a patient way.
A person may only guess what his or her strong sides are unless he/she gets involved in various activities. That is the reason I am using all the available opportunities to improve, to learn, to practice and to enjoy. iGEM is an invaluable experience for me...

Assembly of the LuxR generator and the AiiA (BBa_K516022). We cleaved each part with XbaI and PstI (LuxR generator) or EcoRI and SpeI (AiiA). They were run on 1.2% agarose gels and extracted using QIAquick gel extraction kit. Through three way ligation, we managed to clone both inserts into the BBa_J61002 backbone that was precut with with EcoRI and PstI. We confirmed the insertion by amplifying the ligation products with GoTaq polymerase. The shift to 2Kb in lane D indicates the successful ligation reaction. We did transformations with E. coli strain DH5 alpha, and grew them on LB agar supplemented with 100ug/ml ampicilin.
August 23rd
We performed colony PCR to screen for the transformants. After 12 hours of incubation, colonies were small and appeared white, so we left them to grow for three more hours. Most colonies appeared to have the right plasmid as they remained unchanged. 14 white colonies were picked at random and used for the PCR. We observed the same band shift which is positive.
August 24th
We tried to assemble the gold sensing device (BBa_K1127008) with the LuxR/AiiA generators. Unfortunately, it was not successful. We think that the digestion could have been incomplete as bands were observed in the controls.

Today, we tried to the assembly again. Instead of the three way ligation,  we used the Rapid Assembly of Biobricks (RAB). The parts were amplified with Phusion ® polymerase and digested by single restriction enzyme (SpeI for the BBa_K1127008, and XbaI for the LuxR/AiiA generators). The digests were ligated and subjected to PCR amplification. The band is shifted in lane A that indicates"

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#SPL Section_-_-_TEXT.html," in this proof of concept and what was documented in the standard has slight differences, although the main technology was unchanged, namely the SPL. The differences will be outlined later on.
Strategy
As mentioned previously, a construct was made where the SPL was ligated with BBa_I13507 into the pSB3T5 backbone. In order to verify and illustrate the variation of the promoter strengths from the SPL, promoters with set known strengths, namely the Anderson promoter library were used in order to benchmark the different promoters generated from the SPL. To further illustrate the flexibility of the usage of SPL, two different strains of E.coli were used, namely XL1-Blue and DH5α.
The SPL per se can be illustrated as the following:
Figure 1: An SPL designed on the basis of randomizing both the spacer sequences surrounding the consensus regions (-35 and -10 regions) as well as randomizing two bases within each of the consensus regions is illustrated. N stands for 25% each of A, C, G and T, while S stands for 50% each of C and G, and W stands for 50% A and T.
Figure 1 illustrates how the SPL was designed, where the spacer sequences in-between the -35 and -10 regions, namely N17 have been randomized, where N stands for 25% each of A, C, G and T. Two bases within each of the consensus regions, have been randomized as well although to the degree that they are given a 50% chance of being their original base, this contributing towards having an unbiased promoter library instead of only strong promoters. Within the consensus regions S stands for 50% each of C and G, and W stands for 50% each A and T.
The difference between this proof of concept and what the DTU SPL standard contains is the placement of the SPL and the addition of a selectable marker, namely chloramphenicol. Primers were designed in the way that the SPL would be amplified along side the chloramphenicol resistance marker having the prefix and suffix upstream and downstream of the amplicon, respectively. Having the SPL on its own would be too short in terms of handling viability, i.e.  visualizing from gel electrophoresis on a UV image, digesting and retrieving such a small genetic fragment and obtaining a high enough yield, therefore it was more viable amplifying the chloramphenicol resistance marker with it’s own promoter together with the SPL taking care of issues in relation to handling, such as visualizing the fragment on a UV image after running the amplicon through gel electroph"

Thirdly, to test whether our riboregulator works as expected or not, we replaced the coding sequence of Cre protein with the coding sequence of mCherry protein in the input module to detect the efficiency of this riboregulator by fluorescence intensity. As to the work of collaboration wit other teams, definitely, we did help HUST-China to sequencing their promoters and did this test of promoter intensity.
Anyway, the road to success is always laborious, but we still stick to our goal and finally make it by ourselves. To us, we spent a fullest summer holiday in our college lives and even took a big step forward in our life-long career. The following are more details about our experiments.

ArtScienceBangalore,2010,Team:ArtScienceBangalore#NoteBook_-_-_TEXT.html,"rel is not against that spirit. My complaint is against the direction that spirit has taken."" MK Gandhi, The Health Guide
One of the attitudes that we would like to instill in the team is to take a critical stance when faced with the ideas and achievements of synthetic biology. What direction is the field taking as a whole? Who's vision is driving it? Is the vision realistic, or pure fantasy? Who will benefit from the technology? A critical stance will help the team to build their own vision for synthetic biology which they can then go on to communicate at the iGEM Jamboree. Perhaps they could communicate it as a song .
Codex Seraphinianus
The Codex Seraphinianus , by Luigi Seraphini is a book about an imaginary place written in a language that no-one can understand. It is a richly illustrated account of the nature and culture of this land. In the pages of the book, every assumption about how the world works has been turned on its head. A similar questioning attitude is useful when imagining what might be biologically possible. We are used to the idea that some organisms reproduce in pairs creating one or more offspring that inherit the genetic material of their parents. Could we imagine a biology where things work differently?
Navarasam
Avni gave a presentation to the Students about the concept of 'Navarasam' or the 9 emotional states.
[[Image:Navarasam.jpg]
Being a performing artist, the continuous effort one makes is to live the performance in every single moment, in the everyday and in the mundane. It seems to be a great way to live - sans duality. I was wondering how the same ethos can be translated into synthetic biology. Navarasam - the (all encompassing) 9 emotions is one such phenomena, it represents how one experiences life.
The team was probed into imagining synthetic biology as an extension of their everyday experiences. Parallely, they have their training in art and design, which equips them in creating matter and therefore telling stories through these artifacts. How about extending this experience of synthetic biology into an artifact. Artistic yet commercial? Critical yet naive?
Wednesday 30th June: Thinking about Ecosystems
One of the topics that has kept on coming up during the course of the workshop has been the subject of designing ecosystems. In contrast to the quest for the minimal cell that epitomizes synthetic biology's quest for a rational, predictable biology, the design of ecosystems requires a completely different approach.
Yashas came across a chapter in a book by Kevin Kelly about designing Synthetic Ecosystems"

Les essais pratiqués porte sur la sécrétion de facteurs d’inflammation, ou autre agent immunostimulant, au sein de tumeur. Outre son inefficacité à transduire de l’information génétique au sein de cellule d’intérêt, les vecteurs bactériens sont immunogènes et potentiellement dangereux pour l’Homme. Ce type de vecteur existe tout de même car il apporte certaines possibilités qui lui sont propres. Le vecteur bactérien peut cibler un tissu et y délivrer une protéine d’intérêt thérapeutique, il est également facile à produire et dans certains cas, selon la souche, il résiste au système immunitaire.
Dans la seconde classe de vecteurs, on retrouve les vecteurs nanoparticulaires lipidiques et polymériques.
Les vecteurs nanoparticulaires sont des systèmes colloïdaux dont la structure est généralement constituée de lipides ou de polymères, de préférence biodégradables. Les nanoparticules peuvent être de type matriciel; dans ce cas, le principe actif peut être dispersé ou dissous dans la matrice et être libéré par simple diffusion ou à la suite de la biodégradation dans l’organisme. Les nanoparticules peuvent aussi être de type réservoir, dans ce cas, elles sont constituées d’un noyau central généralement liquide entouré par une mince paroi de lipides ou de polymères dont l’épaisseur ne dépasse pas quelques nanomètres.
Les nanoparticules lipidiques ont l’avantage d’être biomimétique et biodégradable, en revanche elles sont peu stables, leur capacité de compaction avec l’ADN est 40 à 50 fois moins importante qu’un virus de la même taille et elles sont fortement immunogènes, même avec des molécules dites de « furtivité » (e.g. PEG).
Les nanoparticules polymériques sont plus stables que leurs homologues lipidiques, mais elles pénètrent moins bien les membranes. Elles ont une potentielle toxicité et sont tout aussi immunogène, même avec des molécules dites de « furtivité ».

3) Identify the essential genes in the HMF pathway
After we complete the RFP knockdown, we will begin our combinatorial knockdown of the 19 HMF pathway target genes previously identified by graduate student Iman Farasat. Using double and triple gene knockdowns, we will be able to analyze which gene or combination of genes is responsible for the functioning of the pathway. We will do this using a 2-furoic acid assay, where we will incubate all constructs in 2-furoic acid (approximately 3 g/L) and monitor their growth and consumption of 2-furoic acid over a 24 hour period. Colonies that display reduced 2-furoic acid concentration demonstrate that the pathway is still functioning – we will look for colonies that do not deplete the 2-furoic acid concentration.  The latter colonies reflect that the pathway has failed to function, and we will use these to determine which gene combinations result in this phenotype.
4) Develop a program for automated genome comparisons
5) Engineer the pathway to function in P. fluorescens and E. coli
This is a late-stage goal that will most likely not be completed before the Jamboree. Once we identify the gene(s) that are essential for the functioning of the HMF pathway, we will insert them into the E. coli genome and evaluate the action of the pathway using the 2-furoic acid assay. If this objective is completed, industry and academic researchers will be able to use our E. coli strain to produce biofuels without the toxic effects from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural killing cell cultures. They will be able to subject biomass to more intense pretreatment procedures, increasing sugar yields and the amount of biofuels that can be fermented from these sugars.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborate_-_-_TEXT.html," 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects, and present and share their projects with all the other teams. Besides the fun experience, the presentations and synthetic biology discussions with the other teams inspired us to engage in several collaborations. We hope that the rest of the attending teams were also equally inspired to collaborate with each other!
TU Delft iGEM 2017 is happy to have collaborated with the teams of Munich , Wageningen UR , NTHU Taiwan and Hamburg as well as have contributed to the surveys of UNebraska-Lincoln , NTHU Taiwan and BU-Hardware .
NTHU Taiwan
After stumbling upon the description of our project, NTHU Taiwan initiated conversations with us via Facebook. Their project also consisted in a biosensor device, in this case featuring a series of overexpressed receptors and enzymes capable of both sensing and degrading EDC’s (Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals) on-site in sewage waters. A series of Skype meetings followed, in which the usefulness of the inclusion of any of our accomplished BioBricks into their project was discussed. Initially, vesicles and TDPs were deemed potentially interesting for NTHU Taiwan. However, after a closer study of our vesicles' BioBrick by Taiwan, they came back to us with a series of points (such as the variability in the content and size of vesicles) that made us aware of  the weaknesses of our approach for packing Cas13a and TDPs in our vesicles. Such a feedback resulted important for TU Delft iGEM 2017, as it made us aware of more aspects that should be addressed and optimised in our vesicles prior to their integration in our project.
However, the collaboration changed its direction when Taiwan reported difficulties in the transformation of their plasmids.
Figure 1: Snapgene overview of NTHU Taiwan’s construct.
TU Delft offered to revise their SnapGene files featuring their construct to discard a faulty design as the issue and shared a series of recommendations on how to make their design clearer in Snapgene and  achieve transformations with higher yields.
Finally, NTHU communicated TU Delft the accomplishment of their transformation! We wish all the best to our fellow iGEMers of NTHU Taiwan and look forward to meeting them at the Giant Jamboree!

Public Opinion
The objectives of the survey
These surveys will provide information to complement our Interactive Map. It will help to understand                 how GMOs are perceived by the general public, but also how people are                 informed and whether they feel concerned about the development of GMOs.
The intended audience
Concerning the survey, the target audience is the general population in order to have                 a generalized perception of GMOs.
Translation work
We translated our survey into 9 languages to allow a maximum people to                 answer it. We made versions in: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,                 Chinese, Japanese, German, Korean and Arabic. This was feasible thanks to                 our relatives and friends help but also a great investment of our team members.
Distribution of the survey
The distribution of the survey was done through iGEM teams. They first had to complete the                 survey before sending it to their families and friends. Thanks to their help, we succeed to gather more than 100 answers for                 France and Brazil and around 80 answers for Mexico.
The type of information to produce
The opinion of GMOs according to country, age or gender
The perception of our product
The relevance of our Interactive Map.
The conditions of satisfaction
We are looking for information  to answer the major problems found by the                 already existing websites on GMOs."

Currently, the scientific community manages synthetic biology, but some applications, provided to generate significant revenues, might be developed despite the nuisance they cause. Therefore, as stated by Lluis Mir, ""it remains the vision of science and society, and not markets."" It is also important that involved researchers retain their critical thinking and continue to communicate the progress of their knowledge even if they work in an industrial or commercial context.

Intellectual properties
Thinking about the intellectual property of our project. We wanted that our treatment could be available at the lowest price. In this context, we asked about the open source development or patenting at least a part? The first option would allow any company to develop and improve it, but a private company could then patent a more rounded version of it, and impose prices that benefit the most. Furthermore, Willy Rozenbaum confirmed us that the clinical development would be very difficult to finance, ""if you can convince a manufacturer to begin the preclinical tests, you will already have protected your model because otherwise you will not find manufacturers to develop it. "" This last point would be less problematic with the second option as the funds generated by a patent would help persuading manufacturers, but access to data would be much more limited.

Bioterrorists drifts
The loss of control of living systems syntheticaly created could be intentional. The synthetic biology and the diffusion of knowledge that it puts at disposal of a large public of genomes, notably pathogenes can be modified at low cost. In the case of our DVS project,some changes could transform our vector in biologic weapon like mentionned François le Fèvre: « we can imagine that instead of target a cancer, we target neurons to send drogues that permit to weaken someone ». From 2003, a CIA report mentionned risks linked to live science development and the difficulty to limit the bioterrorism developement. It is necessary to limit access to data at the risk of slowing down progress of the knowledge in synthetic biology.

Problematics related to the DVS project
One of the objective of this meeting was to discuss some issues related to our project DVS. The general points have been mentioned above, since these point apply to the whole synthetic biology. Specifically, we examined relative risks underlying the introduction of potentially pathogenic agents in the organism.
Let’s begin with the importance of this risk. Mycobacterium avium is sometimes responsible for serious infections in humans. But,"

Human Practices
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
—Peter Carr, Director of Judging
Overview
The Peking iGEM 2016 has been focusing on current treatments of uranium pollution worldwide and how to solve the pollution using synthetic biology.
Besides the Uranium Reaper project, we did a lot of human practices as well. This page is a quick overview. If you are interested in any work, click ""learn more..."" button for results and more details.
01
311 Brigade
Visiting the Hu’nan Nuclear Geology 311 Brigade
We visited the Hunan Nuclear Geology 311 Brigade, which fights uranium pollution on the front line, to best understand the current situation of pollution abatement. Their feedback showed that they were using a comparatively high-cost, time-consuming and possibly incomplete strategy in which they buried at least the lowest-grade nuclear waste underground and grew appropriate plants on the site. All these shortcomings motivated us to figure out a better solution.

Questionnaire
Brochure
“What about U?” — A questionnaire survey
During this summer, we conducted a questionnaire survey to gather information about public awareness of uranium contamination, uranium pollution treatments and whether synthetic biology could help to solve these problems. According to the results of the questionnaire, we designed a brochure and handed it out to correct erroneous public perceptions of uranium pollution and spread basic knowledge of synthetic biology for public education. Read next Public Education section for more information.

3- Transformation Techniques: An step by step Protocol
4- Current developments in the Field: What’s coming up?
5- Our experience with the chassis and mythes debunking
6- Expanding Marchantia’s Toolbox
7- Questions!
Our team will be presenting Marchantia polymorpha, the novel chassis we have been working with. We will discuss its biology, transformation techniques, protocols and recent developments in its field. We hope to familiarize researchers and future Synthetic Biologist with this model organism and give them the tools and information they need to get started with this multicellular system.  Questions that arise from the session will be addressed, may these be practical, ethical or biological. Assisting us will be our two supervisors who are currently working on Marchantia. They will be able to provide answers to more advanced or technical questions that may arise.  We also hope to share our own experiences with the chassis; how our views evolved over the summer. Finally, Marchantia polymorpha is still an emerging chassis. We hope to investigate the tools that could be brought to the field and present the ones we have elaborated over the summer.

The feedback was a very welcomed gift that we used for adjusting our presentation. Otherwise than that, it was a lot of fun meeting the old teams and hearing their pointers on our project. They also gave us a little pep talk, which we appreciated!
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
The day before we left for Boston we had the opportunity to present our project for the whole Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) . This event was our rehearsel of the presentation, which we will bring with us in Boston. We are hoping that our presentation will inspire other students to apply for next year's iGEM competition.
The media
SDU made an informational video about us and our project, which got featured at their facebook page and on youtube. It was so much fun recording it and we had a strict focus on showing a sense of humor and making our project understandable and relatable to the public. Hopefully this video will inspire other students to apply for next year’s iGEM team at SDU.
We also made our own video, which can be seen at the Home chapter . We made the video a part of our presentation after showing it to the high schools we visited. They thought it was a great way of explaining our project in a short time. We therefore use it both as a different way of explaining as well as a resumé of our presentation.
Prospects
How would we make Bacto-Aid?
Even though we spent hundreds of hours in the lab, we did not end up standing with the Bacto-Aid in our hands in Boston. But do not worry - we got a plan for how you can end up with our bandage. On this page we will enlighten you about the next steps in our project, which we would have followed if the days contained more than 24 hours or if we had a bunch of effective minions available. These steps have to be fulfilled before we can create a full functional patch that can be used in hospitals and in the everyday life.
Making a 4 monomer silk construct
There were some difficulties with producing a longer silk construct, and whether it was due to the reproducibility of UCLA's method  or the too old streptavidin beads, we did not have the time to find out. However, the first step would then, of course, be to try the ICA method with new streptavidin beads.
As soon as a 4 monomer silk construct is produced, we would insert it into E. coli and pur"

During the time as a freiGEM team member I earned a lot of lab experience and enjoyed the time in the team. May the TALs be with you. See you.
David Fuchs
Biology is going synthetic and it's going there fast. It poses many new and exciting frontiers, so joining in on such a high profile competition as iGEM came natural. Working with people from every corner of the life science landscape and beyond was an eye-opening experience. I learned quite a bit about every facet of lab life during my time with freiGEM, which is what makes this whole endeavor so invaluable. Cheers to all.
Human Practice
Pablo Grassi
I will try to make a long story short: I obtained a bachelor´s degree in biology and I´m currently studying philosophy. I joined the freiGEM-team because of just two reasons. On the one hand, since 2010 I organize an interdisciplinary project at the University of Freiburg concerning the concept of life. In this project, I intend to combine theoretical biology and philosophy of biology to encounter the phenomena of the living. On the other hand, I specialized in the fields of synthetic biology and biochemistry during my bachelor studies. Through combination of these two aspects, the iGEM competition revealed itself as an unique chance for exploring arising philosophical questions concerning our understanding of life. I was lucky I had the possibility to be a member of this great team, which lively promoted philosophical reflection and precise thinking.
Advisors
Dr. Susanne Proksch
I have joined the iGEM team as an advisor to share my research experience with the younger team members. After studying dental medicine, and post doctoral work in Paris, I´m currently doing research on regenerative dentistry at the Clinic for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery of the “Uniklinik Freiburg”. I decided to participate in the iGEM competition due to my enthusiasm, curiosity and passion for the world of science and my tremendous thirst for new knowledge. Furthermore, it is a great experience to get in touch with the initiative, creativity and cleverness of the undergraduate students which is quite impressive. I got to know synthetic biology as a fascinating field of research and I´m really grateful for this superb experience – Chapeau freiGEM 2012!

Figure 11: The plot displayed above shows the variation in fluorescence of the transformed DH5α cells grown in LB with pH ranging from 5 to 8. Cells were transformed with GFP constructs, one of which is controlled by a strong constitutive promoter (BB1) and the other, BB3, controlled by a weak housekeeping promoter. The output from these is compared to a cell transformed with an empty plasmid (Ø Ampicillin).
Click here to see our model.
The differences found among the range of pH values were significant for BB1 (F=2.654, p=0.075) but not significant for BB3 (F=7.6, p=0.001) at a 95% level of confidence.
DH5α salinity
Regarding salinity, a major environmental factor, we also tested the stability of our Biobricks by measuring their output in increasingly salty media (Fig. 12). Again, there were no significant differences associated with salt concentration in the case of BB1 (ANOVA values: F=0.832, p=0.491) but they were significnat for BB3 (ANOVA values: F=3.149,             p=0.045).
Figure 12: Using the same approach as the previous experiment, the same strains (DH5α) were grown in mediums with different salt concentrations (LB without salt, regular LB, and LB supplemented with 1% and 2% NaCl). Fluorescence of the GFP Biobricks was measured and results normalized to the O.D.600. As before, Bb1 was significantly expressed compared to the control at values relatively independent of the salt concentration. ANOVA 95% test                   equal mean values hypothesis rejected, as explained in the text.
UV Radiation (2)
We display below the results of Biobrick behavior upon irradiation by measuring fluorescence of the surviving cells. We found out that the fluorescence was not affected by UV exposure (Figures 13 and 14), since the t-Student test for two groups and three replica showed no significant differences (BB1: t=1.011, p=0.418; BB3:                t=1.240, p=0.341)

Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies, the cost of drugs needs to be abridged if we expect to apply the updating research to clinical treatment, which may indicate the direction of our future work.
At the same time, we are very moved to see that, Ms. Guo, who was suffering from cancer, still concerned about the promotion of cancer therapy. Indeed, there exists criminals who exaggerate the new therapies with excessive or false propaganda, thus hampered the promotion of new therapies. We should also keep working to support the promotion of tumor therapy and the elimination of false advertising.

Team NJU-China tried to introduce synthetic biology to people through various ways. This year, NJU-China planned to arouse adolescents’ interest towards this new field of science by organizing lectures for high school students. After the discussion, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory. Through these activities, we successfully presented the basic information about iGEM and synthetic biology to the youth.
Figure 13. Our instructor is introducing our lab to high school students
On Aug 20th, we held a lecture to the participants of a biology summer camp held by Nanjing University, who were high school students from all over China. The presentation consisted of an introduction of iGEM, synthetic biology and our project. Most students showed strong interests in our project and iGEM. The aim of the lecture was to let students have better understanding of the applications and benefits of synthetic biology. We believe that giving presentation about iGEM to high school students, we, college students as well as iGEMers, can inspire them to think deeper about how synthetic biology can change our lives. After the talk, the students were taken on a tour to visit the laboratory where our experiments were taken.

Source Code OverView
We use C++ as our programming language, cmake to manage our project, git to reversion control , yacc and lex to build our model file input assistant tool, Qt4 to build the GUI, Oracle dbxml as our Database manager system. Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#human practice#start-up kit#report_-_-_TEXT.html," from 2008-2013
Fig 1.2 Number of teams who did human practice from 2008-2013
The graph shows the percentage change of teams who did human practice for the period from 2008 to 2013. It can be clearly seen that there has been a large increase in the percentage of iGEM teams who participated in human practice.
The percentage of teams who did human practice has risen considerably over the time period. In 2008 there were nearly 80 percent of the teams who did not participate in human practice. This percentage decreased to approximately 40 percent in 2010, and then dropped dramatically to 5 percent only after three years. Since 2008 there has been a steady increase in the number of the teams who participated in human practice, with around 20 teams increase annually.
There are multiple reasons for this phenomenon. First of all, it could be caused by the increase of interest towards human practice within the iGEM participants. With the rapid development of synthetic biology, promoting the correct information about this area of science became important. Since the main goal of human practice is to promote synthetic biology and explore different topics towards the work, students are willing to promote synthetic biology in creative ways through human practice.
Secondly, the increasing trend in human practice may have been led by emphasis on human practice by the iGEM headquarters. Human practice is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public. The value of human practice has been increasing recognized with the abrupt emergence of issues regarding bioterrorism. Furthermore, being able to communicate is as equally important as doing the lab work.  For the reasons mentioned above, the role of human practice grew in iGEM.
To sum up, human practice has become an increasingly popular destination for iGEM teams, especially in recent years.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," Initial weight of 50 ml falcon tubes and final weights of tube containing PHB in grams was recorded.
Figure 22: PHB extracted from PhaCBA-expressing cells cultured for 24 hours and inoculated with FSPS for 16 hours. PHB was extracted using TritonX-100, sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol in a series of washes and incubation. The negative control tube contained E. coli transformed with the pET29b(+) vector (without insert); this sample underwent the same extraction process as the phaCBA-expressing cells
Week 24 (Oct 16 - Oct 22)
We also began to quantify PHB produced by our E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the pET29b(+)-phaCJ. Subcultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown in 60 mL of various types media for 24 hours. Cultures were then induced with 0.1 mM IPTG to express phaC1 and phaJ4. Cultures were incubated for 24 hours and OD600 was measured. Absorbance was adjusted by diluting cultures with LB so they were all between 0.4-0.6, and nutrients and substrates were added to the flasks to allow for PHB production. The composition of each test culture is shown below:

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#human practices_-_-_TEXT.html," this year’s iGEM competition we set ourselves the goal of producing designer chitosan. In this context we are happy to say that we managed to convince the president of the European chitin society Prof. Dr. Bruno Moerschbacher from the Westfalian Wilhelm’s University Münster to visit us. His visit resulted in some crucial changes of direction in our project. He told us about his large experiences with chitosan and different chitin deacetylases he worked with.
But most importantly he experienced the passion that lies behind our project, which is why he decided to offer us his help for the duration of the project.
This dialogue we managed to establish helped us to overcome some problems we dealed with. We think that we managed to leave a lasting impression on him with the idea of iGEM. We hope he will introduce his university to the iGEM Competition.

For this years Education and Public Engagement efforts we decided to build upon tendencies we experienced in society these days. We’re talking about the trend of E-Learning and web-based interactive learning platforms. As we looked at the iGEM Community we quickly realized that there is a gap that needs to be closed. In reaction this year we capitalized on the Education part and developed a web-based interactive learning tool targeting synthetic biology and safety aspects. We invision, that the iGEM Community will use this platform to establish an interactive connection with the society through education. Additionally we hope, that the iGEM Community will take up this idea and further develop this tool. Read more

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Management_-_-_TEXT.html," technical experts to aid in engineering and prototype development of our system and in financial recording and accounting.
Research and Development
In order to develop our flagship product as well as further generations of the system, our research and development group will require individuals with backgrounds in a diverse array of scientific disciplines. For work on the biosensor component of the system, personnel with expertise in biochemistry, genetics, and microbiology will be required. Expertise will also be required in the fields of electrochemistry and analytical chemistry in order to continue work and development on the output of the system. Our team has extensive formal training and experience in these areas which will facilitate the development of this aspect of the technology.
Individuals with expertise in the fields of chemical, software, and hardware engineering will be required in order to develop the field-portable prototype device and the data transmission, management, and processing components of the system. As such, after the first research and development milestones are achieved, it will be necessary to bring on individuals with these skill sets in order to compliment our existing technical knowledge. During the initial stages of product development, our Chief Technical Officers, Robert Mayall and Maggie Renaud-Young will take the lead. Over the three years of our financial plan, we have budgeted to bring on additional individuals as skill sets are needed; namely an additional geneticist and electrochemisty in 2014 as well as an electrical engineer and a software engineer in 2015. These positions will all be compensated with salary, as outlined in the budget. As for all hired employees, we will target young, bright, recent graduates with demonstrated proficiency in order to keep costs affordable during our first five years.
Production and Quality Assurance
Once the development of our technology is further along, we will need to obtain skill sets in quality control and manufacturing. In order to develop our prototype and products, we have established a partnership with a group with expertise in manufacturing and industrial design here in Alberta: ACAMP. A not-for profit group, ACAMP is well established with a mandate of helping small technology-based businesses overcome hurdles related to manufacturing and quality assurance. As such, ACAMP will help design and implement the production strategy for our product. We feel that a strong partnership with ACAMP will help to ensure that our product will be developed in a cost effective manner and still meet the needs of our customers. Additionally, it will allow us to focus on other aspects of the business as the founding members so not have substantial experience in manufacturing design and operations. Our research and development team will work closely with the manufacturing team, in order to ensure that the required product specifications are incorporated into the final"

The size of exosomes attained ranged around 270nm. Basing the particle size and relative intensity, we also created a 3D plot for a visual explanation. Under measurement condition listed, the exosomes secreted by HEK293 cells were assayed for 2.95 E8 particles each milliliter. Then the relationship between particle number and protein was determined that exosomes in 1 ng protein were equivalent to 6277.95 particles, according to the dilution multiple (24) and protein concentration (1127.756 ng/ul) we have tested. All the data collected helped us decide the transfection dosage of siRNA and dosing of treatment prepared for animal experiment.

1.4 The iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes suppressed KRAS expression in A549 cells in vitro
We next evaluate the effect of iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes on KRAS expression in vitro. The KRAS expression level was assayed in A549 cells after co-cultured with exosomal KRAS siRNA. Non-loaded iRGD-exosomes were used as control to ascertain that any RNAi response observed did not derive from the exosomes per se. The western electrophoresis and knockdown data obtained from qPCR analysis of KRAS gene expression indicated that KRAS protein and mRNA levels both dramatically decreased in the cells incubating with iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes compared with cells treating with nude exosomes or without any treatment. This result suggests that iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes can deliver siRNA into target cells and finally reduce the KRAS expression.
Figure 6. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of KRAS mRNA levels in A549 cells without any treatment (NC), transfected with non-loaded exosomes (exosome) and transfected with iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes (siRNA-exosome) shows that exosomal KRAS siRNA can down-regulate KRAS expression in transcription level.

Overall, the sensitivity of parameters from trial and error is generally low. The bi-stable-related parameters' sensitivity indicates that the bi-stable model, which is the core in the circuit, is very stable. With all of these facts, we have concluded that this model is reasonable.

We also wanted to interview people who have or have had acne in order to understand how the condition has affected their life and whether they tried to get rid of it. It was heartbreaking to learn what a huge affect acne can have on someone's life. The people suffering from acne where willing to go through many side affects and spend a lot of money to get rid of acne.
To get a better representation of our customer base, we conducted an online survey to find out how acne affects people's well-being and what they are willing to do to treat the condition. We got 193 responses in total. The answers were based on self-perception and personal opinions of our respondents.
At least 45 % of our respondents had had acne for more than 1 year. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a need for continuous treatment. Almost 6 % respondents had been suffering from the disease for over 10 years from when most of them had turned young adult age till they were 30+. Over-the-counter medicines are the most common form of treatment (almost 60 %). However, they might have been used as secondary treatment on top of topical antibiotics (~40 %), oral antibiotics (33 %) or retinoids (~16 %). People spend an average of 270 € per year for acne treatment, where as severe acne treatment costs can exceed 4000 € per year. At the same, a great fraction of the respondents (~75 %) would not mind adding another product to their daily skin-care routine. About 80 % said that they would use a product containing ingredients produced with genetically engineered bacteria. We also asked people about four potential topical products containing an antimicrobial agent. Their preferences were as follows: cream for daily use (41 %), face cleanser to use every now and then (26 %), exfoliating pad (17 %), and overnight face mask (13 %).
Based on the survey and interviews, it seems that the treatment could be continuous and an over-the-counter product. Being cheap might be a considerable advantage and adding another product to our customers' skin-care routine would hardly be a problem, even if it contains ingredients that have been produced with genetically engineered bacteria. This was very encouraging for our product design, but an exfoliating pad and an overnight face mask seemed to be a lot less popular options for daily use than a cream or a face cleanser. Those were the two"
