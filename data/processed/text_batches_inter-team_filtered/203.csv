I am Lai Peng from team SIAT-SCIE.I am in charge of the design of our website and some illustration. I like this kind of work from the bottom of my heart, maybe that's because I am an art student. This is the first time I have ever tried web design thus I will try my utmost to learn more knowledge about web design and synthetic biology to make our website more elaborate and special.
I am Huantong Chen from team SIAT-SCIE. I am one of the members who were mainly in charge of the wet lab work. Being a senior member in the team, I will contribute as much knowledge of synthetic biology as possible to our project. This is the first time that I do such a lot lab work, and I hope I can get invaluable experience during the work and together, we can accomplish our exciting project.
Hi, I’m Zeng Junyi. I like shrikes and bubble milk tea without sugar. I joined the team aiming to work in the lab but ended up making illustrations for the website. Anyway, It has been a pleasure working with my team members - they’re brilliant in their respective fields and I thank them for enduring my stupidity at times.
Hi, I'm Alexis. This is my first experience with iGEM, I couldn't be more excited about it. Throughout the preparation of the competition, I have learned much more about genetics and got to know this magnificent micro world. Later the experiment part provides us with a perfect opportunity to put the knowledge we learned into practice, therefore I have the chance to study how to use the precise instruments.  I believe that we are going to have an unforgettable experience with iGEM.
I joined the IGEM Club in our school one year ago and learn some basic knowledge of DNA Structure and central dogma. It was not until a few months ago I first entered the laboratory and began the practice. Doing experiments can be very time-consuming, I’ve experienced many times that whole-day effort being ruined by a tiny mistake.However, when we finally saw the desired result, all our effort paid off. The whole procedure and that sense of achievement motive me to keep on walking on this biological way.
I am Wendy in our SIATxSCIE iGEM lab group. As an inexperienced newcomer, I am still doing some very light works in the lab, mainly serving as a helping hand for the other seniors on"

Cystic Fibrosis
An Autosomal Recessive Disorder
What is Cystic Fibrosis?
Symptoms
Physiological aspects
What is Cystic Fibrosis?
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-threatening inherited diseases, primarily affecting populations of white Caucasian descent such as those of Europe, North America and Australasia (Table 1). CF affects about 1 in 2,500 newborn babies in the UK, where the population of CF patients is in excess of 10,000. CF is an autosomal monogenic recessive disorder for which there is no cure at present.
The mutated gene responsible for this disease was identified in 1989 as the Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, found on chromosome 72. Over 1000 disease-associated mutations of this 1480 amino acid protein have been described3 (see Table 2 for some common mutations). Some mutations result in severe disease impacting many organ systems, while other mutations produce milder symptoms. The most common CFTR mutation, accounting for approximately 70% of all mutant CFTR alleles, is the ΔF508 mutation: a single phenylalanine amino acid deletion at position 508 in the protein3.
The CFTR gene product regulates and facilitates the transport of electrolytes across epithelial cell membranes. CF patients have abnormalities with chloride conductance in and out of cells. The mis-folded CFTR protein is"

Tsinghua,2010,Team:Tsinghua#project#outline_-_-_TEXT.html," the second module in our project is aimed at selection of specific antibodies. Due to the maturity of existing antibody screening technique, our work mainly focuses on imitation of mammalian antibody selection, thus providing possible alternatives for existing methods.
The outline of our ideas is to find mechanisms similar to in vivo antibody selection and take in,to account the industry production costs, controllability and reliability, thus developing new methods for antibody selection. In fact, in mammalian system, antibody selection is achieved through the activation of B lymphocytes and thus the rapid proliferation of the B lymphocytes that express the specific antibodies that bind to antigen. Simply put, the whole process relies on the interaction between antigen epitopes and membrane integral immunoglobins.
To mimic the activation mediated by membrane integral immunoglobins, we develop ToxR-mediated transmembrane activation signal system. In this system, the interaction between antibodies and antigen triggered downstream expression of reporter genes, thus providing signals for selection.
PLEASE refer to ‘ToxR-based Transmembrane Signaling Pathway Method’ for detailed description of this method.
In addition, we develop a technique called ‘Bacterial based Microarray’ for selection purpose. In this method, we combine membrane display technique and high throughput microarray technique, that is, a bacterial based microarray method.
PLEASE refer to ’Bacterial based microarray’ for details.
In order to find methods for antibody selection, we cooperate with other iGEM teams. For example, we talked with Macquarie_Australia iGEM team about the project. The techniques involved in their project might be useful for our selection methods. Therefore, members from both teams worked together to research on this problem.
PLEASE refer to this 'link' to learn more about our cooperation.
Antibody Coding Gene Recombination, also known as V(D)J recombination, somatic recombination, is a mechanism of genetic recombination in the early stages of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptors (TCR) production of the immune system. V(D)J recombination nearly-randomly combines Variable, Diverse, and Joining gene segments of vertebrates, and because of its randomness in choosing different genes, is able to diversely encode proteins to match antigens.  Our system is aiming at imitating this recombination process, using E.coli as the gene carrier. It is known to all that regional genes (V, D, J) are flanked by Recombination Signal Sequences (RSSs), and the recombination occurs when VDJ recombinase are expressed. We choose RecA enzyme to induce the recombination"

Sap-like Medium (250 mL) (see references):
2,5g de tryptone
1,25g de YE
2,5g de NaCl
Glucose : 1,175g
Fructose : 1,125g
Sucrose : 0,125g
Inositol : 0,084 g
Fungicide test: in planta assay
First step
The first step is related to the inoculation of SubtiTree in plants through stomata (opened in wet condition).
We diluted our bacterial samples to get two concentrations:  5.106 and 108 bacteria per mL. The WT and transformed bacteria are introduced into plants (a control test without bacteria is performed). Thanks to a 1 ml syringe (without needle), the plant was injected with bacteria by pressure. Five leaves of each plant were used, marked with a marker point. It is necessary to repeat the operation on both sides of the leaf and the excess is wipe off. The plants are placed in a growth chamber (phytotron) to control light, high humidity, temperature and bacterial non-proliferation. Bacterial growth in the plant is left for 24 h.
Second step
The next step begins with the preparation of the fungal samples. Fungal culture is crushed and mixed with PDB (Potato Dextrose Broth). Then the mix passes through a 100 µm filter (to remove large aggregates) and  through a 40 µm filter. The caught hyphae are mixed with PDB for 24 to 48 hours until it reaches an OD of 2.5 at 600nm. The previously seeded leaves are taken from the plant using a scalpel and placed in boxes above wet absorbent paper (leaves are kept alive for a week). Above each leaf, 5µl of the fungal suspension is deposited (using beveled tips because it is too viscous). As control, we kept inoculated leaves without fungus and leaves with only fungus. Pictures are taken at different times. All the plants are destroyed by autoclaving.

Northwestern,2013,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," financial sensibility by decreasing the value of the starting materials.
Day 8, June 26
Today, the team focused primarily on oral health and tried to come up with several ways to attack biofilm formation in the mouth. The ideas that were discussed include engineering V. Parvula to upregulate lactic acid metabolism, introducing the CovR pathway to disrupt biofilm formation, and using the L-Arginine pathway to produce ammonia. The team also created CCMB solution.
Day 9, June 27
The team learned how to make plates (created 40) using CB antibiotic. The team continued to talk about the three ideas, trying to discover anything that will make the project feasible. The primary hurdle is the mechanism to import lactic acid from outside the cell.
Day 10, June 28
The transformation failed, and no cells grew on the plates. The professors pointed out that the upregulation of lactic acid uptake would disrupt the redox balance within the cell, causing the key enzyme lactate dehydrogenase to work in reverse. However, the team has decided that the project for the summer will involve oral health.
Week 3
Day 11, July 1
The team redid the transformation experiment again. This time, all glassware was washed to make sure they are free of detergent. The team prepared for the meeting with professors by trying to flesh out the idea as much as possible.
Day 12, July 2
The cells did not grow once again. The team divided lab space in preparation of the next phase of the project where each member will have more independence. The team is focusing on pH sensor since that appears to be the common mechanism in all of the ideas that were brought up. To add an extra layer of complexity, the team will incorporate the idea of a ""dual promoter"" into the design.
Day 13, July 3
The team redid the transformation once again. Most of the materials used is store bought to eliminate any possible errors. Prior to leaving for the break, the team is brainstorming on a list of possible mechanisms for the pH sensor.
Day 14, July 4
The team came in just to check for the results of the transformation. Yet again, no cells grew.
Day 15, July 5

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."
Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html," such as melnin, which gives skin color. From here I thought that we could via our bacteia on the skin introduce the lacking melanin to the keratinocytes, hence in a short time period giving skin color.  :)
Nina: Our aim is to have our bacteria on the skin to produce the missing melanin in vitiligo skin as a fusing protein with a cell penetrating peptide, thus passing into the skin layer (epidermis) and entering the “empty of melanin“ keratocytes. This will result in giving a vitiligo skin back its color somewhat directly (matter of days maybe, depending on how much melanin our bacteria produces and enters the target cells ->keratocytes). This approach of allowing for repigmentation to occur will help many people in a short time (compared to current techniques, taking 6 -12 months). Additionally, the vitiligo skin will be more tolerable against UV-light thanks to the bacteria produced melanin entering keratocytes.
Nina: We have found an article about transgenic e.coli producing one type of melanin. Hopefully in the future one might by research find a color spectrum of different pigment molecules (melanin) that will match to different people’s skin color.
“Melanins are polyphenolic heteropolymers with a wide range of colors and applications. Due to their chemical composition, melanins have physicochemical properties that allow them to act as ultraviolet absorbers, cation exchangers, drug carriers, amorphous semiconductors, X-ray and γ-ray absorbers, and in some instances, substrates with antioxidant and antiviral activity (Riley 1997; Lagunas-Muñoz et al. 2006). Bacteria are known to produce 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-melanins, the pheomelanins or eumelanins, and melanin-like pigments that are derived from non-nitrogenous phenols (the allomelanins or pyomelanins; Gibson and George 1998).” - Characterization of a Deep-Sea Sediment Metagenomic Clone that Produces Water-Soluble Melanin in Escherichia coli p. 125

PAHs can also be produced from various vehicles, such as cars and buses, due to the burning of fossil fuels and will eventually end up in sewages, streams, biogeochemical cycles, and groundwater reservoirs. These detrimental compounds can then be pumped from the ground or other water sources and treated via our sponge vat method.
Spills of crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar that are deemed unusable can now be contained and treated through ex-situ methods in groundwater reservoirs and ocean spills. The general method being used today with leaked substances is to harvest them where possible and burn them for energy. However, this method is not the most beneficial as the majority of the oil will not be picked up and often ends up harming the ecosystem of the surrounding environment.
Crude oil detoxification has been shown to be significantly improved by our bacteria through our results, exemplifying the practicality of our project design.
As demonstrated, significant growth and degradation has been recorded for Pennsylvanian, Ecuador, and Saudi Arabian oil. Please look at our results page for more.
We have conducted a series of degradation experiments to measure the efficacy of the newly engineered strains containing optimized synthetic phenanthrene and fluorene degradation pathway, demonstrating the bacteria's ability to harness the PAHs as a carbon source and ultimately degrading the compounds. These bacteria can be incorporated in oil spill remediation and bioreactor use as commercial product, achieving detoxification through combinatorial genetic bioremediation.

This model will quantify the amount of GSR delivered to the lens over time, as new eyedrops are periodically applied.
Single Dose
Noyes-Whitney Equation
The Noyes-Whitney equation models the rate of diffusion over time through a diffusion layer, which will be the nanoparticle surrounding the drug, GSR. The following is the Noyes-Whitney equation. If chambers x and y are separated by diffusion layer z, then
$$\frac{dC_x}{dt}=\frac{DS}{V_y h} (C_y - C_x)$$
where Cx is the concentration of the drug in chamber x, Cy  is the concentration of the drug in chamber y (assume our drug is 100% soluble), which is across the diffusion layer z from chamber x. Vx is the volume in chamber x, h is the thickness of the diffusion layer z, D is the diffusion coefficient, S is the surface area of the diffusion layer z.
The diffusion constant is defined as follow:
$$D = \frac{k_b T}{6 \pi \mu r}$$
where $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, $\mu$ is the viscosity of the surrounding solution, and r is the radius of the nanoparticle (Fraunfelder 2008).
Differential Equations
$$\frac{dC_{in}}{dt}=\frac{DS}{V_{out} h} (C_{out} - C_{in})$$                                              $$\frac{dC_{out}}{dt}=-\frac{DS}{V_{in} h} (C_{out} - C_{in})$$
From these equations, we get the change in GSR concentration both inside and outside the nanoparticle.
Protein Degradation
All protein degrade over time, and the amount of degradation is proportional to an decreasing exponential function of time. Outside the nanoparticle, protein are degrading. We can apply a decay function on the outside concentration function from the differential equation, to estimate degradation. The turnover rate of the aqueous humor is about 16% per minute, so we expect the degradation factor to be on the order of -5. We define a new function, concentration of GSR outside nanoparticles adjusted for degradation, as a function of time.
$$C_{oa}(t)=C_{out}\cdot e^{-"

A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Justification and happiness
Working with GMO’s leads to thoughts about justification: how can one morally justify the methods and the results? Bioethics handles the questions by supplying the foundation for the discussion. It derives from theories about normative ethics and medical concerns and has then specialized in the questions which rises in working with modifying organisms. In the field of bioethics there is different ways to justify the work and different types of arguments, depending on which area one works with and what problem one tries to solve.
In our project we have focused a lot on antibiotic resistance and plastic pollution as a problem in the community and environment. The general argument for justification we use, is an appeal to utility. This means that the work we do aims to increase the overall happiness and utility, which are seen by utilitarians as the most important factor to value actions by. This also makes us ‘proactivists’ which means that we look upon new technologies with a positive mind KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik.  In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Composite Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Composite parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on)."

Due to cleavage at the golden gate sites removing the recognition sequence, we were able to undergo the whole process of digesting and re-ligating with all three BioBricks in a one-pot reaction.
Alongside the personalised cut sites, primers were designed. These primers contained additional bases that are complimentary to the consecutive gene insert, including the BsaI cut site. This ensures correct annealing and ligation of our inserts into the expression vector.
By cycling the temperature of the reaction between 16⁰C for digestion and 37⁰C for ligation we maximised the chances of the full cluster being formed. This vector was transformed into E. coli (transformation into Shewanella via conjugation requires transformed E. coli) and successful colonies were observed. Inoculations were made, incubated, mini-prepped and our purified constructed vector was DNA sequenced to confirm our cloning was successful.

Biological Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM. I've mostly been helping out the undergrad supervisors with their arbitrary needs, so I've been a part of the TALEs, Ferritin and Linker teams. I've loved the opportunity to work in a lab, this is my first year doing so independently. Later in life I hope to become an optometrist, looking into people's eyes is one of my favourite pastimes. When not in the lab though, I am doing other fun activities like reading, hanging out with my friends and soaking up as much vitamin D as I can before winter comes!

TU-Eindhoven,2016,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Team#Advisors_-_-_TEXT.html," Subsequently, he moved to the Biomodeling and Bioinformatics group headed by prof. P. A. J. Hilbers at the Department of Biomedical Engineering (TU/e), studying self-assembling systems from a computational perspective. He also became assistant professor at this department in 2010. In 2013, Tom de Greef was a visiting scholar in the group of Prof. D. Weitz (Harvard) working on protein affinity screening using droplet microfluidics.
Current research themes are centered on the engineering of artificial cellular systems (bottom-up synthetic biology) with the aim to rationalize physicochemical design principles of biological systems and to develop novel biotechnological applications. In this multidisciplinary work he combines his fascination for (bio)chemistry, mathematical modeling, microfluidics and complex systems. In 2012 and 2013 he was awarded a VENI and an ECHO-STIP grant respectively by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO). He is also core member of the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS).
prof.dr. M. (Maarten) Merkx
Prof. dr. Maarten Merkx is a researcher at our university. Not only does he conduct an interesting research about protein sensors, he also takes the time to lecture students at our university, including our team members. This year he is giving our team critical advise on how to achieve the goals we strive for. For a more extensive biography, click the arrow:
Maarten Merkx (1970) studied Physical Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Radboud University Nijmegen (cum laude). He did his PhD with Prof. Averill (University of Amsterdam) working on purple acid phosphatases, and subsequently was a Human Frontier of Science Program post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Lippard (MIT) studying methane monooxgenases. Currently he is professor in protein engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
An important research theme is to develop generic engineering concepts for the development of protein-based switches, which include fluorescent sensors for intracellular imaging of metal ions, photo-switchable proteins, and protein-based sensors for antibody detection. He obtained young investigator grants from the HFSP and NWO (VIDI, 2006) and an ERC consolidator grant in 2011. In 2012 he received the award for the best TU/e teacher at the master level.

OD600 was read at the indicated time points and media only (LB) was taken away as background signal.   In addition to this a qualitative assay as performed. 9 mL mCherry bacteria were transferred into 300 mL of autoclaved SRF in LB, which were placed in a shaking incubator at 37°C. After 2 days 200 µL of this solution was plated out on chloramphenicol plates, this was then repeated a week later to gauge whether or not the bacteria were still alive.  To show that the MG1655 could grow on waste solely, they were grown in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and autoclaved waste. In 100 mL PBS + waste, 1 mL MG1655 mCherry E.coli were added. They were then grown in a shaking incubator at 37°C and samples were plated after 2 days and 6 days.

We are changing the pelB secretion tag to OsmY-fusion partner for better secretion
As seen in the Western Blot results, some of the enzymes designed for secretion were not secreted. These proteins may have been stuck in the periplasmic space. Thus we are optimising enzyme secretion by building a new construct with OsmY BBa_K892008 fusion for secretion. OsmY is naturally secreted from E.coli and will carry our PUR esterase enzyme with. Once in the culture medium, we think that the enzyme is going to be functional in the fusion form but we included a TEV site in between the domains that can be cleaved by TEV protease if needed.
The linker sequence we have designed between the domains is T G S E N L Y F Q G S"

You can download our windows version game.
Then the players can control Csy4 to cleave RNA chain in the right order and right place. The player's operation simulates the process of Csy4 protecting host from external damages. In that way players can not only enjoy our game < Csy4 GO!> but also learn about some functions of Cys4. Once the game starting, RNA chain will roll with the background at a certain speed, so the players should move fast enough to make sure Csy4 won't be touched by the top of screen.
Fig.19 The logo of < Csy4 GO!>.
3.2 Purpose of our game
As is known to us, the mechanism of endonuclease Csy4 in microorganisms is difficult to observe with our eyes straightly. But now < Csy4 GO!> solves this problem successfully. The game presents a microscopic view of the world with a more vivid picture. In this way, we can tell the story of Csy4 as well as the CRIPSR system to more amateurish people, thus achieving the goals of propagandizing our project and synthetic biology.
3.3 The designing process of our game
3.3.1 The game started:
At first, we planned two game blueprints. The first is to control Csy4 to specifically cut RNA, which can explain the principle of Csy4. To make the game more interesting, we created the second one. The second is to control Csy4 moving on the RNA chain. To get the destination, they need to cleave on the certain site and keep falling.
Fig.20 The background of < Csy4 GO!>.
Having discussed in our team, we created the general design of our game. Given that no professional programmer in our team can take charge of this work, we asked Mingjie Shen for help, who has the experiences of programming mini-games .  In our first blueprint, we characterized Csy4 the ability of cleaving the RNA by recognizing certain three base sites instead of cleaving RNA by recognizing the hairpin.
Once the game started, there will be some golden coins suspending on the screen, and several kinds of RNA structures which are shown in pictures and rolling at the bottom. We hope that players can put the RNA structures on the proper position, use the certain keys to cleave the RNA and fall down, gather the golden coins and arrive the destination eventually.

2.1 Guiding XJTU-China
XJTU-China is participating in iGEM for the first time this year. As the first team to participate in iGEM in     Shaanxi Province, we were invited to Xi'an Jiaotong University to accord them with guidance and experience sharing.
As follows what we have shared during the exchange are listed:
label Our understanding and analysis of iGEM.
label 2016 and 2017 projects of our team and the competition planning for 2018.
label Entry experience and precautions.
label Team operation mode.
The participation of iGEM for two years has rendered it clear for us to understand what iGEM is about and what iGEM     entails us to do. By sharing our comprehension of iGEM, we believe that XJTU-China will be able to suit the     competition much faster. We gave them a reference for this year's competition by sharing our previous two-year     entries and this year's plan. We summed up the lessons learned from the past two years’ preparations and some easy     mistakes for them, hoping that they will take fewer detours. Funding has always been a headache for most teams     participating in iGEM. We shared with them how our team works to save as much money as possible and get more     funding.
In the later discussion, we:
label Answered their questions about participation and registration.
label Talked over the idea of their project in the preliminary stage and put forward     our suggestions.
label Gave advice on scheduling and personnel management.
XJTU-China also made some suggestions for our project and planning this year.
Afterwards, our two teams also invited NWU-China to co-establish a WeChat group hence more close exchanges and     cooperation in the future.

The diffusion through the walls of blood vessels
The movement in Y is the distribution of phages in the blood (j(n)). It depends on the equation of diffusion of a particle (n) in a fluid (Fick's Law).
With n the number of particles (phages), grad n the difference between the concentrations and D the diffusion coefficient. The cellular distribution of vectors within the blood vessel and then through the wall is a phenomenon of diffusion with output. So, there will always be a strong gradient of concentration of phage in the blood. We can therefore say that the gradient is constant (equal to 1) over time. Thus the diffusion rate (j(n)) is equal to D.
Dispersal area of phage
When we combine moving Y (diffusion rate) and moving in X (blood flow velocity), we obtain, after integration on the perimeter of a blood vessel, the action surface of cell vectors . Then, we are able to determine the number of cancer cells per 100 cell vectors destroyed or 1 tissue vector .
The diffusion rate of the cell vector is equal to 0.5 μm.s-1 and the size of a capillary blood is 10μm in diameter. The particle farthest places so 10s to reach the vessel wall.
With this dissemination length (10s), the blood flow velocity (1x10 ^ 3μm.s-1) in the capillaries, and the surface of one cancer cell (1 micron square), we can determine:
The length (L) covered by the cell vectors released by one tissue vector .
The surface (S) occupied by phages in blood vessel diameter of 2r.
The amount of cancer cells available.
L = 1 x 10^4 µm 2r = 10 µm S = 2 x π x L r = 31.4 x 10^4 µm²
Thus, a tissue vector can potentially target more than 31 000 cancer cells, yet it has that 100 cell vectors . We can make a simplification to say that 100 cell vectors destroy 100 cancer cells. The efficiency of the dispersion is complete.
For phage, once reached the wall, comes in the cellular internalization. This model responds to two courses of action.

Hello, I’m Sydnee! Once upon a time I thought I was going to be a psychologist, but then I decided science was a lot more fun. This is my second year being involved with iGEM and I am enjoying my time working on human practices.
Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Human Practices
Our story this summer was a tumultuous adventure consultation and rebuilding.  We had the initial idea of building a pathogenic E. coli detecting system in the early part of the year.  Taking it from a mere idea to an actual system with a prototype took lots of communication and even more PCRs.
Tracking back to the beginning of the year in our home province of Alberta we had just seen another enormous recall of beef that was contaminated with E. coli O157.  It had resulted in many deaths and even more cases of illnesses, and showed to us that the industry might have a challenge we could fit into.  We did a bit of research into the industry and got a feeling for how current methods worked on paper for detecting E. coli.  But to get a real sense of how the industry works we decided to talk with people who are actively involved in it every day.  The first person we spoke to was Bob Church, a rancher in Alberta.
Infographic Goes Below
*Insert inforgraphic*
Informed Design
Early on in our project we realized that we really needed to understand how the beef industry worked and who all the players were within it.  We needed to understand the industries culture.  To do so we reached out the first link we could think of. Our families, where did we get our meat from?  There is nothing more personal than the food we eat and understanding the last step in the long chain tells us a lot about the first step.  Speaking of that first step,

In the afternoon, Lauren, Lily and I headed over to the Museum of Science for their Building with Biology Event training.  Building with Biology is an event for scientists and the public to have open conversations about the synthetic biology field and its applications, and clear up public misconceptions.  It’s exciting to be helping out at this event and continue working on public perceptions of synthetic biology.  There are a lot of prominent synthetic biologists presenting at the event, including Natalie Kuldell!
7/22/2015: Day 37
Casey sent us the art for message templates-- a way for us to communicate with the user what their next step is!  We created the bubble-like messages and added them to the screen, we feel excited and ready to be testing with some high school interns at noon!
When the interns came in to play around with our exhibit, they were definitely excited by the premise and platform of the project-- they liked making different combinations of genes, but without the animation of the plasmid entering the bacteria they found it difficult to understand the actual scientific process that the tangibles represented.  Will be making changes to make this process more transparent.
7/23/2015: Day 38
We spent this morning focused on debugging, and figured out how to make the marker recognition more consistent and reliable.
Today was a big day in terms of user testing-- the MIT/Wellesley Upward Bound program of fifty high school students visited our lab and interacted with our prototype in groups of four or five.  It was a wonderful experience-- it was very helpful to see how people first approached the exhibit and what questions they had along the way.  We learned that we definitely need more explicit instructions and labeling of items on the screen, and also discovered a bunch of new bugs that had never showed up before!
With learning all of this new information and finishing the last week before the poster session and when we leave, we are realizing how much work there still is!  It’s really crunch time: we listed everything left to do and divided it over the last days of work.  We’re ready to come in tomorrow fresh and ready to redesign.
7/24/2015: Day 39

The main goal of this setup is to show that; Toehold-GFP doesn’t give fluorecence alone but if it comes together with Trigger RNA, GFP fluorescences. GFP production is also IPTG-dependent.
For the purposes given above, we made liquid culture of two different bacteria together; bacteria including only pColA-Toehold-GFP plasmid and bacteria including pCola-Toehold-GFP and PSB1C3-Trigger RNA. We incubated these bacteria in liquid culture for 13 hours at 37C and added IPTG into their mediums at 13. hour. After adding IPTG, we incubated them for more 3 hours at 37C. At the end of three hours, we firstly measured GFP fluorescence of the grown cultures by using VarioScan device.  The results of measurements are given above. They were made twice.
When the results are analyzed, it is obvious that Toehold-Trigger RNA parts gave very high amounts of flourescence together while Toehold-GFP part gave flourescence in a very low amount. There is almost 15 times difference between these two fluoroscence amounts.  This proves that Toehold-Trigger system works successfully. Also it is shown that systems work IPTG-dependently.
The graphs of measurement results are given below. The difference between two systems can be observed clearly.
Figure : GFP flourescent measurrement in LB mediums.
We also observed the liquid cultures under the fluorescence microscope.
Figure 2: Flourescence microscope image of GFP producing E. coli.
For better results, we isolated protein and we fluorimetrically measured them. Firstly we centrifuged the liquid cultures which were incubated for 16 hours. We took pictures of tubes after centrifugation, they are shown belown.
Figure : Pellets can be seen after 16 hours of liquid culter precipitated.
We applied Standard protein isolation protocol after this centrifuge and managed to isolate protein from the occured pellets. We made GFP fluorescence measurement with VarioScan from those isolated proteins. The results of measurements are shown below.
The measurement results of isolated proteins indicate that Toehold-Trigger system works very efficiently. GFP fluorescence amount of Toehold-trigger RNA including bacteria is about 175 times more than only Toehold including bacteria’s. also the leak of this system is almost negligible. In the absence of Trigger RNA, Toehold’s GFP fluorescence is almost zero. This indicates that our system works"

GUANAJUATO CITY
1. First meeting of synthetic biology in Mexico (Guanajuato, Gto. August, 5th.)
    On August 5th, Team Guanajuato_Mx hosted a MeetUp in Guanajuato City. Four Mexican teams attended our invitation: TecCEM, Tec-Monterrey, Pumas_México and Tec-Chihuahua.
    This was a great chance to share our projects not only with other teams, but also to public in general. Several students from nearby cities (León, Celaya, Irapuato, Silao) joined the event where they had the chance to get involved a little bit in the field of synthetic biology.
    It was a very enriching experience since we all received feedback from both experts and members of other teams.
    PhD Agustino Martínez, our invited researcher, gave us a speech about the projects he is currently working with and at the end we have a round table where we discussed some issues synthetic biology is facing nowadays.
    Afterwards, during the evening, our guests could just relax, explore and enjoy all the wonders of this beautiful city.

2. Letting us know in “Clubes de Ciencia México” (Guanajuato, Gto. August, 6th.)
    Every year during the summer, science clubs are held in Guanajuato city. During one week, students learn about an specific topic, coached by whether Mexican or foreign students from prestigious universities from the USA, for example, Harvard and the MIT. It is an honor for us to say that our members"
BIOSINT_Mexico,2016,Team:BIOSINT Mexico#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". Fortunately for both teams, we were able to be in contact and because BIOSINT_Mexico did have its kit, with great spirits was given them the necessary material, to perform their Interlab Experiment and still participate in the study.
That was how Guanajuato_Mx began working to achieve its mission, were later presented other problems, some doubts were clarified between both teams to get results. Finally, although it was a mutual effort to achieve results, different conditions make it impossible to get them; however, the collaboration was always the best intentions of continuous improvement between the teams.
Guanajuato_Mx, thank you for allowing us to work with you and make us participants in these activities, It will be always a pleasure to participate in this kind of stuff whose sole intention is to spread the knowledge in the best way possible, making friends.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Project#MeS#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," to be known to determine the rate of translation .
The initiation codon, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the identity of the base at position -3 and the occurrence of alternative ATGs (that do not serve as an initiation codon) are features known to be important for translation initiation (Barrick et al., 1994). When those are known it should be possible to make an estimation of the translation rate.
Pennsylvania State University was able to quantify the different relevant features and created a tool (Salis et al., 2009) (Salis, 2011) that predicts the translation rate when the mRNA sequence is known. Even within a range of five orders of magnitude the tool should not differ from the reality with a factor higher than 2.3 (Salis et al., 2009). The RBS determines the translation initiation rate, however, this is relative to all other translated coding sequences (Salis, 2011). Since the RBS calculator uses the same scale for every calculation, the relative translation initiation rate of each protein can thus be determined. An absolute translation initiation rate for only one gene suffices to extract absolute rates. To model this properly, we would require a translation initiation rate of one of the genes from our construct. At this moment, these values are not available from the wetlab, but values from literature should give a reasonable result. We have found that the initiation rate of translation for the lacZ gene in the lac operon is approximately 0.31 initiations per second per mRNA copy (Kennell and Riezman, 1977), which we consequently used as a standard.
A first run through the tool yielded adequate results for both PchB and BSMT1, however the output for PchA was unrealistically low. We realised the RBS for PchA was part of PchB, causing the low output. After communication with dr. Salis himself we settle on a different tool from his website, especially designed for operon structures.  This was indeed the appropriate tool to quantify the translation initiation of the operon pchBA : the output now showed a satisfactory translation rate for each of the proteins in E. coli. We obtained results for the lac operon (as a control) and for the genes we want to clone into E. coli ( https://salis.psu.edu/software/ ). They are listed in Table 1. The third column of this table shows the values of the translation initiation rate that are computed using the literature value from the lac operon.

United State
The United States are the biggest producer of GMO thanks to a different           point of view from the society, government and economy of the country. In the           United States most GMOs are considered as safe for the human health. This point           of view facilitates companies and individuals to produce and consume GMO than in           other countries. Indeed, GMOs are considered as a food additive by the US law and           not as a biologic product.4, 12 In this optic, the United States did not ratify the Cartagena Protocol         on Biosafety to protect the environment of the propagation of GMO.2
During this data collect, we saw different point of view on GMOs. We only focus     on 6 countries, but we want to continue filling out the interactive map to have a     global overview of the different regulation in the world. Afterward, we were curious     about different applications of synthetic biology on these countries and how companies     and scientific researchers adapt their work to their country regulation. Click on the     link to see these applications.

Lab Notebook Background Observations
As a part of user-centered design, we need to figure out what functions the wetlab team will want from an electronic lab notebook.  To do so, we have been observing the team working in the wetlab, as well as sitting in on their lab meetings.  We hope that doing so will help us figure out what the team needs, and will help us design an application that is as useful as possible.

Lab Notebook Designs
This week, I've worked with Kathy to design some initial prototypes for what the electronic lab notebook might look like.  So far, we have ideas for most of the main screens, but we haven't gone into too much detail.  We're hoping to present these designs to the wetlab team next week and get some feedback from them.
Interview with George Church
I went with Orit and Kathy to an interview with George Church, where we asked what sorts of computational tools he used in his lab and what sort of tools he saw being useful for the future.  While this might not be as relevant for the work we're doing now, it's essential in looking to the future of our work.  We're trying to envision what will come next for the tools we're creating now, and that helps us figure out what the role is of the tool we're making now.  If we're making a tool that won't change much over time, then we need to do more work now to ensure that it will continue to function in the future; if the tool we're making is a stepping stone to a much larger tool, then the algorithm and interaction issues are much more important than the actual implementation.

Lab Notebook Design Refinement
We presented our designs for the electronic lab notebook to the wetlab team this week, and they were very excited and eager to help us.  While they worked in the lab, they came out to visit me and Kathy while they had down time between experiments.  We explained our designs to them, then invited any feedback they had.  This worked very well for us, because we got plenty of feedback from them, and working with smaller groups let us confirm trends: when all of the groups told us that they wanted a clear way to communicate the procedures that they had completed with their labmates, but didn't want it to intrude on their own work,"

Through discussion and collaboration with the wet lab research team, the computational research team aimed to produce a tool that would meet the needs of, and aid in automating repetitive procedures done by the wet lab. Survey results from these discussions suggested that plasmid design was tedious and time-consuming, but a necessary portion of the research process. Since plasmid design relies heavily on pattern matching, the computational research team proposed a suitable solution to automate this process, by creating an application that would accelerate iteration through various parameter combinations to find compatible designs. The application takes input parameter sequences for the plasmid backbone, promoter, terminator, and protein of interest, and checks their compatibility to produce a recombinant plasmid. Following this analysis, the program provides the user with a list of potential restriction enzyme cut sites, and based on user selection, the program outputs the final plasmid design sequence.

The model and results: a summary
The agent-based model shows communication between agents through quorum sensing, which leads to the production of a factor (say, IL-2) in regions with high bacteria density, with no production in regions with low bacteria density. We ran the model on a 2D plane, with two distinct regions of different bacteria densities. The higher-density region exhibited production of the factor, while the lower-density region did not. Initially there was no factor production at all, but the signal concentration accumulated in the high-density region. Starting at step 57,000, the signal concentration in the high-density region passed the threshold for factor production, so the bacteria started producing the factor. The factor diffused through the medium, approaching equilibrium by at most step 100,000. Through the entire 100,000 steps, there was no factor production in the low-density region.

PTS screening
Trusting on our targeted approach alone seemed risky − that is why we planned a PTS screening to find the most favorable PTS for our three receptors. Dueber et al. (2016) used the Violacein assay for a similar purpose. They screened for the best PTS for the wild type receptor and were successful. Hence another subproject of our team is the integration of the Violacein pathway into the peroxisome ( Violacein ), we were already supplied with all necessary enzymes − VioA, VioB and VioE.
Figure 1.8: Pathway leading to the production of prodeoxyviolacein − the assay is based on the green color to identify colonies without functional import mechanism.
The figure above shows the principles of the assay. VioA and VioB are localized in the cytosol and lead to the production of the IPA imine dimer while VioE is tagged with a PTS1 variant. Successful import leads to white colonies whereas missing import results in green colonies due to the cytosolic production of prodeoxyviolacein.
Our rests upon the following two plasmids which are co-transformed into yeast.
Figure 1.9: Plasmids used for Violacein assay. The left one carries the coding sequence for the Pex5 variant, VioA and VioB whereas the right one contains the gene for VioE plus the attached PTS1 variant.
As shown above, we created one plasmid containing VioA, VioB and one of our Pex5 variants while the other plasmid only contained VioE. We then designed primers which bind to the VioE plasmid to amplify the whole plasmid except the terminator − random PTS1 variants were attached to VioE with the help of a random primer library. Following up, we did the ligation with the corresponding terminator and obtained a mix of several different VioE-PTS1 plasmids.
After plasmid amplification in Escherichia coli we then co-transformed yeast with the two constructs and waited for the colonies to grow. With the yeast growing, prodeoxyviolacein should be produced in yeast cells with absent import (green color) and the IPA imine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

Have to consider that protein modeling is a complex task that usually takes a long time to develop.
After the meeting we decided to change our responsibilities.

And finally our primers arrived!! (after 3 weeks). We did PCR of the different parts that we need to build our first construct (the Working Plasmid). For that we:
a) Obtained the parts necessary to make the Working Plasmid and transformed e. coli with them.
b) Did minipreps of all the constructs to purify the DNA from the transformed bacteria.
c) Amplified the constructs in the thermocycler.
d) Did electrophoresis of the PCR amplicons.
We had several problems with the electrophoresis, but after some attempts it worked. 5 of the 7 PCR were successfully amplified. The two parts that didn´t work are HIV cleavage site (2kb) and vector backbone pSB1K3 (42kb).
April 16-22, 2012
We did electrophoresis with HIV cleavage site and pSB1K3. This time, we added more of them (4 μL template in PCR) to ensure that they were present in our tubes.  We had now all the parts that we need to proceed! We made our first Gibson Assembly to build the working plasmid (see constructs). We need this plasmid to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid and the Protease Producer Plasmid. But unluckily our colonies resulted to be red. This is not what we expected… later we did an analytical digestion to the DNA of those colonies, but we obtained strange results. Something went wrong.
This week we had the great opportunity to assist to a lecture of Dr. Aldo Leal. He is a Chilean biochemist that currently works in Germany studying the interactions between cells and biomaterials made of spider silk proteins. We learnt a lot of information about the production of recombinant spider silk proteins and the possibility to easily create films. Then, it’s not necessary to utilize other sophisticated spun methods like electrospinning. Later we met with Dr."
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also"

Conclusion & Perspective
Every Deed Begins with a Purpose
All in all, it’s hard to deny that people still have concerns about our project. Convincing the public that our product is safety and security is a difficult task. For adults, based on their personal experiences, they recognize that mosquitoes bring nothing but disease and itching. So it might came upon a bad impression for them, however, they did support us to do more and are eager to know what our final product is. For primary school students, they are quite young and don’t have too much concerns about safety, they prefer a natural bite more than a scared syringe. Promotion and propaganda for GMO products as well as realizing the way to spreading HIV infectious diseases play an indispensable role within our project. Moreover, because of the survey, we came up with our applied device, which keeps mosquitoes secure in a cage as small as a matchbox. And combined with the other experiences, we’ve come up with an idea of peeling off mosquito wings for preventing escaping. Our product hasn’t come true, our journey never stops, every deed begins with a purpose, and the purpose makes our life meaningful.

Knowing that collaboration is the tenet of iGEM competition, this year we have collaborated with two
iGEM teams, a high school team (SDSZ China) and an undergraduate team (Tsinghua A). By collaborating
with these two iGEM teams, we can seek out help whenever needed and receive prompt feedback about our
project design and Wiki contents.
Collaboration with Team Tsinghua-A
Having been known each other for a long time, we were quite thrilled to reach out to our old friends Ke Yuxi
and Wang Linghan, two team members from Team Tsinghua A, and form a very healthy and constructive
relationship with them. In retrospect, it turned out to be a very worthy journey with them.
Linghan first approached us for help for the generation of BioBricks that are eligible for delivery accorded
by the rule of Standard Plasmid Delivery. She brought up the conversation on how they lacked proper lab
facility for liquid evacuation. We offered the machine with alacrity and helped them processed their
extracted DNA into the dried form. We also reciprocated the topic on choosing a delivery company, and she
mentioned one that seemed the most suitable for our purpose. This first collaboration initiated the
following interaction.
With the deadline for freezing Wiki approaching, we visited their Wiki pages and they did it as well. They
noticed several technical flaws regarding to the awkward website design, and professionally pinpointed
the problem being originated from the misuse of the HTML and CSS programming language. It is because of
their help with scrutiny we would be able to adjust and optimize our website display. We were very
grateful to their help. On the final day before the excruciating Wiki freeze, two teams decided to host
a get-together on Wiki final check. We brought snacks and drinks, and outputted Wiki contents with
high-quality.

Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Organization of the Meet Up Ile-de-France 2016
We established a partnership with the iGEM Pasteur team in order to organize the Meet Up Ile-de-France, an event gathering all the Parisian iGEM teams. Paris is a big city and its metropolitan area has a huge impact on the scientific community around the world. Parisian universities and research institutes are at the heart of the French scientific production and all the iGEM teams were created thanks to that immense influence. This year, the 6 iGEM Parisian teams are iGEM Paris Saclay, iGEM Pasteur, iGEM IONIS, iGEM Evry, iGEM Bettencourt and iGEM IMPACT. The event was hosted by Paris Pasteur Institute and organized for 3 months by iGEM Paris Saclay and iGEM Pasteur, with the help and consulting of iGEM IONIS.
Each Parisian team had the opportunity to make a 20-minute presentation of their project in the presence of a jury, composed by the following professionals and students: Dr Deshmukh Gopaul (Pasteur Institute of Paris), Fabio Maschi (Paris-Saclay), Guillian Graves (École nationale supérieure de création industrielle), Mathis Funk (Gustave Roussy Cancerology Institute) and Matthieu Fritz (Pasteur Institute of Paris).

We co-transformed the 58 indC variants with four different PPTases into E. coli TOP10 cells. We used the PPTases Sfp (Bacillus subtilis str. 168) [11], Svp (Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003) [12], EntD (Escherichia coli MG1655) [7] and DelC (Delftia acidovorans SPH-1) [8] and screened them on their functionality. This screening is remarkably easy, because functional indigoidine synthetases result in a blue phenotype when being expressed and activated in E. coli cells [3]. We found, that nine engineered indigoidine synthetases, in which the T-domain was replaced, remained functional in producing indigoidine when co-expressed with specific PPTases. The inserted T-domains include four synthetic T-domains ( Figure 4: Coexpression of Engineered Indigoidine Synthetases and Supplementary PPTases in E. coli In this first experiment, we replaced the indC T-domain with the T-domains of other native NRPS modules (1: wild-type indC, 2: bpsA,3: entF, 4: delH4, 5: delH5, 6: tycA, 7: tycC6, 8: plu2642 and 9: plu2670) and synthetic T-domains (10-16: synT1-7). We also exchanged both the T- and TE-domain by the T- and TE-domain of other natural NRPS modules (17: bpsA, 18: tycC6, 19: delH5).

July 9, 2018
We consulted Professor DeLisa on every part of our system. In regards to our protein degradation tags, he voiced his concern of not having such tags on HrpR and HrpS and the problems with having these proteins lingering in cell. He also echoed Professor Lambert’s suggestion of using the mfLon-ssrA orthogonal protease system for protein degradation. While he could not provide feedback on the HrpLRS system in detail, he did point us to Professor Swingle and his expertise. Finally, he brought up the possibility of using RNA aptamers due to their fast generation and degradation rates. The aptamers would fluoresce in the presence of certain small molecules in the solution as the reporter for this system and an alternative to GFP.
Prof. Bryan Swingle, School of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University
August 6, 2018
Professor Swingle specializes in understanding the molecular systems that enable bacteria to adjust and thrive in plants and other environments. The HrpLRS system originated from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and is a crucial component of our system as an AND gate for transcription. Thus, we met with Professor Swingle to discuss the dynamics of this molecular system, giving careful consideration to the kinetics of HrpR and HrpS dimerization and the rate at which this dimer activates transcription via the HrpL promoter. This was to address a recurring concern that our system would suffer from lag time between its components. From his experience, Professor Swingle was able to say that this system displays fast kinetics but did not have quantitative numbers for support. He pointed us to testing methodologies in order to provide realistic parameters for our model of the system and to rule out significant lag time problems from this component of our system.
Implementation
Our system was designed to be tuned using different degradation tags and the orthogonal mf-Lon system.
Thanks to our introduction to heat-sensitive promoters and heat-shock proteins, we decided to use a RNA thermometer for our temperature dependent component.
We modeled protein degradation tags on HrpR and HrpS.
The use of HrpR and HrpS allowed our system to display fast kinetics due to the proteins’ fast dimerization kinetics.
Optimization and Modeling
Recognition
Our bio-circuit takes the input of an oscillating temperature and, with a low- and high-pass “filter”, leads to the frequency-dependent expression of GFP. Due to the complexity of our mechanism of action, we needed a way to"

Large culture of CT33 in BL21.
Week 30 - 23/10 - 27/10
Biobricking
PCR and sequential digestion and ligation using XbaI and SpeI -> still failing. Maybe the construct is too large.
CT33 part in pSB1C3 vector and 14-3-3 tetramer + GFP and 14-3-3 dimer + GFP parts in pET28 vector dried and sent to Boston.
14-3-3
Purified 14-3-3 tetramer via Ni column and buffer exchange to prevent protein aggegrates. Results show a not 100% pure protein, but target compound was present.
CT33/CT52
Purified via Strep column. Results show a not 100% pure protein, but target compound was present.
Assays
FRET was tested by mixing the main components, transferring them to a well plate and exciting them with a wavelength for GFP and reading the emission of mCherry. Results looked good but can be optimized since a background signal of mCherry activation is still present.
Week 31 - 30/10 - 03/11
14-3-3 & CT33/CT52
To further purify both proteins SEC was used, but results showed that still some remaining extra compounds are present.
Assays
FRET was optimized by comparing the excitation spectra of GFP and mCherry and finding a wavelength where GFP still is excitated but mCherry is not. Results showed that this optimum was found.

Our team
Our team is located at the University of Sherbrooke, in the province of Québec in Canada, and formed of students and instructors from various fields of expertise: electrical engineering, software engineering, molecular biology and microbiology. The multidisciplinary nature of our team has allowed us to create a complete laboratory automation platform comprising hardware, software, and wetware.
The students taking part in this team are attending their final year of college. However, only a few of those are actually born and raised from Sherbrooke and its surroundings.  The team members originate from different regions and demographics throughout the province. The diverse and varied minds and ways of working from everyone came together as a whole as every member weighed in with their contribution, to achieve a shared vision on what the robotic platform should be. The team's representatives are all interestsed in common subjects such as biology, engineering and robotics. The iGEM competition is seen as a great and interestsing challenge.
