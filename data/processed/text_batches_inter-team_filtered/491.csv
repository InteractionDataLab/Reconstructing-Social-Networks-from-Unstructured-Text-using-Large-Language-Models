UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html,"istic question of ""how would a new space-based society work"". Although we can never truly answer these questions before the events have taken place, we will look back at how history has dealt with similar problematics in order to predict future events.
Moon landing
Firstly, we'll look at the critical events related to the first moon landing back in the 60s. Particularly how the political tension between the east and west affected the technological development. Then we will take that knowledge and try to apply it to the present day to make a prediction of how we, as a society, would find the incentive to send a space mission to Mars.
In the time after World War II, the tension grew between the east and west - particularly between the two powerful states USSR and USA. Because of this, many of the newly
decolonized states chose not to ally themselves with either of the states. Where the US chose not to support the countries that weren't allied with them, the USSR supported these states as an attempt to win their affection during the cold war (Syskind, 2003). It was a time that was characterized by bipolarization and demonstration of power. One of the ways this was manifested was technologically. In 1955, both countries declared that they would send satellites into orbit. The Soviets were the first to achieve this in 1957 followed by the USA four months later. The Soviet demonstration of power only grew as they succeeded in sending a man into space in 1961. Again, the US were behind by three weeks in achieving the same. Embarrassed by the turn of events, Kennedy made a claim that at the end of the decade the USA would land a man on the moon (Space News, 2012). While several other technological leaps were made in the time leading up 1969, the space race culminated when the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon. This has later be viewed as the end of the space race as the people's interest in space missions decreased. In 1975, however, a joint space mission indicated improved relations between the two powers (Thuren, 1984).
NASA was heavily involved in the space race. The conditions were different than usual within the association due to the political pressure of the time. As Kennedy promised to land a manned mission on the moon before 1970 on behalf of the country, he proved willing to spend the money it took to develop the technology within the given time frame increasing the funds given to NASA from 0.1% given in 1958 to 2.31% in 1969 of the total US"
BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic chip design. This tool is analogous to a place and route tool for a circuit schematic, allowing for complicated designs to be specified and then realized. Fluigi takes in a MINT specification, and outputs design schematics in the form of SVG’s for CNC mill fabrication, and EPS files for photolithography.
We integrated the MINT file type, along with the Fluigi compiler into Neptune. As a standalone tool Fluigi can be pretty daunting to navigate, requiring shell scripting experience and a solid software background. We eliminated all difficulty from Fluigi by integrating Neptune as a user interface for Fluigi. Users can compile their MINT files through Neptune, and Fluigi will in turn provide the designer feedback in a console. Design errors and design status is all fed back to Neptune. All in all, we integrated Fluigi with Neptune, providing a robust and easy to use UI for editing and compiling MINT files.
Choosing Mechanical System | Zach Lasiuk
Analyzed the pitfalls and advantages of both the rack and pinion system as well as the piston rod system. In order to properly choose a system for Neptune, the overall goals of Neptune were called to mind: Low cost, easy to use, and modular. With these design goals in mind, the piston rod system was ultimately chosen to ensure accuracy, modularity, and the ability to dispense very small to very large amounts of liquid with a feedback control active.
Designing Electrical System | Zach Lasiuk
Focusing in on the overall goals of Neptune’s hardware (low cost, easy to use, and modular), the Arduino Mega was chosen to control Neptune’s hardware. Because Neptune is inherently modular to change with synthetic biologists needs, Neptune’s electronic control circuitry must be equally as modular and scalable. The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and various headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately.
Mapping Mechanical Motion & Constant Flow Rate Equation | Zach Lasiuk
In order to accurately control Neptune’s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined. Therefore, the equation for off-center piston-rod motion was derived. An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled. Based on where the servo arm is in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome"

Survey
In Germany, synthetic biology is starting to gain more importance in academic research. However, the ethical issues and potential risks associated with it, are a major concern for the general public. So far, the German government did only fund the opinion-forming process but not synthetic biology projects in natural sciences.
In order to determine the general consensus on synthetic biology we generated a survey about the opinion of the members of the German parliament. The aim of this survey was to figure out what the members of the parliament think about “synthetic biology” and how the future of synthetic biology in Germany might look like.
This survey was sent to 637 members of the German parliament. 15 Members answered and 10 of them attended the survey. The participation was around 2.22 percent. Furthermore, Mr. René Roespel invited us to discuss about synthetic biology.

Biosecurity
While synthetic biology has the potential to greatly improve human life, it is also capable of producing harmful microorganisms, either by accident (discussed above) or on purpose. Synthetic biology could open the door for a new type of bioterrorist – one that could rationally design microbiological weapons for use on the public.  While DNA sequences and research publications may be readily available, construction of an actual organism capable of acting as a biological weapon (for example, by reconstituting a virus) is both difficult and expensive. Though it is still a possibility and needs to be taken as a serious issue, the equipment necessary to synthesize full viral or bacterial genomes is expensive, furthermore, facilities that offer these services screen synthesis orders to ensure that the DNA being synthesized poses no threat to public safety. Lastly as the DNA sequence alone is not enough to create a bio-weapon, the synthesis of potential harmful DNA is not sufficient to pose a threat to public safety by itself [6].
Intellectual Property and Ownership
Another important ethical issue is the relationship between synthetic biology, intellectual property, and ownership.  Should someone be allowed to patent a gene?  What about a synthetic network of genes that perform a specific function? Should these systems be patentable or copyrightable?  Or should they be neither and left to the public domain?  While genes are currently patentable under the same law that makes drugs patentable, there is ongoing debate and controversy as to whether this law, should change as technological progress continues to redefine the assumptions made by legislators and regulatory agencies [7]. Broad patents on entire genes can slow down the growth and stifle innovation in the field, preventing the production of potentially useful systems. Early entrants into synthetic biology are attempting to patent basic genetic components to get ahead of their competition. Copywriting genetic code is not clear cut either, as copyright law generally requires expressive choice, which is limited by the 4 DNA base pairs.
Putting the legal arguments aside, enforcing ownership of a gene or genetic system will be near impossible. Interested scientists can simply find the gene again in nature, or even in the engineered microorganism, and culture it themselves. Self-replicating bacteria that are distributed to the public and produce a therapeutic of choice could allow anyone interest to culture the organism themselves and have a potentially limitless supply of the drug. Simple PCR could allow direct access to"

Technical criteria
a) Biological and biochemical basics
As already discussed in the previous chapter, the goal of the Darmstadt group is to create bacteria, which can cleave and utilize PET. In contrast to the utopia of Ernst Bloch the resulting initial product is Catechol and not amino acids. To achieve this goal the group has split up onto three wet labs and one simulating lab. On top the group has also taken some external groups onto the boot, who further support the process. In the three wet labs it will be tried to bring genes for specific enzymes with biotechnological methods into the Chassis-bacteria and the activity of the corresponding enzymes will be tested. The Chassis-bacteria is so reduced in its gene pool that it could not survive in the environment. It completely lacks all pathogen factors and the ability to conjugate (gen exchange between bacteria). The three labs can be separated into following areas (1) degradation, (2) transport and (3) metabolism.
a1) Degradation
PET is a macromere from the group of polyester and is made of the individual substances Terepthalacid and Ethylenglykol. To recover these individual substances is the goal of the group degradation. Since PET is produced industrial, and as discussed in the previous chapter is inert for biological live forms, there is no enzyme found in the animal world that could cleave specific PET. Polyester on the other hand is frequent in Nature. One of them is Cutin, a part of plant cell walls. Molds attacking plants, like e.g. Fusarium solani, can degrade Cutin with an enzyme named Cutinase. The isolated enzyme shows also a low activity on the degradation of PET. By the use of a targeted point mutation by the company Henkel, the Cutinase was altered in such a way that its enzyme activity was enhanced compared to the wild type enzyme. Biobricks, which were coding for this altered enzyme, were bought by the scientists and built into E.coli. With the help of this additional membrane anchor, the enzyme could be expressed on top of the cell wall of the bacteria and be used for the degradation of PET. However, since the Cutinase degrades very unspecific and cleaves besides PET and Cutin also lipids, the cell wall of the bacteria was also degraded which leads to the death of the bacteria. Evasive test in yeast showed due to different cell wall structure better results. Alternative to the Cutinase, another enzyme (Esterase) was tested. With this enzyme the degradation activity on PET"

Motivation
Remember ’Mystique’ from the X-men franchise? Albeit prone to a little villainy,  she is that amazing character with the blue skin; and possessed the uncanny ability  to effortlessly transform into anyone at will. Quite an intriguing capability; her  cells had the potency to reconfigure into any individual of choice as per necessity.  Now, that may be a far fetched dream, but we can take a lesson or two from  Mystique’s biological gifts. For instance, reconfigurable electronic circuits may not  be far out of reach [? ];these systems would be the ideal multitaskers, switching  between functionalities as the need arises. Synthetic Biology also seems to be  vying for a place in this domain; from reconfigurable logic gate systems [2, 4] to  systems with switchable dynamical behavior [1, 2, 6].  On an abstract level, the idea of reconfigurablity resonates with Team iGem IIT  Delhi. Works like [1, 6] that propose a novel synthetic circuit, which can act both  as an oscillator and a toggle switch have been a major influence on our work. The projet is divided into two parts; and at the heart of it all lies a ”Sychnronized  Quorum of Genetic Clocks” [3]. First, we develop a reconfigurable circuit that  can switch between an oscillator and a toggle switch. We realize this circuit  using the oscillator of [3]. In order to achieve a toggle switch behavior, we add  the lambda repressor; which is susceptible to thermal denaturation. Thus, at  temperatures of around 30 deg. celsius the system acts as a toggle switch, since  the lambda repressor is constitutively produced and represses AiiA. However, as  the temperature is raised to 37 deg. celsius, the lambda repressor undergoes  thermal denaturation"

Restyling filters including javascript and css
In order to have the whole apps in a compact layout, the filters were put into a notebook. To navigate and style this javascript and css had to be included. This works through the simple ""includeHTML()""-function shiny contains.
The tab heading are implemented as a unordered list containing links. These links activate a javascript, which shifts between the containers displayed in the notebook. This works by first hiding all containers in that area and then showing the one that was specified as parameter, when calling the function from the link.
The style of the tabs and the notebook were adjusted to match the border color and radius of the bootstrap styled elements.

Our Contribution
Throughout our iGEM experience, we have interacted with synthetic biologists, researchers, and companies in the microfluidic industry. Our team has found that there is a need for a system that increases the accessibility of microfluidic devices to the scientific community. While microfluidics is not new to biologists, many scientists have not incorporated it into their research workflow. This is due to a number of barriers that scientists must overcome in order to utilize microfluidics, one of which is a lack of accessibility.
Currently, the experimental outputs of experiments run on microfluidic chips are collected in a tube and manually transferred to other vessels, such as a well-plate for analysis in a plate reader. This, however, defeats the purpose of using microfluidics to automate biological protocols. In order to streamline the process of utilizing microfluidic devices for synthetic biology protocols, we have developed a system that automates the output of a microfluidic device. Our system, TERRA, takes the output of a microfluidic device and selectively dispenses the fluid to specific locations on a vessel, such as a 96-well plate. Scientists can then use the output of a microfluidic-based experiment more effectively. For instance, the microfluidic output can easily be analyzed using standard lab equipment, such as a plate reader. TERRA allows scientists to incorporate microfluidics to their workflow without an extensive knowledge of microfluidics itself.
TERRA aims to be an application- and microfluidic-agnostic system, in which a biologist can run a microfluidic device designed for their experiment, connect it with the TERRA Adapter, and enter the protocol for the experiment to our user interface. Our system will then automate the experiment and dispense the fluid output to the wells of the microtiter plate that the user inputted to the user interface. By automating the microfluidic-based experiment, our project combines the use of standard lab equipment for analysis of outputs of microfluidic devices. TERRA allows scientists to easily incorporate microfluidics to their experiments and easily access and utilize the outputs"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," mesh, the discretization method was tetrahedral as it is easy and quick to create but it also creates an unstructured grid which in our case is helpful as there are domain regions with large difference in the required scales. For instance, in the proximity of the tumor we needed a finer meshing as the numerical solutions would converge to more accurate values that way.
The mesh generated by Comsol Multiphysics is a physics-controlled mesh with finer elements. The tetrahedral space discretization is visible on the mesh plot. We present here two mesh plots; the first shows the tetrahedral meshing of the intestinal geometry and the second one depicts the interior region where the tumor meshing is visible.
Initial Parameters & Boundary Conditions
In CFD models one needs to determine the initial values of the parameters as well as the boundary conditions of the problem in order to get an accurate result from the solver.
The normal velocity of Chyme inside the small intestine is below 1 cm/s and inside the large intestine it's even slower. Thus, we assumed that a logical value for the inlet normal velocity is 0.5 cm/s. The outlet boundary condition is pressure and its value is 101.16 kPa, close to 1 atm [ 5 ].
The intestinal “tube” in our geometry is considered to be a no-slip wall in our study which implies that the velocity of the fluid particles close to the wall will tend to zero. The tumor region is a no-slip interior wall.

The velocity field of the fluid flow inside the large intestine is quite complex, when peristalsis occurs, as the intestinal walls contract in a periodical manner in order to forward the colon contents towards the rectum where they are being secreted. However, that kind of study is beyond the scope of our model. In our model the inlet velocity is a consequence of the contraction of the caecum but we assume that the time scale of the peristalsis is bigger than the fluid movement's; thus, no peristaltic waves occur throughout our model and the fluid is driven by its inlet velocity and a pressure outlet which is close to 1 atm.
Also, viscosity is a rather important factor when it comes to fluid flow. The intestinal fluid, due to nutrients and water absorption, doesn't possess a constant viscosity value; although the site of absorption and phase change of Chyme is the Transverse Colon and not the Caecum and Ascending Colon, the digested food determines to a high degree the success of nutrients and water absorption. Thus, we considered essential to examine the fluid flow under"

Public Engagement
Public engagement is a term that has recently been used to describe ""the involvement of specialists listening to, developing their understanding of, and interacting with, non-specialists"".
Now why would that be relevant to a competition regarding Synthetic Biology. The answer to this question is simple, it’s quite clear that iGEM is much more than just science. Given that this competition is of the academic nature, the main focus is science, however, it’s not the only focus.
iGEM really is a true multidisciplinary competition, targeting many real-life aspects. Going back to public engagement, it is one of the disciplines that iGEM is focused on. Within this track, students focus on reaching out to the public, spreading word about their achievements. It is extremely important to work on researching a new disease or optimizing a new technology, but it is even more important to be able to reach out and share this knowledge with the world. Therefore, public engagement is extremely important. This year, we really focused reaching out to the public, spreading the word about our science, synthetic biology, and of course, iGEM!                                  Public Engagement as a concept was achieved through three phases, The European Practice Jamboree, The EOS Blog, and Social Media. First, we reached out to European teams to invite them to Belgium in an attempt to collaborate. We organized the European Practice Jamboree which was a huge success! Second, we reached out to those who already have a knack for science. Through a scientific magazine based in Belgium, EOS, we were able to post weekly blogs about our iGEM journey, where we shared our journey from the start till the last week before the Jamboree! Lastly, we used Social Media to reach out to all those who might be even slightly interested in our project. Using the power of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, we were able to reach people that were wouldn’t have been able to in any other way!

The Macquarie 2014 team designed and constructed the following three operons required for the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. These three operons have been sent to the registry.
Functional Operons
Operon 1: BBa_K1326008
In anaerobic bacteria, the bch1 and bchD genes are part of an operon. Macquarie 2014 have constructed an equivalent synthetic operon in E. coli, using separate ChlI1 and ChlD taken from oxygenic photosynthetic eukaryotes. We have shown that our artificial operon works, and that proteins self-assemble to form a functional ChlI1:ChlD complex in E. coli. This part works together with ChlH to insert magnesium into protoporphyrin IX. Although our operon does not contain ChlH as originally planned (due to issues in fully assembling the part), in vitro assays indicated full functionality of self-assembly and catalytic functionality.
Figure 1 Operon 1, made up of the lac promoter, ChlI1, ChlD, and GUN4. The BioBrick plasmid backbone encodes chloramphenicol resistance.
Figure 2 Schematic representation of the conversion of Protophoryrin IX to Mg-Protophoryrin IX via Mg-chelatase (Operon 1). The functionality of this step has been demonstrated in our project .
Operon 2: BBa_K1326002
This operon has been constructed with genes responsible for catalysing the biosynthesis pathway from Mg-protoporphyrin IX to Protochlorophyllide. CTH1, Plastocyanin, and YCF54 are involved in the oxidative cyclase pathway. Ch"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," already existing areas under cultivation and facing an estimated world population of around 9.2 billion people in the year 2050 we have to look for even more efficient ways to do so. Meeting the world demand for food is not only a scientific challenge but a moral obligation of civilized nations especially facing an excessive 1 billion people suffering hunger in the year 2000; more then ever in human history.
Figure 3: Global distribution of genetically modified crops in 2010 (in million hectares) [3]
Today biotechnology in foods is already a widespread method. Even more than the general population dismissive of such technologies is aware of. The mere percentage of biotech crops cultivated globally in comparison to their non GM counterparts is astonishing. In 2009 of the 90 million hectares of soybean grown globally, 77% were transgenic. Of 33 million hectares of cotton 49% and of the 158 million hectares of maize 26% were genetically modified.
Actual Situation in Germany
Figure 4: Destroyed research field in Üplingen, Germany. Acts of vandalism like this led big biotech companies to withdraw from the german market.
This year for the first time since they started, there have been no field trials of GM plants in Germany [4] . This is the outcome of a long lasting attitude against biotechnology by the general population. The implications of this development are disastrous for Germany and the EU as they will play no considerable part in the global development and research on GM foods meaning they will not contribute to an inevitable change in global food production. This is especially unfortunate as the EU is dependent on the import of food and feed from regions like South America and Asia where biotechnology plays a greater part every year, making it difficult to import enough feed, for example in accordance to strict EU regulations.
This resentful public attitude has furthermore led big companies to withdraw from Germany taking with them important funds for plant biotechnology research. Those global players tend to invest into more promising markets. ""We want to concentrate on the attractive markets in North and South America and the growing markets in Asia"" a spokesman of the BASF says.
Transgenic moss in comparison to GM food
After our thorough research about GM plants and especially food we wanted to assess which risks in GM food really applied to our moss. After establishing all major problems with genetically modified food we found that almost none of them have to be considered when using a water-filtering moss system.
Horizontal gene transfer
As our moss is not ingested into the human body, gene transfer between the bacteria in the human digestive system and our moss is virtually impossible. As"

5/27 Messing Around with Silk Purification Products
Messed around with the supernatants from the wash step that contained that viscous liquid
Adding 1 ul of DNAse for 15 minutes, and rotating, followed by 15 min centrifugation at 10000 g seemed to get rid of the viscous substance.
This result substantiates that it was most likely chromosomal DNA. Next time I will add DNAse while doing the purification protocol.
As noted in yesterday's entry, the inclusion body solubilized in 3% SDS and stored in the cold room seemed to gel up overnight.

Alberta,2010,Team:Alberta#team_-_-_TEXT.html," not studying, I’m busy volunteering, singing with my choir, teaching dance or indulging in random vegetarian cuisine. I believe iGEM offers undergraduates a unique opportunity to collaborate with individuals from not only science, but many other fields of study. As a first time team member, I am excited to take what I’ve learned in lecture and apply it to a project with huge business and educational potential. I look forward to a fun summer and an intense competition!

I’m already done my bachelors at the UofA, I’ve just been tagging along with iGEM over the summer as a volunteer. From iGEM I’m looking toward studies and work related to synthetic biology.  I really hope to see synthetic biology open up the intricate machine-like world inside cells to engineering applications.  For now, help from the biofuels industry seems to be a safe bet, as long as oil prices stay high.  I’m also a fan of rally racing, DnB, military aviation, eastern and western philosophy/metaphysics and you can find me on Starcraft 2 occasionally.

I was born in Toronto, Ontario but have spent nearly my entire life in Edmonton. I aim to contribute my knowledge and abilities in this field to the U of A iGEM team. I look forward to being a part of a team that offers its students a chance to participate in the scientific community and to contribute to the burgeoning field of synthetic biology. My outside interests are: sport (soccer, rock climbing), music (playing kit drums, listening to nearly all genres), and languages (fluent in one, nearly-functional in three more, and can say at least “thank you” in about 30 others). I sincerely hope to help ensure that the U of A team continues to prove itself as an organization in the vanguard of scientific innovation. I also love to laugh…ha ha.

Darwinian evolution for microbial cell factory:
in vivo evolution engineering towards tryptophan-overproduction superbug
Darwinian evolution shows great power in creating incredible biological function in amazing speed.Inspired by this, our team aimed at creating novel fast and irrational microbial cell factory by simulating natural Darwinian evolution process. With tryptophan as target product, a novel tryptophan biosensor utilizing translating ribosome mechanism was firstly developed as the foundation for tryptophan productivity and selection pressure switch module. We further constructed this tryptophan overproduction selection gene circuit coupling with in vivo mutation machine (mutator gene of mutD). By fine-tuning the selection conditions, our selection circuit showed good tryptophan dependent growth property, which provides the foundation for further evolution.As a preliminary result of this project, we successfully evolved an ancestor with zero productivity to a high-tryptophan producer only after several rounds of evolution.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," who used to work for Metabolix - a company that used to specialise in the PHB plastic production using plants. We held a Skype call with Kristi Snell and with Nii Patterson who has advised us on potential methods for PHB plastic characterisation in small scale:
Looking at the cells under the light microscope to explore whether or not we can identify large inclusion bodies inside (PHB plastic granules). Then perform the Nile Blue staining protocol on PHB producing cells and on the control cells and look under the light microscope again to see if those inclusion bodies got colored in blue -- would mean than PHB plastic is present
We were advised against Nile Red staining, as it also colours the oil droplets inside the sell. Yet giving no other option Nile Red can be an alternative to Nile Blue
We were also advised against using HPLC for PHB characterisation since it was found insensitive. Yet it has been successful in certain literature
Both professionals have advised us to use Gas Chromatography for PHB characterisation, yet we would not have time to perform the experiments before the iGEM Giant Jamboree
We have further met with a professor in the engineering faculty, who have advised us to run our control and bacterial PHB on different chemical analytical equipment and then compare the produced peaks. This would have helped us to characterise the PHB by comparing the properties of the produced material to the properties of standard and the literature values. Yet we would not be able to generate enough plastic for those experiments in such short notice and hence can’t perform the experiments
Week 25: October 16 - 20
This week the team have continued working on writing and uploading the journal onto the wiki, as well as writing up the Overview, Fermentation and PHB extraction pages.
We have further coordinated with the synthesis group to adopt the Nile Red staining protocol and to look at the PHB producing cells under the microscope to move forward with the characterisation experiments
We finalized our extraction method this week and calculated the ESM for it. Literature has demonstrated the use of dissolved air flotation in the separation of PHAs with an overall yield of 86 ± 0.3% (van Hee, Elumbaring, van der Lans & Van der Wielen, 2006). When water saturated with air is bubbled through media containing PHB, the tiny PHB granules float up to the top of the mixture due to particle-bubble interactions. The PHB-rich top layer can be separated from the mixture and then dried to produce relatively pure PHB powder. However, we would need to"

Yener Tuncel
I have graduated from METU Molecular Biology and Genetics       department and just started the Bioinformatics Graduate Program       this fall. My main research interests is in systems biology,       and its applications. Currently I am focused on genome wide       association of SNP biomarkers, where we will utilize systems       biology approaches for discovering disease gene and pathway       associations after highthrough-put genotyping studies. During       the course of our research on the iGEM project this summer as       a Molecular Biologist I worked on the standardization of the       parts information for our applicaiton database. Also, as a Bioinformatician       in training, contributed to the development of the algorithms       for the BioGuide software. Besides research, I develop educational       tools for biology and bioinformatics education and getting used       to do couples dancing.
Motivation
Since 2008, we have been participating in iGEM as METU ( Middle East     Technical University) wet-lab team, and each year we have noticed the     increasing number of teams participating, along with an increase in     biobricks entries at partregistry.org .     While having more choices of biobricks to choose from is incredible,     searching for and choosing the appropriate parts is becoming a challenge.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Notebook#Engineering#WatsOn_-_-_TEXT.html," 12 V. For security reasons it has been placed into an aluminium casing. Plug the USB hub connector into the Raspberry. If you use the GUI locally on the device a mouse and a keyboard need to be attached to the USB hub to navigate on the user interface. Follow the steps described in the section Raspberry Pi - Setup .
Mount the device on top of the power supply casing. Add the display and apply some stickers to enjoy your custom-made WatsOn.
1By German law only certified electricians may work on 230 V electronics. Therefore, the electrical workshop at our institute created the power supply specifically for our design.
Raspberry Pi - Setup
In order to get a running linux system on the Raspberry Pi which includes all required components and configurations the following steps have to be considered:
The Raspberry Pi needs an SD card on which the operating system will be installed. Go to the download page of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and select an operating system of your choice - we used Raspbian - or just download the NOOBS package which offers all different operating systems during setup.
Follow the specific image installation guidelines to install the downloaded system onto your SD card.
Once finished, insert the SD card in the slot on the Raspberry Pi board, connect a monitor over HDMI, plug in a USB mouse and keyboard and start the Raspberry Pi by connecting it to the micro USB power supply. Follow the installation instructions; these should be straightforward. After the installation you will be shown the desktop of your new system.
To be able to use the Raspberry Pi camera you need activate it over a terminal. Search for a desktop icon labeled ""LxTerminal"", double click it and a terminal will appear where you can enter commands which will be executed after you press Return. Enter ""raspi-config"", press Return and activate the camera with the displayed corresponding option.
To check if the camera works, enter ""raspistill -t 5000 -o camera_test.jpg"" in the terminal. An overlay shows a 5 second preview from the camera on the screen, then an image is taken and saved as ""camera_test.jpg"" in the current directory.
An issue concerning the Raspberry Pi camera is that it supports just a fixed-focus which is per default set to infinity. This can be solved by removing the glue dots fixing the lense und unscrewing it until the required distance is focused.
Download the source files for the backend server and the graphical user interface (GUI). To be able to compile the GUI, you need to install the Qt5-libraries. Follow this guide on how to get the Qt source code, compile it and setup"

Results of Cross Junction PCR of 2 random colonies from ligation
After running an e-gel we saw the expected 1.4 kb band. (The gel image is not available, because we were unable to get the software running at the time). We decided to proceed with sending 24 colonies out for sequencing.
Send out 24 colonies for sequencing
We performed a cross-junction PCR on the following colonies to send them out for sequencing:
1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H, 2A, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 4A, 4B, 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D, 10E, 10F, 10G, 10H
We picked cultures that did not have sequencing results from our previous attempt. A 1 ul of a 1:10 dilution of each culture was used as template in the PCR. We used the Junction Reverse primer.
Isothermal assembly and transformation of GFP reporter
We ran our PCR product from yesterday on a 1% agarose gel. We got an appropriate band at approximately 700 bp. (Unfortunately, we could not get the imaging software to work at the time, so no image is available)
We performed a gel extraction on our GFP PCR product, with the following yields:

UCLouvain,2018,Team:UCLouvain#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," an automatic path length correction feature. This adjustment compromises the accuracy of measurement in highly light scattering solutions, such as dense cultures of cells. We don't have the                       pathlength correction on our instrument.                       The correction factor to convert measured Abs600 to OD600 is thus the Reference OD600 divided by Abs600. All cell density readings using this instrument with the same settings and volume can be converted to OD600.
Protocol:
Add 100 μl LUDOX into wells A1, B1, C1, D1
Add 100 μl of dd H2 O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2
Measure absorbance at 600 nm of all samples with the same measurement mode
Particle standard curve - Microsphere protocol
We will prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the Abs600 in our plate reader. The size and optical characteristics of these microspheres are similar to cells, and there is a known amount of                       particles per volume. This measurement will allow us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
Protocol:
Prepare the Microsphere Stock Solution:
Obtain the tube labeled ""Silica Beads"" from the InterLab test kit and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds. (Note: Microspheres should NOT be stored at 0°C or below, as freezing affects the properties of                           the                           microspheres).
Immediately pipet 96 μL microspheres into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube
Add 904 μL of ddH2 O to the microspheres
Vortex well. This is the Microsphere Stock Solution.
Prepare the serial dilution of Microspheres:
Accurate pipetting is essential. Serial dilutions will be performed across columns 1-11. Column 12 must contain ddH2O only.
Initially we will setup the plate with the microsphere stock solution in column 1 and an equal volume of 1 x ddH2O in columns 2 to 12. We will perform a serial dilution by consecutively transferring 100 μl from column to column                       with                       good mixing.
Add 100 μl of ddH2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12
Vortex the tube containing the stock solution of microspheres vigorously for 10 seconds
Immediately add 200 μl of microspheres stock solution into A1
Transfer 100 μl"

Overview of the differentiation process. For a complete organism with four metabolic operons, there are four possible outcomes, each of them leading to the expression of only one operon. In other words, each cell randomly choses one operon to express.
How to induce the differentiation?
There are different ways the CRE recombinase can be induced.
Chemical induction
A chemical would be one of the most predictable, efficient way to differentiate the cells. However, it requires to have access to this chemical, and to open the reactor which can be impractical for community labs with low resources to maintain sterility. It is nevertheless the solution of choice for funded factories. Carbohydrates such as glucose, arabinose or lactose seem to be the best options since they are not toxic.
Heat
On the other hand, heat does not require to open the bioreactor, so it's ideal when sterile conditions are not easy to obtain. Numerous heat-sensitive promoters exist, such as the Heat-Shock Promoter that is present in the registry (
BBa_K338001
).
The problem of leakiness
Most of the promoters from living organisms are leaky, i.e. they still lead to a small amount of transcription even in the absence of inducer. In our case, it means that the CRE recombinase will be expressed from time to time in some cells and it could result in the differentiation of some of them. If their number is low, it should not have any consequence as the differentiated cells are very unlikely to take over, but leakiness may be an obstacle if it affects a large proportion of the cells.
The perfect expression level
We could try to differentiate all the cells as quickly as possible, or let the cells differentiate slowly in a prograssive manner. Provided the differentiated cells grow significantly slower than the mother cell, the strategy that generates the largest amount of vitamins is not obvious.
To answer this question, we created a mathematical and computational model of the situation. Given the growth rate of the mother cells and the daughter cells, it is possible to calculate the optimal differentiation rate, and chose the strength of the promoter accordingly.

Construction of the system
We succesfully assembled a prototype version of this system in the model bacteria Escherichia coli.
The initial promoter is a strong constitutive promoter from the biobricks registry, BBa_J23119.
The genes involved in vitamin production are replaced with fluorescent proteins, allowing for easy monitoring of their production. Our construct contains mCherry as a reporter gene,"

Mating pheromone pathway model
We expected to use mRFP intensity to predict the sweetness based on our system. So we needed an insight into relationship between mRFP and sweetness. But lots of factor can impact the signal output so that we decided to divide our system into two parts, single cell model and yeast growth model.
Single cell model
Purpose
To simulate RFP intensity under different sweetness, we needed to set a model in a single cell firstly. By establishing this model, we could learn about how the sweetness signal transmit in the in yeast coupling pheromone pathway[3], and know each step of the signal transmit in detail, which provides supports for regulating the signal and  improving our bio-meter.
Single cell model:
In single cell model, we pay main attention to the signal transduction in pheromone pathway based on[4].And in order to simulate the signal transduction in mathematical way conveniently, we set some hypothesizes of this model:
1. We assumed that T1R2/T1R3 receptor does not have synergistic effect when it binds with sweeteners.
2. We hypothesized that the number of binding sweetener are consistent when binding to T1R2/T1R3 receptor or pheromone receptor.
3. We supposed that the combining rate and the initial binding concentration of sweetener are as same as pheromone receptor’s.
4. There is no influence between cell growth and protein expression in a single cell.
5. Only concern conservation relations of protein concentration in a single cell. The protein involving in the signal transduction is not considers its production or degradation.
Method and discussion

In order to simulate our project systematically, we divided our whole system into four blocks: (a) the activation of T1R2/T1R3 receptor; (b) the activation of G-protein cycle; (c) the cascade reaction of MAPK; and (d) the expression of RFP. And the simulating process and result of each part were shown below.

By making our bacteria dependent on an artificial amino acid and including this in the medium, we could ensure that bacteria which escape the gel die. Through point mutations, one makes essential proteins dependent on an artificial amino acid. To examine this option, we contacted professor Jan van Hest, who has a lot of experience with artificial amino acids.

Augus 13, 2018. Kill switches: Meeting with Prof. dr. Jan van Hest
Prof. dr. Jan van Hest was so kind to share his knowledge with us. He warned us that some artificial amino acids used for this purpose are still present, in varying quantities, in nature. Kill switches relying on such an amino acid are thus not completely safe. We discussed some potential artificial amino acids to use. Van Hest ultimately advised us to use azidophenylalanine, an artificial amino acid which is not present in nature. Its implementation is also efficient, as the required tRNA and synthetase are easily producible by bacteria. Van Hest recommended us to start with only one point mutation. Multiple mutations would be saver, but could complicate the synthesis of essential proteins, leading to cell dead.
Another topic we discussed with Van Hest, is the option to replace the use of antibiotic resistance genes in R&D by dependence on artificial amino acids. As we ultimately want to use our living material on patients, we do not want to risk antibiotic resistant bacteria escaping into the environment. Van Hest informed us that dependence on artificial amino acids could be a serious alternative, albeit not much used yet. He said that currently researchers simply use antibiotic resistance genes because of their ease of use and wide availability. However, dependence on artificial amino acids as a selection mechanism may be even more reliable than antibiotic resistance, as bacteria tend to get rid of genes that are temporarily unused, e.g. in the absence of antibiotics. As genes related to artificial amino acid dependence generally encode for essential proteins, they do not run this risk.
Insights
Dependence on artificial amino acids is a feasible method to implement a kill switch into our design, and thereby make our living material an even saver platform for the use of GMOs.
For optimal safety we must choose an artificial amino acid not present at all in nature.
One must strike a balance between safety and feasibility while choosing the number of point mutations to make.
Dependence on artificial amino acids may form a saver alternative to antibiotic resistance as a selection mechanism in R&D.
Follow-up
We designed a kill switch to be implemented into our design through the dependence on az"

Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of receptor signaling complexes in the kinase-on and kinase-off conformations.  Both chemoeffector binding or release and methylation or demethylation can shift receptor signaling complexes from one state to the other.  For example, attractant ligands drive receptors toward the kinase-off state; subsequent addition of methyl groups shifts receptors toward the kinase-on state, reestablishing the steady-state (adapted) balance between the two states and restoring random walk movements.
TlpB in Helicobacter Pylori:
H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in thestomachs of over half the world’s population. Its gastric habitatcontains a marked pH gradient from the highly acidic lumen,which can reach pH 2, to the more neutral environment adjacentto the epithelial lining, which is typically pH 7.  Based on genome sequence analysis, the H. pylori chemotaxismachinery resembles that of the well-studied model, E. coli,with a few notable variations including the absence of themethylation enzymes involved in receptor adaptation (Sweeneyand Guillemin, 2011).
Figure 5: Chematic representation of chemotaxis signaling in E. coli (A) and H. pylori (B). Chemoreceptors are shown in purple and flagellar motors in greenspanning the cell membrane. Cytoplasmic chemotaxis proteins CheA, CheW, CheY, CheZ, CheR, CheB, CheV, and ChePep are labeled. Protein modificationsare shown as pink circles for phosphorylation and purple hexagons for methylation. Activating interactions between signaling pathway components are indicatedby arrows, and speculative interactions are indicated by dotted lines.
When Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli bacteria which belong to two separate systems are examined, we recognize the vast similarity between the two. Both systems have chemoreceptors which belong to the MCP family enable the detection of chemical substances which do chemotaxis. Also, both bacteria also share in common the proteins required to send signals to necessary regions.
H. pylori has four chemoreceptors, TlpA,TlpB, TlpC, and TlpD, and several polar flagella that dictatesmooth swimming behavior in the presence of an attractantand increased stopping behavior in the presence of a repellent(Lowenthal et al., 2009; Rader et al., 2011). Only a small"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html," the corresponding negative control.
The samples with considerable halo formation in this case were:
EB ‘old’, 1mM IPTG induction, soluble fraction
EB ‘old’, 0.5mM IPTG induction, soluble fraction
EB ‘new’, 1mM IPTG induction, insoluble fraction
Unfortunately, those results don’t appear very consistent and even negative controls (cell lysate from untransformed BL21(DE3) cells) showed halo formation in some cases, especially on the plate with the ‘new’ EB. This could  indicate that the mere fact that the disks were soaked in a liquid could inhibit bacterial growth. In a subsequent experiment where triplicates were performed and less liquid was used, unfortunately no colonies formed, likely because the inoculum used to streak the plates had been too diluted.
After those three experiments, no clear conclusion can be drawn about whether EB has a bacteriolytic activity on E.coli. Since its main effects were documented to concern the biofilm and virulence factors, EB might in fact not be bacteriolytic or at least not exhibit that effect on gram negative bacteria.
For replication of the experiments, EB should be cleaved beforehand in order to remove the pro-peptide, which is reported to greatly improve its efficacy (Sugimoto 2011) This cleavage was not performed in our experiments and would likely be needed to test EB efficiently. Alternatively, Esp could perhaps be assembled in a mature form, as we attempted by truncating the sequence (see below).
Assemble truncated EB
Esp is initially transcribed as a pre-pro-peptide and subsequently cleaved into an active, mature form. (Sugimoto 2011) The uncleaved pre-pro-peptide has shown little to no activity in biofilm-degradation and is usually treated with thermolysin before functional assays (Sugimoto 2011, Ohara-Nemoto 2002) In order to avoid the additional step of thermolysin-mediated cleavage, which can also represent an additional confounding factor, we decided to create a truncated version of Esp (trEB) which would be missing the first 66 amino acids.
The set up for this experiment was considered to be fairly simple: we constructed a primer that was going to anneal at the valine in the 67th position and add the BioBrick prefix to its N-terminal. That primer was then used in combination with the EB_reverse primer to allow for subsequent ligation of the LT sequence to the C-terminus to assemble a protein that could be purified and conjugated to the spider"

A fluorescein 1x stock solution of 50uM was prepared via resuspension of 2x solution (100uM) in 1mL of 1xPBS followed by a another addition of 1mL 1xPBS solution. Four replicates of 1:2 serial dilutions were completed for a row of 11 wells, one of which contained only the prepared 1x stock. Measurements were performed at 600nm  with our standard GFP settings (excitation: 485nm, emission: 538nm).
Following our standard curve, cell measurements for fluorescence were tested with varying devices in E. coli K-12 DH5-α. After transformation of the plasmids into the DH5-α cells, two colonies were selected per device and inoculated in 5mL of LB medium with Chloramphenicol. The cells grew overnight for approximately 16 hours at 37 C with 220 rpm shaking. The OD600 measurement of the overnight cultures were performed immediately following the time span. Cultures were then diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 12mL of LB medium and chloramphenicol in a 50mL Falcon tube prior to incubation. 500uL were retrieved from the cultures at time 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation for absorbance and fluorescence readings on the 96 well plate (consisting of 4 replicates per colony of a test device), resulting in a total of 16 sample measurements per replicate.
All measurements were inputted into the standard iGEM InterLab 2017 excel document for respective calculations.

Women's Weekend
To create an accessible and relevant outreach program we followed the Outreach Planning Guide . An overview version of the guide can be found on the Database Page page
Find Communities
William & Mary is celebrating 100 years of women and co-education on campus. This meant our team had the unique opportunity to connect with alumni from a diverse array of fields to share our research. We wanted to excite an older generation of women who did not have a background in bioengineering, and encourage them to stay connected with campus and our synthetic biology research.
Evaluating Interest & Understanding
Knowing our alumni come from a diverse array of majors we moved forward with the assumption that all attendees had at least a highschool/intro level understanding of biology. For women without a background in biology we wanted to generate excitement for our project by describing potential applications of our work. We knew some of the alumni visiting would have backgrounds in biology due to bachelors or master degrees in biology, we decided to speak with them one on one and more deeply about the nuances of our project. As SynBio is such a recent field, even those with biology background might not have not encountered some of the bioengineering concepts we used, so we decided to treat each conversation as a unique learning experience and adapt our poster presentation based on the interests and background of the alumni.
Consider How to Connect
We were asked to create a poster for the event, and knowing that our audience was a mix of backgrounds we created the poster as an opportunity to display our data and act as a guide for our conversations. We tried to create visuals on the graph which would help develop a baseline understanding of our project, and we used the text to dive deepening into our project.  Our primary method of connection was going to be the individualized conversations we had with each alumni. These kinds of connections cannot be scripted because they are based on the interests and background of each alumni.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Tar_-_-_TEXT.html," a swimming plate; we immediately plated several drops of MG1655 overnight culture on different positions on the plate. The simulation is in accordance with the experiment and it is possible to distinguish three different       behaviors between the groups. The first group, starting from the upper part of the plate, shows strong symmetrical movement, this can be explained by the fact that the concentration in that portion of the plate is higher than the sensitivity       threshold of the Tar receptor, thus the bacteria cannot distinguish the direction of the gradient and expand equally in all directions.       The second group shows a biased movement towards the stripe, this is in accordance to the predicted position of an appropriate window of aspartate concentrations.       The remaining four groups do not exhibit any clear swimming activity, which, once again, is predicted in the model by the fact that there is no aspartate yet in that portion of the plate.

In       both negative control experiments no directional movement was observed.

Negative controls
The screening experimental set up
Based on our experiments, swimming plate assays can be used for library screening as follows. The bacterial culture needs to be grown in M9 at 30°C for at least one night before plating on swimming plates. After observing the desired movement       behavior, the responding bacteria can be selected by simply pipetting out of the plate the semi solid agar where a movement halo is visible and diluting it in LB. The culture then needs to be diluted and grown in M9 to get rid of any residual       attractant and can then be re-plated, starting the next round of selection.
Conclusion
We established a simple, inexpensive and relatively fast assay to screen large libraries of chemotactic mutants; complementing it with a model that can support the process of tuning multiple parameters.

Hanahan as a cloning strain with multiple mutations that enable high-efficiency transformations. The genomic structure of this strain is a singular circular chromosome consisting of 4,686,137 nucleotides, 4359 genes, and 4128 protein encoding genes. This strain also contains plasmids, and has the ability to accept plasmid insertion exceptionally well. Escherichia coli is the most commonly used host for high-yield expression of recombinant protein, usually by exploiting the high promoter specificity and transcriptional activity of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. However, several Escherichia coli host proteins also contain nonconsecutive histidine residues that exposed to the surface of their ternary structure (Robicon, et al, 2011). Escherichia coli strain BL21 and strain DH5α have cultured in Luria Bertani Agar media for 24 hours at 37°C. Then, we inoculate them in Luria Bertani Broth for 24 hours at 37°C. All media were supplemented with appropriate antibiotics as follows: chloramphenicol 170 μg/ml for maintaining the mini F′ plasmid pSB1C3 10 μg/ml for maintaining EDE1C8 constructs. Luria Bertani (LB) is a widely used bacterial culture medium but it has its origins in the field of bacteriophage genetics. LB medium is a rich medium that is commonly used to culture members of the Enterobacteriaceae as well as for coliphage plaque assays. LB and related media (such as SOC) are used extensively in recombinant DNA work and other molecular biology procedures.  Often an antibiotic is added to the sterilized medium to select for cells that contain a specific genetic element such as a plasmid, a transposon, or a gene disruption via an antibiotic resistance cassette (MacWilliams and Liao, 2013).

Robust public participation is essential in both the development and implementation of specific policies as well as in a broader, ongoing national conversation about science, technology, society, and values.
Conclusion
Each team had an interesting experience doing this collaboration. We had the chance to exchange different points of view from our different countries and we managed to write a great report out of those discussions. Unfortunately, we barely covered three areas of the issues concerning synthetic biology, therefore there are still many other things we could still discuss about.
A word from each team concerning their experience on that collaboration: Toulouse-INSA-UPS: “We are so very lucky to have been able to collaborate all together on this subject. As we discussed above, the ethics behind biological research have become more important than ever, and in the context of our growing and changing world, we need to focus on just that: we are a part of the world, not just our country or our iGEM project. This humans practices-oriented collaboration has shown us all the diversity in this competition, and we hope that next year’s projects can unite even more different cultural backgrounds in a common goal.”
NUSGEM (Singapore Team-A): “NUSGEM is happy to have worked with Team Toulouse-INSA-IPS and Team ULaval on this piece about the bioethical, economic and cultural considerations of Synthetic Biology, its businesses and its technology. The human practices based research conducted by each of our teams has been instrumental in helping us understand the different facets of synthetic biology. Learning aside, this collaboration also served to illustrate how collaboration between different teams is important not merely a transactional relationship, but a synergistic one. We learned more than the sum of our individual sections combined, as we have gained a more holistic understanding of the field of synthetic biology.”
ULaval: “Here at Team ULaval we consider ourselves extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to work with Toulouse-INSA-UPS and NUSGEM Singapore iGEM teams. The collaborative work done on the human practices aspect of the project allowed us to look at synthetic biology with a new eye and with a different perspective. As synthetic biology is an ever-changing domain, we need to constantly re-evaluate how it affects society. We think that by working with teams from around the world allowed us to think more critically about the implications of our work. As a team that participates to IGEM for the first time, being able to work with veteran teams was invaluable. We look forward to meeting our collaborators in person!”

The transformations that were re-done using the old batch of electrocompetent DH5-alpha cells turned out to have worked quite well, the negative ligation control plate had very few colonies whereas the plates containing the transformants had significantly more colonies, so very little background noise in our transformants. The transformations that were done with XL1-blue had tiny colonies on them, so we need to let them grow longer in the incubator before we can make any conclusions on them.
The remainder of the transformation cultures that were used to innoculate fresh LB media were measured using FACS, though as there were difficulties calibrating that spaceship and the uncertainty of FP references, data was obtained but there is bigger certainty that the BioLector measurements using single colonies will give more precise results.
The plates containing colonies from EXII (reference - 19-10-2010) were used to make O/N cultures for BioLector measurements, these colonies were also restreaked for future use.
BioLector measurements are set to take place tomorrow (21-10-2010).
All parts to be sent to iGEM are now ready.
19-10-2010 - Patrick - Antiterminator group
Seeming as the transformants were first plated at 21:00 last night, couldn't make any conclusions after having looked at the plates in the morning; these will be left until the evening and checked again.
As the newest batch of competent cells have some funky contamination, we re-did the transformations from yesterday using our oldest batch, although these are not extremely competent.
Giving this a second thought, the ligations were remade from scratch again, using more DNA content, adding more ligations as well now that J23101 and more of I13507 were digested and ready for ligations.
For these new ligations, a lab technician from another lab was kind enough to give us some XL1-blue electrocompetent cells which as we were told, were awesomely competent! :D
These actually being alot more efficient when wanting to induce high copy number ""mode"" in pSB2K3 with IPTG as this strain contains lacIq as apposed to DH5-alpha which only contains lacI.
Cultures have been prepared for FACS measurements for tomorrow.

Total volume per tube is 35uL. Each tube’s contents split into two wells (17.5µL per well), and gel was run on 80V p.d. for 45 minutes.
* Gel can help tell if any digestion occurred at all - if no digestion occurred plasmid would still remain circular, and circular plasmid would encounter more resistance migrating through the gel matrix than linear plasmid of the same size and hence appear to be bigger than expected when compared against the ladder.
Bands were excised and the heaviest chunk was 0.66g. 670uL of XP2
Binding Buffer was added to each excised chunk to initiate E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction protocol.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#BeyondTheLab#WikiTutorial_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM wiki this HTML framework cannot be modified. In other words, the layout and design has to be entered into the textbox on every edit page.
But as the layout and navigation bar is identical for every page, it is useful to have these elements at one central place, rather than copying the same information on every single wiki page. For this purpose MediaWiki can handle so-called templates. These templates are wiki pages themselves and can be included into other wiki page. The import of a template into another wiki page is accomplished by placing the name of the template between and opening ""{{:"" and a closing ""}}"", for example {{:Team:xyz/Templates/Layout}} will import the wiki page ""Team:xyz/Templates/Layout"". When this page is requested by a browser, the MediaWiki software will replace {{:Team:xyz/Templates/Layout}} with the content of the page Team:xyz/Templates/Layout (Please note, that MediaWiki always treats names in a case-sensitive manner). Another handy aspect about templates are so-called parameters that can serve as a placeholder for content. The great advantage araises from the fact, that you can import one template several times but each time you tell MediaWiki to replace the placeholder with another content. A placeholder or parameter is inserted by using ""{{{"" and ""}}}"" with the name of the placeholder inbetween. For example, the template page ""Team:xyz/Templates/Layout"" containing the placeholder ""{{{text}}}"" can be imported using {{:Team:xyz/Templates/Layout | text=This will be put into the template}}, where the {{{text}}} will be replaced by ""This will be put into the template"".
By now we already have enough knowledge to implement the basic layout of the wiki. We will use the table layout described above and, to provide an easy-to-use wiki, we will split this table into different template page. The figure summaries the basic structure of the wiki:

Later, during the investigation of the interactions in the process, the chemical group 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) was added to the N-terminus of the dipeptide, facilitating the self-assembly into typical amyloid-like fibrils [4] .
Follow-up studies demonstrated that it is possible to trigger the self-assembly of the dipeptide in solution. At a pH higher than 8, the dipeptide remains in solution but when lowering the pH levels to below 8 by gradually adding hydrochloric acid, a clear gel is formed [5] .
At alkaline pH, the molecules are negatively charged and therefore repelling each other. If the pH drops, protonation of the molecules occurs, neutralizing the negative charge and permitting the self-assembly of the dipeptide into fibers [6] . The formation of this mesh has been shown to be induced by exposing a solution of Fmoc-FF with gaseous CO2 [7] .
Peptidosome creation
This was the entry point for our project and we decided to use this method of exposing Fmoc-FF to gaseous CO2 for the creation of the Peptidosomes. The challenge was to build a closed spherical cage formed of Fmoc-FF layers surrounding a liquid core. In order accomplish this, we used an ultra-hydrophobic surface. When a droplet of water is deposited on an ultra-hydrophobic surface it will minimize the contact with this surface resulting in a droplet with a contact angle higher than 160°. In other words, the droplet will remain stable - almost forming a perfect sphere [8] .
To prepare a Peptidosome, a droplet of Fmoc-FF solution is placed on the ultra-hydrophobic PTFE membrane and it is directly exposed to CO2. This membrane allows CO2 to reach the entire surface of the droplet, even the small contact interface with the membrane.
Upon exposure with CO2 carbonic acid is formed when the gas comes into contact with water. The carbonic acid subsequently dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions causing the pH to decrease inside the droplet (Figure 2).
Cresol red was added as pH indicator to follow the pH drop during the experiment. A red / violet coloration can be seen in the basic pH. With acidification to a pH below 7.0, the solution turns yellow.

Ordered formal course of treatment, these antibiotic would effectly treat

However, treating with microbiotics may be associated with a rang of side effects, from some mild including gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea to severe like hearing loss, kidney damage. Some speculation from scientists postulated that exposition of high concentration utilization of antibiotics alter the host microbiota, especially the familiy of the probiotics, and this has been associated with chronic diseases.
The prodcution of antibiotics in pharmceutical companies explosively expanded these years. Articifical synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich the categories of antibiotics.
Antimicrobial Resistance and Abuses
As the matter of fact, microbiotics, the great saver of our life, is now putting us in potentially tremendous disaster both environmentally and physiologically.
Emergence of antimicrobial resistance is theoratically predictable by evolutionary potential. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains physiologically improved of their cell bodies or genetically enhanced capacity of mutagenesis and gene horizontal transfer like conjugation.
Because of such horizontal genetic exchange, nowadays, efficacy loss may attribute to the emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains. For instance, tuberculosis(TB) in China becomes more difficult with administration with previous antibiotic substances owing to elevating level of antimicribrial resistence, which raised great challenge on Chinese public health. Besides, the discovery of NDM-1(New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase) in Klebsiella pneumoniae from a Swedish patient of Indian origin in 2008 once may contribute to severe disaster on that broad of beta-lactan antibiotics.
Though, antimicrobial resistance can be transferred through evolutionary theory, main contribution of increasing antibiotic resistance comes from individuals' inappropriate antibiotics treatment, overuse of antibiotics without prescription from professional doctor, instead from self-prescription.
Demonstrably, attribution of antibiotic resistance not only from clinically, but from agriculture and animal husbandry. In China, the overuse of antibiotics for animal is the same serious as the clinical therapy. In farms or hospitals, solution containing antibiotics directly emittes to river,"

We then place the gel into another container with Destaining Buffer and it can be put on shaker overnight for the destaining. The bands are usually clearly visible the next morning.  
Western Blot
Before setting up the cassettes we place Whatman filter papers into Transfer Buffer, and the nitrocellulose membrane into methanol first for a few minutes then into Transfer Buffer as well.
One of the Whatman papers is placed in the cassette and flattened with the rolling apparatus gently so there are no bubbles trapped.
The membrane is placed on to the first paper and the gel is placed onto the membrane. The second layer of Whatman paper goes onto the gel. After placing each layer we roll over them with the apparatus again gently to smooth out the bubbles.
We place this cassette inside the tank and it is set to Turbo -> Mini Gel -> Run for a 7-minute transfer.
While the transfer is occurring we prepare the Blocking Buffer with 5% dry milk. This solution can be used up to a few times so we do not discard it.
When the transfer is over we take the membrane out with tweezers gently and the top corner is marked to know which side is up.
The membrane is placed inside the milk solution and incubated inside the shaker for 2 hours.
Then we place the membrane carefully into the 1st Antibody solution and keep it rocking on the shaker for another 2 hours.
The membrane is placed into another container after, and we put enough TBS-T to cover it, leaving it rocking for another 5 minutes. Afterwards the membrane is washed twice, first for 5 then for 10 minutes.

In addition, multiple tandem integrants became single integrants after the marker excision. This is because the Flp recombinase mediated the recombination of all the FRT sites of the multiple integrants until only a single FRT site was present in the Phi80 locus. The marker excision is a powerful tool to engineer microbial strains for industrial protein manufacturing because the engineered organism should not carry unsafe antibiotic resistances that may be diffused in the environment.
The fluorescence phenotype confirmed the correct integration into the E. coli chromosome. As expected, in general multiple integrants showed a higher fluorescence than the single integrants.
The BioBrick compatibility and the vector modularity give the possibility to the scientific community to stably engineer novel biological functions in E. coli with a very easy and user friendly methodology. A user’s handbook about the vector usage is shared in the Registry, as well as the users experiences and the compatibility information.
<partinfo>BBa_K300001</partinfo> - BioBrick integrative base vector for S. cerevisiae
The integration capability of this vector has been tested in S288C S. cerevisiae strain (<partinfo>BBa_K300979</partinfo>). Here is reported the followed protocol and the obtained results.
Protocol:
S288C strain (Open Biosystems) was inoculated in 5 ml of YPD from a long term 15% glycerol stock and grown for 24h (30°C, 200rpm).
The culture was diluted 1:10 in 50 ml of pre-warmed YPD in a 250 ml flask and was grown for additional 4 hours under the same conditions as before.
Cells were pelleted (4000 rpm, 5 min) and resuspended in 25 ml of deionized water.
Cells were pelleted (4000 rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of deionized water and transferred into a 1.5 ml tube.
Cells were pelleted (4000 rpm, 30 sec), the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in deionized water to a final volume of 1 ml (vortex mix vigorously).
Three 100 ul aliquots were transferred into 1.5 ml tubes, while the remaining 600 ul of cells were not used in this protocol.
The three tubes were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 30 sec) and the supernatant discarded.

Secondly, Yuwei Huang started to introduce iGEM to the audience, which was also the most important part of this talk. He started with the history of iGEM and its  recent development. Then, Mingjun Zhang introduceed the primary responsibillities of members who want to participate in the competition. After that, some main contributions that iGEM has made to the development of synthetic biology were also introduced, including the construction of RSBP and some novel ideas raised from the competition. In addition, some achievements that the previous teams made were also included in this part.
At last, this speech was concluded with the introduction of our own project. Since the time was limited, we just introduced the basic ideas and the important progresses of our project. We also illustrated some of our results from experiments, human practice and wiki.

Tomorrow, Katie and I will be testing out all of our lab equipment and making necessary corrections/streamlining activities. Once this is completed, everything can be replicated to the green lab and the lab component will be basically complete. (Katie rocks)
We are also toying with the idea of using Katie’s item script to drop completed lab mission products in the robots, and allowing users to get ‘prizes’ as a result. However, we currently are lacking prizes to be given so that must be brainstormed. Ideally, we want it to have something to do with synthetic bio, our island, and even the lab missions themselves (which are largely elaborate made up applications). These must still be completed.
Wiki Ease of Navigation
Did the daily update for both sponsors and blog/update pages. Editted Fahd’s article about NUTV, and posted that along with the video of our news coverage.  Filling out of notebook began today. I still need to write the description of what the notebook is (I think emphasizing that we want to document our activities OUTSIDE the lab as well in our notebook might be a good idea, as I don’t think it’s been done before).
Kevin noted that it was difficult to navigate between notebook pages, but from the looks of the Team: Warsaw page, the coding is extremely complicated (I might ask Patrick about it tomorrow if he has time). Instead, we have included links to days through the month’s calendar in the sidebar, allowing easy access between days. With the fixed template, I sent it to Jamie, Carol, Emily, and Kevin, and they have helpfully put up the new template on all the days (including weekends) from MAY until AUGUST, making it easier for the people who post afterwards. I am trying to find an easier way to post/code tables, esp. for Jeremy because his tables are GINORMOUS, and we need an easy way to do that. :P
Also prepped the Acknowledgements page for Prima to fill in and the Protocols page for Carol.
Looking at Heidelberg, their ‘guide’ to the Wiki really only takes you through 6 critical areas of their wiki and sometimes he is hard to find, I am thinking of implementing a navigational guide (NOT in mascot form) that opens in a new window when people click that they need help. Still playing with these ideas.

Step Two: Utilizing Wheat Resistance Genes
To determine the virulence of the detected race of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), we are engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 to display Sr35, a stem rust resistance gene from Triticum monococcum on its surface. While not yet incorporated into commercial wheat lines, it has the potential to provide wheat with immunity to many highly virulent races of Pgt. Sr35 has been shown to interact directly with its corresponding effector from Pgt, AvrSr35.
The goal of this stage of the project is to produce a fluorescent signal by bimolecular fluorescence complementation when AvrSr35 from Pgt is present. Therefore, when Pgt spores are detected in the detecting stage, the profiling stage will determine the virulence to Sr35. If a fluorescent signal is produced in both parts, although Pgt is present, any crops containing Sr35 will not be infected and do not need to be treated; they will have innate immunity to the fungus. However, if no fluorescence occurs, the spores are virulent to crops protected by Sr35 and the crops will need to be treated to protect them from further infection.
Sr35 will be tagged on the C-terminus with cYFP with a Gly8 linker. The fully assembled structure will produce fluorescence when Sr35 is activated. The placement of c"
DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#Other assembly systems_-_-_TEXT.html,"A method is based on use of restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, which means that illegal restriction recognition sites need to be eliminated. The method also leaves a scar between the BioBricks. Another disadvantage of the 3A assembly is the requirement for plasmids to contain three different antibiotic markers. Furthermore, the 3A method can only combine two parts at a time.
Gibson Assembly
Gibson Assembly is an isothermal, single-reaction method for assembling multiple overlapping DNA fragments. The method was developed by Daniel G. Gibson at the J. Craig Venter Institute in 2009.
The assembly system employs 5´-T5 exonuclease, Phusion DNA polymerase, and Taq ligase. Gibson can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA fragments. This method makes it possible to join DNA molecules that are as large as 583kb and clone joined products in E. coli with a length up to 300kb. Among the advantages is that it takes the same amount of time to ligate N number of DNA fragments as for two DNA fragments [3].
The way it's done
The isothermal 5´-T5 exonuclease removes the bases from the 5'-end of double stranded DNA, leaving a recess in the DNA. The ssDNA overhang is used to assemble the DNA fragments.
The T5 exonuclease is inactivated during the incubation at 50ºC. Phusion polymerase and Taq ligase fills the gaps of the annealed complementary ssDNA overhangs and seals the nicks in the ends, leaving a joined DNA molecule ready for transformation [3] .
Difference between Plug'n Play assembly and Gibson Assembly
One of the disadvantages of the Gibson assembly is that the primers for the assembly are more expensive due to the 40 bp extra nucleotides the primers have to be flanked with. The Gibson assembly is not as specific as USER cloning, where there is nicked at a uracil instead of chewing back from the end point.
Gateway assembly
The Gateway® cloning technology is based on a site-specific recombination system of the lambda bacteriophage provided by Invitrogen.  The lambda phage can change between the lytic and the lysogenic life cycle by enzymes called clonases. The recombination occurs between phage and DNA of E. coli via specific recombination sequences denoted as att sites (4).  On the phage genome attP sites are found, and on the host bacterial genome attB sites are found. After recombination the att sites, hybrid sequences"

The intein-bacteriocin protein is then extracted by use of French press that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. The cell lysates are poured onto prepared chitin beads that allow affinity chitin-binding of the intein-bacteriocin fusion. By use of a cleavage buffer containing a thiol-reagent, we induce cleavage between the intein tag and the bacteriocin protein. This results in native bacteriocin elutes.

Figure 1 illustrates the removal of the hybrid bacteriocin Laterosporulin-ThuricinS from the pSB1C3 vector into the pTXB1 vector. This is schematically illustrated via SnapGene History.
For the IMPACT procedure, the vector pTXB1 was used. The vector pTXB1 contains a mini-intein (Mxe GyrA intein) that has been modified to undergo thiol-induced cleavage at its N-terminus. At its C-terminus the intein tag contains a chitin binding domain (CBD) that allows affinity purification on a chitin column (IMPACT Kit) . The target protein - in this case our bacteriocins - is fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the intein tag marked by the MCS (Multiple cloning site), shown in Figure 1. With the use of a cleavage buffer that contains dithiothreitol (DTT), the vector allows protein purification of a target protein, by thiol-induced cleavage, at the site between the intein tag and the target protein. The results were obtained through cloning into NdeI and SapI sites, which allow the target proteins to be cleaved without any residual amino acids. In order to clone the bacteriocins into the pTXB1 vector from pSB1C3, specific primers were designed to add compatible restriction sites that included the restriction sites for NdeI and SapI.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"
