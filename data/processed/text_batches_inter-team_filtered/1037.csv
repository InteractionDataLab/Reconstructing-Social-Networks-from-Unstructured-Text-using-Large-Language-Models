Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment"

Report - summary
Nowadays, in the big data era, medicine will be inevitably transformed by systems biology. Rapid developments in deep sequencing, metabolomics and so called ""personal medicine"" have already changed medical sciences. Hence, we would like to add a valuable contribution to that healthcare transition by proposing a more synthetic biology-oriented approach for medicine. Our project ‘Cellulare’ touches both healthcare transformation for data analysis and optimal allocation of deficit resources. Our question is how to design a hospital only having access to limited resources, equip it in modern technologies (biomedical and IT), and finally how to combine modern technology and pro-ecological design in order to improve the work of healthcare. To address this difficult issue, we developed Future Lanthan Hospital Model, which is aimed to show that recovery of lanthanides (rare earth elements) from electronic waste  (smartphones, tablets etc.) by synthetic biology methods, could be a beneficial supporting strategy for a modern hospital. We have proposed integration of a hospital with a supplementary synthetic biology lab,  in which lanthanide remediation project could take place. First, such a solution would contribute to the public image of the hospital as a rationally functioning  institution with  eco-friendly profile. Secondly, it could allow to equip the hospital in modern technologies based on rare-earth metals. Simultaneously, we suggest mechanism design (engineering part of the economy) and the stable matching algorithm allowing better resource-management that would address the needs of the patients. By Future Lanthan Hospital Model we would like to show beneficial changes for society resulted from implementation of modern technologies in medicine  and  educate people about  applications, safety and some security problems related to cutting-edge technologies. In the end we also aim to provide a contribution to the processing of medical data and open source science, since in the era of big data in medicine such measures seems to be necessary for the rapid transformation of the healthcare.

Waterloo,2011,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," several classes of antibiotics. This makes MRSA infections a serious threat in both health and economical aspects.
The infection could be easily transferred directly (through regular skin-to-skin contact), as well as indirectly (through contamination of surfaces). The ease with which infection could occur, as well as the high mortality rate involved with the infection, make MRSA a serious threat to the health of patients worldwide (Durai et al., 2010.) There are only a few methods, which currently exit for MRSA screening. These are plating, liquid-broth inoculation, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays. While these will be discussed in further detail later on in the report, it is important to note that these methods could be costly and time consuming, and could sometimes present incorrect results (Durai et al., 2010.)
In 2010, the International Genetically Engineered team at the university of Waterloo had been working on a method which can be used in supplement to the already-existing ones for the detection of MRSA infections. It is a proof of concept for diagnosing the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in an infection site before it has had the chance to create an infection. This synthetic biology–based diagnostic method will take advantage of the quorum sensing mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus, and utilize Escherichia coli as the sensor and reporter.  For more information with regards to the Design of the Staphiscope please see the University of Waterloo’s 2010 iGEM Page: https://2010.igem.org/Team:Waterloo
Who are the “Competitors”?
Treatment of an S. aureus infection is of extreme importance, as outcomes can range from simple pustules to death. Early detection and treatment of S. aureus carriers can reduce healthcare costs and greatly improve the health of the patient. There are only a few methods currently available to hospitals for the diagnosis of S. aureus infection. These methods are time consuming, expensive and, in some cases, not very reliable. The purpose of the Staphiscope is to provide the option of accelerating the method of detecting S. aureus, without compromising reliability. It will be a particularly useful tool in speeding up the conventional methods of serial plating.
The following section analyzes the current products on the market and compares them to the Staphiscope.

There was the right tendency for AP_light and AP_dark after one hour. For further experiments the incubation time should be increased. The Dickinson phage target_133 exhibited higher phage titer than SP_Opto. For AP_dark this is not surprising as this phage don't contain EL222 and therefore activates the psp-promoter. But it should not activate the promoter of AP_light, pBLind. As it was suspected that the Dickinson phage is superior in its propagation cycle due to e.g. packing ability, a phage containing a non-binding EL222 should be created.

In the spirit of iGEM, our project’s aim is to design new biological systems that will make synthetic biology more accessible and friendly. Our team plans to achieve this by constructing a bio-electric interface, designing new selectable and counterselectable markers and characterising Citrobacter freundii to start a dialogue on what a synthetic-biology specific chassis should look like. For more detailed information on each of these sub-projects, refer to the links in the navigation menu on the left.

Project Abstract
Bioelectric interface
As part of our project we will attempt to create a bioelectric interface - a way to connect biological and electronic systems in a standardised, inducible and quantifiable way.
To achieve our goal we will use the MtrCAB proteins (cytochromes, proteins that mediate electron transport) from Shewanella oneidensis. We will transform E. coli with these genes along with a ccm gene cluster (cytochrome c maturation proteins) and couple it to an inducible promoter such as the Ars or Lac promoters which are induced by arsenate or lactose/IPTG.
As a result, we should be able to obtain a system"
Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices2_-_-_TEXT.html," it safer to use Curdlan rather than copper sulfate ?
1. Copper Sufate
For the Environment Even if copper is essential for life at low doses, it is environmentally toxic at higher doses. Not being biodegradable, it spreads through rain water in soils and in river waters. It accumulates on the soils and vineyards are polluted. Its spread is facilitated by water and wind erosion. This element has been used many times to treat mildew which has resulted in it’s accumulation in the Aquitaine region.
This compound also modifies the biosphere since it is toxic for worms and microorganisms living in vineyard soils. Furthermore, copper sulfate does not distinguish harmful and beneficial fungi. It disrupts, for example, the development of mycorrhiza fungi that live in symbiosis with the plant’s root to help the access to nutrients from the soil to the vegetal. The microfungi that decompose the material to fertilize the soil are also in danger.
These effects are poorly seen on an area not exceeding the current authorized limit in organic farming (4 kg of copper per hectare per year, according to AFSSA (French Agency for Food Safety)). However, in terms of conventional agriculture, there is no limit for this substance. The measure reduces the damage to the biosphere but isn’t sufficient:  copper sulfate is tolerated but not banished. It is therefore necessary to take more drastic measures by reducing the use of this substance.
For Humans Through the food chain, copper is an essential element for life at low doses. It is found in insects, fish, mammals and all herbivores, carnivores or omnivores. However, it is harmful if swallowed or inhaled, in cases of skin contact, eye contact (hence the compulsory wearing of gloves masks and glasses during our project) and is very toxic to aquatic organisms. We must not underestimate the long-term effects of chronic copper use.
Also, the copper-related risks are increased if added residues of this product from agricultural cultures, other food sources containing copper as tap water. Living near the wine places, like winemakers, are the most exposed.
Indeed, when it accumulates in the body, it is in too large quantities, it would affect the removal system of the beta-amyloid protein in the brain. This is harmful to the nervous system and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The protein, in excess in patients, is a peptide which is mainly aggregates (plaques) characteristics of the disease, and is present in soluble form in healthy patients.
In humans, it is known that copper occurs naturally and in normal amounts"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernat"

Figure 7: Model for how TlpB Senses Acid: In low pH conditions (shown on the left), TlpB’s periplasmic domain is ina ‘‘relaxed’’ or expanded state due to decreased hydrogen bonding to ureaand consequent lowered urea-binding affinity. However, in high or moreneutral pH conditions, TlpB’s periplasmic domain is in a ‘‘tense’’ or condensedstate with increased urea-binding affinity. The state of the periplasmic domainis relayed through the transmembrane region, which affects CheA’s phosphorylationstate, ultimately affecting the flagellar motor and dictating stoppingbehavior. TlpB dimer is shown in orange, CheA in red, CheW in green, urea inpurple, protons in blue, and phosphate in black..
By sequence analysis, H. pylori TlpB is organized like a typical member of the MCP superfamily of transmembrane receptors with two transmembrane helices (tm1, tm2) per subunit bracketing an extracellularsensing domain[2,7]. The extracellular-sensing domain is responsible for detecting ligands directly or indirectly via interactions with periplasmic-binding proteins. Continuing from tm2, the C-terminal portion of the MCP is cytoplasmic and mostly helical. It contains a histidine kinase, adenylyl cyclase, methyl-binding protein, phosphatase (HAMP) domain, followed by a helical domain and a segment that binds to the CheA/CheW histidine autoki-nase complex[2,8]. Phosphorylation of CheA in response to an extracellular signal in turn controls downstream compo-nents that modulate activity of the flagellar motor. MCPs dimerize at the membrane, forming a four helix bundle with ligand-binding domains in the periplasm, whereas trimers of dimers assemble with CheA and CheW to form a high-perfor-mance signaling array located in the cytoplasm[2,9].
In low pH conditions , TlpB’s periplasmic domain is in a ‘‘relaxed’’ or expanded state due to decreased hydrogen bonding to urea and consequent lowered urea-binding affinity.

BostonU,2017,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,", this poll validated our choice of nine synthetic biology protocols to move onto microfluidic devices housed in the MARS archive.
Phenomyx
During the course of the Fall semester the team also had to opportunity to tour Phenomyx, a microfluidics startup located at LabCentral in Boston. The tour was led by Salil Desai, their founder and Chief Technology Officer, who took us through their fabrication and testing space. During the course of the tour we were able to learn from his industry experience in microfluidic devices.
While discussing our fluid functionality checklist we were able to discuss our quantitative and qualitative metrics in some detail. A key point of the discussion was the importance of utilizing general metrics, instead of protocol or design specific metrics, when grading a chip. This way we can ensure that our system can be applied to chips at large without being specific to individual designs. This advice has been integral as we ensured that our finalized protocol used metric we were able to apply to any device design. The possibility of integrating our checklist into a software system was also pitched as a possible progression of MARS. Although we were unable to meet this goal for 2017, it provides an exciting direction for future iGEM teams to build on our project.
Black Hole Lab
Over the summer we were in contact with Black Hole Lab who manufacture plug and play microfluidics for researchers. As we were in the beginning stages of fabrication, we had many questions for them regarding manufacturing processes and what standards they recommended in order to ensure quality control. Although they were unable to provide us with “industry standards” to utilize, Black Hole Lab advised us to build our checklist around our fabrication method. Many of the suggestions they made such as:
Checking the milled dimensions of primitives and channels
Testing the maximum pressure chips can withstand
Checking if the chip leaks or the seal breaks
were integrated into our preliminary checklists. In fact, testing for a channel’s maximum pressure and checking for seal leaks became two of the key quantitative and qualitative pillars in our final Fluid Functionality Checklist. To see how these were integrated into our Fluid Functionality Checklist, please click here:

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#fba_-_-_TEXT.html," (FBA) is a methodology that uses optimisation to get predictions from a constraint-based model by invoking an assumption of optimal cell behaviour. Basically, one particular state among those that cells can show, accordingly to a constraint-based model, is chosen based on the assumption that cells have evolved to be optimal, i.e., that cells regulate its fluxes toward optimal flux states. The following procedure is used to develop a flux balance analysis model:
Flux balance analysis is used to investigate hypothesis (e.g., test if a reduced uptake capacity can be the cause of an unexpected cell behaviour) and to evaluate a range of possibilities (e.g, find the best combination of substrates).
Metabolic objectives and optimization
It must be taken into account that FBA predictions, the optimal flux state, may not correspond to the actual fluxes exhibited by cells. To support the assumption of optimal behaviour, it must be hypothesised that: (i) cells, forced by evolutionary pressure, evolved to achieve an optimal behaviour with respect to certain objective, (ii) we know which this objective is, and (iii) the objective can be expressed, at least approximately, in convenient mathematical terms.
Clearly, predictions of flux balance analysis are dependent on the objective function being used. To date, the most commonly used objective function has been the maximisation of biomass, which leaded to predictions consistent with experimental data for different organisms, such as Escherichia coli [3].
Genome-scale and plant models
FBA is widely used for predicting metabolism, in particular the genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions that have been built in the past decade.  These reconstructions contain all of the known metabolic reactions in an organism,   and the genes that encode each enzyme.  In our case, FBA will calculate the flow of metabolites through our metabolic network to obtain the maximum production of pheromone. It must be noted that plant genome-scale models are very rare   and, indeed, plant FBA is a very new research topic. One of the very few available plant models is the AraGEM model [4], a genome-scale of Arabidopsis Thaliana.

Our mail to Grenoble IGEM team
Dear Grenoble İGEM team,
With a great project comes a great responsibility of finding the best solution  to the safety issues we encounter and most oftenly, figuring the main safety areas that needs concentrating on can be pretty difficult. This year iGEM  has introduced strict rules and regulations for safety which is a clear  indication of how much effort and importance they are expecting us to show!
So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety plans but will also increase the probability of reaching our aimed destinations. The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity to form a platform where we can discuss our safety issues, what we have done to overcome them and the main parts that have challenged us the most.
After reading your abstract a few questions on the safety of your projects popped into our minds. If you are interested in forming a discussion platform, we would be delighted  receive your answers as this, on the day of the platform will enable your team to see how much progression was made with safety from today onwards.
We would be really grateful to read your questions on the safety of our project too J
iGEM cares about safety, so do we! Lets take a step together and make a change in how we handle this caseJ

Their Response
  Dear ATOMS-TÜRKİYE iGEM Team 2013,
I am Stewart Humble, a member of the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU Team for 2013.  I was asked to give a quick informal overview and comparison with our project and my previous research at LSU to address some of the biosafety issues and questions that may arise for our team.
As an undergraduate at LSU, I performed my thesis work on the synthesis and cellular investigations of a specific photosensitizer that is a chlorophyll derivative called Chlorin e6.  My work concentrated on the applications of this photosensitizer in the clinical process known as photodynamic therapy (PDT).  PDT is used to destroy tumors, and involves three key components:  a photosensitizer, light, and tissue oxygen.

However, the results for mtr complexes were weird. So we picked a few cultures and grew them overnight for further analysis.
All gels were 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, 1kb ladder(Invitrogen) (on the right). We also noticed that something was not right with our gel viewing box as the images turned out to be very dark even at max exposure.
August 17th
Another busy day, so firstly about mtr complex. We purified the plasmids from yesterdays colonies using our usual NucleoSpin Plasmid kit and then digest them with FastDigest enzymes:
Triplet consists of: 1. Control 2. PstI digest 3. EcoRI & SpeI digest. First three triplets are of the mtr ORFs only construct and the last one (a lot of it!) is the one with promoter. Even though the gel is faint we can see the most important thing: double digests separate the pSB1C3(2kb) backbone and our part (5.3kb). The PstI digest also confirms the prohibited PstI cutting site within mtrC sequence (present in the genome). 1% agarose dyed with SYBR-Safe, 1kb ladder(Invitrogen) (on the right).
Using the primers we designed earlier we do the Site-Directed Mutagenesis on each of the mtr constructs, which should remove the PstI cutting site from where it should not be present but still retaining the aminoacid sequence. We also finish it up with DpnI digestion to remove any background and then transform the cells.
In the meantime, we did similar to mtr digestions on the peptide parts we cloned earlier. Again on NucleoSpin purified plasmids with FastDigest enzymes.
Each plasmid was ran on the gel in triplets: 1. uncut control 2. XbaI & SpeI digest 3. EcoRI & PstI digest. Both gels show the same peptides mentioned earlier from different colonies picked yesterday. The gel shows us that the peptides are actually there within the pSB1C3 with working prefixes and suffixes (there was only a slight nuisance with the 3rd peptide). 1% agarose gels dyed with either ethidium bromide(left) or SYBR-Safe(right), QStep4 ladder.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," the definition of diversity as:
Getting representation from people of all different backgrounds, whether that be racially, sexual orientation, gender, socio-economic background. It is just representing people who are different
This goes further than organisations like the Royal Society of Biology and the Institute of physics who, whilst declaring they want to make their fields as equality, diverse and inclusive as possible, predominantly represent gender, ethnicity, disability and socio-economic background as diversity. Alec went further saying:
It is the whole core of who we are: where we come from, our background, gender, religion, our sexuality, but also hobbies, interests, friends and families
This is more in line with the Royal Society of Chemistry’s definition which includes: age, marriage/civil partnership, pregnancy, first language and geography amongst the more inclusive definition of diversity. We wanted to understand whether universities are doing enough to promote this kind of inclusivity and accessibility but individually what both the students and academics were doing to make university accessible.
The universities are responding both to the opinions of the students and the staff in (scientific) bodies, but also the top down drivers...Are they doing enough? They are starting to improve the amount they are doing
-Dr Rob Wilson
This echoes much of what we heard from academics previously, that there is a significant improvement to equality and diversity, but there is still a long way to go. Alec James emphasised these points saying:
It’s the responsibility of the university to remove those barriers, so that everyone has the opportunity to come here and the university has Widening Participation high on their agenda
. What was interesting is that Dr Hill highlighted how the university is changing the way it takes new students into the university considering the socio-economic status, in an attempt to make the university more diverse, which is a very positive, forward perspective. However, Laura had a stark opposing view:
I would disagree in saying the university does enough to drive diversity. I was one of two other black girls on my course, and that is quite sad to see
Laura did go on to say that she recognises the university is working hard on Widening Participation activities and there is improvement, but her opinion stands out as shocking, and a reminder that we have to have a significant improvement in inclusivity for the effects to be widely shown and felt. The discussion went on to talk about whether the university was excluding students through events like the recent Snowsports White T-shirt social in which offensive comments were exposed, and conclusively both academics and students completely condemned this behaviour, and encouraged that measures were being put in place to prevent this from happening again.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Microbiology_-_-_TEXT.html," of C6–C3–C6. Depending on their structures, flavonoids may be classified into about a dozen groups, such as chalcones, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins.
If we take a deeper look in the anthocyanin structure, we observe that it’s composed of :
a chroman ring
an additional aromatic ring on C2
There are 31 different monomeric anthocyanins known. They differ from number and position of the hydroxyl and/or methyl, ether groups.
But, 90% of the naturally occurring anthocyanins are based on only six common anthocyanidins. among them :
Cyanidin,the major form in nature
Malvidin, the most commonly found in wine
As we can see in this figure, they only differ by their cycle B groups, so the chroman ring remains unchanged.
Therefore, we believe that enzymes able of degrade a lot of different types of anthocyanins would preferably attack the chroman ring structure as it is well conserved among the family.
Thus, we thought that the ideal cheap substitute molecule should present a very similar basic structure.
After some researches, Quercetin, a flavonol molecule, appeared to be a good competitor.
We can in fact see that the only difference remains in the presence of a carbonyl group in 4. Another advantage is that Quercetin is present in Wine, and is partly responsible for its color. Thus, even though the assays may find some enzymes able to degrade specifically quercetin instead of anthocyanin, we should have a decrease in the wine stain color intensity. In addition, because of the co-pigmentation chemical interaction between quercetin and anthocyanin, degrading quercetin could also have an impact on anthocyanin stability.
For these reasons, quercetin was chosen as our substitute molecules for running the microbiological assays.
However, in parallel, we decided to develop a protocol for purifying anthocyanin from grapes, so that we could also tests our microbes directly on anthocyanin. (See the Anthocyanin section for the evolution of the protocol).
Week 11th - 17th July
We are looking into the microbes that could be able to degrade quercetin.

We realized that in order to have a comprehensive point of view over a problem, we also need to cover the perspective from the members of the public. Advices and opinions from the experts should be taken into consideration while doing the project. Thus, the integrated work between the wetlab, drylab, and the policy and practices could be achieved. To share our project and educate the society is also one of the fundamental part of the scientist.The following video would summarize some of the activities that we had done, such as seminar, socialization, and interview with the experts.

I’m at the Univesity Olimpics when I have to take the inoculi from the thermoshaker, so Andrea kindly does it for me.      The screening, again, confirms my second Part K731010 . At this point I have the building blocks to make my Composite Parts, using araC-pBAD as promoter, which is made by Ross.
I and Ross then decide to start with araCpBad: we digest CysE with E and S, araCpBad with X and P and pSB1C3 with E and P. Ligation and transformation into Nova follow.
I began focusing my attention of the characterization of araC-pBAD. I chose two different parts to do that, BBa_E0840 ad BBa_E0240. The two BioBricks are composed of a strong or medium RBS followed by the same gene, GFPmut3b. I will test promoter behaviour in presence or absence of glucose, differences in expression with the two different RBS and eventually differences when using a high copy or low copy plasmid. I waited for sequencing results to start amplifying all the parts I need. I also had time to have a BBQ at Giacomo's house for my birthday and to give an exam the next day!
Me and Giacomo stayed in the lab all the weekend to advance the project. We did lots of things from PCR to mutate illegal sites, PCR to insert BB prefix and suffix on the plasmid we are creating, some transformations and a lot of screenings! We also had lots of fun on saturday evening, and the all night long partying m,ade us really sleepy and tired the next day.
I went on constructing my first BioBrick, which is K731300: it consists of LacI-LacIq into pSB1C3. Everything went right, and on 13th June I announce the birth of my first construct, after attending the endless run of a giant 2% agarose gel (I waited for about three hours…!) .
In the rest of the week I kept on isolating and purifying some low-copy plasmids that could have been useful in the future.

Epilogue
Calibration experiments
Before starting cell measurements work, we accomplished three sets of calibration measurements with materials provided by the committee, including an OD600 reference point, a particle standard curve and a fluorenscein standard curve. These tests and data greatly facilitated our following quantitative interlab experiments.
Calibration 1 OD600 reference point and LUDOX
According to the protocol, we performed three calibration experiments (OD600 reference point, particle standard curve and the fluorescence standard curve) before the body part began.
In this experiment, we first uesd LUDOX CL-X provided by the committee to obtain a conversion factor as the intermediate variable between Abs600 and OD600 measurement. The LUDOX solution (45% colloidal silica suspension) is hardly scattering and gives a low absorbance value, making it an ideal material for correct the standard path length of spectrophotometers in different laboratories, which would greatly improve the accuracy of the following volume dependent experiments.
Results shown below.
Fig.1 OD600 reference point
4 replicates are measured respectively to acquire the average Abs600 of LUDOX CL-X solution and dH2O. Reference OD600 is given by the iGEM authority. The ratio of OD600/Abs600 is 3.652.
Calibration 2 Particle Standard Curve
After standardizing the absorbance value, we managed to conclude a conversion factor between Abs600 and the estimated number of cells. In this experiment, we used the silica beads delivered by iGEM committee and made a serial dilution in the 96-well plate according to the protocol. The beads’ size and optical charateristics are similar to cells and its concentration (amount of particles per volume)is known, allowing us to conduct a standard curve of particle concentration in 4 replicates.

Collaborations
Overview
Collaboration is always important in the science community, let alone the iGEM competition. It is important for different teams to exchange ideas with each other, as well as help each other to deal with difficulties and solve problems. The iGEMers from all over the world are in a big family and there is no doubt to give each other a hand. Besides, it is also important to propagate iGEM to new people and help them establish a new team.
 
This year, our team Nanjing-China formed close collaborations with three iGEM teams and helped to establish two new undergraduate iGEM teams.

Collaborations with other iGEM teams
 
1. Team Tianjin
 
At the beginning of the summer vocation, team Tianjin contacted us for help and support. They wanted a kind of bacteria called Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. We eagerly contacted Prof. Aijun Liao in our university asking for this species, cultivating it and then mailed Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 timely. After that, when they encountered some difficulties cultivating this species, we assisted them to get technical support about the conditions for culturing this kind of bacteria.
 
Later, in CCiC conference, we are pleased to know that team Tianjin managed to use Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 successfully and achieved crucial experiment results based on this species. Therefore, we took a picture with each other’s posters together to witness this collaborations. Besides, some of the team members in team Tianjin or team Nanjing-China made great friends and team Tianjin gave special gifts to us during CCiC to express their thanks.
 
 
2. Team NEFU-China
 
We got in touch with NEFU-CHINA during the CCiC conference by asking questions after their presentations. Most of our team members were really interested in their project so we meet them after the Q&A time of the presentation. In this meeting, our team members came up with some great ideas to improve their project. What’s more, when advisors in team NEFU-China put forward their difficulties of proceeding experiments, we offered to share some equipment with them and invited them to our lab. All of the teachers and students in team NEFU-China are excited about this invitation and expressed intense interests in collaboration. Therefore, about one month later, they invited us to their lab for a"
London_Biohackspace,2015,Team:London Biohackspace#blog_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Sponsored by the Royal Society of chemistry, the show aims to answer the most pressing question in synthetic biology like: What is a spider goat? Can we create artificial life? And why haven’t we made a real Jurassic Park yet… along with discussing the potentials of biobricks and genetic engineering.  Also all the attendees of the lecture received information about iGEM and the London BioHackers stickers to take away with them.  Shows were presented everyday from the 8/8/2015 to the 29/8/2015 with each week the London Biohackers iGEM presentation evolving as the project evolved.  We will have more feedback through in the coming weeks.
On the radio ...
Saturday 8th August 2015
To further our aims to open up synthetic biology to the wider community we have been looking for media opportunities to share the igem ideas to the community.  The initial contact was made during SynbioBeta which was held in April at Imperial college.  Bringing together a large section of the UK  Synthetic biology community with great international speakers to.  During the event the London Biohackers were asked to comment for the BBC … this then grew into a full blown interview that took place in the London Biohacker Lab in the Hackspace in Hackney.  FutureProofing is a new series in which presenters Timandra Harkness and Leo Johnson examine the implications - social and cultural, economic and political - of the big ideas that are set to transform the way our society functions.  The London Biohackersg iGEM team meet with Jonathan Brunert the producer of Future Proofing and Leo Johnson to talk about the development of the biohacking community, the labs itself, our ethics and safety practices, how we achieved CL1 Status, the iGEM project that team is currently working, and the impact synthetic biology will have on how things are made in the future.  The show aired on Wednesday 12th of August  and was repeated on Saturday 15th of August.  We were honoured to be speaking alongside some of the most important people working in the field of synthetic biology today. – Craig Venter, Jim Ajoika and the Cambridge arsenic biosensor team, Jennifer Doudna, Daisy Ginsberg and FBI Special Agent Ed.  For the article we have received very favourable feedback and alot of interest in future projects involving the labs facilities. Please listen and give us feedback on what you think we should talk about in future discussions.

Sequencing was performed with a new FLO-MIN106 R9.4 flowcell on a MinION sequencer with the MinKNOW software version 1.7.14.1. Each DNA sample was sequenced individually, with intermediate washing steps with the Flow Cell Wash Kit EXP-WSH002. For every sample, a minimum of 260000 reads was generated. Basecalling was performed locally with ONT albacore version 1.2.4. .
Data Analysis with our Software Package iCG
After basecalling wih albacore, the Nanopore data was analyzed with our own software iCG. The scripts that were created in this process were combined to a powerful software tool named iCG that can potentially be used for the analysis of DNA containing arbitrary unnatural bases with Nanopore Sequencing.
In the first step, the reads were filtered by iCG filter in order to identify reads that contain the region of interest and have a high basecalling quality. Regarding the parameters minimum length, maximum length and minimum mean Phred qscore, the default argument settings of iCG filter were used for filtering. Of the remaining reads, only those containing the neighboring sequence context of 15 bases upstream and downstream of the POI were selected, without considering the close sequence context (blur region) of 3 ±1 bases around the POI, where influences of the unnatural bases may lead to unpredictable behavior of the basecaller. The matching reads were tolerated to contain a maximum of 2 mismatches, including indels. The maximum deviation in length was set to 1 base and reads containing the region of interest multiple times were rejected. Additionally, the selected reads were further filtered for a minimum mean quality score of 14 in this restricted sequence context and sorted by their stand orientation. For further information about, please read more about iCG on our Software page.

Week Six - 7/6
Spectacles with the new VBOL icons, plus drop-and-insert!
Monday: I'm going to try and update every day this week for a change. Dealing with the LayerWidget's ordering of its children has gotten too troublesome, so I'm keeping a separate ArrayList to track the sequence ordering. Question is, is there a better variable-size list-type data structure?
Tuesday: Spectacles now has tabbing! Of course, for every new item added to the interface, a slew of failure points washes over the code. I spent most of today fixing bugs- there were problems with the keyboard listener, the mouse handler, and the interaction between the thumbnail pane and the workspace panes. I also made some progress in implementing drop-and-insert, but my current stumbling block for that feature is obtaining the mouse's location relative to the workspace pane from a click-and-drag event from the thumbnail pane.
Wednesday: I managed to pull the mouse pointer's location from java.awt.MouseInfo and manually convert it to a scene coordinate, so drop-and-insert now works in Spectacles. The solution's a bit sketchy, but a ghost widget shows up and shadows the mouse like a normal workspace widget until the left mouse button is released. The problem now is keeping the code as modular as possible. It's so easy to create a bunch of inter-dependencies between the GUI frame and the scene code that will break once the front and back ends are separated. For example, the drop-and-insert functionality that I added today relies on the thumbnail scene explicitly calling on methods specific to the workspace scene, instead of the generic GraphScene class from which both classes are derived. Aside from that, adding new functionality mostly consists of defining new action handlers and putting them into the target widget's action chain.
Thursday: There isn't much new with my part of Spectacles today. I've started planning out the implementation for right-click menus for the workspace widgets. I did clean up the code for the mouse handlers to get more consistent behavior out of the GUI, but who knows how many more bugs will crop up with the new menus...
Friday: Today we met with Cesar Rodriguez from Stanford. Adam and Lesia presented Eugene, and Joanna and I presented Spectacles. We discussed development plans for Eugene, Spectacles, and the various flavors of BOL. The canvas section of BioBrick Studio will be very much like the interface for Spectacles; the demo that Cesar showed us is almost like what I originally envisioned for Spectacles"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html,"Ap2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."
TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to preserve paper fibers. We offered to test this for CGU_Taiwan. We used a similar experimental procedure as our preliminary biofilm trapping experiment. The results suggest that our biofilms can trap ink particles. As shown below, the relative absorbance of ink decreased by approximately 50% when mixed with biofilm.
From left to right: control (biofilm only), control (ink only), biofilm mixed with 0.1x ink solution. More ink was pulled down when mixed with biofilm, and the color of the supernatant is clearer than the supernatant of the ink only group. Experiment: William Chen, Yvonne Wei
When ink was mixed with biofilm, we saw a 50% decrease in absorbance, compared to a sample containing only ink. Experiment: William Chen, Yvonne Wei
In return, CGU_Taiwan helped us independently verify that overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) produces more biofilms than control (BBa_K342003).
A) Our experimental results showed that E. coli overexpressing OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) is producing more biofilm than a control which does not overexpress OmpR234 (BBa_K342003). B) CGU_Taiwan independently tested our constructs using crystal violet, a dye commonly used to quantify biofilm formation. BBa_K2229200 showed higher absorbance compared to the control BBa_K342003, reflecting the formation of more biofilm, which matches our results. Experiment: Yvonne Wei
LAMBERT_GA
We received and 3D printed LAMBERT_GA’s Chrome-Q device. We used this device with our synthetic biology class when they started to clone DNA constructs that expressed GFP.  Students monitored the effect of temperature on GFP degradation at 25, 37, 60 and 100 deg C.   We also had a great video chat  with their entire team in May 2017 to share project ideas & topics, summer plans, iGEM HS life, etc.  We always enjoy seeing them at the jamboree!!

Week 32
We are really working on our Llowlab project now! It has to be finished since we are leaving on thursday next week. It's a lot of sawing, sanding, painting! On friday we had a nice dutch friday-afternoon-drink, we played darts, had a drink and really enjoyed ourselves! You might have seen some nice pictures on facebook, like the dart the Isabelle threw in the bulls eye, unfortunately her next to throws ended up next to the dartboard..
Week 33
There is a little bit of stress now ending the Llowlab game! Some mistakes have been made with painting and the spray paint stopped while working on the last few blocks! Wednesday Menno and Mark were working on the game until half past 8! But it all turned out well and thursday at noon we'll leave at noon to Biddinghuizen, were Llowlab will take place.
Week 34
The fun is over, well, Lowlands is over. We think we made a good impression at Llowlab. We introduced many people to synthetic biology by offering a crash course supported by the game we designed and the T-Shirt . Now back to the lab to get evidence of the nice story we told.

Cooperation with other iGEM Teams
During this year's iGEM we have cooperated with the following teams:
Poznan-BioInf - we send them our superfolder proteins: sfCFP, sfBFP and sfYFP asking them to measure those proteins
NRP-UEA-Norwich - we send them three samples of soil from Warsaw
ATOMS-Turkiye - we told them about our new approach to an issue of Human Practice
Gdańsk-UG - we received methanol-dependent promoter from M. organophilum - BBa_K1038001 . We added to it B0034 RBS and E0040 reporter (GFP). We tried to measure it with different concentration of methanol, but did not make it before wiki freeze. We intend to continue working on it until we obtain solid results.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Biobricks_-_-_TEXT.html," is active and allows the transcription of beta-galactosidase. Lactose can be substituted by IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).  This part already contains a strong RBS to begin directly a gene transcription.
P1003 + B0014 : BBa_K292003 [4]
This part contains a kanamycin resistance cassette and a double terminator (BBa_P1003 + BBa_B0014). This allows the kanamycin cassette to be functional.
The cassette can be used to design a recombinant vector by gene insertion in a non lytic bacteriophage as the Lambda phage.  In fact it allows us to know if a bacteriophage is modified or not and if the inserted gene is expressed or not. When the virus is modified the kanamycin cassette induces a kanamycin resistance, so the bacteria become resistance, and when the virus is not modified bacteria are killed by kanamycin.  This part is completed by B0014 + P1003 + B0014 to finish the transcription before the resistance cassette.
B0014 + P1003 + B0014 : BBa_K292004 [5]
This part contains a double terminator and a functional kanamycin resistance cassette (promoter, resistance against kanamycin and a double terminator). It is reliable to design a recombinant vector by gene insertion in a non lytic bacteriophage as the Lambda phage.
In fact it allows us to know if a bacteriophage is modified or not and if the inserted gene is expressed or not. When the virus is modified the kanamycin cassette induces a kanamycin resistance, so the bacteria become resistance, and when the virus is not modified bacteria are killed by kanamycin.  We can use this part as a reporter, or as a simple resistance cassette.  The double terminator allows the RNA translation arrest before the resistance cassette, so this is already created to insert a coding gene with its RBS before the resistance cassette.
C0012 + B0014 : BBa_K292005 [6]
This part contains a LacI repressor and a terminator (BBa_C0012 + BBa_B0014). The LacI repressor repressed pLac promoter from the E.coli lactose operon. So LacI repressor is really reliable to use when we want to control a gene expression by using pLac promoter. In fact when LacI is not expressed, pLac is activated, and when there is an"

Figure 10: Microtiter plate of the measurements for pH optimum determination. The more intensive the blue color the more ABTS got oxidized. At pH 5 the darkest color has been reached.
The pH of the medium containing the enzyme is very important for its activity. The pH optimum of TTHL is at pH 5. This is the result of activity measurements using Britton-Robinson buffer with differently adjusted pHs. TTHL laccase was re-buffered into H2O and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2. The range from pH 4 to pH 9 was tested under substrate saturation at 25 °C for 30 minutes. At pH 5 ABTS gets oxidized the fastest (see Fig. 10 and 11). At higher and lower pHs than pH 5, the activity of TTHL is decreased considerably. The resulting Units mg-1 support the observed data (see Fig. 12). At pH 5 TTHL shows a specific enzyme activity of ~15 U mg-1. The higher the pH, the less U mg-1 can be calculated for TTHL. At pH 4 and 6 the activity is decreased to 42 % and at pH 7 even to 14 % in comparison to pH 5. But still TTHL is active at this pH allowing an application of this laccase in a waste water treatment plant where the average pH is a pH of 6.9. However, a combination with a more effective enzyme should be considered.
Figure 11: Oxidized ABTS by TTHL laccases at different pH adjustments. The experimental setup included CuCl2 incubated TTHL laccase (308 ng), Britton Robinson buffer adjusted to the tested pHs and 5 mM ABTS. Measurements were done at 25 °C for 30 minutes. The most amount of oxidized ABTS can be detected at pH 5.
Figure 12: Calculated specific enzyme activity of TTHL at different pH conditions. The highest specific enzyme activity for ABTS is under pH 5 conditions. The higher the pH, the less ABTS gets oxidized. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.

Thursday, 7/25: This morning I continued to work on making the tweets in the twitter queue clickable. However, no matter how hard I tried, all my efforts were in vain. Finally, after lunch, I decided to consult Diana, and together, we worked to figure out the problem was. In the end, it turns out that my code was actually perfectly fine - it just wasn't appropriate for my function since the html I wanted it to affect was not in the DOM - it was being created dynamically. After that, it was a quick fix, and I'm forever indebted to Diana for her absolute genius. (Debugging web programs is actually the worst). In any case, after that, I was finally able to move on to the parsing of the messages (to remove the special symbols), and to the displaying of the message at the top of the workspace. That I was able to do very efficiently, and after writing myself a reminder of my goals for tomorrow, I called it a night.
Friday, 7/26: Today I took a break from the twitter queue and worked on the protocol panel that will go on the right side of our application. Then, I went back to the twitter queue and spent some more time cleaning up the code and adding to it. Finally, at the end of the day, Heather and I talked about our goals for the weekend, what our priorities were, and what we were each going to work on.
Week 10: July 29 - Aug 2
Monday, July 29: Over the weekend I spent less time on the code and much more time working on the abstracts and poster. Since the public and technical abstracts were due today at 4, it was important that I got those done. In addition, since we're printing out our poster Wed night, I wanted to get a solid design in place for that as well. As for today, I spent a lot of time finishing up the twitter queue and working on CSS.

Tuesday, July 30: Today I worked on updating the files in order to make use of the GAE datastore. Since our application requires that we store the encoded messages, we need way of retaining them even when the page is refreshed. Our best bet was using GAE's datastore, so that's what I tackled.

After the meet-up we went out for post-meet-up drinks and a celebratory night on the town. Conversation began regarding what we should wear for our presentation in Boston. It was noted that many iGEM teams incorporate their own national dress into their outfits (such as the Tokyo Tech and TU-Munich 2013 teams). After an intense debate about what British national dress truly consisted of, one somewhat inebriated team member bought a bowler hat on eBay (at the insistence of a postgraduate supervisor) in a certain notorious Sheffield nightclub. It was most likely not worth the £20 spent on it.

OUR PROJECT
When we came up with the idea for our project we imagined a home detection kit for toxins, allergens and other substances. So while we are doing PCR’s, run gels and document every step, we try not to forget what can be done with our work with some (a lot) more R&D, so we let our imagination sail and planed a home test, called “Safie”. If you’re allergic to peanuts, eggs or any other substance you know how important it is to be sure your dish doesn’t contain the allergen – what if you could be sure the dish is safe? Imagine you’re going out to celebrate your mom’s birthday. You’re the only vegetarian in the family so you are forced to go to a nonveg restaurant – how can you be sure there is no egg or meat in your dish?
The answer is “Safie”!
You test, wait 10 minutes and know what is safe for you!
Let us know what you think of the name and the concept

Week 3 (May 15 - May 19,2017): Codon optimization and ordering sequences
The synthesis group optimized codons using this tool , removed a number of restriction sites, finalized our constructs, and ordered our sequences from IDT. We also researched the chemicals required for growth media and the characterization protocols we planned to perform.  We continued formulating and editing protocols for post-synthesis experiments such as chemical cell lysis, PHA extraction and purification, and Nile Red Fluorescence quantification. A table was compiled to compare the pros and cons of different procedures for processes such as PHA extraction and quantification.LINK
Week 4 & 5 (May 22 - June 2, 2017)
This week, the entire iGEM team took a field trip to a Calgary Wastewater Plant to learn about wastewater management. This trip informed us of the applications of our project. After evaluating the economic feasibility of implementing our waste-to-plastic system for use in the municipal wastewater treatment plant, the team started to discuss other possible applications of our project (wastewater treatment, developing countries, landfills, or space). Each member of the group researched a different application of our project to present and discuss at the weekly lab meeting.  The group finalized the post-synthesis protocols that were researched last week and ordered our required chemicals for these experiments.
Week 6 (June 5 - June 9, 2017): Restriction digest + electrophoresis
While waiting for the rest of the ordered gblocks™ to arrive, the synthesis group assisted the efforts of the human practices and modelling groups. We practiced coding for the wiki and researched E. coli infections in space to evaluate its virulence and containment.
Week 7 (June 12 - June 16, 2017): Plasmid mini prep
We performed single digests on our Pet29b(+) vectors using restriction enzymes HindIII, Sal1, EcoRI, and KpnI to check that each enzyme worked. After the DNA was digested we ran the samples on 1% agarose gel. The gel showed bands representing linearized plasmids on the gel, which informed us that our restriction enzymes were functional.

はじめに
現在、国際的に理科離れが進んでおり、どのようにScience Communicationを図るのかが問題となっています。日本でもその傾向が見られ、特に合成生物学の主幹技術である遺伝子組換え技術においては、「何か怖いものだ」という認識が根強くあります。遺伝子組換えとはどういったことなのか正しい理解もされていないまま、遺伝子組換え食品などは市場から実質的に排除されてしまっているのが現状です。今後、合成生物学が発達していくに伴って、国際的にこうした問題がより広がっていくと考えられます。
そこで私たちは、遺伝子組換えとはどういうことなのか、日本の、そして世界の多くの人に知ってもらうために、Human practiceにおいて次のような活動に取り組みました。

Silver Human Practices
From the first time you set foot outside the laboratory and leave scientific articles aside to interact with people related to your project, you begin to realize how crucial human practices are.
Human practices allowed us to investigate and validate the purpose, design, scope, and execution of our project. Is our product suitable for beekeepers to use? Will it disturb the innocuousness of honey? Is it capable of counteracting more diseases?  Is it permissible before the law? These are some of the questions that were answered throughout our human practices chronology; we were driven to think, reflect, and act on it as our integrated human practices.
Beekeepers, beekeeping societies, international organisms, government representatives, and researchers were all essential for fortifying our research.

iGEM teams are great at making things work! We value teams not only doing an incredible job with theoretical models and experiments, but also in taking the first steps to make their project real.
What should we do for our proof of concept?
You can assemble a device from BioBricks and show it works. You could build some equipment if you're competing for the hardware award. You can create a working model of your software for the software award. Please note that this not an exhaustive list of activities you can do to fulfill the gold medal criterion. As always, your aim is to impress the judges!"

DNA without adapters During library preparation, once the DNA molecules were fragmented by transposition reaction, we added a new known sequence (pACYCduet-1). This molecule entered the ligation reaction with the second adapter (with the motor protein), but should not be ligated due to the absence of the first adapter. After the sequencing run, we aligned the sequence reads to pACYCduet-1 as a reference to determine how unadapted sequences are read with Nanopore.
Replace fragmentation step from Rapid Sequencing Kit with targeted fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5 using sequencing adapters.  We took the functionality of the fusion protein a step forward to attempt targeted sequencing. This was done by replacing the rapid adapter step of library preparation with our fusion protein, and continuing with the pipeline of rapid sequencing. The sample used for this reaction contained both target and non target DNA, and after data alignment, we aimed to determine whether specific target is enriched during library preparation. In figure 15, we depict the difference between ONT rapid sequencing library preparation and our approach for targeted library preparation.

4.5 Data Analysis Software
Aim: Verify gene doping DNA sequences by classifying sequenced DNA as natural EPO genes, artificial EPO genes or other DNA.
Approach: We created a software tool to perform this task based on comparison of the input sequence to a custom database. Our database contains natural sequences with variations corresponding to misreads, and artificial sequences with codon mutations around exon-exon junctions. Natural genes do not have exon-exon junctions, which allows their distinction from artificial DNA.
Our tool calculates local and global alignment scores based on the Smith-Waterman and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithms respectively. Based on a combined alignment score, an input sequence is then classified using the k-nearest neighbour machine learning algorithm.
The database includes every new artificial EPO DNA that is analysed. In this way, evolved EPO gene doping sequences update the database resulting in ever-increasing accuracy.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your"

It is apparent that the hybrid promoter is leakier than the original- even with a high concentration of aTc we see very little fluorescence in the light. A comparable amount of aTc would have degraded in the light of both the hybrid and normal promoter, but it is hard to say if the stark difference of both the Hybrid and normal system with aTc would have been as apparent when taking into account the degradation of aTc..
Our next steps would be to modify the RBS of TetR in order to find a saturation point where the system is most tightly on and off without aTc. We ideally do not want to use aTc at all, as chemical induction is troublesome and won't be very reliable if degraded by constant light.
After we modified the system to be working without aTc around, we can look into swapping EYFP with the nif cluster to have the genes expressed only in the dark.

The idea of sharing the projects is good. But pay attention to the verification of the submitted projects,  it’s rough work and need some professional volunteers to help you.
In Regional jamboree
Tsinghua-I iGEM team
They show great interest in our Mindmap software. and came up with an idea of carry out iGEM training for freshman via Mindmap. Because the interface is quite fantastic while the data contains many useful iGEM projects and professional circuits from papers. we also decided to have deeper cooperation in the future.
Others
During the Regional Jamboree, we showed our software to many people and got some feedbacks. Many iGEM teams, such as team of BGI, team of USTC and team of Tsinghua, they all thought that our software was very useful, especially when coaching new iGEMers. They also showed some ideas to cooperate with us in information in database.
All the suggestions are precious to us, and we made efforts to achieve some of them. We will try hard to make our software more useful for these adorable researchers in the future

A Novel Solution to Minimizing Postprandial Hyperglycemic Spikes
Project Overview
The Problem: Diabetes Mellitus and Hyperglycemia
SHOW LESS
SHOW MORE
From diabetes mellitus a number of devastating complications, such as amputations, blindness, crippling neuropathies, and many others, can arise from increased blood sugar levels on a regular basis, but many of        the major complications of diabetes arise from drastic fluctuations in the blood glucose        level (Ceriello et al., 2012). Up to two-thirds of people with diabetes die of        cardiovascular disease (CVD) brought about by diabetes-related macrovascular diseases        (Deshpande et al. 2008). In fact, the risk for cardiovascular disease mortality is 2 to 4        times higher in people with diabetes than in people who do not have diabetes.        Additionally, diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication        among people with diabetes and results in more than 10,000 new cases of blindness per        year. Retinopathy is associated with prolonged hyperglycemia; it is slow to develop, and        there is some evidence that it can begin to develop as early as 7 years before clinical        diagnosis of diabetes (Deshpande et al., 2008).
Postprandial (post-meal) blood sugar spikes specifically are one of the most        damaging complications of diabetes (Parkin et al., 2002). Many diabetics are able to        effectively manage post-meal glycemic spikes with self-administered doses of insulin,        but these hyperglycemic incidents still kill more Americans per year than any other        diabetes-related complications (Parkin et al., 2002). Arguably, the gravest consequence of        glycemic spikes in diabetes patients is the development of progressive macrovascular        disease (MVD), which affects the large blood vessels of the body, hardening and        blocking these vessels (Ceriello et al., 2012). MVD is the leading cause of death among        T2DM patients in the United States, causing up"

Because the University of Westminster strongly leans towards law education, one of the initial ideas we had was to write a law proposal to tax EPS producing companies. We got in contact with Amer Eid, one of the best students from the law department of the University, and organised a meeting with him in early June. During the meeting we discussed how we would come to accomplish our goal of reaching out to the government, and found that we need over 1000 votes on the proposal only for it to be studied out by the environmental department.
This led us to research more and find that the same proposal had already been attempted during the previous year and at the time we were looking at the page, it had collected no more than 20 votes on its side, indicating that it may not have been the greatest idea.
University plastic waste
Spending time wondering around the University and its facilities we found that the highest usage of unnecessary single-use polystyrene products occurred in the University cafeteria and the main University cafe store, where the consumption of polystyrene cups demanded weekly new purchases of over 200 cups.
We intervened by reaching out to our university’s sustainability team, who agreed on stopping the purchases.
During the project, we wanted to make sure that apart from polystyrene, other major plastic waste contributors were also considered. The most accessible and one of the biggest contributors indeed turned out to be plastic bottle waste. To tackle the issue, we decided to post plastic awareness posters around the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) campus. The posters caused occasional attraction, but a difference in the number of students who were impacted by the posters to use reusable bottles could not be observed.
The plastic lab
Polystyrene problems aside, integrating the human practices of reusing, reducing and recycling went on to integrating the solutions farther from the general public and more towards the scientific community itself. We found that supporting other iGEM teams to understand their own wasteful impacts was of great importance.
About 1.8% of the total global plastic waste was found to come from bio-research facilities (Urbina, 201"

New Part Shewanella ldhA gene BBa_K2565001
This composite part is used to constitutively express high levels of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 fermentative lactate dehydrogenase NADH dependent ldhA (BBa_K2565000) in E. coli, locus tag SO_0968.
The left figure shows that the media with E. coli constitutively expressing ldhA contains more lactate than LB only. The right figure shows the amount of lactate in the media of cultures so that when Shewanella and E. coli are grown together there is more lactate in the media. The MG1655 strain of E. coli does not express the Shewanella ldhA gene.
This graph shows the voltage produced by microbial fuel cells (MFC) in 15 hours. The MFC with Shewanella and E. coli produced more voltage than Shewanella alone. The MFC with Shewanella and E. coli expressing Shewanella ldhA produced more consistent voltage than E. coli without Shewanella ldhA.
Improved Part Consensus ProU promoter BBa_K2467002
The biosensor from the CMUQ 2017 team was selected for improved characterization (Part: BBa_K2467002 ). Five different concentrations of NaCl were added to tryptone and yeast extract (same as LB) and E.coli containing the biosensor plasmid and were grown overnight in triplicate. After 18 hours the red fluorescence of 100ul of culture was measured in a TECAN m1000 plate reader set for excitation/emission wavelengths of 584/607nm at a gain of 100.
Figure showing fluorescence readings of RFP reporter for ProU consensus promoter. Error bars show standard error of the mean.
These results show that the biosensor is sensitive from at low osmolarity (0-100mM NaCl). At more normal osmolarity (100-400mM NaCl) there is no difference (normal LB is 170mM NaCl).

We are students of '''KIT''-''Kyoto Institute of Technology''.
Our University KIT is one of the National Universities located in Matsugasaki Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto is a very famous city of Japan. It had been Japanese capital for over millenium, and its history has built up its unique, traditional culture.    KIT has ties with this traditional culture and industries in Kyoto and has been advancing knowledge in engineering, design, and textile science. By pursuing ‘human-friendly practical science,’ KIT and its two predecessors have been serving our society for over a century.   KIT has Drosophila Genetic Resource Center(DGRC). The DGRC collects Drosophila stocks from laboratories all over the world, maintains them, and provides them to researchers upon request. There are only three Drosophila resorce center in the world !  Drosophila is an essential model organism for life science research as a result of its long-term use in genetic research.  KIT has great achievements in this genetic field.  And, KIT has departments not only of science but also of arts. It is rare in Japanese national universities! So KIT has philosophy that we will develop an academic community, which aspires to the fusion of science and art cultivated from the foundation of KIT.  So it is no doubt that KIT is the best university to participate iGEM projects!    KIT encourages students to participate in internships, experience the realm where design and science converge and take part in projects with our partner universities abroad. KIT also promotes collaboration in business and research with industries. The close rapport maintained with area industries over the past 100 years has allowed us to continue to have our fingers on the pulse of Kyoto design and technology.   Finally, KIT financially supports our team.

Yeast Terminator
Much like promoters act as a green light telling transcription to begin and a gene to be made, terminators are also required to act as red lights telling transcription to stop once the gene was been made into RNA.
Escherichia coli
Constitutive E. coli Promoter and Ribosome Binding Site
Just like what was discussed with the constitutive yeast promoter, E. coli uses a constitutive promoter to keep gene expression constant at a stable level. The promoter we chose however, did not come with a Ribosomal Binding Site, a sequence which is required for translation to occur allowing the gene to be fully expressed. So, we merely added the Ribosomal Binding Site immediately after our promoter.
Ice Nucleation Protein
This protein was initially taken from bacteria that lived on a plant, and its purpose is to aid in the formation of ice crystals on the plant. This protein sits on the surface of the bacteria, and displays a smaller protein. Last year, the Queen’s iGEM team used this part to express a protein of their own choosing on the surface of E. coli, showing that others could use this part for surface of nearly any protein on E. coli.
Mating Factor Alpha
Much like how animals have two genders, yeast has two mating types: mating type a and mating type alpha. Yeast cells secrete small proteins that correspond to their mating type, and when yeast of the opposite mating type encounters these proteins (also called mating factors), they grow in the direction that they sensed the opposite yeast. In order for reproduction to occur, an a cell and an alpha must come into contact with one another, fuse, and then divide into 4 cells. In order for this to happen, the expression of many genes has to change in the cell, so there are many promoters that are sensitive to when a mating factor of the opposite type is sensed. In our project we are using this to our advantage by expressing mating factor on the surface of E. coli using the Ice Nucleation Protein described above and using a mating-sensitive promoter on an essential gene to construct a system where the only way yeast can survive is if E. coli binds to its surface.
Lactate-Sensitive Promoter
Up until now, we’ve thoroughly discussed how the yeast is dependent upon E. coli for its survival, but in order for our system to work, we need the E. coli to be dependent upon"

Bio-bricks:
 
1) Constitutive Promoter (J23119) + Ribosomal  Binding Site (B0034) + pvdQ Gene + Double Terminator (B0015)
 
This biobrick was constructed to test the  expression of the pvdQ gene amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Pseudomonas  aeruginosa. It is an uncontrollable, standard biobrick that can later be used as  a baseline reference to test whether our future biobricks result in an  improvement in pvdQ expression level.  The biobrick is a composite part  consisting of the already prevalent Constitutive Promoter [2006 Berkley], along  with the newly inserted pvdQ gene. It is also composed of a strong RBS and a  transcription double terminator. 
Constitutive Promoter (J23119): This promoter biobrick is the consensus sequence and therefore results in the  idealized transcription scenario. Since it is a strong promoter and is  constitutively expressed, it complies with our preliminary goal of testing  transcription and translation of the pvdQ gene in an AHL-independent manner
2) LacI Promoter, RBS, LuxR Gene,  Double Terminator, LuxR Promoter, & RBS (K137076) + pvdQ Gene + Double  Terminator (B0015)
This biobrick was constructed to test the expression of the pvdQ gene in an environment containing the 3OC12-HSL  substrate. However, the synthesis of pvdQ is not exclusively dependent on AHL.  This is because the LacI+pI promoter that initiates transcription of the LuxR  gene can be effectively induced by IPTG. Moreover, the LuxR promoter is also  expressed well in the absence of LuxR and AHL. The biobrick is composed part of  the already existing K137076 [200"

Peptide Prediction
     NCTU_Formosa 2017 had completed a Peptide prediction model which can predict peptides for new function. In the model, they used Scoring Card Method (SCM) for machine learning. This year, NCTU_Formosa 2018 continued to use the same method for predicting antimicrobial peptide, in order to seek more candidates for our project.
Prediction Process
     We started from the Uniprot to pick out the peptides with the key word of antimicrobial. After deleting peptides with similarity over 50% with each other, there were totally 425 sequences left. These data will be           taken as positive data for our model.
     For negative data, we chose the sequences which are not antimicrobial peptides and the sequences length should"
Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Bioplastics_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Hydroxybutyrate and Polylactic Acid are two of the best developed bioplastics
Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate(P3HB) and Polylactic Acid(PLA) are both commonly used and well studied bioplastics. Currently several different companies produce each by a variety of methods(9).
Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate
P3HB is produced as an energy store in some bacteria. Commercially it is produced in bioreactors from sucrose and other sugars derived from plant biomass. P3HB can also be produced in the stems of plants, however this requires large inputs of fertiliser and large areas of land. Interest in the production from the fermentation of organic waste materials is also increasing. P3HBs are being investigated for uses in many things from food packaging to discount cards to replacements for current plastics made from polymer blends.
Polylactic acid
Polylactic acid production is usually a chemical process, building up the monomers of lactic acid or lactide. It can also be produced by certain organisms. Biological systems of PLA production are also possible. This is what our collaborators at Yale are working on. PLA already sees use in the packaging industry and plastic bottles. Future uses as with many ‘biodegradable’ plastics will expand to include tasks where increased durability are needed(8).
Can’t we just let these plastics biodegrade?
You may have heard that P3HB and PLA are biodegradable. The biodegradable label  disguises a subtlety which has important consequences. P3HB and PLA are actually industrially fermentable. This means special conditions are required for optimal degradation. One prominent P3HB producer even states during a promotional video that P(3HB) will not biodegrade in conventional landfills and counter to many claims will not easily degrade in your compost heap. PLA can be degraded in a compost heap, however the time it takes varies considerably depending upon the weather, temperature etc.  Allowing these plastics to biodegrade is also a waste of the valuable resources used to create them. Biodegradation, although theoretically a green option due to the renewable source of the feedstocks, ignores the large amounts of energy, fertiliser and water that went into their original production. Biodegrading the final product after use means that it must be produced again from scratch. The loss of resources represented by biodegradation and the special conditions required make this the wrong end of life choice for P3HB and PLA.
What other methods for recycling P3HB and PLA are there?
Currently we are are not aware"

iGEM Bootcamp at UCL
Monday 15th June 2015
The UCL iGEM boot camp is a week long event designed to provide iGEM participants with a crash course in the skills necessary to compete in the iGEM competition.  This years boot camp was attended by team members from University College London's own 2015 undergraduate team along with team members from Birkbeck University and the community-run London Biohackspace laboratory (any others Lena).  The camp primarily consisted of a number of technical workshops designed to help iGEM newcomers (and a few grizzled veterans) develop essential iGEM lab skills such as biobrick design and construction along with bacterial culturing and transformation techniques.  Further workshops were also available on topics such as how computational modelling can lead to iGEM success, constructing your own spectrophotometer and how to build an award winning wiki (without having to stay up all night on wiki-freeze deadline day). Previous iGEM participants were on hand throughout the week to provide assistance as well as offer invaluable advice on how this years teams can excel in the iGEM competition (step 1:rob a bank).  The week concluded with a mini-jamboree in which each team presented their chosen project and current progress to the rest of the group in a format similar to the iGEM giant jamboree held in Boston at the end of the competition.

Sensing h.p.
In this section, we aim to use our gene parts for making E. Coli, sensing H. Pylori’s existence and activating a pathogen-killer system, after it gets into the mucus layer. Targeting this pathogen will be provided by sensing Auto-inducer 2 (AI-2) and ammonia (NH3), both secreted from H. Pylori. AI-2 will be sensed by Lsr operon system and NH3 will be sensed by TnrA-pAlsT regulation system. Getting only one result of these two systems when they are sensed seperatley, is provided by Toehold-Triger RNA system. The output of this system, which works in the existence of these two molecules, is an endonuclease called TEV protease. Produced TEV protease will activate the antimicrobial peptide Pexiganan after this molecule synthesized in an inactive form and accumulated in cell. Activated Pexiganan molecules are expected to leave the cell, become free and kill H. Pylori.
Background
Helicobacter Pylori Sensing:
Helicobacter pylori lives in stomach, by connecting to epithelium cells under the mucus layer.This bacteria releases some molecules around which comes from its metabolic waste. Two of these molecules are Auto-inducer 2 and ammonia.
Ammonia (NH3)
H. pylori  synthesizes urease to buffer the pH of its microenvironment within the stomach. H. pylori dedicates several genes to the biosynthesis of its cytosolic urease, a Ni2+-containing enzyme which hydrolyses urea into NH3 and CO2. Bacteria has urea channel which is regulated positively by protons, opening at acidic pH values to allow"

2.3  Derivation of Reversible                                     M-M Theory
      Traditional M-M Theory seems OK on a                                             single enzyme reaction. However, the whole theory fails on complex enzyme                                             reaction system.
      Why is that? Let’s take a look back at                                             the very basic assumptions of M-M                                             Theory first. One of the basic assumption is that the concentration                                             of                                             substrate is much larger than the concentration of enzyme, which yields                                             CS>>CE. Therefore, the complex can quickly enter the steady state                                             quickly                                             enough for us to omit the variation of the complex and use the equation                                             (2.7).
      Hence, what is the restriction of                                             traditional M-M Theory? In a complex                                             enzyme reaction, things are different. This restriction might be OK during                                             the first enzyme reaction of TDC, but it will be poor in the reaction of T5H                                             and more poor in the reaction of SNAT. The substrate of the                                             intermediate                                             product Tryptamine and Serotonin is zero while the whole reaction                                             starts.                                             Therefore, we cannot use the M-M theory on a complex system.
      How do we fix this? Our method is to                                             abandon this irreversibility character                                             of the traditional M-M Theory by adding the reversibility between the                                             product and the complex. We can rewrite the equation (2.1) as:
      The difference between equation (2.1)                                             and (2.12) lies in the parameter k-2. This parameter may be small but                                             crucial to the limitation of reaction velocity. Then we can rewrite the                                             equation system (2.2-2.5) as
      Although we cannot get a simple                                             expression like equation (2.11) but we can numerically solve the equation                                             system. Here, as is shown in Fig.2. we can see the dynamical difference                                             between equations (2.2-2.5) and equations (2.14-2.17).

CGU_Taiwan,2017,Team:CGU Taiwan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," wood in daily life. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 40% of the annual industrial wood harvest is processed to make paper and paperboard*. Moreover, papers are everywhere in people’s life, this makes paper a good start for promoting and educating people the protection of forests. Paper industry is also one of the biggest manufactory category in the world, it would be hard to change the environment of this enormous manufacturing environment. The ultimate goal is to reduce the deforestation reasoned of paper making industry, the solution relies on two problems, first, the technology must allow a higher reuptake of all resources in each steps, and second, customers must accept a higher cost of products. The purchase habit of the public could change the environment while pushing the manufactures to produce a more eco-friendly products.
Solution
Brief Description
For improvement of the technology of the supply chain, we decided that reprocessed paper is the key point if the process needs to be brought to a new generation. In the reprocessed paper making process, recycled paper must first be chopped into pieces, so that the paper pulp could pass fast through the pipe line. Clean up processes would follow to detach the ink particles from the fibers and be removed from the paper pulp. Finally, the paper pulp would be made into new reprocessed paper. The manufacturing process of reprocessed paper can be roughly divided into pulping, cleaning, deinking, fiberizing, suspending, pressing, and drying. Among these processes, deinking process belongs to the most important section which carries out the removal of the adhered substances from paper surface, such as the color kernels of printing ink, and the adhesive agents. However, the currently existing deinking processes mainly adopt chemical deinking method by using chemical agents such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium silicates (Na2SiO3), sodium phosphates (Na2PO3), and potassium phosphates (KH2PO4) which is harmful to the environment.
Traditional process shortens the time and cost to make massive paper products. However, traditional process often cost high pollution and resource lost. The current reprocessed paper manufacturing breaks all the paper into paper pulp and treated with chemicals for cleaning up, but the entire treatment of all the paper fiber cause enormous paper fiber lost, especially the strength of paper fiber. For a better method the reduce the usage of chemical reagents and to preserve up to 80% of paper fibers. Here we present a model of our solution and a future imagination of the paper making industry.

In the current reprocessed paper manufacturing process, factories break all the paper into"

George Danias?
Many have dreamt and heard his name
Only to find themselves shocked and maimed
By his unputdownable creativity,
Ingenuity and alacrity,
His inventions rise from ground
Like his infinite wisdom that always astounds
His mechanical chess pieces guard his palace
Where he makes cells as radiant as the aurora borealis
Although only a part of the team since this year
Everyone seems to notice when he disappears
So treasure his presence, for he’s only nice
When you’re not one of his lab mice
Many wonder why he has chosen to impact our lives,
But to that question, he chooses to derive
A massive differential equation
Showcasing why it is the best and most valuable occasion
He often is staring at the sky
Not pondering when, where, or why,
But deciding the fate of planets and stars
Like a couple billion years ago, he decided on mars.
So in fact he didn’t apply to the team
But decided it would be good for our self-esteem

Wherever you find her, she'll be smiling, making sure it lingers even when people talking to her look away. Kiss her in the rain under the glow of a streetlamp because you saw it in a film. Remark at its huge significance. Date a girl who reads because she is a storyteller.
