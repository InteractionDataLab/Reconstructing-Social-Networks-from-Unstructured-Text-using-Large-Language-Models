We have designed several posters about iGEM and Synthetic Biology for exhibition, introducing what is iGEM and what we are doing for changing the world.
iGEM Classroom
We set up a series of iGEM courses for High school students instead of simple lectures. As the saying goes “The best way to learn is to practice”, we held a summer camp with lab visiting and offer them a chance to do experiment themselves. Besides, we open up our iGEM classroom both online and offline for them to learn more about iGEM. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them establishing their own team.
iGEM Summer camp
We held a lab open day which attracted students of Chengdu NO.7 middle school. We introduced iGEM to them and showed them around in our laboratories, as well as introducing them our experiment equipment.
Then we began our class of Plasmids extraction. We guide them to do some basic experiments and they experienced the real life of lab. We also talked with them and received some feedback:
“A wonderful experience. I had never thought that it was such a hard work until I did it myself.”
“Thanks to your careful guidance! It is really exciting when my plasmid concentration was detected to be in a normal level.”
“Experiment needs patience, determination and circumspection. It is really a hard work, because you have to endure much failure during the experiment and go on to do it again…Of course it is me!”

iGEM offline class
We went to Chengdu No. 4 High School and started our offline iGEM course. We introduced the knowledge of iGEM to them, explaining what synthetic biology is and what we can do through our work. They showed great interest in this and expressed their hope to participate in this competition.
With our help, the school established their own team, CDHSU-CHINA this year. We hope that they can achieve a good result in Giant Jamboree.
Our Edutainment Product
The greatest thing is that we created a series of edutainment products such as Gene Card Online, Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in"

Queens_Canada,2018,Team:Queens Canada#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," hour-long session highlighted a different synthetic biology application and focused on a      specific example from a recent scientific publication.
Our first SynBio Club summer 2018 event took place on June 29th and was devoted to better explaining the applications of genetic engineering in the field of medicine.      Our Outreach Lead, Maddison, presented a paper that focused on research done at Cornell University. The research team did a study using genetically engineered      Escherichia coli as commensal bacteria to prevent Vibrio cholerae virulence in mouse models. By transforming the bacteria to produce an autoinducer molecule, they      were able to alter bacterial communication and decrease the amount of cholera present in the mouse systems. This was an excellent example of how synthetic biology      applications can impact the field of medicine and even have the potential to serve as a basis for disease prevention and treatment plans. Following the presentation,      everyone attending was invited to discuss their views on the application, its potential for use in human systems, possible ethical concerns and considerations that      would need to be evaluated if this application was to move forward.

Our second SynBio Club event took place on July 25th and was focused on evaluating the use of synthetic biology in research applications and its effective use as a tool      to further academic research. Specifically, the topic of optogenetics, a technique frequently used in neuroscience research, was explored. Optogenetics involves the      introduction of genes for light-sensitive channels that allow for the specific and targeted activation of neurons. The meeting focused on a paper that involved the ability      to create false memories in mice using this optogenetics approach. Following the presentation, the group discussed various topics surrounding this emerging field of research,      which included use in humans, future applications and limitations of this technology, and possible ethical questions that may be raised when evaluating this tool.

The created recombinant molecules are transformed into specific hosts: Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The constructs generated are screened and sequenced to confirm their successful assembly. The positive clones are passed to the characterization team.
Characterization
Fabrication Team Members:   Judith, Brittany, Meghan, Adam
The Characterization Team collects and analyzes data on our constructs after they have been designed and fabricated. They specifically want to determine how quickly the different fluorescent protein constructs mature and degrade. To collect data, they are using an automated microscope platform that includes a microfluidic system for trapping cells, and switching the available nutrients to them. All of the hardware is adaptively controlled by the software GenoSIGHT. This arrangement allows them to precisely control when cells are exposed to a stimulus, and automates the collection of fluorescence data. After data is collected it is compared to a mathematical model of expected maturation and degradation processes. Parameter estimation is then used to give us quantitative descriptions of our constructs. This information is used to compare different constructs, and it is passed back to the Design Team. The Design Team then compares these results to their expectations, adjusts their models accordingly, and generates new designs as necessary, beginning the cycle all over again.

Hilde Mellegård
Senior Adviser at the Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board
Key insight
The norwegian law concerning gene technology is quite strict compared to other countries, as the precautionary principle is important.
The regulation of GMOs is based on the technology used, not the final product.
Our use of GMOs in the lab is regulated by our university’s rules, therefore we do not need to take further precautions than we already do.
Summary of interview
Hilde Mellegård works as a Senior Adviser at The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board. She has a doctorate in microbiology and a background as a veterinary. We contacted Mellegård to learn more about GMOs in Norway.
The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board is a consultative body that informs the public and initiates debate on biotechnology. From their website: «The main tasks of the Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board are to evaluate the social and ethical consequences of modern biotechnology and to discuss usage which promotes sustainable development». The precautionary principle is essential in the gene technology law. [HM1]  For a GMO to be approved by the Norwegian government, it needs to be comply criteria linked to health and environment. Norway has its own legislation on GMOs, which is similar to the EU legislation in general, but there are some differences, e.g in definitions of what a GMO is. In Norway and the European union, the regulation of GMOs is based on the technology used, not the final product regardless of what technology is applied, as in some other countries.
These days, the Advisory Board is working on a statement on future regulation of GMOs in Norway through the Gene Technology Act. The Act is now 25 years old, and there has been a rapid technological development since then. 25 years ago, the divide between gene technology and conventional breeding techniques was clear. Today, with new technologies giving a much larger range of possibilities, these lines are becoming increasingly blurred. According to Mellegård, the technological development presents new opportunities and challenges. Therefore, the law that regulates the GMOs might be due for an upgrade. The aim of the work of the Board is to develop appropriate and robust regulatory frameworks that facilitate the harnessing of the potential of gene technology, while also avoiding harm"

Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," Switch (which acts as the internal memory bank, by keeping the system active or inactive over long periods of time).
(3) A Signal Circuit (which acts as the ""antenna"" used for broadcasting and receiving cell to cell signals).
Computation Circuit
The Computation Circuit has been programmed to function as an OR gate:
Its first part consists of the gene LacI, which activates the Toggle Switch, and whose synthesis is regulated by the changeable promoter Pchangeable. This is the promoter activated by the substance we want to detect.
Its second part consists of the gene LacI, whose synthesis is regulated by the promoter Plux, which is activated by LuxR-AHL dimers, which result from the cell-to-cell communication.
This circuit determines whether or not to activate the toggle switch, according to the external signal (the substance being detected by the Pchangeable promoter), and the signals coming from the surrounding cell population (which activate the Plux promoter).
Toggle Switch
The Toggle Switch is how the cells ""remember"" data. As a default, the switch stays ""off"", until it receives a signal (in the form of LacI) from the Computation Circuit telling it to switch “on”. Once the Toggle Switch is ""on"" it remains activated indefinitely, unless it receives an external signal (IPTG) to switch “off”.
We based our system on the Toggle Switch from Gardner et. al. (Gardner, Cantor, & Collins, 2000):
""The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two constitutive promoters [LacI and CI]. Each promoter is inhibited by the repressor that is transcribed by the opposing promoter. We selected this design for the toggle switch because it requires the fewest genes and cis-regulatory elements to achieve robust bistable behavior"".
The system is switched ""on"" when the computation circuit produces the repressor LacI, which binds to Plac, thus inhibiting the expression of CI.
Without the presence of CI, the promoter PCI is uninhibited, and LacI and T7 RNA polymerase are synthesized. LacI inhibits the expression of CI, keeping our system in an ""on"" state, while the T7 RNA polymerase activates the Signal Circuit.
The system can be switched “off” by using IPTG, which induces Plac, causing CI expression and therefore repression of PCI, LacI and T7 RNA polymerase.
Signal circuit
The Signal Circuit is designed to facilitate cell-to-cell communication, which is based on the diffusion of a small quorum sensing molecule called AHL (N-Acyl Hom"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook-3_-_-_TEXT.html," pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe our plasmids were not what we believed them to be. Eventually it was discovered that we were using an incorrect amount of Q5 2x master mix which caused the PCR to not work properly.
During the first lab week, we rehydrated our gene blocks from IDT and performed overlap extension (OE) PCR on three of the genes (delta7, ADR, and FDX1). We used touch-down and touch-up thermocycler settings which resulted in many different sized bands on an agarose gel. To reduce the amount of nonspecific primer annealing in these reactions, we decided to only use touch-down thermocycler settings and to put the primers on the side walls of the PCR tubes to limit the Q5 polymerase exposure to the primers. The exonuclease activity of the Q5 polymerase chews back the ends of our primers and causes non specific annealing, so we made sure the primers were added last before putting the reactions into the thermocycler. We also decided to run OE PCR reactions without primers to allow the overlapping regions of the genes to anneal and form the full length genes which could be used as templates for regular PCR reactions.
Since our project would eventually require separate experiments with 5 different inserts, our first goal in lab was the amplification of our experimental base plasmid. We first created a stock of ampicillin selective plates with a concentration of 100ug/mL. We carried out a transformation with NEB DH5α chemicompetent cells and created a glycerol stock of leftover cells after plating. We plated out transformants on 3 plates at original strength, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions using glass beads. Our platings were successful, and we used the 100-fold dilution plate to isolate single colonies and create a monoclonal culture of transformants. We also learned how to plate with a sterile wire loop in order to keep the number of plates used to a minimum. Every protocol--pouring plates, transformations, platings, and creating glycerol stocks--was new to us and required some reading of protocols from NEB and other sources.
Created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of four S. cerevisiae strains obtains from the Heinrich lab at UCSC. Did a second attempt of miniprepping the pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli, but unfortunately had salt contamination"

Since we were not able to transform the BioBricks B0015, J23100 and J23106 we decided to obtain these Bricks via Phusion-PCR directly from resuspended DNA from the distribution kit.
A gel electrophoresis was conducted with the freshly acquired PCR products of B0015, J23100  and J23106 as well as C0060, C0061, C0070, J23100 and J23106 from our last batch of PCR amplificates. Besides J23100 from today's PCR all BioBricks showed bands of the expected size and therefore were isolated via gel extraction.

Investigators: Oliver, Laura
We prepared to clone some of our first and essential parts. The BioBricks were digested according to the table below.  Parts labeled as vector were dephosphorylated to prevent religation and then purified.
In order to obtain the inserts a gel electrophoresis was conducted and the appropriate band was isolated by gel extraction. The ligations were conducted according to the following table.
Friday, June 7, 2013
Investigators: Tabea, Oliver, Laura, Kevin
We transformed our ligations from yesterday using our competent glycerol stocks without prior heat inactivation of T4-ligase. Transformed cells were plated on agar plates containing glucose and chloramphenicol and were grown at 37 °C overnight.
To test the success of our ligation beforehand we conducted a colony PCR (extension time 30 s) using 1 µL of our untransformed ligation mix of C0061+B0015 and B0032+J23100 as template. The conducted gel electrophoresis was visualized and showed a band of the expected size for B0032+J23100. The band for C0061+B0015 was too small. Further investigation revealed the chosen extension was too short.
We also send some of the BioBricks miniprepped on June 3, 2013 for sequencing (primers VR and VF2).
Week 4: June 9 - June 15, 2013
This week we confirmed the successful cloning of the constitutive promoter + RBS. Furthermore we confirmed the addition of the double terminator to the autoinducer synthases and the lactonase. More BioBrick sequences were verified. However, we observed some point mutations in the prefix/suffix sequences of some bricks as well as major annotation differences in the BioBrick C0061"

Increasing tooth loss remains a feature of old age in humans throughout the world. We will harness synthetic biology to improve the dental health of the ageing population by designing bacteria that do not cause decay but actually prevent it. These biofilm-fillings will provide a regenerative internal environment for the tooth whilst fighting off the surface bacteria that cause dental plaques.

Patients interview
Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?
A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.
Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?
A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.                         And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too                         expensive!
Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?
A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in                         America.
Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.
A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From                         what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But                         it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this                         medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it                         too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.
Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically                         synthesized medicine?
A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors                         confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would                         usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.
Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors                         recommended anything else?
A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically                         synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by                         medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.                         It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I                         can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative                         is bear bile powder.
Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?
A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh,"
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,", if the hot side is maintained at 20 C, the cold side would be at -20 C. Therefore, it's a balance of the heat able to be dissipated by the hot side and the power supplied that achieves the coldest temperature.
We opted for air cooling because it is easier to maintain and more cost-effective versus water cooling solutions. However, this makes it hard for us to model heat dissipation and since air cooling is not as effective as water cooling, the lowest temperature reached was only around 8 C.
The Peltier plate assembly is controlled by an H-bridge, which allows both a modulation of the voltage and the direction of current. It accepts a PWM input and a directional input from the Arduino, allowing us to control the temperature difference created by the Peltier plate in response to the temperature in the box. The PWM input controls the voltage, and therefore the power given to the Peltier plate. The more input (from a higher PWM) is given, the more power will be delivered, leading to a larger temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the Peltier plate.
It also has the ability to change the direction of the current based on input from the Arduino, so that electrons are flowing in the opposite direction. This allows the cold side of the Peltier to become the hot side and vice versa. Therefore the Lab-in-a-Box can act as both an incubator and a chilled centrifuge depending on the application.
The temperature in the box is sensed by a thermsister, which is a resistor that chances its resistance based on the temperature. It is an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) probe, meaning that the resistance increases as temperature decrease. In the Lab-in-a-Box, the resistor is wired in series with a 10 kOhm resistor, and the difference in voltage reflected by the change in resistance (following Ohm's Law - V = IR) is sensed by the Arduino
3D Printed Rotors
Three rotors are designed for the Lab-in-a-Box, the centrifuge, shaker, and vortex function. The centrifuge and shaker parts were designed with capacity in mind - we did not want to limit high schools or labs by the small capacity when making overnight cultures or doing minipreps. Each rotor is mounted in a #10 Nylon lock hex nut, which fits with the threaded adaptor that comes with the motor. A Nylon lock hex nut was used for two reason - the increase height of the nut provided a larger surface area for the glue joining the rotor and the nut, and the nylon lock prevented"

For enzymatic digests, the following formula was used if bovine serum albumin (BSA) was not part of the buffer, which was the case for NEB buffer 3.0:
... µl DNA (~500 ng)
5 µl BSA
5 µl buffer (for example NEBuffer 2)
2 x 1.5 µl enzymes (for example EcoRI-HF & PstI)
... µl water
=> 50 µl in total
The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1h or up to 1:30h and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
In case BSA was already part of the buffer, the following recipe was used:
... µl DNA (~500 ng)
2 µl buffer (e.g. NEB CutSmart buffer)
1 µl restriction enzymes
water ad 20 µl
The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1h or up to 1:30h and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
Extraction of DNA fragments from an agarose gel
After gel electrophoresis, the gel parts containing the desired DNA fragement size were excised from the agarose gel with a clean and sharp scalpel. For DNA extraction the QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit was used. Following the instrucion manual all necessary solutions have been prepared. The slices were weighted and accordingly Buffer QG added to the gel (for 1 slice 600 μl; for 2 slices 900 μl). The tubes with the mixture were incubated at 55°C until the gel slices had completely dissolved. In between samples were vortexed, if fragement sizes were not too large. Since the color of the solution never changed, no pH adjustments had to be done. In the next step isopropanol was added (for 1 slice 200 μl; for 2 slices 300 μl) to the sample and mixed. For each sample a QIAquick spin column was placed into the vacuum manifold and the sample decanted to it to bind DNA. Vacuum was applied until the whole sample has been drawn through the column. For further purification samples were washed with 500 μl buffer QG and vacuum was applied. Afterwards 750 μl Buffer PE were added to the samples, let stand for 2-5 minutes and vacuum applied. To remove residual wash buffer, the columns were placed into collection tubes and"

Vi Ka: Continued literature review on transport assays - decided to use fatty acid in our protocol instead of benzene (for now), because it is harder to quantify transport of benzene into the cell. Most protocols used radiolabeled oleic acid, however due to lab regulations we won’t be able to work with radioactive materials.
Friday, 5/26 Day 5
Andrew: Literature review concerning preserving bacteria was continued, exploring whether to perform this through lyophilization or freezing in harmless compounds (like sucrose).  Vacuum drying was researched as another possible method.  A final method was decided which included freeze-drying bacteria with sucrose and skim milk powder at various temperatures.
Caleigh: Attended a meeting to discuss our use of Bindley Metabolite Profiling Center equipment. Created gBlocks from the universal ribosome binding sites designed by Andrew to allow for efficient use of the gBlocks in several constructs and assays and Gibson assembly.
Katie: Finished the enzyme assay bill of materials for Archana. Attended a meeting with Dr. Sors and took note of other on-campus experts to contact about the enzyme assays and the lung model. Wrote the Relay for Life post for the Wiki, relating to the team’s public engagement that had been executed in the spring. Made a graphic for the Relay for Life post.
Kevin: Found a sigma-70 constitutive promoter for the atpI gene in E. coli that should prove effective as a basis for the universal promoter. Met with Bruce Cooper from Metabolite Processing Center about use of his gas chromatograph and received approval of benzene, toluene, and xylene quantification protocols. Decided that xylene effects poses no serious health effects and should therefore not be tested. Wiki work!
Archana: Continued contacting company representatives. Began intern payroll process. Continued researching corporate funding opportunities.
Vi Ka: Preliminary protocol for transport assay designed; will need to perform additional review.

Andrew: A new protocol for preserving bacteria and testing viability was started.  Tubes able to withstand overnight storage in liquid nitrogen were researched for the purpose of testing this method of preservation.  The protocol was completed with room for flexibility of advice from advisor Dr. Rickus and from additional equipment.  A practice run of transforming bacteria was performed to prepare for GFP assays later.

What makes sequ-into a reliable tool nevertheless, is                                     GraphMap. This mapping                                     algorithm is specifically designed to analyse nanopore sequencing reads, while it                                     handles potentially                                     high-error rates robustly and aligns long reads with speed and high precision                                     thanks to a fast graph                                     traversal.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," unnecessary burden by overexpressing a heterologous Acc.   The native Acc consists of four subunits together with an associated biotin ligase.   The genetic organization is the same like in E. coli, which is shown in figure 3. Nevertheless, further looks into literature revealed, that heterologous expression of pathway enzymes could be more promising because housekeeping Accs often are strictly regulated while foreign genes have different regulation motifs.   Hence, we also used the Acc from E. coli together with its associated biotin ligase (BirA). These enzymes have already been tested for
3HPA
production (Liu et al. 2013) .   Additionaly, we decided to test the enzyme from Synechococcus elongatus. Since cyanobacteria require higher amounts of fatty acids to form thylakoid membranes, they might have more active enzymes.   The S. elongatus Acc consists of four subunits, just like those from E. coli and V. natriegens. For this enzyme it was also recommended to use it with a biotin ligase, because it needs a covalently bound biotin to be activ.   Unfortunately Accs consisting of four subunits form a very unstable complex and unbalanced expression levels of its subunits lead to gene repression (Abdel-Hamid et al. 2006) .     To circumvent this issue, we also chose the
Acc
from C. glutamicum.   In this organism, AccB and AccC are fused to one subunit, as well as AccA and AccD. Balancing of two subunits instead of four is much easier, therefore this enzyme is beneficial for us. Gande et al., 2007 still characterized this enzyme and confirmed its applicability for synthetic biology. Since C. glutamicum is a gram-positive bacterium, we decided to codon optimize the genes for a smoother translation and coexpressed the associated biotin ligase (Accession numbers NCgl0670, NCgl0678, NCgl0679).
Figure 3: Genetic organisation of acc genes in E. coli and comparison to
Acc
s from other strains
In E. coli Acc is encoded by the genes accA, accB, accC, accD and the associated gene birA. In V. natriegens and S. elongatus there is the same genetic organization. Acc from C. glutamicum is encoded by only two genes, accBC and accD.

Amplification of biobricks we would use. Our protocol is based on the iGEM Protocols:
Punch a hole into the corresponding hole in the hole in 2014 kit plate by a pipette tip. Adding 10ul ddH20 to the hole and pipette up and down for several times. Let sit for 7 min to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended.
Transform 3ul DNA into E. coli DH5α competent cell. Ice incubate for 30min.
42℃ heat shock for 90s, then ice incubate for 5min.
Adding 200ul SOC medium and shake at 200rpm for 50min.
Centrifuge 12000rpm for 2min. Discard 200ul supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in the rest 50ul medium. Then spread the plate with all 50ul broth.
37℃ incubate overnight. (19:27)

We observed the plate at 14:00 and found the bacteria on several plates were growing much faster than on the other plates. We then put the plates which has grown out colonies into the refrigerator in case of overgrowth and continued to incubate the rest plates at 37℃. At 19:00, we found that some plates in the incubator had grown out several colonies.

My name is Jeremy Glass-Pilon. I am a third year student in Concordia University's Molecular and Cell Biology Honours Program. I am involved in various fields of research, however my ultimate interest is applying synthetic biology to human health - especially cancer treatments. I am thrilled to be a part of Concordia University's first IGEM team and hope to represent my team and faculty well in the upcoming jamborees. Additionally, I am an avid gamer and enjoy to spend the little time off that I have with a good game or maybe a good book now and then. I love music and play both the Piano and Violin, but really, who has the time in our field. If you feel like it, follow me on Twitter: @JerGlassPilon and we can talk about synthetic biology, music or even games.

Safety
Have we met the iGEM safety requirements?
We checked our organisms against the white list to see if we needed to complete a check-in. We found that we did not as our two organisms E. coli K-12, and S. cerevisiae were on the white list.
We checked the components of our parts against the white list to see if we needed to complete a check in. We found that we did not as we use only non-red flagged registry parts or coding sequences from the list of dangerous categories.
Completed the ‘About Our Lab’ questionnaire .
Completed the ‘About Our Project’ questionnaire .
Completed the  final safety form .
Our Local Guidelines
As a UK based team we familiarised ourselves with the regulations in the UK concerning the proper safe management of biological organisms, and particularly GMOs. In particular we found that all work involving biological material in the UK is subject to the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (COSHH). The specific schedule relating to our work is Schedule 3, ‘Additional Provisions Relating To Work With Biological Agents’ . Additionally, because we are working with genetically modified organisms"

U of C iGEM team wins provincial competition
With smiling faces and heightened team pride, the U of C brought home the aGEM trophy after placing first in the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (aGEM) competition, which was held in Banff from September 18th -19th. aGEM is the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines Competition. aGEM facilitates a sense of regional spirit and gives students a chance to compete and critique each other’s work as the three Albertan teams (U of C, U of A, and U of L) prepare for the iGEM Jamboree in the fall.
The University of Calgary team members drove down to Banff on the 18th- the night of the aGEM wiki and poster presentations. The students arrived early to set up the poster, prepare handouts (lab, modeling, Second Life and human practices) and set up iMacs to present their wiki and facilitate tours of our 3D virtual world in Second Life. The team distributed and organized themselves around each station so that there was always someone there to explain the project and address questions.
This was great opportunity for all of the team members to practice presentational skills, demonstrate a cohesive understanding of the four components of the project, learn about"

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#AffinityTags_-_-_TEXT.html," look at our page about synthetic peptides ). In order to immobilize our enzymes, they were C-terminally fused to the coding region of the SpyCatcher, which could then bind to the SpyTag, attached to the matrix.
SnapTag
The SnapTag is originally a labelling system, used to tag Proteins with fluorescent molecules. It is a derivate from human O-6-alkylguaninalkyltransferase. In our system the same principle is used, but instead of attaching a fluorescent marker, we attach the Snap-protein to a membrane coated in Snap-substrate. The Snap-protein itelf is a protein chain (182 amino acids), C-terminally fused to the target protein. The membrane is coated in the so called Snap-substrate, a 1-benzylguanidine. The mechanism for covalent fusion of the two parts is a SN2-reaction where the guanine is substituted by a cystein residue near the N-terminus of the attached protein, which forms a thioester bond.
Split Intein (Ssp gyrase b intein)
Intein immobilisation (Figure 1) has a significant difference to the other two tag systems: While in the other cases two peptide chains are connected by the tag, the intein itself isn’t present in the immobilised state anymore, thereby forming a direct connection. Artificially created split inteins are modified parts of natural occuring inteins - protein regions which cut themselves out of a protein chain via self-catalytic activity- that are cut in two pieces. If C-terminal and N-terminal part find eachother in solution under specific conditions (in our case the optimal conditions are room temperature and a pH value around 7.5) the intein’s highly specific self-splicing activity is induced and the intein then cuts itself out of the protein chain, leaving the regions around the recombined intein covalently bound to each other. The cleavage mechanism occurs by conserved cystein and asparagine resiudes at the ends of the intein region. For our system we chose a split intein from gyrase b of Synechocystis spec. PCC6803. We chose it in particular because of it’s published high binding efficiency (89%) and it having a very small C-split-intein (modified the ensure a working fluorecin test) (GVPVHNGA[6-AHS]K(Fl)C) which could be aquired by peptide synthesis in the lab, thus allowing the same modifications we also used for Spy-Tag"

This other graph is the comparison of interest in iGEM competition in different Latin American countries:
So, our divulgation was made not just to communicate with other teams, but also to inform and generate interest in public unaware of this new area of research and this competition. To do so, we promoted different initiatives within and outside the university.
Within the university
Synbio OpenHouse
UFMG´s Synbio Open House invitation
In February of 2013 was held a SynBio Open House at UFMG. The invitation to this event was sent to all academic community. The event was presented by our instructor Liza Felicori, who made an introduction to synthetic biology for those who attended, which also had the opportunity to apply to be a participant in the iGEM team.
Seminar
Presentation of our proposal to IGEM competition at the seminar of the UFMG Graduate Program of Biochemistry and Immunology in April 19th
On April 19th, when we were starting to be known inside the university, we were invited to make a presentation about iGEM, our team members and project proposal for the competition on the seminar organized by the Biochemistry and Immunology Graduate Program. This seminar happens on Fridays and has as audience the graduate students and professors from the department. It was a very good experience because we practiced a formal presentation and had the opportunity of answering several questions about our project and experimental design. After the presentation, we received valuable tips from UFMG researchers, which helped us to adjust our proposals concerning the chosen biomarkers and the experimental approaches for achieving our aim.
Classes at the course “Ideas in immunology”
Once our initiative on participating of iGEM was disclosed, the professor Nelson Monteiro Vaz, involved on a partnership between Brazil and Boston, showed great interest and invited us to have a talk to other students during two classes of the course “Ideas in immunology”. In these opportunities, we could introduce students to synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, present our project and debate how new trends in immunology may lead to a paradigm shift, revealing how body interacts to microbiota and new horizons to synthetic biology projects, like on the use of probiotics. New scientific reports presented on the last World Congress on Inflammation and the Annual Congress of Brazilian Society of Immunology (SBI) were also debated, including the important role of TMAO on immune system modulation as bacterial product, what highlights the relevance of our project.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

MichiganState,2018,Team:MichiganState#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a pdb file for each of the genes, Phyre2 also produced a homology comparison to each of the ACC deaminase structures submitted to the protein database. Below are the results from all three homolog alignments.
Figure 8: Below are the homolog alignment results for the Fusarium oxysporum gene. As you can see, the highest match is ACC deaminase protein 1TYZ with 57% match.
Figure 9: Below are the homolog alignment results for the Trichoderma asperellum gene. The highest match is ACC deaminase protein 1TYZ with 60% match.
Figure 10: Below are the homolog alignment results for the Pseudomonas sp. gene. The highest match is ACC deaminase protein 1TYZ with 83% match.
From these homolog matches we can conclude that the closest to our model ACC deaminase gene, 1TYZ, is the gene extracted from Pseudomonas sp. This makes sense since 1TYZ was produced in Pseudomonas. Because of this, we chose to use the Pseudomonas gene to transform our endophyte with. This way, we would have the most information regarding the efficiency and functionality of the protein our endophyte was producing. There were a couple amino acid differences between the Pseudomonas gene and the other two. The most important one which should be mentioned, is directly involved with catalytic pocket function.
This point is at position 80 in the amino acid sequence. Both 1TYZ and our Pseudomonas strain have Q or glutamine instead of arginine in position 80. The image below shows this distinction. This is very interesting, since arginine is a very large molecule and is a positively charged molecule. Glutamine, on the other hand is a smaller, polar molecule.
Figure 11: The ring is PLP in the active site of this monomer, and the molecule in purple is arginine and the molecule in blue is glutamine.
Overall, the three genes we had available to us aligned almost perfectly to 1TYZ. Below is a 360° rotation and zoom into the active site of the enzyme where PLP is seen. Each color is a different one of the homologs overlapping with 1TYZ. The color distinctions are given in the figure legend.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Symposia_-_-_TEXT.html," the city of Darmstadt organized an environmental event on the Ludwigs Platz in the heart of Darmstadt. This meant that the iGEM team got the opportunity to explain their project to people from small to large in more detail. This was a great chance to bring the Synthetic Biology more closely to the general public. The project got positive response by the residents of Darmstadt and pushed and inspired even more the young scientists.

Catrione Lee
Hi, my name is Catrione and I am a 4th year undergrad biology student. This will be my first year in iGEM and I’m extremely excited to be a part of synthetic biology. I hope to one day be a microbiologist/immunologist and being involved in a project that could directly impact the technology in those fields is something that I’m really looking forward to.
Lucas Saville
My name is Luke Saville and I am from Calgary, AB. I have just completed my second year as a biochemistry major at the University of Lethbridge. I also do RNA based research at the University of Lethbridge. I joined iGEM because it seems like a good way to be surrounded by cutting edge science that is constantly growing.
Jessica Semmelrock
Know what's exciting? Biological systems functioning in synthetically derived cells. Newly engineered nucleotides. Someone linking all the yeast chromosomes together to form a functional mega chromosome. Generally speaking, all the advancements being made in the scientific world day after day. My life? Not so much. I’m just enduring a lot of trial-and-error before I make it to the big leagues and having extra fun with synthetic biology and rugby along the way.
Reanna Takeyasu
Hi, my name is Reanna Takeyasu and I am a fourth year biochemistry student at the university of Lethbridge. To me, synthetic biology has always seemed like an amazing, mad-scientist-esque option for finding a solution to many of the world’s problems. This is my first time participating in iGEM, and even though we haven’t quite fixed the entire world yet, I’m having lots of fun learning more about SynBio.
David Tobin
This is my first experience with synthetic biology and I'm excited to be part of the team!
The cells will not grow,
but will it work tomorrow?
The universe laughs.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Neuroscience but I have an academic background in Molecular Genetics, which definitely helped shape me into the SynBio nerd that I am today. I am a returning iGEMer because I really enjoy working on challenging interdisciplinary projects that bridge my research interests (and because I apparently cannot abide spare time)! And if I am not in the lab, you can find me on my mountain bike!

To set up a model to determent the amount of miR-21 in cells, we made a construct to express miR-21.  We designed the specific primers of human miR-21-precursor based on the sequences of miR-21 precursor ( http://www.miRbase.org/cgi-bin/miRna_entry.pl?acc=MI0000077 ) and amplified 72bp fragment by PCR. After that, we digested the purified PCR products with restriction enzymes Sal I and Not I (Fig 5).

Validating a Part: Ribitol Transport BBa_K2663000
In order to test the efficacy of our ribitol transporter (RT) gene, we designed an experiment where we incubated both E. coli containing the transformed plasmid and wild-type E. coli DH5a in M9 minimal media with 0.2% by mass ribitol for less than 24 hours. We took samples and harvested the intracellular fluid at 2 time points. Concentrations of ribitol in the intracellular fluid were measured using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) with an organic solvent. The measured samples of both wild type and engineered E. coli were then compared, and basic statistical analysis was done to show that the average concentration of intracellular ribitol (per unit biomass) was more than seven times the baseline ribitol concentration of the wild-type cells.
Given that we had only incubated the cells for less than 24 hours in the ribitol-enriched M9 media, this is a promising result for our transporter. In future experimentation, we hope to do longer incubation periods with varying concentrations of ribitol.  Literature (Pfyffer and Rast 1979) has proven that there are relatively high (20 mg per gram dry fungal mass) concentrations of ribitol in the Pgt fungus, so even a low amount of transport into the cell would be sufficient for our purposes."

Utrecht Party - 26 August
We had a great evening with all the Dutch iGEM teams in Utrecht. We went out for dinner and had drinks afterwards at Pamela Capendale's place (thanks!;). It was a lot of fun and we had a great time!
Team Weekend - 14-16 July
We had a nice team weekend near the lake Leekstermeer. With the whole team we rented a bungalow at the Cnossen camping. We played games and had drinks plus we went sailing on the lake itself :). Since we will be spending a large part of our summer together, we judged it to be a good teambuilding exercise to meet the other team members in a different context and just enjoy some quality time together
Dinner
Quite often, we had dinner together as a team. To discuss our project?- of course! But also for the fun of it. The best ideas originate with food and drinks, wouldn't you agree?
BBQ and fundraiser - 20th of September
On the 20th of September we organized a BBQ and fundraiser. We used this event to raise money for our project and to explain our research to our family, friends, fellow students and other scientists from molecular biology.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C"

Synthetic Rally
In order to achieve better results, we collaborated with the CIDEB-UANL_Mexico team for iGEMhs2012 while doing the Synthetic Rally activity.  Collaboration allowed us to reach better results, organization was the key for success, but above that, it was an amazing team work. We could set different teams in order to give the talks and to set and keep the logistics while the Rally was being performed.
iGEM-MX collaboration network
On August 10, 2012, all the iGEM teams from Mexico were called to make a reunion in order to talk about their projects and to discuss about common problems for iGEM teams in this country. This reunion took place in Irapuato, Gto. Mexico at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV).
iGEM teams presented their main problems, above them there are troubles with customs. These teams decided to make a collaboration network in order to look for solutions to these problems and to achieve better results as teams through collaboration. Among the resolutions that were taken there are to look for institutions that could help us with customs troubles, to standardize the lab protocols among the teams and to make a database for the Registry Parts that we usually get with functional troubles, thus we can look into our parts in order to analyze if there is a general problem or not.
Construction of the Synthetic Biology Tunnel
While we were setting up the Synthetic Biology Tunnel we needed so much help, so we invited the other two teams from our University: the iGEMhs team CIDEB-UANL_Mexico and the iGEMe team UANLe_Mexico.

Future characterization of these constructs should allow us to explore the leakiness dependence on plasmid amount and if the tight expression is robust for different copy numbers.
We have characterized promoters response of the three quorum-sensing systems. These are pLux, pLas, and pRhl . We first measured the transfer functions with a non-regulated RBS in front of sfGFP, i. e. the amount of fluorescence in dependence of the inducer concentration present and compared the response with the corresponding riboregulated constructs with and without the forbidden restriction sites. All experiments were carried out in 96-well microtiter plate format for 10 h. This kinetic data-sets were also used for parameter-fitting in our modeling approach .
We found an about 60-fold reduced basal GFP expression and an increased signal-to-noise ratio of about 6-fold when using our riboregulator construct, as compared to a non-regulated reference RBS (B0034) . These results are summarized in figure 2. The BioBrick conform module was confirmed to show no loss-of-funtion due to EcoRI and XbaI site removal. Interestingly the sensitivity towards the inducer was reduced (see figure 3). Is interesting to speculate if small changes in the sequences flanking the riboregulator could be used as a way to switch the response curve.
Figure 3 Improved signal-to-noise ratio and decreased basal GFP expression (leakiness) due to the use of a riboregulator in combination with a quorum-sensing module. The fluorescence per OD600 is shown for the LuxR-system with a complete riboregulator over an inducer-range of 10-13 M to 10-5 M (dashed, light blue). An incomplete riboregulator without the trans-activator shows the expected reduced sensitivity towards the inducer (dark blue). As a reference, a system with a non-regulated RBS (BBa_B0034) is shown (light blue). Data points are mean values of triplicate measurements in 96-well microtiter plates 200 min after induction ± standard deviation.

For microorganisms, the effect has not been tested, but it would take enormous mounts of the protein for it to be in a sufficient concentration to cause damage in the external environment. It is a stable molecule and doesn't degrade by itself quickly, but proteases in the external environment can easily destroy them.
As KillerRed by itself does not pose any risks in genetic or protein form, we now move on to the other components of our system: the Voigt light-regulated protein expression system.
As they confer no survival advantage nor have any effect other than regulating the expression of KillerRed in our system, these components do not pose a risk by themselves. The antibiotics used to maintain the corresponding plasmids in the cells have the same properties as ampicillin; resistance to them does not confer a survival advantage to bacteria in the wild. To prevent our bacteria ever making it inside a hospital where they could pose a risk due to the particular nature of those environments (immunodeficient organisms, strong trace presence of antibiotics...), we did not allow any sick researcher to perform experiments in the lab.
We show that interactions of our system with the environment or healthy organisms do not pose any more risk than interactions with wild-type bacteria. Yet this isn't all there is to biosecurity. As a general guideline for good laboratory practices, and by law, we are required to follow a set of rules. These are given by governmental organizations in France:
The High Council for Biotechnologies
The Ministry of Higher Education and Research
The European Parliament
Among the laws that have passed concerning the use of genetically modified organisms, the following laws concern us in particular:
European Directive 89/391/CEE
European Directive 90/219/CEE
To sum up these different laws, we can make a list of good laboratory practices that we have to follow:
1. Minimalise contamination of work areas and the environment with genetically modified organisms.
2. Take measures to control risks at their source (genetic and/or protein level) and then use personal protection equipment (blouses, protectice eyewear...) if needed.
3. Regularly check and maintain equipment and procedures used to control genetically modified organism proliferation (laminar flow hoods, bleach...).
4. Verify if genetically modified organisms can thrive outside of their defined containment zones, and check for their presence in the work area out of their containment zones.
5. Ensure that personnel are adequately trained ("

        We standardized the SRRz lysis gene and the β-galactosidase gene, to build a novel visible reporter. And then                 we screened out a series of operons specifically responding to different kinds of heavy metal ions which                 can be expressed in E.coil BL21. We make a collection of these parts, linked our reporter with different heavy metal ion-specific operons, and created a series of new Devices.

SYSU-Software,2017,Team:SYSU-Software#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the similar key words efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a fast algorithm based on binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy.
Models used in the system
Word2Vec Algorithm
Word2vec is an algorithm that produces word embedding , i.e. it converts a corpus of text into a high dimensional real vector space(in our case , the dimension is 400) and each word in the corpus is assigned to a vector in the vector space. If two words are similar semantically , then they will be close under cosine distance measure.
In our Recommendation System, we use gensim, an open source Python module focused on Natural Language Processing , to train our word2vec model and the corpus we use to feed the model is wikimedia, which can be downloaded from: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/
The reason why we use Word2vec is that it can distinguish the semantic meanings of words accurately by Deep Learning technique, which outperforms the traditional semantic analysis methods greatly.
KD Tree Algorithm
The KD Tree algorithm is rather efficient when searching for the most similar items with averaged time complexityO(log(n)),thus the users can get recommendation instantly after they enter their interested new word to our system.
The KD Tree Algorithm consists of the following two parts:
Construct KD Tree based on the normalized word vectors of the key words in the database which we previously mentioned. (Offline)
When the user enter a new word , we search the similar key words along the KD Tree that we constructed in step 1) . (Online)
Note that KD Tree Algorithm is based on Euclidean distance measure , while in our case , we need to calculate the cosine distance of the word vectors. To solve this problem ,we normalize all the word vectors of key words before constructing KD Tree and normalize the word vector of new words offered by users before letting it travel along the constructed KD Tree. The reason behind the method is that by Law of Cosines:           $$|x_1-x_2|=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2-2|x_1||x_2|\cos(x_1,x_2)}\,,\,\,x_1,x_2\in R^n$$
while since x1,x2 are normalized, we have :           $$|x_1-x_2| = \sqrt{1+1-2\cos(x_1,x_2)}\,,\,\,x_1,x_2\in R^n, |x_1|=|x_2|=1$$
Now we see that the calculation of cosine distance between"
UNITS_Trieste,2011,Team:UNITS Trieste#Data_-_-_TEXT.html,": the plasmid was control-digested with EcoRI/PstI and checked on gel electrophoresis, showing the expected pattern with the construct at about 1850 bp and the plasmid backbone at less than 3000 bp.
This plasmid was sent to sequence and the results were analyzed and compared with the irregular construct we'd previously made. The composite construct is correct but we observed some mutations in the glucosidase sequence.
To complete our construct, the BBa_I13522 PTet GFP was resuspended, transformed, extracted and digested with XbaI/PstI. This fragment was then ligated into our SpeI/PstI-digested construct. The ligation product was transformed into DH5α, giving some positive green colonies expressing GFP.
Positive colonies were expanded and the extracted and digested with EcoRI/PstI. The digested fragments were finally ligated into the kanamycin-resistant vector pSB1K3, then transformed into DH5α and seeded with the appropriate antibiotic, in order to allow the selective growth only of the colonies carrying our construct B1 ligated in the new plasmid.
Notes:
It has been planned to join in this high copy number plasmid also the parts present in the other medium copy number plasmid (PLasI-TraI and PConst-LasR). This strategy was performed with success during the last week.
Pcost-LasI
This plasmid contains a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100) that guarantee a continuous production of the LasI synthase (BBa_K081016) that in turn produces the 3OC12 AHL autoinducer.
The LasI generator device present in the registry – BBa_K081016 - has been resuspended and then amplified through transformation into DH5α competent cells. The plasmid was then extracted and digested (XbaI/PstI).
At the same time the constitutive promoter containg plasmid was processed in the same way except for the digestion (SpeI/ PstI).
The obtained composit part is then transfered to a medium copy plasmid (pBBR)
Notes:
It has been planned to insert the RFP reporter (BBa_I13522) downstream this part and to obtain all the elements on a single plasmid. This strategy was performed with success during the last week of work.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," come into being in the 3-D model and try to see the nature of this concern, besides the more direct analysis of the concern itself.
     Questions in the second stage mainly involves the means in which synthetic biology does its work, such as standardization, animal testing, etc.
     The ""stage"" dimension helps to determine the approximate location of a roughly asked question, and by realizing its place in a larger scope, we can see the surrounding issues more clearly.
     At all times, the 3-D model can apply, especially if we are trying to see the source of a problem.
3. Tracing Back to the Origin
Diversity forms the world of senses, unicity lies at the heart of intuition. ""Tao produced one, one produced two, two produced three, three produced everything"", says the Taoist sage Lao Tzu.
     This verse could be looked at as a simple paradigm of the development of a discipline. Synthetic biology has passed its initial stage and is somewhere on its way to a world of ""everything"". When complexity increases with perhaps some exponential rate with each step forward, simplicity becomes more than a style but a necessity. When going forward, perhaps sometimes we should also track backward, and the farthest we can go with rationality is the state of ""one"", whereas the ""Tao"" before that is not a thought explainable by scientific language.
     The verse could also be interpreted as a simplified paradigm on the formation of human perceptions. There is ultimately one thing, one idea, or one event that lies at the bottom of a series of issues, and this one thing was the first thing that entered the human psyche and anchored there. The rest, and the later, are but metamorphoses or projections of this one, and we cannot say we truly know ourselves if we do not delve that deep. However, the road to the depth is arduous and tricky; it's like the layers of dream in the movie Inception: the deeper you go, the more irrationality and instability you counter.
     The bottom belongs to the realms of psychology and some more arcane disciplines. ""Our psyche speaks in metaphors, in analogies, in images"".[3] Such as, the myths. Though, should the word ""myths"" even stand shoulder to shoulder with the word ""science""? Perhaps not; they make an odd couple, they differ too greatly in almost everything from contents to methods. However, with the phra4se ""ethics of science"", then, maybe. And in some cases, definitely. Because ethics is fundamentally about humans, and since humans"

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," in this case because it would require further details of the nature of the activity (species of bacterium, exact genetic modification, containment measures etc). However, theoretically it could be argued that similar activities might be regulated under ‘contained use’ if the environmental risk assessment demonstrates that the GM bacteria are effectively contained.
Key points from our talk can be seen below:
1. Applicants will have to determine whether they apply on deliberate release or the contained use of GMOs. For our project, we will have to prove that our device (panel and membrane) is robust enough to keep our bacteria in when placed in the environment to argue for applying to ‘contained use’.
2. Guidance and regulation of non-plant releases of GMO is currently geared towards clinical trials. In clinical trials, they look at the level of attenuation of any pathogens that is used and the level of biological containment. When it comes to experimental releases, they will consider biological containment as well as physical containment measures. A kill switch could come into the category of biological containment but even a kill switch would be quite a new application. Regulators would expect a lot of detail in the environmental risk assessment.
3. In a deliberate release of GMOs, DEFRA will publish the application online on gov.uk (previous applications are recorded there as well). The applicant is also required to state an advertisement of their intended use in a national newspaper (such as the Times, Telegraph, or Metro). DEFRA will also invite representation for public consultation where the public can make comments on the safety or any environmental/human health risk that may occur due to the release of GMO. Only scientific concerns/comments are accepted and considered by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) as part of their deliberation.
4. Although decision about the legislation of research into GMOs can be taken in a national level, decisions on the commercialization of GMOs have to be taken at a European level at the moment (while the UK is still in the EU). Anything beyond the EU will depend on the GMO legislation in whichever country the applicant would like to commercialize in. However, some third world countries may not have any GM regulatory system at all. In this case, then it is possible that these countries may require the applicant to gain approval in the EU first which has a well-respected GM regulation.

Hi!
I am one of the team-members of Team Stockholm, my name is Nina Schiller and I am a master student in molecular biology at Stockholm University. It is the endless possibilities and opportunities in the field of synthetic biology that has caught my attention to put together our iGEM team: Team Stockholm. To me, this field of research and iGEM competition drives science researchers and students to gain better insight and take advantage of the diverse and powerful characters of living organisms. This summer, I will together with my team mates work our hardest to combine biology, chemistry and engineering in order to understand, harness and imitate the complex phenomena of biological life and finally build innovative and useful biological systems.
My goal with iGEM is to challenge myself to think “out of the box” and seek for ways to put together bits and pieces in science in order to design organisms that would prove useful in the obstacles in modern life. I look forward to build up my science knowledge and laboratory experience. Of course, with a great idea in our luggage, both my and the whole teams goal is to win the iGEM competition!

andreas (at) igem.se
I first came in contact with synthetic biology in 2008, when I heard about attempts to create a petroleum-producing bacterium to be used as an alternative energy source. Immediately fascinated by this idea and the synthetic biology concept and methodology, my aim has been to study this interesting field ever since. This has now led to the founding of a Stockholm-based team in the 2010 iGEM competition.
What fascinates me most about synthetic biology is that it links biology and engineering together. With a great interest in both, I see iGEM as a unique opportunity for me to combine my creativity and knowledge in molecular biology to design and build a biological machine that can be used in every-day life.
With a revolutionary idea, dedicated and hard-working team-members and a large portion of self-confidence, Team Stockholm is ready to fight for the 2010 iGEM Gold Medal!
See you at the jamboree at MIT in November!

Implementing a tool to compare different type of phages-bacteria interaction:
Thanks to our iGEM Meet’up in Marseille we were able to explain the first version of this modeling and on the advice of one of the participants we looked into implementing a tool for comparing the different type of phages-bacteria interaction.
We would have like to do this with as many phages as possible, unfortunately we did not manage to obtain key parameters for a lot of different strains of phages, therefore we only offer to the user the possibility to choose between 2 phages-bacteria interaction: C.jejuni and C.difficile for which we had complete set of parameters (respectively thanks to this article and to our partnership with Nottingham).
However, we offer to the user to choose an interesting set of parameters, that are not related to any particular strain of phage, but show the wide spectrum of different interaction possible. We also added the possibility for the user to change any parameters after he chose one strain of phage.
We implemented 5 interesting set of parameters:
High phages multiplication
Fast-growing bacteria
Low phages binding rate
Slow lysis
Low carrying capacity
User interface:
In order to give a more user-friendly modeling to the user, we implemented 3 interactive dialog prompt.
The first one allows the user to choose the phages-bacteria interaction:
Figure 3: Phage-bacteria interaction choice
The second one allows the user to choose the initial population of phages and bacteria. It also allows the user to choose 2 parameters that have an impact on the computing time: timespan and accuracy of the modeling. And finally, it gives the user the option of choosing a file name for the modeling figure that will be saved as an image in the current folder at the end of the process.

The third one allows the user to change directly the key parameters of the system modeling.

Another Definition of Reaction Parameters
By constructing the two interwined database, we can easily retrieve chemical dynamics parameters, match reactions or substances, traverse possibly extended bio-network or reaction network. Above all, we can retrieve enough information to abstract the real, substential system to soundly built linear/nonlinear ODE array system, based on which, we can predict behavior, modify choices and make suggestions.
Though there does exist quite a lot of standard protocols and techniques depicting measurements to quantify bio-chemical reaction parameters under strictly defined reacting environment, the high cost and usually mediocre outcome still can hardly live up to prople's needs. Now assume the modeling has enough precision of simulation/identification, we can loose the strict requirements of reaction system and leave the addtional complexity originated from loosen conditions to the program, and choose experimental data from a much wider range of reactions to 'fit' the 'true"

Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
METHODS OVERVIEW
The measurements were done in a plate reader. Because the 96 well format of the plate reader is convenient for multiple measurements, the methods are written from the perspective of 96 well format. The 96 well plates were clear bottomed plates. All plate reading was done using a Molecular Devices Spectramax i3x. This device has variable temperature settings, pathlength correction and can measure both absorbance and fluorescence. All GFP measurements were taken at wavelengths of 532/25 for emission and 485/20 for excitation. We did not perform the optional flow cytometry experiment as our flow cytometer is difficult to use, requiring the efforts of a trained technician, making it impractical for its use in this study.
For complete methods click here.
Calibration
Measured a standard curve for fluorescein to allow this data to be standardized with the data from other iGEM labs. Fluorescein displays similar excitation and emission as GFP and could also be read by the plate reader. This allowed for measurements of GFP fluorescing cells to to be transformed into similar fluorescein readings.
Followed a LUDOX protocol to serve as a reference point that functioned as a conversion factor. This conversion factor allowed for the absorbance values taken at 600 nm to be converted into OD600 measurements.
A plate was prepared with silica microspheres and read by the plate reader at 600 nm. These microspheres have similar functional characteristics to cells that allows for the absorbance measurements to accurately estimate cell counts. Our measurements for this step can be considered flawed as we neglected to perform the initial dilution of the samples before preparing the plate. As well, this sample was not recorded at the correct wavelength. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the error, and the limited quantity of the reagent, we depleted our supply and could not redo the experiment.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," and clogging was inevitable at low flow rates. Finally, the hydrogel was floating around freely in the liquid thus the required spatial precision for 3D printing was impossible to achieve in such a setup.
We concluded that we would need something to which the hydrogel could attach, something that would keep bacterial cells alive and in the best case could also be used as a calcium ion source for the gel formation. We found such a material in LB agar to which we added calcium chloride at a concentration of 0.1M.
This turned out to be quite successful: diffusion of calcium ions from the agar was able to trigger the hydrogel formation even through a thickness of eight layers printed successively on top of each other. However, we identified one major flaw: in order to redissolve the hydrogel, the calcium ions are complexed with sodium citrate and replaced with sodium ions. Introducing an excessive abundance of calcium into the agar would thus lead to problems at a later stage when trying to redissolve the alginate.
4.6 cm in diameter
1.5 mm single line thickness
3 mm final line thickness (8 layers).
For this reason, we adapted the system in the following way: we plated 500 µL of 0.1M calcium chloride solution directly before the printing. In this manner, the top layer of the gel was sufficiently saturated with calcium ions to produce the hydrogel, but calcium ion abundance was kept as little as possible.
The distance between the tip and the print surface is of great importance. Initial experiments with larger distances were optically characterised by resembling a pearl necklace: due to the large distance, droplets were able to form in a repetitive pattern disturbing the straight line. In order to prevent this, the distance between the tip and the print surface thus must be kept as little as possible. However, due to unevenness of the surface, this lead to some problems. Being close to the agar, the needle often got stuck in the surface due to the nature of the mechanical movement. To tackle this problem, we decided to change our setup from extruding the alginate through a needle to leaving out the needle and only using the tubing. This offered the advantage of a simpler setup and improved flexibility when the tip touched the print surface.
This setup has proven to meet our purposes well and was used by us until the end.
Finally, we are working with bacteria, so what about sterility? To ensure high quality in our experiments, all our solutions were autoclaved to prevent unwanted contamination. Unfortunately, sodium alginate is decomposed during autoclaving. For this reason"

High Temperature Induced System – cI Promoter & cI repressor
Design
In order to make our target protein has a large amount of performance at high temperature, we use the circuit BBa_K098995 , which is designed by Team Harvard 2008. (Figure1)
Figure 1.
Part BBa_K098995 Design, with constitutive strong promoter BBa_J23114 , followed by RBS(Ribosome Binding Site) BBa_B0034 , cI repressor BBa_K098997 , terminator BBa_B0014 , and high temperature-sensitive cI promoter BBa_R0051 . Among this circuit, cI repressor( BBa_K098997 ) will be produced constantly to inhibit the cI promoter( BBa_R0051 ) at low temperature. At high temperature, cI repressor( BBa_K098997 ) is still produced, however; cI repressor( BBa_K098997 ) will degrade soon. In this way, cI promoter( BBa_R0051 ) will be activated. This part is designed by 2008 Harvard on backbone pSB1A2, and we transform this part to host strain DH5α for further use.
This circuit uses gene BBa_K098997 coding for cI repressor to inhibit the cI promoter BBa_R0051 . The activity of cI repressor is gradually decreased by elevating temperature from 30 ℃ to 42 ℃. We just need to place our target gene after this circuit BBa_K098995 , and then regulate the performance of our target protein by incubating E.coli at different temperatures between 30℃ to 42℃. At higher temperature, our target protein will produce abundantly. On the contrary, at lower temperature, it will not express well. The function of this circuit is illustrated as followed.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," genomic sequence of B. subtilis and E.     coli to potentially increase the     stability. It is followed by the sequence of the TetR system: a     quad-part inverter based on tetracycline that inverts the signal     since both riboswitches stop gene expression upon binding their     respective metabolite. The TetR QPI inverter reverses this process     and cause protein expression when the riboswitches have bound the     ligand of interest. This is the desired outcome in the overarching     project: a V. destructor sensing bacteria would ideally start with     the production of a toxin in presence of the mite. Instead of a     toxin, mRFP is used as a reporter gene.
iGEM Wageningen 2016 sent us these two BioBricks ( BBa_K1913011 and BBa_K1913012 )  they constructed, one to detect guanine and one     for vitamin B12. We helped them to show that the RFP expression is     controlled by the concentration of either vitamin B12 or guanine.     We could show an increasing RFP signal with increasing      concentration of vitamin B12 and guanine using a photometric     measurement with the plate reader (see protocol below). We also took     pictures of the cells at the microscope with and without vitamin     B12 or guanine.
Figure 3. BioBricks from Wageningen safely arrived      in Groningen and happily grow on our agar plates.
1. Photometric measurement of the OD600 and mRFP fluorescence
Grow E. coli in 3 ml LB with 35 μl/ml chloramphenicol  at 37°C     and 220 rpm for 16 h. Prepare a transparent 96-well plate with a     total volume of 250 μl. Provide 175 μl LB and  25 μl of the     appropriate concentration of guanine or vitamin B12. Dilute cells     to an OD600 of 0.5 with LB and add 50 μl of this dilutions to each     well. To measure the fluorescence the excitation and emission of     mRFP was set on 584 nm and 607 nm, respectively, with a bandwidth     of 5 nm. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm. Measurements were     taken every 20 min at 37°C with the plate reader (Varioskan LUX     Reader, Thermo Fischer). The results can be seen in Figure 5 and     6.
