Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," create affordable, more economical, and more innovative future food systems, controlling environmental conditions.
AeroFarms, who have patented an aeroponic growing system for faster harvest cycles predictable results, superior food safety and less environmental impact.
High technology’s greenhouses, as automated and self-regulated plant growth system.
Among these proposals highlights Open agriculture, which pretends to develop a controlled-environmental agriculture engineering platforms called ""food computers"". This device automatically controls different parameters, optimizing the growth conditions of the plant seeking to decrease losses alike pest damages. Inside the confined space climate conditions are automated, meeting the users requirements and desires.
However, this Food Computers only controls external factors. Some of the problems related to crops are solved, but substantial ones still exist. In many instances it is unlikely to stop a pest since their hardware cannot be 100% isolated.
Valencia UPV team realized SynBio offers all the possibilities to carry plant growth control to a higher level.
CHATTERPLANT INTEGRATED SYSTEM
ChatterPlant is proposed as a SynBio-based solution to control plant growth in both genetical and environmental way. A bidirectional communication is mandatory to establish a properly system. Other technologies only provide the manage of environmental conditions, keeping away from a total control system.
In order to achieve that control, we designed ChatterBox, an specific device that regulates precisely plant growth conditions while enables a bidirectional human-plant interaction. Merging both SynBio and cutting-edge technologies in greenhouses, thorough control of plant processes is achieved.
Following bullets summarize >main converging points between SynBio circuits and ChatterBox :
Optogenetic switch enables to intervene in plant development by regulating its genetic profile. Systems’ activation/deactivation is carried out by “Optogenetic” lamps, equipped with red/far-red wavelengths.
Color code sensor circuit which flags the presence of specific plant stresses contains different AND gates. In normal basis, ΦC31 recombinase is being expressed in the plant and the stress-inducible promoter is always inverted. In this case, the circuit is inactivated and there will be any change in plant. If plant is under stress, phenotypic color variation is detected with the integrated camera and an specific recognition software, so the appropriate actions could be taken accordingly.
Adding to this, ChatterBox is able to regulate temperature, humidity and illumination as well as NFT hydroponic system is used to manage irrigation, oxygenation and crop nutrition. Besides in order to connect the ChatterBox to the user, a human - machine interface was developed, this opens the communication between both agents. Having this is possible"

CHOICE OF MATERIALS
crdS, crdA and crdC genes
✵ crdS gene codes the Curdlan synthase.
✵ crdA gene codes a protein which assists translocation of nascent polymer across cytoplasmic membrane.
✵ crdC gene codes a protein which assists translocation of nascent polymer across the periplasm.
crdA, crdC, crdS genes occupy a contiguous 4,948-bp region in Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749.
N.B. We tried to work on these three genes. However, amplification attempts by PCR were unsuccessful for crdA and crdC genes. So, in a first time, we focused on cloning crdS gene only.
OsmY promoter
In Agrobacterium sp.ATCC31749, Curdlan production is started after a nitrogen starvation in stationary phase. So we decided to use OsmY promoter (BBa_J45992) characterized by MIT 2006 iGEM team which is active in stationary phase and under high osmotic pressure condition. This promoter imitates Curdlan biosynthesis in E.coli without the nitrogen stress.
Figure 1: Growth dependent regulation with three promoters
(Property of MIT 2006 iGEM team)
M63 and LB media
Curdlan production was carried out in two different media: LB medium and M63 medium.
✵ We worked on M63 medium because a mineral salt medium is used on the literature [1]. M63 is a minimal, low osmolarity medium for E.coli, resulting in slower growth rate of these cells.
→ With this medium of known composition we were able to control parameters for the production of our molecule of interest.
✵We worked also on LB medium because this is the most common medium used in the laboratory.

ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," profound contributions and achieve social values.
This year, iDPI collaborated with Shanghai Coordinate International School, holding an iGEM Lab Open House Day on Zhangjiang campus. The activity took place in the early September. At noon time, along with another iGEM team at ShanghaiTech, our iGEM team members warmly welcomed the visiting delegation from Shanghai Coordinate International School at the conference room. Leaded by Teacher Gordon, a leading science teacher at the Coordinate, the delegation consisted of 8 high school students from different grades.
An introduction speech to the ShanghaiTech was first delivered by the team member Haolong. Then he continued to further talked about the background of iGEM as well as synthetic biology. After that, delegates from two of the iGEM team conducted a brief presentation on the iGEM project subsequently. Finally an open discussion session was held, where the high school students demonstrated strong interests about synthetic biology and actively asked questions about the iGEM and our projects. Some of them even showed strong willingness to participate in the iGEM in the following year. As we responded at the meeting, we would be very happy to try to provide all sorts of assistance they may need to build up their own high school team for the iGEM. Also, if any of they were interested in real experience of hand-on lab operations, our iGEM lab was always open to them to visit and explore. Additionally, last week we were just informed by Teacher Gordon that their school would be very likely to build up their first-ever high school iGEM team; hopefully they may officially participate in the competition in the following years. We would keep providing them sufficient assistance and support as long as necessary.
After the speech and discussion, a lab visiting was scheduled as the second session of the Open House Day. Our team members paired with the visiting high school students, guiding them around the research center at school. We introduced the equipment to them one by one, from the cell disruptor to the ultra-centrifuge, from the FACS to TEM, explaining the mechanisms behind in popular and easy-to-understand language. Part of our lab results were demonstrated as well, so as to help them build a better understanding on our projects.
The Open House Day ended around 6 in the evening. As one of the visiting students commented, this lab tour was very impressive and amazing which greatly aroused his curiosity to explore the secrets of nature. And this was just the core value shared by iDPI to pass the knowledge and inspire the interests to the next young generations.

Figure 10. Closed circuit diagram
Figure 11 Current density which is normalized with electrode surface area over time
After we built the mfc circuit as shown in figure 10, we could obtain the current over time when the variable resistor is fixed. Dividing the measured current by contact surface area of the electrodes, we could obtain the above graph. Figure 11 showed a constant increase of the current density over time during the experimental period.
Figure 12. Relationship describing electromotive force,  current, load resistance and internal resistance
Therefore, it is possible to determine the internal resistance by plotting the above graph, given that the emf is a constant. However, emf is not a constant for mfc as well as the internal resistance.
As known, the internal resistance of a microbial fuel cell is affected by the emf of itself. To determine its relationship, different emf with corresponding internal resistance was recorded over time. Since the above graph is only valid in constant emf, we could only approximate the constant emf by obtaining the current-resistance relationship in a very short period of time so that the change of the emf could be neglected.
Figure 13 Internal resistance against electromotive force (emf)
The graph above showed the relationship of internal resistance and the output voltage of the microbial fuel cell across the first 90 minutes after it was built. 20mM lactate was added as the sole carbon source. The curve indicates that the internal resistance increases with the output voltage more rapidly in the early stage, but reaches its maximum as the voltage further increases. From this result, it could be concluded that the internal loss of the MFC will be gradually minimised as long as the voltage continue to increase.

Figure 14. Teriminal power output over time
Figure 15 Total work done of MFC
Since we have obtained the relationship of voltage against the current, which could be evaluated to the terminal power output, we want to tentatively evaluate the actual energy output of our MFC. As we learnt from the figure 13, the power will fluctuate at the beginning, but it will develop an apparent increasing trend after the experiment had been carried out for 50 minutes. To further visualise the actual energy output of the MFC, we calculate the total work done from the data of power and it gives the figure 14, which still abide to the increasing trend of the power.  From the two figure above, we could conclude that our designed MFC could be applicable"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Future possible applications_-_-_TEXT.html," immune system for transgene expression in eukaryotic cells (mammalian cells)
Hiroshi Ochiai (2010) reported that positive feedback system provides efficient transgene expression in Hela cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Additional papers regarding gene therapy suggested plasmid that lacks bacterial backbone due to recombination by site-specific recombination (such as minicircles) will improve efficiency of transgene, because host immune system will not reject entity containing foreign vectors such as bacteria.
The recombination of origin of replication and marker gene or antibiotic resistance gene can reduce allergic responses in an individual should the application be used in eukaryotic cells such as gene therapy.
4. Reduced GM pollens dissemination
The propagation of GM pollen by GM crops have been a major concern especially its effect on undesired gene flow. Transgene removal in pollen prior to its dissemination is, thus, a crucial step to prevent gene flow happens.
Our sensing module can be adjusted to detect specific stimulus and temporally produce protein of interest necessary for plants for a controlled period. Recombinase can then knockout gene of interest safely.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," design an experiment in such a way that the risks have minor consequences and a low probabilities. In practice, however, this is not always possible; though the goal of risk management is, for all risks, to diminish the probability of occurrence, the severity of consequence, or both, such that safety can be ensured with high fidelity. The first steps in achieving this goal are the identification and assessment of present risks. In the Risk assessment tool several general risks (identified by the team) are presented to the user, and a simple solution to obtain an indication of their criticality is provided. Creating awareness of the risks that are critical enables mitigation of these risks and an increase in the level of safety.
The final version of the tool addresses risks following from the used chemical compounds and risks following from the used type of organisms and vectors. Firstly, the user can indicate which chemical compounds are used in the experiment and in what way these are used (concentration and frequency of use) (figure 1).
Figure 1: The user can indicate which chemical compounds are used in the experiment and in what way these are used.
The tool analyzes this information using material safety data on the chemicals in question, which results in a quantification of the risks the chemicals pose. Five classes of compound-related risks are distinguished; oxidation, explosion, flammability, health hazard, and environmental hazard; roughly based on the GHS hazard categories. Upon user input providing the CAS-number of the to be analyzed compounds, the tool searches the database of the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for hazard level classification data, which is returned to the tool memory. The analyzed chemicals are distributed over three hazard levels, based on the classification data obtained. The hazard level determines the severity of consequence assigned to the corresponding chemical risk. The user input on concentration of the used compounds and frequency of use determine the probability of occurrence of the corresponding chemical risk. The user can choose from three different options for both concentration and frequency of use (low, medium, high).
Figure 2: Risk matrix about the risks of the chemical compounds
Secondly, the user is asked to answer a set of questions about the host organism, donor organism, and vectors used in the experiments (figure 3).th The questions included in the tool are based on Dutch legislation on the use of GMOs, and the answers given are assigned a risk level according to this legislation.
Figure 3: The user is asked to answer a set of questions about the host organism, donor organism and vectors used in the experiments.
The answers to these question result in one specific risk level of the environmental and health related risk associated"

MOTIVATION
Open Bio Labs (OBL), a community biology laboratory in Charlottesville, currently implements the safety standards of the iGEM organization. While these are sufficient for the organization’s current purpose, we, the 2016 Virginia iGEM team, believe it is in the best interest of Open Bio Labs to adopt a standard set of safety guidelines better suited for the goals and philosophy of a biohackerspace with an emphasis on biocontainment.
In the United States, there are three primary regulatory agencies for synthetic biology: the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A 2014 report on Synthetic Biology and the US Biotechnology Regulatory System by J. Craig Venter Institute cites that these agencies have an adequate level of authority to address most, but not all, environmental, health and safety concerns with regard to synthetic biology. 5Reference:
Sarah R. Carter, Ph.D., Michael Rodemeyer, J.D., Michele S. Garfinkel, Ph.D., and Robert M. Friedman, Ph.D. (2014). Synthetic Biology and the US Biotechnology Regulatory System: Challenges and Option (J. Craig Venter Institute). Because APHIS’ authority extends over engineered plants and FDA’s authority extends over foods and drugs, EPA is the only agency with broad authority to make regulatory decisions based on risks posed by genetically modified microbes to health and safety of humans, animals and ecosystems. A primary concern is that the anticipated increase in number and diversity of engineered microbes, especially those intended to be used in an open environment, will challenge EPA’s resources, expertise and authority to regulate synthetic biology. Furthermore, studies done by the NRC have concluded that genetic engineering does not present more risks than other methods of genetic modification like traditional breeding or hybridization.16Reference:
(2004). Safety of Genetically Engineered Foods: Approaches to Assessing Unintended Health Effects (Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press). Thus, individual products could pose risks that depend on the genetic changes made to which constructs, which can only be assessed on a case-by-base basis, an additional challenge for regulation.

Uppsala,2014,Team:Uppsala#ProjectTest TargetingTest_-_-_TEXT.html," cheZ expression cassette including the J23114 promoter (strain 5) is not as clear as that of the other two constructs. The structures that have grown upon incubation resemble the negative control. For strain 5, these structures include cloudy formations, however, which is most clearly visible in figure 2C.
Based on these results, we conclude that both the cheZ expression cassette including a J23100 promoter and the cassette including a J23113 promoter were able to restore motility in a cheZ mutant. It is not clear if an expression cassette containing J23114 was able to achieve the same result. Further experiments should be performed to determine this.
The expression cassette including the Anderson promoter J23100 swarmed to a greater extent than the cassette including the Anderson promoter J23113. This was to be expected, as J23100 is a stronger promoter than J23113. The strain containing the expression cassette including J23100 swarmed to a smaller extent than the positive control, however, which is surprising, given the fact that J23100 is such a strong promoter.
This could be caused by the fact that the number of cells that was applied during inoculation was not normalized by growing appropriate cultures to mid-log phase. The positive control might simply show more swarming, because of a higher cell count. Including the protocol for growth in further tests could show if this is the case.
Wolfe and Howard [4] give another possible explanation. They state that cells that tumble infrequently may move slower on agar plates, as they alter their direction only slowly after running into an agar molecule. A cheZ expression level that is high might in this way restrain swarming, just like a low expression might hinder it. Coupling more Anderson promoters in cheZ expression cassettes, might help find the optimal promoter strength for swarming.

Project Overview
With a synthetic biological approach, Ari, et al. constructed a cellular counter termed the riboregulated transcriptional cascade (RTC) counter[1]. It counts the number of inputs by the state transition induced by an arabinose induction. The state tansition system is regulated by a riboregulator. The BioBrick part of this cellular counter has already been registered, which was constructed by Tokyo-Nokogen 2009 and was named BBa_K225002, BBa_K225003 [2].
In order to expand the function of this counter, we added a ""reset system"". The reset system enables the transition from any state to the initial state by a particular input, which gives applicability in various situations. One of the applications is the closed transition loop designed so that the reset system is exerted in the final state, which enables to regulate cellular behaviors periodically. For example, by constructing the state transition loop that have 7 states and assigning 7 states to the days of the week, it is possible to make cells produce drugs once a week by sensing hormone having a cycle of 24 hour-period and memorizing the number of times of the elevation of the hormone.

A riboregulator is a post-transcriptional regulation system composed of two kinds of RNAs, cis-repressed mRNA (crRNA) and trans-activating RNA (taRNA). crRNA forms a stem-loop and its ribosomal binding site (RBS) is covered (Fig. 1). Consequently the gene coded in cis-re"

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2009,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#The team_-_-_TEXT.html,". We began to brainstorm our project while learning more knowledge about the biosynthesizing field. We came up with a lot of interesting ideas, such as yeast that can produce strawberry bread, a bacterial gameboy, a biological monitor that can realize the transformation of pictures by fluorescent protein. Though some of ideas appear to be intriguing but are actually hard to realize. We were fond of thinking freely without any constraint. We guess it may also be the essence of the competition.
Our school's library offered us a meeting room.
Since it is the first time, we came across a lot of difficulties in the process because of lack of experience, such as having no idea about parts and standardized assembly. All the work before the Workshop has been put in vain.
Our representatives attended the iGEM Workshop in London.
In the summer, we encountered the biggest obstacle that we have ever met. Since we failed to plan all things well, students have already participated in a lot of lab internship programs and there were few students left in the lab. The initial plan of competing with two projects has put a lot of pressure on us. Fortunately, we invited the team from Peking University to have a discussion and share the experience with us at the end of July. After that, we finally found the crux of the problem. We recruited our members at the beginning of August and disciplined the team. At the same time, we made up our mind to focus on a single project by choosing from the two. The meeting has become a turning point of the team.
PKU_Beijing Team 's visit to our school.
Everything is going well after that. We combined our effort in doing our lab task, discussing wiki, designing our post and preparing out presentation. In the end, we are proud to stand on the podium of the MIT for 2009 iGEM competition and show our fruitful result to the whole world.
Our original design of ur wiki frame, cultural shirt & mascots
When looking back into the team formation process, we found that we were lucky. Though we have felt our way out and went through numerous tough moments, we finally make it. We hold our firm belief in no pain, no gain. The result may not be the medal, but rather the experience itself.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," are not competent.  That message may affect your experimental constellations, your methods and your theory of science up to the members of research groups. Prof. Stoellger was impressed about the concept of iGEM and how this competition in Synthetic Biology encourages young scientists to reflect on safety , environment and the involvement and contribution of the general public to the design and elaboration of the scientific project. Following this concept, young scientists would grow to become responsible researchers in the future.

Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image Processing and
When we considered to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) for our software project for the first time, we wanted to ensure that we do not endanger anybody with this powerful, but controversial technology. Interviewing high school students, we learned about their fears regarding the use of AI. Dr. Ullrich Köthe elucidated all potential risks, and we discussed dystopian predictions where AI dominates the entire earth or universe and turns all available matter and energy into ""Computronium"". To answer the question whether these dystopian predictions might come true one day, he referred to the onset of gene technology: People pointed out severe risks thirty years ago, but science has found effective counter-measures to keep these risks under control. The current discussion about AI is in many ways similar. Informing us about leading experts who anticipate computers to achieve general intelligence or even super-intelligence, he especially referred to Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil predicts that “by 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence” and ""set the date 2045 for singularity — which is when humans will multiply our effective intelligence a billion fold, by merging with the intelligence we have created” - Dr. Köthe considers this estimation to be quite optimistic. He points out that we cannot predict AI-related threats and dangers far into the future, because we have no idea how computers at this level of intelligence will work. Current dystopian ideas are mainly extrapolations of human weaknesses, which are unlikely to apply to intelligent machines in the same way. Existing (weak) AI systems usually make mistakes that are markedly different from typical human errors in the same situation. Therefore, it is necessary to advance our understanding of AI goal control and safety in close association with our improving understanding of AI itself. For the time being, AI will remain unable to cause severe trouble, unless actively misused by a human. All in all, Dr. Köthe quietened down our concerns and general fears of dystopian AI and made us feel more relaxed using AI for our software approach.

Introduction
Examples
GANs and Synthetic Biology
What are Generative Adversarial Networks?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are deep neural network architectures comprised of two different networks, contesting with each other.
In 2014, Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues at University of Montreal introduced GANs in their research article
Generative Adversaral networks is the most interesting idea in the last ten years in machine learning
Yann LeCun, Director, Facebook Ai
These generative networks have an immense potential, as they can learn to mimic any distribution of a given dataset. GANs are creative „robot artists“ which are capable to imagine and generate things we can grasp and understand: images, music, speech, stories...

Introduction by Analogy
Let‘s say there is a jewelery store which purchases diamonds from customers and later resells them.
However, there are customers that have decided to try and sell fake diamonds. In such case, the jewelery store must be able to distinguish between the fake and real diamonds or else they will start losing money.
Initially, the forger might make a lot of mistakes when making and selling the fake diamonds and it will be easy for jewelery shop to identify that those diamonds are, in fact, fake. Yet, the forger will try many different techniques to simulate an authentic diamond and eventually might trick the store owners. After that, the forger knows that certain methods work better then the others, and will build upon those techniques to improve even more.
At the same time, the jewelery store might get some feedback from other shop owners or diamond quality experts. As the store receives more and more diamonds, they will become better and better at distinguishing them.
Therefore, the main goal of the forger is to make diamonds that are indistinguishable from the real"

The ladder seems to be wrong. So it was really difficult to ckeck the size of our plasmid ppL82. To make, that, we assume that the size of our biobricks was ok, and we estimate the size of our plasmid. The plasmid ppL82 seems to have the right size, but we will have to check again to be able to use a ladder.
Competence of B.S. kept on the bench
We observed B.S. with a microscope. Problem, all B.S. seems to be dead!
Possible reasons of this problem :
- Problem with the vector (it could be a wrong vector, we are not really sure)
- Quantity of DNA, we added 0.5μg. The protocol was 1μg, but normally it should be ok.
- B.S. may not be competent (we have to test motility with microscope)
- Cells could be dead : replate them
- Try to add tryptophan in the medium
Probable reason : we forgot to dilute the medium B, that's why it did not work
Results from transformation plates (B.S.)
There are 2 colonies on a plate, but it does not look like Bacillus. Moreover, there is also a colony on our negative control plate. SO it must be contamination (resistant to CM!). We will do the transformation again.

Overview
Background
Two years ago the Michigan Software 2014 team began development                of ProtoCat 1.0. Like many innovative ideas, ProtoCat began because of a problem. Studies have estimated                that only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible.  A 2014 survey conducted                by the Michigan Software team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic                biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols.                The majority of these scientists indicated unclear language and missing steps are the greatest                contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A second study conducted by last                year's Michigan Software team only further confirmed the sentiments of the first study. These                issues are what ProtoCat has been designed to solve.
Solution
Every respondent of the second survey indicated that they                would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that                they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 3.0                is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more                repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe                this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a                broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 3.0 works to establish                such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a                repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally,                ProtoCat 3.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by                allowing users to document, rate, review, and edit existing methods.
ProtoCat 4.0
ProtoCat 4.0 is optimized for collaboration among users                and offers the best user experinece we have developed. We've added features such as threaded comments,                 notifications, protocol favoriting, and a new chat system called ProtoChat in this                 years verions of ProtoCat. Now users can communicate through commenting and chatting                 to make improvements on existing protocols or favorite one they like to quickly relocate                 it. ProtoCat also recieved a password recover system, notifications, and a better search                 algorithm to search more fields of a protocol. In addition, users can now create drafts                 of a protocol which allows them to start and finish a new protocol at their convienience.                 These are are all"

We introduced Cry toxin as another candidate to kill the infected bee. According to assessment made by EPA(Environmental Protection Agency), the 5-day LC50 on honey bee require 7.0*107 cfu/g diet. However, the efficiency is not still good enough to stop the spreading of Nosema ceranae. We designed a positive feedback builded up by T7 promoter and T7 polymerase to shorten LC50 of honey bee. Besides, we cloned B0015 right after the ROS promoter in case bee accidentally killed by Bee. coli.
Circuit design
According to the result of modeling, it is obvious that we should put 1~2 terminators whose forward efficiency is about 0.98 CC after our hybrid promoter. The purpose of the terminators is to prevent bees from dying easily.The purpose of the terminators is to prevent bees from dying easily. On top of that, the other important part is the positive feedback circuit. It is useless that we only produce very few pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or Cry toxin. Hence we introduced some biobricks to our circuit to exert efficiency.
The coding sequence of the first train is Part:BBa_K145001 , which is the upstream DNA sequence of T7 polymerase. Otherwise, one of the coding sequence on the second strain will also be transcribed into the mRNA of T7 polymerase. In order to construct positive feedback of the alcohol-producing enzymes, we set a T7 polymerase coding sequence on the second train. Meanwhile in front of the second train, we place the receptor of T7 polymerase and T7 promoter . In case of the leaky condition, we choose T7 polymerase as our go-between of alcohol-producing enzymes proliferating system.
Experiment
Test the producing efficiency with positive feedback
Introduction
It is not enough to just produce enzymes to synthesize alcohol. We need a more abrupt, rapid way to produce PDC and ADH which were enzymes responsible for synthesizing alcohol, so we add T7 system on the original circuit to construct positive feedback.
Background
According to the experiment made by 5th group, we could know the efficiency of ROS promoter
According to the experiment made by Caitlin Conboy, we could know the forward efficiency of B0015 [1]

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids were assembled using BioBrick assembly techniques, and a full list of parts used in this subproject is described below in Table 4. All parts are assembled the standard BioBrick vector pSB1C3 unless otherwise stated.
Table 4: Full list of Biobricks parts submitted during this subproject.
Basic parts
PCR reactions were designed to amplify the C-terminal fragment of GFP, and both the N and C-terminal fragments of T7 RNAP. These three amplifications additionally inserted the weak ribosome binding site B0032 upstream of the coding sequence of these fragments. Following the reactions, gel electrophoresis confirmed successful amplification of the fragment parts. The fragments were purified following the QIAGEN PCR Cleanup kit protocol, then each was restriction digested for ligation into pSB1C3 vectors. Following transformation of the ligation reactions, three transformant colonies were picked, cultured overnight, and miniprepped. Minipreps were then checked by restriction digest for the presence of correct insert and vector sizes, which was confirmed correct for all three split-fragment parts. As a final confirmatory step, the GFP C-terminal, T7 N-term, and T7 C-term fragment BioBrick parts, now in the pSB1C3 vector, were sequenced using the VF2 BioBrick sequencing primer. Sequencing confirmed the correct assembly of the two T7 RNAP parts, but revealed an issue with the GFP C-terminal part – the PCR design had incorporated an incorrect version of the BioBrick prefix, shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3:  A Biobrick prefix error in GFP C-term part. Alignment of a sequencing read of the split GFP C-terminal to a reference sequence plasmid map. The bases highlighted in red indicate an insertion has occurred at those positions relative to the reference sequence. The insertion corresponds to the use of the “long” Biobrick prefix, rather than the short version which should precede ATG-starting parts. Alignments performed in ApE.
As explained on the http://parts.igem.org/Help:BioBrick_Prefix_and_Suffix page, BioBrick parts beginning with ATG must use a shortened version of the prefix ending TAG, instead of the longer version for non-ATG parts which ends TAGAG. The short version ensures ideal spacing between upstream ribosome binding site parts and the start codon. Unfortunately, this oversight of the primer design was not initially noticed our plasmid map sequence for the C-terminal GFP part also contained the error. A part such as"

Link To Our Safety Form
On August 12, a massive warehouse explosion hit Tianjin, China, resulting in at least 114 deaths and hundreds of people injured, let alone the economic loss it brought. The tons of hazardous articles leakage including sodium cyanide compelled thousands of people to leave their homes.
This devastating blast put safety issues on the table. Synthetic biology, as a sensitive and controversial subject needs to be paid more attention in the potential safety threats it may bring. To shoulder our responsibility for development of synthetic biology, our iGEM team highly valued the safety training, risk assessment and safety design. Notably, the safety test and instructions from professors ensured health among our teammates. The bacteria has also been assessed and decontaminated by us in order to guarantee safety outside of laboratory.
Lab Safety Course and Exam
Before our efforts to begin the experiments, we were all required to take Lab Safety Course in our school. The topics varied from proper dressing which includes wearing gloves, goggles and lab coats when working in lab, to general lab safety like no food or drinks stored in the lab, and no chemical and biological substances taken out of lab without permission and appropriate methods. In addition, we have been trained carefully to deal with hazardous and corrosive material by using fume hoods and protective gloves. Whoever uses those detrimental materials are required to be recorded and check the labels when they finish. The wasted substances need to be classified and collected in an appointed containers, and marked with name of substance as well as basic properties. Then we need to contact with disposal center from our school or other specialized company to deal with them. Also, maintaining a clean workspace is crucial since it can reduce the fluctuation brought by contaminants. For example, ethanol has been used to clean our desks before putting into service.
Particularly, this year, all of our team members have to read Laboratory Biosafety Manual carefully and take a safety exam. We can enter the lab only if we pass the exam, which makes sure that we have bore those tips in minds indeed.

Team: BERLIN
The IIT Delhi iGEM team whole-heartedly collaborated with Berlin team. Berlin team was working on the affordable, practical and effective diagnostic of the widespread third world parasitic disease -Tapeworm Infection. Since India is one of the countries where millions of people are infected by this parasite, IIT Delhi directed Berlin team to a suitable site. It was a hospital in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh where many cases of tapeworm were reported. After the successful extraction and lysis of the Tapeworm eggs, Berlin team obtained RNA molecules of the T. Solium species of the Tapeworm. IIT Delhi further assisted them by providing our own lab as -20 and -80 degrees centigrade refrigerators and other required lab apparatus were not available in the above-mentioned hospital. Sequencing of the RNA was also done and all the samples were shipped to them.
This was not only constricted to iGEM collaboration as we further plan to adopt this technology for affordable diagnostic of tapeworm infection which is otherwise done using fecal inspection using a microscope. This would help in timely detection of infection and thus would save lives of many people. Following this, Berlin team provided us the protease stains without Degradation Tags required by us to generate oscillations in the form of a square.

Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments aggregated by tubulin dimers end to end. And microtubule can be the hollow tube with 13 protofilaments coiled into helix with each other, water in hollow part. The tube wall is 4～5nm thick.  Tubulin dimers are incorporated into the growing lattice in the GTP-bound form and stochastically hydrolyze to GDP-tubulin, thus forming a GTP-cap. It is thought that the switching from growth to shrinkage occurs due to the loss of the GTP-cap.
Caplow M [1] research shows that when the cap structure of microtubule plus end subunit containing GDP- beta tubulin instead of GTP- beta tubulin, microtubule becomes unstable and will quickly disaggregate.
Fig.2 Microtubule dynamic instability
As is shown in the figure, there are two kinds of Dimer, called GDP and GTP, with blue and red two connected to the circular. These dimers have close relationship with each other, and there are three important modes of their action.
GTP-tubulin dimer in endpoint can aggregate new GTP to make the single protofilament grow, and microtubules extend.
At the same time, the endpoint GTP may also be made off, thereby protofilaments shorter.
Any place of GTP (in addition to the right endpoints of the GTP) made made random hydrolyzed to GDP have a chance.

We treated tubulin with taxol of different concentrations, measured their intensity of emission at around 520-530 nm wavelength.
First, we use the boxplot to conduct the descriptive statistical analysis. Then, we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data given by the experiment.

Before we use the one-way analysis of variance to deal with the data, we need to conduct some simple descriptive statistical analysis. This analysis can help us gain the overall understanding of the data, find the abnormal data, and then guide our next work.

UNC-Asheville,2017,Team:UNC-Asheville#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," project now formalized, our team now turned to the task of convincing our university to fund our research project. UNC-Asheville is a small liberal arts university and this project is the first ever iGEM team. The most similar thing that had been done at our school was a First Robotics team, which had strong professor support and was extremely well funded. Our team was told three days before the registration fee deadline that no money was forthcoming and that we would have to fundraise our own registration fee using a website called Givecampus. Although we were frustrated from being explicitly told not to fundraise on our own and then having to do so last minute, we managed to raise our registration fee with two days to spare, with the help of a large $2000 donation secured from the NC Biotech Center.
As the school year drew to a close we began asking departments for a spare room to use, and were eventually directed to the physical chemistry lab in our chemistry department. When we moved into the room in May, we had $84 leftover from our Givecampus page and equipment which had been previously purchased out of pocket for DIY bio projects at home - a few pipettes, a small centrifuge, and a hacked together cell incubator fondly named Gorgeous George. Fortunately, our advisor allowed us to borrow some of his disposables and reagents until money we had raised from our university campus commission unlocked - $2099 which did not unlock until July 1st.
In May we designed our parts to be ordered from IDT, a kickback without which our project would have been very hard to complete. We decided to remain as faithful as possible to sMMO while splitting it into 2 parts to adhere to IDT’s 3kB gBlock limit. Some minor edits were made to non-coding regions due to the IDT website disallowing sequences with large homology. dhLB was printed exactly as it was listed on the Australian iGEM website. The sequence for GroEl/Es was pulled from the Takara website and BLASTed to deduce what species it came from. It was identical to E.coli GroEl/Es, so our team added a Biobrick prefix and suffix, edited out the restriction sites that were not compatible to the format and sent it off to be printed. While our sequences were being printed, the team worked on other possible revenue streams, favors and getting loaned equipment. It was unanimously decided that the pressure cooker we had purchased from eBay could be dropped in favor of the school’s autoclave.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Experiments#Anti Cancer Toxin_-_-_TEXT.html,". Calcein AM staining assay gave inconclusive results as medium concentrations of tha killing agent didn't result in cell viability decrease (Figure 11, A). On the other hand, the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluouracil could be reliably monitored via the decrease of citrine fluorescence after the removal of detached non-viable cells (Figure 11, B).
Figure 11. Tecan measurements for viability assessment of HeLa CCL-2 and HeLa  CCL-2 lc cells. (A) Detection of fluorescence stemming from calcein staining of viable cells. The results are inconclusive as there is cytotoxic effect detected when high and low amounts of the killing agent are applied to HeLa CCL-2 cells, but medium cocncentrations of the killing agent doesn't seem to affect the viability of the cells. (B) Detection of citrine fluorescence from HeLa CCL-2 lc cells (constitutive production of citrine). In this case the decrease in fluorescence correlates with the increase of the apoptotic agent used for the experiment.
CONCLUSION
The spectrophotometer results couldn't conviencingly prove the expected killing effect of 5-fluouracil on the HeLa CCL-2 cell line. On the other hand, the loss of citrine fluorescence from HeLa CCL-2 lc cell samples due to the removal of the dead cell fraction proved to be a good measure of cell viability. For this reason, we decided to use the HeLa CCL-2 lc cell line in further experiments to assess the cytotoxic effect of our azurin-rich bacterial lysates. However, the Calcein AM assay was still used for qualitative viability assessment of other cancer-cell lines that lack the constitutive citrine expression, via fluorescence microscopy.
Assessing the bacterial lysate tolerance of different cancer-cell lines
OBJECTIVE
With this experiment we wanted to assess the tolerance of the HeLa CCL-2 lc cell line upon incubation with different amount of azurin-free bacterial lysate. The information acquired from this expreriment helped us to define the amount of medium that we can substitute by our bacterial lysate without harming the cells neither because of the native E. coli proteins present in the lysate nor because of nutrient depravation. Additionally, a p53 negative cancer cell line, namely HT-29,  was also qualitatively assessed for its tolerance towards azurin-free bacterial via calcein AM assay.
PROCEDURE
For the two different cell lines, namely,  HeLa CCL-2 lc"

Individual E.coli with 0 to 200 plasmids are considered, and after the simulation for 3600 seconds, we count the total amount of nutrients utilized by each kind of E.coli, which reveals the total amount of target protein produced. Then the gene (taken by each plasmid) expression level within each group of E.coli can be calculate, and its change are drawn into the curve below.
Ribosome fall-off rate
But one thing left to be mentioned is that, the express possibility of target gene can differ from the gene in charge of promoting cell growth (i.e. glucose dehydrogenase). Since the target gene can be successfully expressed as long as the promoter combines with the ribosome, while the subsequent TGATG sequence allows for a ratio of  fall-off , therefore results in a decrease in the expression level of glucose dehydrogenase.
The possibility of fall-off is relevant to the length of target gene, which situated before the TGATG sequence, while the gene of growth-promoting part is relatively fixed, which follows the TGATG sequence, and our task is trying to figure out, the change of fall-off rate with respect to the length of target gene.
The intensity of ribosome-sequence combination can be measured as their binding energy through translation, which we assume to be proportional as the length of target gene. Referring to [], the fraction of time that a ribosome elongates the translation process and remains in combination with subsequent sequence. $F = \frac{1}{1+C \exp(G_bind)}$, $C$ a parameter representing the ribosome-assisted unfolding coefficient, while $G_bind$ is the binding energy between given target gene and the ribosome. The curve describing the remaining rate of ribosome, with respect to the length of target gene, is shown.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," transit. The nerve carries efferent neuronal signals, from the central nervous system to the peripheral nervous system, which regulates and control the body's natural functions through muscle recruitment. But nerves also carry information from natural sensors (mechanoreceptors, proprioceptive, etc.) and transiting to the central nervous system by activation of the afferent nerve fibers. Generally, muscle recruitment and sensory fiber activation are not coded in the same way.
In the case of motor or efferent fibers, the number of active motor units, as well as their discharge frequencies, vary at the same time as the force produced by the muscle[10].
We presented the calculation of the spatial action potential at the surface of the nerve. Based on these results, we exposed the construction of a nerve model for which the fascicles are generated randomly. This model allows us to represent a fascicular activity on the surface of the nerve. We show that the high spatial frequency component can be present at the surface of the nerve, but only for fascicles close to the point of measurement.
Finally, we have shown that the amplitude of this component is of the order of ten microvolts.
All the information presented can be used to realize an extraneural electrode having the desired performances.

Hydroxylation
In order to make the Mfp-5 on the outer membrane of the E. coli cells sticky, an hydroxyl group has to be added to the tyrosinases present in Mfp-5. For this we use the enzyme melA, which conversts tyrosine to L-DOPA. For this, we use Biobricks made by the iGEM team of Tokyo Tech 2009 (BBa_K193601 and BBa_K193602).  To be able to analyse the tyrosinase activity of MelA, we needed to have purified MelA.  For this, we decided to add a His-tag to the MelA protein by the use of PCR. The PCR reaction was  followed by digestion and ligation to put the sequence of MelA-His back into a BioBrick backbone.  Since we strive towards a final system in which no additional compounds are needed for adhesiveness., tyrosinase production should also be done by the Mfp-5 producing cells. An initial approach would be introducing both genes, as well Mfp-5 production as MelA production, in one or two separate plasmids. This will probably cause inclusion bodies due to internal activation of the adhesiveness. To prevent this, tyrosinase may be transported to the periplasm using the same Sec-transporter as described earlier. Although it would likely be degraded rapidly by the largely present proteases, activation may still occur. Proper integration of this mechanism is definitely a promising achievement for future research.

Discussion of results
Despite relatively poor performance in E.coli TOP10, our pigment-producing devices gave encouraging results in E.coli MG1655. Simply by overnight incubation, the colonies were able to show visible colour changes. Since the precursors were already present in normal E.coli, no additional growth medium or special treatment was needed. This paves the way to developing a signalling system that is quick to produce visual outputs.
The acetone extraction of carotenoid provides a low-cost method for quantitative measurement. In the above experiments, the results of photo-spectrometry were consistent with characteristic absorbance wavelengths of lycopene (around 475nm) and β-carotene (around 450nm), as noted in literature. In the case of β-carotene, the absorbance profile of our β-carotene-producing device (K274210) matched that of pure carotene standards, confirming that our device was functional in the cells.
When we overlay the graphs of our two devices (constitutive), we obtained the following result:
red: K274110/lycopene; orange: K274210/β-carotene; black: pure β-carotene; blue: untransformed E.coli MG1655 (negative control).
Lycopene and β-carotene showed characteristic absorbance profiles, with different maximum absorbance wavelengths. It was tempted to think that by converting lycopene to β-carotene (e.g. by expressing CrtY gene), we would be able to see a “shift” in the peaks of maximum absorbance. However, in the bar charts above it was noted that lycopene and β-carotene had significant absorbance at both 456nm and 474nm, albeit with different ratios (i.e. lycopene absorbed more at 474nm; β-carotene absorbed more at 456nm). Therefore, measurement at a single wavelength was insufficient to determine the identity"

Introduction
The iGEM competition is a lot more than just wet lab and modelling. With the rapid development in synthetic biology, the need for creating awareness on how it could potentially affect the society and environment is great. Human practices entails considering all the different aspects that is influenced by the new technology. These can include ethical, social, legal, and economical issues as well as concerns regarding biosafety.
In our project, we aimed to spread information about the applications of synthetic biology and its potential in helping solve some of the problems in the world. We did this by having lectures both at our own university for students and at Lund’s University for the public. We wanted to reach out and get people interested in the field and inspire to think outside the box by solving problems using applications no one thought imaginable, for example using baker's yeast for detection of lung cancer.
To further reach out and integrate human practices in the project, we developed a screening program for lung cancer, which involved working with the different criterias for screening programs, including biosafety, carry out discussions with scientists and physicians within the field, designing and producing a prototype and creating and spreading a survey concerning the public’s view on a potential screening program for lung cancer.
Outreach
An important part of every iGEM project is to spread information about synthetic biology and its applications to the public. It is also important to reach out to the public and tell them about your own project and answer the questions that they might have and establish a dialogue. To do this we did some outreach to the university and the public through different channels and in different ways.
University outreach
We wanted to make our whole university aware of the cool project that we were working on and therefore decided to spread information about iGEM and our BREATHtaking biosensor. We did this in two ways; by having a lunch lecture and and also making a mini series about the project in cooperation with Chalmers University of Technology.
The lunch lecture was about iGEM and our project and was conducted for Chalmers students, primarily biotechnology students. We answered"

Outreach and Education
How did we approach Outreach and Education?
The outreach events below were based on our science communication framework. We recognized that discussion of socio-ethics, as well as looking at the potential of patterning applications, maintained audience interest in and approval of our project.
Communications Strategy Guide
Following the Communications Strategy Guide (CSG), and in particular, the Science Communication Framework, we targeted 3 main audience types for our outreach efforts. These audiences include academic staff and students at Imperial, members of the public with no relation to synthetic biology and children/teenagers. Each outreach effort was optimized for its target audience and effort was taken to optimize for circumstances around the outreach effort. Lastly for most of our outreach efforts, feedback given was in either written or verbal form. More information on the CSG can be found here.
Public Opinion Survey
We also wanted to gauge whether the public would approve of widespread applications for our project in the future. Surveys that were done to better characterize public opinion of our technology and synthetic biology in general showed no statistically significant correlation between knowledge of synthetic biology and support of its use. We therefore adapted our outreach to focus on bioethics and better show the potential beneficial effects of implementing our technology. With these conclusions in mind, we decided to host a socio-ethics discussion to better address the ethics of controlling life, as well as an art exhibition that would better visualize these potential beneficial effects. More information about our surveys can be found down below.
Survey Data Analysis
Our survey tested whether people that are more knowledgeable about the science behind biotechnology are generally more positive towards GMOs. We included 66 participants in our survey. Our survey was conducted at multiple different locations in central London, including the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum and Exhibition Road in South Kensington.  Our survey was divided into two parts:  in the first, we asked scientific questions on the area of biotechnology, in the second part we asked whether the participants are in favour or"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread fish disease in China.
After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.
Watch our VIDEO!
Communication activities
Introduction video to GFP protein and awards
This August, Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology etc organization held a “3 minutes for science” activity, aiming to collect videos which introduce scientific phenomenon to the public. Our team members made a video to introduce GFP protein and relative knowledge, won the special award and had our video broadcast in the Scientific Carnival in Beijing Olympic Parks.
Our own We Chat official account
Since WeChat has been widely used in China, we decided to create our own official account to get more people know us and iGEM competition. In the past two months, we have shared introduction of iGEM competition and some details of our team's project. To sum up, we received 7731 clicks and more than 3783 persons read our passages.

Experiments with BBa_K381001
From these data we could conclude that:
• The BB grows best in LB.
• It grows less in Minimal Media.
• It shows almost no growth in Saline Solution.
• Il grows best @37°C
• It grows good @23°C
• It shows almost no growth @8°C
Experiments with BBa_K410000
From these data we could conclude that:
• The BB grows best in LB.
• It grows well in Minimal Media.
• It shows almost no growth in Saline Solution.
• Il grows best @37°C
• It grows well @23°C (best in Minimal Media than LB)
• It shows almost no growth @8°C
Experiments with BBa_K672000
From these data we could conclude that:
• The BB grows best in LB.
• It shows almost no growth in Minimal Media.
• It shows almost no growth in Saline Solution.
• Il grows best @37°C
• It shows almost no growth @23°C, just in LB.
• It shows almost no growth @8°C
We also studied the behavior of BBa_K381001 @23°C and @37°C in LB and Minimal Media; we detected the GFP expression using the spectophotometer, the graphs are shown below.

Discussion of Results
As we expected, our Renbo grew well at 37°C, grew regular under cold shock stress in LB (23°C) and did not grow at 8°C.
The BBa_381001 grew well alone at 23°C, better than the BBa_410000 and our device (expected to work better).
Looking at the results for BBa_410000, it decreases the capability of BBa_381001, under a cold shock.
From these results we could determine sources of errors during the experiments and learn from these for our further investigations.
The next step in our project:
Continuing with our original design, we are are planning to use another promoter as the Csp"

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Project#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html,".
The J-alpha helix is clearly identifiable in the front bottom. The part suitable for photocaging (that is the part downstream of the I539 is colorised in red. The flavin mononucleotide chromophore is shown in green.
As LOV2 is the second Light-Oxygen-Voltage domain from the Avena sativa phototropin 1 (Figure 1). In its host organism, the common oat, phototropin 1 is a blue-light receptor involved in the response of growth to environmental light conditions and may be responsible for the opening of stomata and the movement of chloroplasts [5] . LOV2 mainly consists of a flavin mononucleotide (FNM) -binding core containing a FNM as chromophore, as well as a helical structure on the C-terminus, the J-alpha helix. Upon excitation with light, a cysteine within the core covalently binds the activated FMN, which induces a conformational change resulting in the protrusion of the formerly concealed J-alpha helix [6] .
This light dependent change in conformation can be used to control cellular processes via light induction, a method for which two strategies exist: It has been shown, that proteins or protein domains which are fused C-terminally to the LOV2 are not able to bind to possible interaction partner due to sterical hindrance. Only after the conformational change initiated by illumination the J alpha helix is exposed, and so is the attached protein domain and its catalytic core. [7] . Instead of being fused to the very end, small amino acid sequences can be introduced and therefore hidden within the J alpha helix. Usually, this offers a better light-state to dark-state (signal to noise) ratio. This approach, also termed photocaging, has already been used to control degradation or nuclear accumulation of proteins [8] [9] .
As in LOV photocaging inhibition is not achieved by merely blocking an active centre but by completely hiding the whole binding partner we assessed the latter strategy as the most promising. Because of the C-terminal location of the J-alpha helix, the place that photocaging takes place in, an intein that is hidden within the LOV domain and splices off a fused protein without creating a significant scar needs to be a C-intein. It has been suggested that the length of the caged peptide itself determines the success of the photo caging [10] . Thus, we extensively screened the literature and discovered a set of only six amino acids long C–inte"

DNA
Before the text can be integrated into a bacterium, it needs to     be translated to DNA. Computers store letters, digits and other     characters as numbers. The numbers are translated to the symbols     you see via an encoding table. The most common encodings are ASCII     and Unicode. The cipher text from the example is encoded as     follows: 138 000 014 209 084 121 251 087 225 251 126     128 122 072 080 007 075 250 227. We use Unicode Transform     Format 8, which means that every character is encoded by 1 up to 6     bytes of 8 bits each. In binary, the bytes of the cipher text look     like this: 10001010 00000000 00001110 11010001     01010100 01111001 11111011 01010111 11100001 11111011 01111110     10000000 01111010 01001000 01010000 00000111 01001011 11111010     11100011. Binary has only two digits, 0 and 1, but DNA has     four 'digits': ACTG. This means those bytes that need eight bits,     need only 4 DNA base-pairs. The translation to DNA is done like     this:
Lets take the letter 'm' as an example.
The ASCII/Unicode code is 109.
In binary it is 01101101.
Cut off the right-most, the least significant, 2 bits: 01.
Look up the base: 00 = A, 01 = C, 10 = T, 11 = G: C.
Append the base to the output: C.
The input number is now: 011011.
Repeat steps 3 - 6 until there are no more bits left.
The result is: CGTC.
When we apply the above algorithm to all the characters in the     cipher text, we get: TAAG TTAT AAAA TGAA GAAG CACT     ACCC CTGC GAAG GTGT GCCC GAAG CATT GAAG GTGT TGGC TAAG AAAT TTGC     ATAC AACC GCAA GTAC GAAG TTGT GAAG GATT. This, however, is     not enough DNA to be able to decode it after extracting it from a     bacterium. The next section explains more about the meta-data that     goes"

PUF Tether Design
Fig. 1.[1] An example of a conclusive experiment which would prove that spatial control of enzymes is possible is depicted above. With addition of split fluorescent parts to each separate RNA binding protein observed fluorescence with expression of the scaffold is expected. This result would prove spatial control of enzymes is possible and a desired effect, such as an enzyme conveyer belt, is achievable.
Fig. 2.[1] Fluorescence microscopy would show that activity of the fluorescent protein only occurs with addition of the RNA scaffold. The scaffold brings the split-fluorescent parts to close proximity resulting in a drastic effect such as an almost 100 fold in fluorescence.
Fig. 3. In order to tether split-fluorescent proteins to PUF, primer extension was used with BioBricks from the Parts Registry. Specifically, parts BBa_K157005 (Split-Cerulean-CFP) and BBa_K157006 (Split-Cerulean-nCFP) were worked with after the 2010 Slovenia iGEM team showed conclusive results testing them. Linker sequences used in literature which bound PUF to endonucleases were included in the primer sequences to create the most optimal construct [2]. Primes on the outside of the gene parts included restriction enzymes compatible with standard assembly methods for future biobricking work.

Collaborations with other iGEM teams
Alongside with our approaches in biology and engineering, we aimed to socialize with other teams. We gladly collaborated with several other teams throughout our whole project. As first iGEM team of the RWTH Aachen University we have plenty of things to learn, but we have to offer a lot, too.
Aachen iGEM MeetUp 2014
On September 13th and 14th all German teams were invited to attend the Aachen iGEM Meetup 2014 to share knowledge, fun and some drinks.
iGEM Meets CASLMU - Munich meetup
Early into the competition we were invited to the meetup of German iGEM teams in Munich. Arne, Markus and Michael attended the event and had a great time meeting the other iGEMers. Meeting the other teams and talking about each others problems, was also a factor in starting some of our own collaboration projects.

.... Unfortunately, we didn't have much time to work on this project for the end of the Wiki, and even for the Jamboree, we don't have much time to finalize even the main project, so we were forced to put this idea away for the moment, but as we ask a lot to other team we will particularly thanks the TUDelf team to his support and its motivation to answer, and propose some new functions, and to the Valencia Team also.

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - £16000 for stage 1 and £17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be £8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be £19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.

Detector Cell SBML Model
The deterministic SBML model for the detector cell was tested separately from the other two cell types in COPASI. Figure 1 shows the model schematic. When IPTG is absent, LacI is produced constitutively and inhibits the pLac promoter. This prevents LasI from being made, which means that the C12 quorum sensing molecule can not be synthesised. When IPTG is present, it can bind to the LacI and stop the pLac promoter from being repressed. This allows the production of LasI, and hence the synthesis of C12.
Figure 1: Schematic for the detector cell model. Crossed circle represents a degradation reaction. A blunt-ended line represents repression.
Figures 2 and 3 below show simulations by COPASI of the detector cell with and without IPTG present. As was expected, when IPTG is not present, C12 has a low value, and when IPTG is present C12 has a high value.
Figure 2: Detector cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of C12 quorum sensing molecule over time in the presence of IPTG.
Figure 3: Detector cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of C12 quorum sensing molecule over time in the absence of IPTG.
Processor Cell SBML Model
The deterministic SBML model for the processor cell was tested separately from the other two cell types in COPASI. Figure 4 shows the model schematic. LasR is produced constitutively. When the C12 quorum sensing molecule is absent, LasR is unable to activate expression from the pLas promoter, resulting in no production of RhlI and no synthesis of the C4 quorum sensing molecule. When C12 is present, it binds to LasR, allowing expression from pLas, production of RhlI, and synthesis of C4.
Figure 4: Schematic for the processor cell model. Crossed circle represents a degradation reaction.
Figures 5 and 6 below show simulations by COPASI of the processor cell with and without the C12 quorum sensing molecule present. As was expected, when C12 is not present, C4 has a low value, and when C12 is present C4 has a high value.

Informing Design
We consulted numerous experts in various fields to ensure that the design of the AuxIn system respects all relevant social, ethical and legal issues.  One module of our system, Gene Guard , is a direct result of brainstorming around the issues involved in the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although we have only reached the proof of concept stage, we have put a lot of thought into how AuxIn may be implemented as a product and the legal issues that would be involved.

Implementation
GM Release
There are many different biological aspects that need to be taken into account when deliberating release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. A big issue associated with this is containment of genetic information and preventing its spread to other organisms. To prevent spread of our auxin-producing plasmid in the environment, we have devised Gene Guard, a containment device that will actively prevent horizontal gene transfer. In addition, we have chosen Escherichia coli as our chassis to prevent spread to adjacent ecosystems.
Gene Guard design
1. Goal Bacteria frequently pass on genetic information through horizontal gene transfer. This can happen in a variety of ways, including transfer or a mobile plasmid into another bacterium (1). As a result, a significant portion of bacterial genomes (12.8% of Escherichia coli genomes) consists of foreign DNA (2). If the DNA we engineered into our bacteria were to be transferred to plant pathogenic bacteria, it may give them a competitive advantage. This could have detrimental consequences and negatively affect plants and the ecosystem. Therefore, we want to prevent spreading of the genetic information we have engineered into our chassis.
2. Action Early on in the project, we recognised that containment of genetic information is an issue that has to be taken very seriously. We discussed many different ways in which we could ensure that the DNA we engineer into our bacteria does not spread to other microorganisms or adjacent ecosystems."

""ω-3"" Weekly Summary
Squad Omega managed to create its very first preliminary BioBrickTM! We successfully inserted the L. Major D6 elongase into a pET-15a vector, and have sent it off to be sequenced over the weekend.  At the moment, we are working on creating an assay to monitor this gene’s function. In order to do this, we have grown three different types of protein expression E. coli: BL 21 BL 21 codon stop, BL 21 plyS. After growing them, we will be analysing their natural 18-1 lipid content, in order to create a “background”. Once we have inserted our foreign proteins into our expression vectors, we will be able to compare the types of lipids synthesised.
We have also started working on another gene of our sequence, D15 desaturase from T. cruzi. Originally, we had planned to use this gene from the organisms Synechocystis; but as the genomic DNA is not due to arrive for several weeks, we have found a suitable, more accessible alternative. At the moment, we are running a PCR after designing primers to isolate the gene-of-choice.

Week 5
""Metal Binding Protein"" Weekly Summary
This week we were able to see through our protein gel, loading it using what is here known as the ‘Excalibur method’ and letting it run, before staining it with coomasie over night and destaining it in the morning. The gel showed our GST protein band at 26 KDa, but without any over expression in comparison to the other cellular proteins.  We had grown up the successful colonies from the colony PCRs done the previous week and minipreped them. Some of this miniprep was sent to GATC in Germany for sequencing and some was used to transform the plasmids with the insert in them into BL21 cells in order to over express them. This however was unsuccessful and investigation proved that our cells had not been lysing properly and releasing their plasmids during our minipreps. Some alteration in procedure and a further DNA gel showed provided a small amount of DNA, some of which was used for transformation into DH5. Over the weekend we got colonies for the Ni, Pd and Pt and grew them up for expression on Monday.  Somewhere along the way a second set of primers to make"

These pathways were constructed from the codon-optimized genes of Enterococcus faecalis, Methanosarcina mazei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli, with one designed for optimum flux and the other providing extensibility for synthesis of other terpenes. Finally, the codon-optimized ocimene synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana would be assembled in an additional plasmid to catalyze the final step of ocimene synthesis. The mevalonate pathways would be compared, while in-vitro testing of ocimene synthase could be conducted after purifying with GST-tagging. Both ocimene itself and E. coli with our pathway would be tested by the Crow Lab at Georgia State University for inhibition of P. destructans.
Unfortunately, we were unable to assemble these plasmids for submission to the parts registry. The mevalonate pathways were designed for Gibson assembly and ordered as several Integrated DNA Technologies gblocks, but we were unable to obtain the assembled product in a backbone. We suspect this is a result of either overlaps too long for the exonuclease to process, secondary structure in overlap regions, or an issue with our method of linearizing the backbone. Our issue was exacerbated when no PCR primers were ordered for the amplification of individual gblocks, and stocks eventually ran out. Additionally, the single ocimene synthase gblock was designed for direct RFC[10] digestion and ligation, with flanking VF2 and VR sites for amplification using existing primers. After discovering the reverse complement of the VR site had instead been designed and ordering the corresponding primer, the gblock still failed to amplify under a variety of conditions.
We also investigated potential methods to prevent the fungus from damaging the bats' skin without direct elimination. Analysis of the P. destructans secretome found a serine endopeptidase, destructin-1, responsible for much of the fungus' ability to degrade collagen in bats’ skin. Its inhibition resulted in a 77% reduction in collagen degradation at 54h/20°C, and it is believed to create ends for exopeptidases to act on. Unfortunately, the biosynthesis of most protease inhibitors remains a mystery, but a recent preprint purports to have found a gene cluster in Streptomyces roseus responsible for the synthesis of leupeptin, commonly used in protease inhibitor cocktails (and expensive). Named leupA-D, we believe that le"

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," construct encoding the tyrosinase enzyme, which would be able to hydroxylate tyrosine residues in vivo. We also ordered mushroom tyrosinase which has been shown to be able to hydroxylate tyrosine in vitro post-purification [8].
Once all five constructs were ordered, we ligated the linear DNA constructs to the PSB1C3 iGEM backbone using Gibson Assembly Mastermix 2x, transformed NEB T7 competent E.coli with our new plasmids, and plated the colonies on chloramphenicol selective LB plates. The colonies were incubated at 37 ℃ overnight or until there were distinct, visible colonies and never longer than 72 hours. The existence of our DNA constructs in the colonies were confirmed using verification primers in a colony PCR. We then performed his-tag purification on crude cell extracts from our colonies using Thermo Scientific HisPur Ni-NTA spin columns. Following protein purification with the Thermo Scientific HisPur Ni-NTA spin columns, we confirmed the presence of our protein in the final elution using Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Lumio Tag Protein Detection Kit. We then performed a standard BCA Assay to determine our total protein concentration in each elution.
To test quantitatively  the strength of each purified glue candidate we performed a lap-shear test using the Instron 5565 in the Stanford Soft & Hybrid Materials Facility. To do this, we grew G. lucidum mycelium on sawdust into the specified dimensions of the ASTM D3163 rectangle, which is used as a standard for lap-shear adhesive tests [9]. We also cut cardboard into these dimensions to use as a rough control that would help us assess whether or not our glue candidates were truly specific to mycelium material. Before applying our various glue candidates to the mycelium and cardboard specimens, we incubated the purified protein solutions at their isoelectric points at 4 ℃ for 2 days, spun them down, and discarded the supernatant. This was done to allow aggregate forming proteins (csgA, csga-CBD) to form amyloid fibers and for all the proteins (CBD4x, fp151) to reach their optimum functional pH [6].
Mycelium-based Biofiltration

Wells 1-4 were from old colonies while 5-12 were colonies of the new ligation of the same construct. With the new buffer everything seemed to work well and the bands are at the correct sizes for this particular construct.
Week 10: 8/6-8/12
Since there was success with restriction mapping, I wanted to double check that the construct of which a glycerol stock was made, was correct. Also the insert of the pbad_YFPc plasmid was not checked just the whole size of the plasmid was checked. Therefore, a gel was once again run for all these samples as verification.
This is a figure of a gel with multiple cut construct samples.

Because this sample of construct seemed to check out according to restriction mapping, I decided to streak out BBa_I14033_BBa_E0430 from the glycerol stock. The streaked plate was also put under UV light to see if the colonies would glow yellow. They seemed to glow slightly stronger than the original plate of the first ligation; however, it was not as bright as the construct of YFPc with ptet. To verify once again if the streaked plate worked correctly, restriction digest reaction was also set up on the plasmids of the colonies from the streaked plate. The results on the gel seem pretty clear.

4. pH Monitoring (LB Growth)- Cultures of our clones were grown anaerobically in 5ml of luria broth, along with standard DH5α cells, used as control. These were then subcultured into 50 ml cultures, also grown anaerobically, with different concentrations of Sodium Nitrite. After 16 hours of growth, the cultures were taken out and the pH of the solution was taken for all different concentrations of Nitrite. The experiment showed results as expected, with the pH of our clones being higher than the control, which can be attributed to the presence of excess ammonia in the solution. We also saw that at concentrations of Nitrite greater than 2mM, the pH showed a sharp decline. This could be due to the fact that high concentrations of nitrite (NO¬2-) become toxic for the cells, due to which cell death occurs.
5. Indophenol test (LB Growth)- Cultures of our clones were grown anaerobically in 5ml in luria broth, along with standard DH5α cells, used as control. These were then subcultured into 50 ml cultures, also grown anaerobically, with different concentrations of Sodium Nitrite. To a 1ml aliquot, 40 microlitre phenol, 40 micolitre sodium nitroprusside and 100 ul of oxidising reagent (tri- sodium citrate + sodium hypochlorite) was added, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm. These OD values were plotted against DH5α culture, used as control for the experiments.
a. Monitoring with time- For a concentration of 1mM Nitrite, multiple cultures were inoculated. After regular intervals of time, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD540 values were noted. This experiment was successful, as it showed an increase of OD values with increase in time, before finally saturating. The OD values were more than that of DH5α cultures throughout, pointing to the fact that more ammonia was being formed in our clone cultures.
b. Monitoring with different nitrite concentrations- 50 ml Cultures were inoculated with different concentrations of Sodium nitrite. After 16 hours of growth, the indophenol test was carried out, and OD Values were taken. This experiment was also successful, with OD values showing a trend similar to the one above.

Dr. Hayden’s journey with working with infectious diseases began in 2009 when a patient with CRE tragically passed away at Rush University while she was on call. Though CRE and MRSA were not prevalent yet, some of the first cases to be seen were in Chicago. Through her work in the field, she realized that these diseases were remaining undiagnosed in many health facilities. She also realized that the control of antibiotics were being conducted ""selfishly” and  facilities would set up protocols to protect their own facilities. One of the main programs at the Epicenter is to aid surrounding facilities in developing protocols that will protect them all from the wide spread of antibiotic resistance.
Dr. Hayden emphasized how there are many different methods to protect the population from antibiotic resistant bacteria diseases that stem from them. From good hygiene practices, to using gene sequencing to track the origins of resistant microorganisms, to antibiotic stewardship, she provided many examples of ways to make a difference.
Dr. Hayden stressed that innovation is the way to go if we are planning on finding a replacement or something to go in conjunction with antibiotics. She mentioned that our research seemed promising but reducing overuse would also be vital.
Takeaway: Dr. Hayden really ingrained in us the idea that there are many ways to battle this problem. Dr. Hayden pressed that a novel intervention is needed and commented that we are heading in the right direction."

This adjustment compromises the accuracy of measurement in highly light scattering solutions, such as dense cultures of cells. We don't have the                       pathlength correction on our instrument.                       The correction factor to convert measured Abs600 to OD600 is thus the Reference OD600 divided by Abs600. All cell density readings using this instrument with the same settings and volume can be converted to OD600.
Protocol:
Add 100 μl LUDOX into wells A1, B1, C1, D1
Add 100 μl of dd H2 O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2
Measure absorbance at 600 nm of all samples with the same measurement mode
Particle standard curve - Microsphere protocol
We will prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the Abs600 in our plate reader. The size and optical characteristics of these microspheres are similar to cells, and there is a known amount of                       particles per volume. This measurement will allow us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
Protocol:
Prepare the Microsphere Stock Solution:
Obtain the tube labeled ""Silica Beads"" from the InterLab test kit and vortex vigorously for 30 seconds. (Note: Microspheres should NOT be stored at 0°C or below, as freezing affects the properties of                           the                           microspheres).
Immediately pipet 96 μL microspheres into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube
Add 904 μL of ddH2 O to the microspheres
Vortex well. This is the Microsphere Stock Solution.
Prepare the serial dilution of Microspheres:
Accurate pipetting is essential. Serial dilutions will be performed across columns 1-11. Column 12 must contain ddH2O only.
Initially we will setup the plate with the microsphere stock solution in column 1 and an equal volume of 1 x ddH2O in columns 2 to 12. We will perform a serial dilution by consecutively transferring 100 μl from column to column                       with                       good mixing.
Add 100 μl of ddH2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12
Vortex the tube containing the stock solution of microspheres vigorously for 10 seconds
Immediately add 200 μl of microspheres stock solution into A1

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Europe Jamboree_-_-_TEXT.html,"After an intense night of preparing for the presentation, we arrived bright and early to set up our poster and deliver our presentation. Chris and Nikki did a great job and, relieved to have put the stress of presenting behind us, we were able to enjoy many other teams' great presentations. Our only regret was not being able to attend more talks. If only there hadn't been parallel sessions!
The poster session was intense with many a team member complaining of back pains and fatigue, but also very interesting because we got a chance to look at many cool posters of other teams and enjoy the creative projects that some had come up with.
One of the highlights of our day had to be showing off our jumpsuits, though. We had spent days running around East London to chase up these babies and had painstakingly hand-painted them with the help of our wonderful RCA advisor Charlotte and now was the time to present them to the world.
Post-Jamboree
On the morning of the last day all of the teams assembled in the main hall to find out how they fared in the results of the competition. We were anxious and excited and filled with joy when our team showed up as one of the finalists, along with South African team CSIR-WITS and French team Paris Bettencourt. Nikki and Chris delivered the presentation for the second time, much more relaxed after having the first run over with.

We were all very proud of our results and agreed that the hard work paid off, and we left the Jamboree with Best Wiki, Best Safety Practice, and the first place winners of the 2011 European Jamboree!
Lunch provided a great opportunity to mingle with other teams and get excited about going to Boston! We met a lot of really lovely people who we are looking forward to seeing again soon. Meeting so many people from so many different countries really highlighted what iGEM is all about: interchanging ideas with like-minded people from all over the world and learning from their cool ideas and awesome projects.
With less than two hours until our flight, we rushed off to the airport and quickly bid good-bye to the lucky few who were able to stay behind for a few days' holiday. It felt sad to have to leave so quickly and we wish we could have seen more of Amsterdam. All in all, it was a good experience and we cannot wait to go to Boston.
