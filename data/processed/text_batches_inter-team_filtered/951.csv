C’est le cas notamment de l’étude menée par Chunlin Yang en 1995 qui a travaillé, tout comme nous, sur des cellules cancéreuses prostatiques p53 mutées (Tsu-pr1). La transfection de p53 wild type n’a pas été réalisée par électroporation mais en infectant les cellules tumorales avec des adénovirus non réplicatifs contenant p53wt (AdCMV.p53). Quarante-huit heures après avoir infecté une population tumorale avec AdCMV.p53, une forte expression de p53 est corrélée avec un taux important de mort cellulaire. Si les populations témoins (cellules non-infectées et cellules infectées avec des adénovirus contenant le gène LacZ, AdCMV.NLSßgal) montrent une morphologie tout à fait similaire et saine, une condensation et un détachement cellulaire sont observés chez la population p53 infectée. Afin de vérifier si le processus de mort suivi par ces cellules correspond bien à la voie apoptotique, une migration sur gel d’agarose de leur génome a été réalisée.
Figure 2 : électrophorèse sur gel d’agarose d’ADN isolé de cellules non-infectées (a), infectées par AdCMV.NLSßgal (b) et AdCMV.p53 (c).
Les cellules infectées par AdCMV.p53 montrent une multitude de bandes (laddering pattern) tandis que les cellules non-infectées ou infectées par AdCMV.NLSßgal n’en montrent qu’une seul et unique de haut poids moléculaire. Ces résultats indiquent que la mort cellulaire induite par p53 wild type est d’origine apoptotique avec l’observation de la fragmentation du génome, conséquence de l’activité de la CAD (Caspase Activated DNase), une endonucléase spécifique au processus d’apoptose.

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Background_-_-_TEXT.html,". These enzymes are tagged with their related peptide ligands. This increases the effective concentrations of metabolic intermediates, while preventing their accumulation to toxic levels. This strategy was inspired by natural biosynthetic machines (e.g., polyketide synthases, fatty acid synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases) that produce small molecules by channeling intermediates iteratively through assembly lines of catalytic activities. Although an artificially created system is much simpler than these elegant natural systems, the modular design of the scaffold strategy should prove to be both programmable and generalizable.
By encapsulating the pathway components within protein shells a more direct way of compartmentalizing would be achieved. Here, the pathway enzymes get physically encapsulated into distinct compartments, thereby limiting cross-talk between engineered pathways and the cellular milieu. The most critical step of reaching an ideal compartmentalizing is the evolution of pores in the protein shells, which specifically limit the diffusion of the intermediate.
A further possibility to reach metabolic channeling is the use of plasmid scaffolds. The 2010 Slovenian iGEM team constructed a plasmid scaffold on which the violacein biosynthetic enzymes (VioA-E) were co-assembled and tethered to zinc finger DNA binding domains. The amount of deoxychromoviridans, the products of the unwanted side reaction, was significantly reduced, while there was an approximately six-fold increase of the yield of the violacein biosynthesis. An advantage of plasmid scaffolds is that they accommodate many interaction motifs and variable length linkers without solubility issues. The disadvantage of this method however is that to be able to achieve this, the enzymes must be significantly modified with multiple zincfinger domains (usually 3–4 domains with a total addition of 90-120 amino acids). A problem is, that the maximal concentration of DNA scaffolds in cell is limited by the maximal plasmid copy number (roughly 500 per cell).
By incorporating a transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-based scaffold system into an Escherichia coli chassis, it is also possible to accelerate a heterologous metabolic system. The TALEs bind to an artificial DNA scaffold. The validation of the effects of such systems was done by the heterologous production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) after the integration of TALE-fused IAA biosynthetic enzymes in E. coli. Compared to zinc finger domains, this shows to be a simpler design with a higher specificity and lower toxicity. To form in vivo clusters of multi-enzymes the TALEN"

Further Study
Due to limitations resulting from the lack of previous synthetic biology application within plants, we were unable to obtain any results. We have successfully isolated the desired parts needed for assembly of the plasmid and have the backbone with the 35s promoter left border and Nos terminator right border.  Successful construct assembly of these parts is still needed for bacterial and plant transformation. Following promising transformation, fluorescence testing and characterization must be done.

The basal rate was consistent across the constructs, with the exception of BBa_I747381. A closer look at the data shows that the larger response only happened on one of the three cultures, so can be assumed anomolous.
The hill coefficients are largely within an accepted range, suggesting that 2 or 3 molecules of the activator are necessary to engage the promoter. In some cases, however, the resolution of concentrations was too small to achieve a sensible value for the hill coefficient. Here, the upper limit of the fitting script was reached; the parameter takes the value 4.00.

Initial Characterization of E. coli
Initially, we did two experiments to characterize untransformed E. coli under conditions that would be present during wastewater treatment.
Toxicity of Nitrite, Nitrate and Ammonium to E. coli
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the ions nitrite, nitrate and ammonium are toxic to E. coli, and at what concentration.  We used the BioLector microfermentation system to grow an E. coli strain that constitutively expresses RFP in the presence of these ions (at a range of concentrations), and measured the fluorescence of the cells and light scattering (proportional to optical density) as a proxy for growth.  We found that high concentrations ammonium (≥500mM) and nitrate (≥25mM) were toxic to E. coli.  However, these concentrations are much higher than we would expect to find in wastewater, so we do not expect these ions to be toxic to our cells under normal operating conditions.
Experiment details -- Toxicity of Nitrite, Nitrate and Ammonium to E. coli
Nitrite stability in anaerobic E. coli
To measure how much nitrite would be consumed by competing pathways (such as conversion to ammonia) in Mutant 2, we grew untransformed E. coli anaerobically in the presence of nitrite and measured the amount of ammonia and nitrite present. We found that a pathway to convert nitrite to ammonium was active, and therefore our Nir pathway will need to outcompete this pathway.

Glasgow,2011,Team:Glasgow#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," sculpting.  However, biofilms are also medically significant and can cause problems for human health (Høiby, Ciofu, and Bjarnsholt, 2010). Our first priority therefore was researcher safety.  We also had to deal with the problem of a lack of shuttle vector between E.coli and common biofilm forming lab strains, such as species from the genus Pseudomonas.  For this reason, we have worked with a novel biofilm forming synthetic biology chassis, E.coli Nissle 1917.  We intend to make this available to the Registry to allow future teams who wish to have a safer alternative that is still compatible with existing parts on the registry, to work with biofilms.
In order to sculpt shapes into the biofilm, it is necessary to disperse some of the microorganisms.  We have developed three novel biobricks designed to cause dispersal of the biofilm.  Under control of the light responsive promoters, we can use light to cause targeted dispersal of the biofilm.
Phosphodiesterase, an enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, breaks down the signalling molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP).  This molecule is extremely important in biofilm formation and motility, and so the targeted overexpression of phosphodiesterase is designed to interfere with biofilm formation (Barraud et al., 2009)
We have also created two biobricks of novel surfactant proteins.   These are Latherin and Ranaspumin, which are surfactant proteins with antimicrobial properties.  Both these proteins are studied for their antibiofilm activity (Kennedy, 2011.)
To further enhance biofilm dispersal, we have also used two biobricks from the registry – Colicin E2 (Part BBa_ K131000) and T4 Endolysin (Part BBa_K112806) .  All five of these proteins have been modelled to predict their diffusion through a biofilm.  This allowed us to understand how large an area would be affected by triggering dispersal using our light responsive constructs. This meant we could predict how fine a resolution we could get when sculpting with light.
DIScoli centres on the use of three light responsive promoters – the BLUF domain (Part BBa_K238013) which is activated by blue light, OmpC (Part BBa_R0082) which is activated by green light and OmpF (Part BBa_R0084) which is inhibited by red light.  We"

KK Clarice left for Russia on Sunday, so she'll be gone for perhaps a month working at her internship. At the beginning of class we talked about possible community projects. The first project we may want to do is publish a children's book. The other two projects that received votes were: creating a board game, and sponsoring a fun run to raise money for Haiti. I called my friend Redge Ballard, an animation major, to ask if he would be interested in designing the book. We PCR verified our 10 colonies and only colony A had the CRO insert we were looking for. We set up overnights of colony A to do a plasmid prep and then sequence, and we also set up overnights of our three lambda strains to plate tomorrow as a lawn. Once we do that, we hope to be induce lambda to go lytic by plating our E.Coli with CRO.
5/22/13
Yesterday I came in and did a plasmid prep of colonies A and W, which looked promising for having CRO+pIG12 on our PCR readout. Today we confirmed on the spectrophotometer the concentrations of the plasmids. The plasmid from A was present at a concentration of 158 ng/microL, and that of W had a concentration of 62 ng/microL. Yesterday we also plated our three strains of lambda-infected E.Coli, TT9901, TT9907, and TT23281, so today we were ready to trasform the plasmid into these three plasmids using electrophoration. Dr. Grose showed us how to use the electrophorator. We shocked each strain with plasmid from colony A and then a control plasmid separately, for a total of 6 electrophorations. After letting the cells recover for 30 minutes at 37 degrees celsius, we plated about 1 mL of each on LB/Amp plates. Tomorrow, hopefully, we will see a few colonies indicating that they took up our plasmid! Also, we submitted plasmids from A and W for sequencing.

UNIPV-Pavia,2008,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html,". In this section we preferred to be general and we considered the transcription dynamic because our aim is to provide a mathematical model for future parameter identification. We also decided to neglect AHL synthesis dynamic, considering luxI protein a ""direct"" activator for luxR.
In the following paragraphs, the complete ODE systems and the Simulink block diagrams will be reported.

Demux
Simulations
The written models have been simulated in Matlab and Simulink, in order to perform a preliminary heuristic study of the system behavior and to search for critical parameters. For simulations, we used dimensionless ODEs to avoid numeric errors due to small parameter values, so results are reported in arbitrary units. We defined ODE systems in Simulink (block diagrams showed above) and then solved them using ode15s, a multistep ODE solver for stiff problems.
Parameters have been calibrated considering the values reported in literature and in some other iGEM wiki pages. In some cases values were missing, so we fixed these missing values at 1*10^om, where ""om"" is the (median) order of magnitude of the parameters having the same meaning (e.g. protein degradation rates). In other cases we found different values for the same parameter, so we computed the mean value.
An important feature that will have to be studied is systems' basic activity. In other words, can genetic Mux discriminate the output in response to a low input signal and the output in response to a high input signal? Moreover, does Demux have a non negligible baseline activity that turns on the output channel that should be unactive? One of the parameters that plays a very important role in basic activities is the leakage factor (""a"", that is the probability that a mRNA is transcribed randomly). This parameter depends on the specific promoter. Future estimation of ""a"" for all the promoters will be useful to predict ""false positive"" system outputs. High ""a"" values give high basic activities, while for a->0 transcriptional regulation becomes ""ideal"".
At first, we wrote the ODE models with only one ""a"" parameter, but then we decided to consider different leakage factors for the promoters in the network.
Here we report some simulation examples. The initial states (t=0) have been fixed to 0, but here we are interested into steady state values.

Abstract
The abundance and diversity of our food relies on honeybee pollination. Varroa destructor mites weaken bee colonies through the spread of disease. Our team aims to save bees by killing Varroa using bacteria inside beehives. In continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. The hive-localized bacteria sense Varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. The bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. Additionally, we develop an in vitro test of Varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. The system is modeled in various ways to assess its viability in the real world. This is the first effective method to combine specificity, ease of use, safety through bio-containment, and the iGEM open source character to save the honeybee.

Human Practices
Even though the field of synthetic biology may seem difficult to define and beyond the remit of many people’s day to day lives, it's presence in our homes and workplaces is ever growing.  Many of the foods we buy, medicines we use and services that are offered would not exist without synthetic biology and are very much taken for granted.
This means that without knowledge of a product's origin, production process, proper usage and disposal, some risks are inevitable.
For these reasons, we believe it is vital to make information accessible to people in all walks of life, allowing them to make informed decisions.
We have tried to demonstrate a model for achieving this through integrating education, increased public awareness and of course, igniting curiosity in synthetic biology.
iGEM Stockholm’s human practices project extends far beyond the bench through our innovative iTECH model, integrating the four different components of our Human Practices work: Teaching, Evolving, Community & Health.
TEACHING: Schools Projects
EVOLVING: Makerspace Lab & Workshops
COMMUNITY: Integrating Human Practices & Nordic iGEM Conference
HEALTH: Expert advice and the development of SMITE
The iTECH model framework has allowed us to develop a public dialogue, which engages with different groups of the population about synthetic biology and the journey from the lab towards our product.
Overall this vastly improved the foundations of our research and challenged us to question how and why our project could be successful.
The following are different ways our Human Practices project has impacted our society:
Raising awareness of synthetic biology at all educational levels (spanning ages 9-11, 15-18 and 20+ in different arms of the project)
Providing an educational backdrop for young researchers on a practical and theoretical basis
Encouraging creative thinking in the approach to combating deep seated problems
Introducing innovative new approaches to treating chronic wounds
Promoting consideration of the global impact of human civilisation and how we can use synthetic biology in the future to adapt to a changing world
Predicting the consequences of inaction in relation to antimicrobial resistance on future generations

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA had survived, and some of it had been transferred to bacteria in the gut.
Alex: Yeah that’s true, but they were unable to isolate the precise bacteria that had taken up the DNA because of the small amount that was transferred. Also, when they examined the stools of the volunteers, no evidence of the DNA was found, showing that although it may be capable of surviving the small intestine, it was completely destroyed in the large intestine. The fact that the DNA survived shouldn’t be very unsettling either, unmodified DNA from soya is degraded exactly the same as the DNA from the modified strain.
Dev: Well it’s good to know that if we consume anything that has been genetically modified, it is unlikely that genes that, for example contain antibiotic resistance, are very unlikely to be transferred to bacteria within the gut. But in April 2001, a poll conducted by PBS with over 21,000 respondents indicated that 65% of those polled said that we should not grow genetically modified food. So there is still a lot of controversy involved in consuming genetically modified products.
Alex: Yeah, there is also a worry that genetically modified foods are worse for the environment. In 2003 there was a trial which used three modified types of crops, and compared it to its effect on wildlife with the naturally occurring type of crop. In order to test the effect on wildlife on this farm, researchers monitored weeds, weed seeds, and collected beetles and other insects in traps.
Dev: The results of this study found that in two of three plots, weeds didn’t grow near as well. When comparing the genetically modified corn with the natural type, it was actually found that there were more weeds growing, and that it actually had the potential to increase the biodiversity on farms.
Alex: So what are governments doing about controlling genetically modified foods? If people think that it somehow harmful to either them, or a risk to the environment can they avoid it?
Dev: Well in Canada, if the nutritional value or composition of the food has been changed, or if there is an allergen present in the food, the food must be labeled to indicate this. Though it doesn’t have to indicate if the food has been genetically modified, because we have adopted a standard for voluntary labeling of genetically modified products.
Alex: Yeah, but this isn’t the case for all countries, the U.K takes a much more stringent approach. Since September 1998, U.K all foods, additives, and flavorings that contain more than 1% GM content have to be labeled. In April 2000, the new UK Food Safety Agency extended that provision to"

Team CLSB UK is an iGEM team from the United Kingdom on the High School track. They have 20 team members. Would you like to search for another team, search for a part or exit?
Protocols
And you can get a protocol by first asking the app to find some. Due to certain restrictions you can't ""one-shot"" the protocols command on Google Assistant (i.e. ""find ligation protocols""). However, this does work on Amazon Alexa.
Find protocols
Sure. What protocol are you looking for?
The app will then prompt you to tell it what protocol you want. For example, if you want a ligation protocol you'd just say
Ligation
Ok, I've found Ligation protocol. Ligation lets you take a strand of DNA that has compatible sticky ends and insert it into a vector. Would you like a step-by-step guide or to exit?
The app will then search the Protocat database and find you relevant protocols. It will then read out the summary for that protocol. You can begin the step-by-step guide for that protcol by saying
A step-by-step guide
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
The app will then proceed to read out the first step. Once you're ready, you can ask the app to move on to the next step. If you missed a step you can ask the app to repeat it, and if you've gone too far you can ask the app to go back.
Next
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Repeat
Step 2: Add 2μL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer to the tube
Back
Step 1: Label a microcentrifuge tube to perform the reaction in
Where possible, the app will try to remember where you are in the protocol in case you accidentally quit the app.
If you want to add your own protocols simply add them to ProtoCat , a protocols database created by Michigan Software 's iGEM team. Once you’ve added protocols there, you'll be able to use them in the app within a couple of minutes.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," efficient for a bacterium. Plasmids are one mode of transmission of antibiotic resistance genes. When two cells conjugate, one which has a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance gene with a second bacteria that lacks it, the second cell gains a copy of that plasmid such that both bacteria are antibiotic resistant. It is also possible for plasmids to have two or more resistance genes. Selection for one resistance gene simultaneously selects for all the others on the same plasmid. Thus while the bacterium may not currently need these additional resistance genes, they persist in the cell and the population. Horizontal gene transfer of plasmids via conjugation which occurs even between bacteria of different species is a real threat. Combined with selective pressure from an antibiotic and short generation times, it does not take long for a high percentage of the population to become resistant to any given antibiotic.[1]

Introduction
Bacteriophage (“phage”) therapy, as a study, was initially developed in 1916 but then became nearly obsolete in the West until the 1940's and again after the fall of the Soviet Union. In the East, phage therapy had been and is still currently used in Georgia and Poland among other countries. Their success has thus rekindled interest and research in the West. This therapy is increasingly cited as the best alternative to antibiotics, the overuse of which has led to"

In order to continue with the production of T7 promoter variants, Vincent had to make more gene-specific Lysis (i.e. T4 Lysis with RBS upstream). For this, Vincent used the new Hifi+ enzyme that had been ordered the previous day. Since we were also running out of PCR primer mix, Vincent went ahead and made some more. The gel result for the T4 Lysis cassette is found below.
Friday, 26 August 2011
Vincent ran a plate-reader experiment for the K1-T7-lysis BL21 cells. The first three rows received various doses of IPTG before the experiment got under way. The next three rows (const, lac, lac2) received no IPTG for the first 2 hours of incubation but then were given the same IPTG doses as the first three rows. Data analysis will take place tomorrow.
Vincent also made liquid cultures of the C5-T7-lysis BL21 cells. After consultation with Henrike, we have decided to drop the C5 backbone since it does not really add to the work we are doing and only adds more PCRs and cultures.
Vincent made a Gibson assembly of the 18 T7-RFP promoter variants and the 3 T7-Lysis variants into the K1 backbone. The DNA will be transformed on Saturday.
Nadine made colony PCRs for yesterday's Gibson assemblies: J61002 Plac-RFP and pSB3K1 TetR-LacI; she also made PCRs for pSB3K1 TetR-LacI that had been sent for sequencing on wednesday. Unfortunately, the plate with J61002 Plac-lysis yielded no colonies... Details of the PCRs:
pSB3K1 TetR-LacI:
amplify LacI with sequencing primers
amplify TetR with sequencing primers
J61002 Plac-RFP:
amplify RFP with colony PCR primers

To test the detecting function of the Fim Standby Switch it was assembled with the PBAD/AraC promotor. The PBAD/AraC promotor with Standby Switch parts were plated out onto four different LB plates containing chloramphenicol, two plates with different concentrations of glucose and chloramphenicol, and another containing arabinose. As colonies for the Fim Switch section were red and white when plated onto chloramphenicol plates due to leakiness, the plates with glucose in theory should suppress this switching and a greater percentage colonies on these plates should be red after transformation. The colonies on the arabinose plate should be white as translation of fimE leads to the flipping fimS, and expression of RHlI. The number of colonies on the plate that are white and red confirm inversion, this will show the percentage of colonies in the [ON] and [OFF] states. DNA sequencing will show inversion of the switch. As fimE is unidirectional over time the colonies should all become white on the plate containing arabinose. The plate containing glucose should repress leakage and the medium is supplemented by some percentage glucose. To ensure that AHL is produced a white colony is chosen, where the fimS section has flipped, and a red colony which has not yet inverted. These colonies are then co-cultured with a successfully independently tested reporter cell. This reporter cell detects AHL production and as a result GFP produced. This also shows that the reversed sequences for RHLI and B0034 are working as expected.

Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," changes. We learned that blood tests in cattle take place behind the tail, as opposed to the current skin test which takes place in the neck. According to Phil, the blood test is easier and safer to perform, however there is still a partial risk of kicking from the cows hind legs. This risk has been significantly reduced as the cow is normally held in a crush, preventing the rear legs from kicking backwards and letting the tester stand to the side of the animal.  However, he also told us that an eppendorf tube would be too small and fiddly for the purpose of a blood test. The current blood test tube is around 110mm long with a 12mm diameter, bulky enough for the vet performing the test to get a good grip on the tube whilst drawing blood from behind the cow. The environment in which the test takes place is unclean and hectic, so our next design took elements from the current blood test tube. We designed a larger test tube with a vacuum sealed lid, shown on the left. Inside the main tube is a smaller eppendorf tube containing the cell-free test system.
Design 3 - the filter
Our own research into bovine blood testing and further advice from Phil brought up a new issue: bovine blood tests can draw up to 7ml of blood. Our test only requires a few drops, but the vet performing the test would not have time to measure delicate amounts of blood whilst behind an agitated cow. So we decided to move the eppendorf containing our cell free kit to the base of the blood tube. We then needed to design a filter that allows only a small amount of blood to interact with our test. Ideally this membrane would let only a few drops of blood through whilst keeping the remaining blood above the membrane. This method lets the vet collect a blood sample as normal. A further benefit is that in a future design the cell free kit could snap off of the blood tube, therefore allowing both a TB test to be carried out and a blood test. By associating these two parts together, most likely with a tear off label, the blood could be tested in more detail if required.
The 3D mockup shows the Vacutainer with an eppendorf in the base containing our cell free kit with the filter situated above this. This design allows the blood to be kept away from the cell free kit whilst the filter lets the correct about of blood into the eppendorf tube.

Abstract
We have developed a stochastic model of a colour bio-camera system in E.coli. The model takes the light incident of the bacteria and stochastically estimates the light regulated expression of pigment proteins over time. The population of proteins over time is combined with their absorption spectra and plotted as a surface showing the cell’s absorption spectrum over time. There have been insufficient experimental results to test the model with rates and absorption spectra taken from literature and theoretical conjecture. This prevents us from drawing accurate conclusions. However our preliminary results suggest that a collection of cells will show a reliable colour but with a very high variance between individuals. This reduces the spatial control of expression and thus the resolution of any bio-camera. One way to counter this problem and the problem of one pathway dominating the others is to insert multiple copies of the light regulated genes. This causes spatial control to be increased as the behaviour of each individual is more predictable. This model requires experimental data to test it and update it to produce an accurate description of our biological system. In its current for it provides a well documented framework for future rule-based modelling of similar systems.
Introduction
Our model predicts how the absorption spectrum of a modified E. coli changes over time in response to a given incident light spectrum. It can estimate key properties of the system such as stability, development time of the image, and the balance of colours.
The model is split into three sections. Initially, the reaction of each sensor species to a given incident light spectrum is calculated. This information feeds to the heart of the model, which involves simulating the biochemistry of our designed pathways. Finally the data from the simulation is used to plot the absorption spectrum of the system as it varies with time.
Currently the model is based on results from literature and theoretical conjecture as sufficient experimental results are not available. The motivation for the model is to numerically characterize our bio-bricks for future use and to help us create the first colour coliroid. With experimental results the model could readily be updated to fulfill its original mandate.
Control of bacteria using light has many applications. Di-chromatic control of bacteria has been achieved, the challenge now is for Tri-chromatic control. Our lab project aims to produce a full colour ‘coliroid’ to demonstrate tri-chromatic control of"

The following Gibson assembly was conducted with both backbone fragments (Gibson overhang 5-3, Gibson overhang 3-4) and the two different ORI variants (p15A and pSC101) respectively. Afterwards the particular Gibon assembly products containing the different ORIs were transformed into chemically competent cells and plated on LB-Carbenicillin plates. To test the grown colonies, colony PCRs were performed which showed promising results so the corresponding growths were purified and sent in to GATC for sequencing. The sequencing results confirmed the desired outcome. So Glycerol stocks have been prepared from all different AP variants with pBR ORI, p15A ORI and pSC101 ORI.
2. Preparation of AP pBR ORI for PREDCEL: In order to test the circuits in PREDCEL, the AP with pBR ORI was transformed into 1030 and 2060 electro competent cells and plated. The colonies of these trafos were picked and corresponding growths were inoculated. In parallel colony PCRs were performed to check the Trafo outcome. All of the picked clones showed excellent results. After the colony PCRs were repeated from the growths and did not show clear results, one of the other sequenced APs was transformed into 1030 and 2060 electro competent cells and into chemically competent cells as well. These Trafos have also been checked by colony PCR the next day. As this showed the desired results, glycerol stocks were prepared from the corresponding growths and the growths were plated on LB-Tet plates to select for the F-Plasmid, which is crucial for phage infection.
After the sequence of the other two AP variants (ORI p15A and pSC101) were confirmed, they were transformed into 1030 electro competent cells as well. The three different ORI strenghts (high copy-low copy) allow gradual adaption in the following PREDCEL experiments.
3. Test constructs for Riboswitch and CYP1A2: Started to transform the pSB4K5 (iGEM Distribution Kit 2017, Plate 4, well 6H) and pSB1C3 (iGEM Distribution Kit 2017, Plate 4, well 4B). But still waiting for all primers necessary to build test constructs.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," to construct a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

2.Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
a.Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they? The University of Waterloo had a Bio-Safety plan in place to ensure the proper use to bio-hazardous materials in teaching and research at the university. A more detailed overview of their plans is outlined at the Bio-Safety Website
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? The laboratories operating at the University of Waterloo have obtained permits from the Bio-Safety Committee in order to perform intended research. Since the Waterloo iGEM team performs all laboratory work in a parent lab under the guidance of the Masters and PhD students of that lab, the projects carried out in the lab are covered by the permits obtained by the parent lab.
c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training. All lab volunteers are required to take an online training to familiarize themselves with the Biosafety practices of the University of Waterloo. The training is followed up by a quiz ensuring proper understanding of the material. Upon completion of the training and quiz a hands- on lab training is provided under supervision of the parent lab's PhD student. The hands-on training involves instruction of use of the appropriate equipment that is used in the lab, as well as how to maintain and discard materials in a safe manner.
d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if possible. Canada operates under the guidelines set up by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Agency is the national authority on matters concerning biosafety and biosecurity. Risks to the public are reduced by standardizing controls over activities that involve human pathogenic agents, domestic or imported. While these guidelines are in place the current iGEM project does not involve work with any agents or materials that may pose a risk to humans.

——Applying DNA to record kids’ dreams and motivating them to keep dreaming
Introduction
There is such a plot in the novel ""The Three Body Problem""：in the future, under the threat of outer space             forces,             human beings begin to study how to save important information for a longer time, only to find that Quantum             Memory,             which shows the best storage performance, merely lasts for two thousand years due to the decay of the             internal             substances thus cannot be read. What if we need to save information for 100 million years, or even more?             The only             way, according to the novel, is to engrave the words on the stones. Whereas we wonder whether there is any             method             with long storage time and small size in reality? Actually, there does exist, which lies squarely in our             body - DNA,             a medium that stores genetic information of life, and can also be utilized to store other sorts of             information.             Extraordinarily impressive should best describe the storage capacity of DNA. It only needs 1KG of DNA dry             powder to             store all the information in the world[1], and then keeping the information stable for more than             a             million years             shall be made possible by burying it in the frozen soil in the Antarctic or the Himalayas.
Objective
This year, our project mainly focuses on the use of genetic synthesis technology to create an artificially             designed             mitochondrial genome. We hope to show the society a very tangible application of gene synthesis technology             - data             storage. Then we begin to ponder what sort of information we shall store with DNA? How about ""Dream""? It is             a more             feasible and meaningful practice to store kids’ dreams in DNA, which we name “Time Capsule.”
Collecting dreams
With this exciting and bracing idea, we came to Mawu Primary School in Chang'an District, Xi'an. First of             all, we             did a science activity with the children in Mawu Primary School to introduce them to some basic biological             knowledge. To our surprise"

Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

[Yan-Kay] ‘We need to explore our intermediate pathway, else, we can still find a better solution using dyes (…)’.
From a reflexive point of view of risk society theorists, the attempts of the team are about tackling an environmental issue which was produced by the industrial society. Such an attempt can be seen as a way of mending the shortcomings of what would be called a ‘semi-modern’ institution (i.e. technology and business in the context of industrial society) fixed on material production. Moreover, science and technology are perceived here to have adopted the role of ‘guardian and constructor of taboos’ in the sense that agency in the risk society is steered by overly depending on risk analyses and risk management schemes to further a rational train of logic. Instead of putting into question the way traditional scientific rationality is practiced, science is compared to “a washing machine, as a symbolic detoxicator, as a sedative to suppress the worst fears” (Mol and Spaargaren 1993: 441).
Chapter 2: UCL iGEM 2014 in the Risk Society
Goodbye AzoDye: Addressing Environmental Hazards of the Classical Industrial Society
The vision to embrace the merits of technological innovation to enable the process of ecological modernisation, has been the subject of critique by risk society theorists who argue that technological optimism does not appear to be compatible with the urgency of some environmental issues (Mol and Jänicke 2009). In contrast, the risk society would experience scientific and technological achievement above"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html,"During the Danish Science Festival, we presented our iGEM team. Here, we talked to a lot of people about GMO, especially with children. We had prepared several activities for the children to participate in, one being a drawing competition. In this competition, the most innovative and creative idea of a bacteria won. From this activity, the team received a lot of fantastic drawings, with endless creative ideas, that the team took into consideration and used to further shape our project.
Week 18
The team had a course in innovation with Ann Zahle Andersen, from the patent office of the University of Southern Denmark. Here, we gained a better understanding of our project from a business point of view.
Bastian and Magnus, 6. grade students from a local public elementary school, interviewed us on the topic of GMO. After the interview, the boys received a guided tour around the iGEM lab. The boys used the obtained information about GMO to write an assignment at their school.
Week 19
We got the first look at promoter reporter systems in the fluorescence microscope.
Week 21
The team started their collaboration with Odense Municipality. The main focus in this collaboration was to integrate our project into an urban setting.
Week 23
Putting our final touches on the PowerPoint presentation for the Nordic Meetup, held by the KU iGEM team. This was the first time, our project was presented for other teams. At the meetup, the team members met a lot of wonderful people, some for the first time, others were enjoyable reunions.
Week 24
We received parts from the Bielefeld team for the carbon fixation system. There was a breakthrough regarding the secretion system, as we succeeded in the creation of the cex part.
Week 26
The team filled out the first three parts of the safety form. We had a talk with postdoc Oona Snoeyenbos-West, who suggested that we should work with Geobacter sulfurreducens to test the bacterial nanowires.
Week 27
The entire team went to the Netherlands, where we joined the European Meetup at TU Delft. At this meetup, we had the pleasure of meeting new people from several European iGEM teams, alongside meeting old friends from the Nordic teams. The team extended the trip while in the Netherlands, to spend a day in beautiful Amsterdam together.
Week 28
The genes encoding RelE and RelB, which comprise a toxin-antitoxin system, were purified from E. coli.

Presentation event
13/12/18
In addition to spreading awareness through the newspaper of our university, we also scheduled a presentation event. During this event, we did the presentation about Gelcatraz for students, the other student teams and the researchers that were interested or were wondering what it was exactly that we did in the months that we occupied some of the benches in the lab. We aimed to generate public interest into synthetic biology by showing what we did and how we can implement that to solving real world problems.

Aalto-Helsinki
Erwinions had the opportunity to do a great and productive collaboration with the Aalto Helsinki Team. Our first start with them was when one of our team members, Alejandra Ogaz Ramos, was in Helsinki, Finland, and so the collaboration was in person. Since she was there, she had a conference with the team to discuss the ways both teams could have helped each other on their projects. During the conference, our team discovered that European Union legislation would not help us with our project because mostly in all EU the transgenic food is prohibited.
Nevertheless, our team member went to the Aalto University on the 26 of July of the present year to help the other team members with a sample collection of sweat for their project.  The Helsinki´s team wanted to extract different types of sweat so they could run exams on them and determine the characteristics of the human sweat and if the place and climate influenced on the sweat production.
As a matter of fact, our member spent a whole afternoon with the team in a sauna in order to obtain samples of the “Mexican sweat” for their lab project. She can tell that it was quite a Finnish experience and that the other team members were very nice. The greatest discovery was that our team member didn’t sweat that much, or at least as the Aalto team would have imagined, definitely because the temperature climate of the Finnish sauna is likely like the normal summer weather in Chihuahua.  So, because of that our member, spent like 3 hours on the sauna and finally could get some little drops of “Mexican sweat”.
The collaboration concluded with an investigation our members did about legal issues on patents for the usage of the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin for skin care, this because the Aalto Helsinki team doesn’t have members specialized on legal aspects, and that was the reason why our Human Practices members helped them. After the meeting with our member in Finland, Aalto team send us patents and"

As can be seen from the figure above, the reorganization efficiency is high, which reaches 50.8 percent. This proves that our Mating switcher is fast and efficient.

There are 325 yellow colonies and 31 white colonies in the field of view.

There are 325 yellow colonies and 31 white colonies in the field of view.
Apart from mating, we also transformed plasmid pRS416 with vika gene into the PVRVC. The efficiency is up to 91.3 percent in this figure.
Compare above two methods, we find that mating is not as efficient as the transformation of the plasmid. After analysis, we came to the conclusions as follows. For the mating method, vika recombinase has stopped expressing when BY4742 mated with PVRVC in YPD medium. The previously expressed Vika recombinase may be degraded during the growth. In contrast to this, with another method that the plasmid was transformed into PVRVC directly, vika recombinase is continuously expressed during growth. So the efficiency of the second method is higher than the first method.

We also used other Saccharomyces cerevisiae with mating type of a to achieve mating switcher. After changing TEF promotor to TDH3 promotor, we repeated the test according to the above two methods. The four strains are all haploid synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae with mating type of a named TVRVC NO.2 (upper left), NO.4 (upper right), NO.11 (lower left) and NO.19 (lower right) respectively. The color appears to be white because β-carotene is not expressed.

These are parts of successful results of mating mentioned above.
To sum up, the mating switcher can be presented in kinds of yeast with different forms. This proves that our Mating switcher is fast, flexible and efficient.

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," syringe A is open and control syringe B is closed while direction to waste occurs when control syringe A is closed and control syringe B is open. When dispensing into a well, the output specified by the user is selected and all other outputs are directed to waste. Once the dispensing is completed all outputs are directed to waste while the XY Plane moves to the next well; this process is repeated until all wells specified by the user have been hit.
Controlling the XY-Plane
The XY Plane software is responsible for taking the well coordinates given by the user and moving the the plate to each coordinate during dispensing. The software snake loops through all the wells, going through row by row, on the vessel and compares each to the coordinate array given by the user. If there is a match between the a well on the vessel and a well in the coordinate array, XY Plane moves to that well to dispense. This process continues until the software has hit all the wells in the coordinate array.
To accomplish we needed to calculate the number of steps between wells to program the stepper motors. Given either a 24, 96, or 384 well plate, we calculated the steps between wells for each plate by using the distance between wells and the circumference of the pulleys.
In addition to moving the well plate for dispensing, the XY Plane software is also responsible for homing TERRA. Before a run on TERRA, the system needs to be homed in order to start from a known location. The system is homed by moving the well plate so that left-most corner is under the nozzle. Because the well plate can be in any location on the XY Plane, contact switches are used on both the X and Y paths send a signal to to halt the stepper motors once they’ve reached either end.
This flow chart describes the flow of information in order to integrate our hardware and software components."

If we choose the business plan model, we will market our team as though we are a company. We will discuss how we will start and grown our company. Divya – An email has been sent out about the IGB symposium. Last year’s project will be presented at the poster part of the day by 2 former iGEM members. If you want free breakfast and lunch, register! Our theme is “other IGB.” The brochure will be further discussed with Melissa. Asha – The final Engineering Council meeting of the year is next Wednesday, and the retroactive summer travel funding will be discussed. Human practices has contacted Northwestsern, Brown-Stanford, and University of Michigan to collaborate. Instead of building a whole new website, Angela will contact Alyssa (Cornell) who is an administrator of the Alumni iGEM site to see if we can create a new page on their website. The point is to collaborate, not compete. In the fall we will also look into potentially volunteering to teach middle schoolers/ high schoolers about synthetic biology. Bob – Will be working to put all of the meeting minutes up on the wiki. The website looks basically the same as last time, but David has been contacted about how to make the wiki look more like a website through templates. Alex and Bob will share contact information to make everything look awesome. We also want to put our ideas on the wiki so that we can have them available for everyone to see the time-stamp of when we came up with it. Anthony – Estimated budget to travel to North Carolina for next year’s IBE conference. Cara – There is concern that the proposed phat project is too roundabout. A better idea might be to simply mutate the cytochrome enzyme that converts resveratrol to picetannol by sending it out to a company and then just testing all of the different versions. Tentatively, it sounds like this is a long term project. It would be better to make 1 of 2 simple constructs to test. Social stuff: We will have dinner on Reading Day together. Go to one place for actual food, then after to a dessert place! Will’s comments – As an RSO we can set up our own poster session about our iGEM projects and synthetic biology. We could do it at the end of the fall semester and invite other research groups who would like to present at the end of fall semester (there aren’t many symposiums at that time.)

Figure 1: Process Flow Diagram (PFD)
We as a team has decided to enter the manufacturing track. This was due to our excitement of the applicability of our project. We feel strongly, that the need of a replacement for mAbs and not least the opportunity to reduce usage of laboratory animals, should be explored on an industrial level.
The aim of PAST is to cater to customers with very specific needs. Therefore it has been decided to design several small-scale operations, which will allow the company to efficiently fill changing orders without accumulating large stocks.  It has not been possible to determine any values for the process design experimentally, therefore estimates has been made using data obtained on proteins considered to be as close in properties as possible to the peptide aptamers. Protocols and research papers have been extrapolated linearly, which is most often not possible. Therefore experiments should be conducted on both laboratory and pilot scale, and this proposal should only be taken as an indicator of the feasibility and competitiveness of the operation, and thereby the validity of carrying out the necessary experiments.

“Gene Go!”
iGEM Classroom
Our Edutainment Products
Meet-up
Film of Our Lab Life
Overview
To establish a bond which connect synthetic biology and the public, we devoted ourselves vigorously to public education. We hosted ""Gene Go"", a giant education event which drives the public participation in synthetic biology. We promote iGEM in a more innovative way, such as DIY classroom and stage play adapted from our project. We also open up ""iGEM Classroom"" which contains experiment practice and iGEM classes both online and offline for teenagers. It impressed them deeply and even embraved them forming their own iGEM team.
Furthermore, we created a series of edutainment products such as Crazy Lab (a MOBA game), Gene Card Online (an online board game), Plasmid Rubik and E.mocoli (online emoticon) to bring more fun in education. Above all, what we created was not only an edutainment product, but also a carrier of iGEM and synthetic biology which output influence no matter where it is.
“Gene Go!”
To develop a connection between synthetic biology and the Public, we held an educational event named “Gene Go!” in SCSTM (Sichuan Science and Technology Museum) with UESTC-Software. It is a public event with huge social impact. Within one day, we received registration forms from more than 300 families and 1000 people, reaching the maximum capacity of the activity.
Based on the concept of edutaiment, we created an atmosphere of synthetic biology to tell people what is iGEM and what we’re doing for the world. The event includes five section, such as DIY classroom, “Cellulose Go!” Stage Play, Exploring the micro world etc. Through “Gene Go!” we interacted more with the public and received feedbacks from them as well
“Gene Go!” was appreciated by SCSTM as well as a lot of parents. They both expected us to hold this great event next year.

We stained inoculated biofilms and performed the Crystal Violet assay. Left in 37 C for 36 hours. We did 4 trials 100uL, 4 trials 200uL, and 4 trials 300uL. Biofilm formation was successful, with varying band thickness. We also replicated this with two 5mL LB petri dish inoculated with 20uL E.coli. We added 5mL of crystal violet each to the petri dishes to cover the whole plate.
We also performed an oxalic acid gradient with 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, and 2.0% oxalic acid to give a final volume of 6mL. We added 20uL of E.coli to each 6mL tube. Left in 37 C.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-nuc_-_-_TEXT.html,", which could have affected the dispersion of the nuclease.
Kirby-Bauer: Second attempt [❌]
The same cell lysates were used for this attempt. However, it was unsuccessful. There were no signs of impeded growth around the nuclease impregnated Whatman papers. There are three possible explanations to this result; i) the nuclease did not have a bactericidal effect on the TOB1 E. coli strain, ii) the concentration of nuclease in the cell lysate was too low or iii) the plasmid construct present in the BL21(DE3) cells used for expressing was not correct or had been unintentionally altered.
Troubleshooting
The IPTG induction time when expressing nuclease in BL21(DE3) could have been too short. This time will be increased in future expressions.
Kirby-Bauer test with TOB1: Third attempt [❓]
The results from the third attempt were inconclusive since it was difficult to determine whether the growth of TOB1 around the impregnated Whatman papers was actually impeded. More clear results of the activity of nuclease were obtained from the biofilm assay of the same cell lysate samples.
Adding Sortase and His tags to the expression construct
In order to purify and attach nuclease to the spider silk using Sortase A, a DNA sequence coding for a His-tag and a cognition motif (LPETGG) are added downstream to Nuc in the assembled expression construct. This sequence is called linker-tags (LT) in our documentation. BamHI is employed for the ligation of Nuc and tag sequence. BamHI restriction site is introduced downstream to Nuc through overhang PCR of the T7-Nuc sequence, as the first step. 3A assembly is then applied where the PCR amplified part is then digested with EcoRI and BamHI, the backbone with EcoRI and PstI, and the tag sequence with BamHI and either SpeI or PstI. This new final construct is transformed into TOP10 cells for optimum transformation efficiency.
Assembly: First attempt [❓]
Gel electrophoresis showed no band at expected sizes and several contaminations at smaller sizes. Result of analysis of the extracted plasmid after transformation were also negative, showing several bands but none of them corresponding to the expected size of approximately 900 bp. However, since there actually were colonies on the plates after transformation, the possibility of a successful ligation can not be rejected.
Troubleshooting

Outreach: Skyline High School Summer Camp, sponsored by Women in Science & Engineering Program
PURPOSE:
Outreach is an important goal for our team here at the University of Michigan (U-M). From our previous Human Practice projects, we have noticed that there is frequently a negative connotation associated with synthetic biology. In order to address this issue, our team targeted the education of the younger generation, specifically high school students. Since synthetic biology is such a dynamic field, we believe a younger audience would be more willing to accept new ideas rather than older generations that may already have preconceived notions. This year, our team collaborated with Women in Science & Engineering (WISE), a program on the U-M campus. WISE hosted a science and engineering all-day camp for one week during the summer for high school from across the United States to participate in. Our team hosted a two day bio-laboratory session for the students that taught techniques commonly used in synthetic biology and critical problem solving skills.
AUDIENCE:
A wide range of students from across the United States -- from Texas and Minnesota to local cities in Michigan -- came to our campus for the science and engineering day camp. The general age ranged from 14 to 18 years old (9th to 12th grade). Although the program was mainly targeted at females interested in science and engineering, we still had one male student among the 48 students that attended the camp.
TIME/LOCATION:
Hosted by WISE on the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor campus; June 18 to 22nd 2012
ACTIVITIES:
1)      College Panel (lecture)
2)      pGLO Experiment 1 (lab)
3)      Introduction to iGEM and the Field of Synthetic Biology (lecture)
2)      pGLO Experiment 2 (lab)
4)      Survey/Feedback Session
Before each lab session, the students learned about synthetic biology the Michigan iGEM team members.
CONCLUSION:
The two-day sessions we hosted with the students was a great success and would not have been possible without the support and enthusiasm from the students, teachers, and our team! It was unfortunate we only had two days with the students, but we are sure that the. At the"

When those are known it should be possible to make an estimation of the translation rate.
Pennsylvania State University was able to quantify the different relevant features and created a tool (Salis et al., 2009) (Salis, 2011) that predicts the translation rate when the mRNA sequence is known. Even within a range of five orders of magnitude the tool should not differ from the reality with a factor higher than 2.3 (Salis et al., 2009). The RBS determines the translation initiation rate, however, this is relative to all other translated coding sequences (Salis, 2011). Since the RBS calculator uses the same scale for every calculation, the relative translation initiation rate of each protein can thus be determined. An absolute translation initiation rate for only one gene suffices to extract absolute rates. To model this properly, we would require a translation initiation rate of one of the genes from our construct. At this moment, these values are not available from the wetlab, but values from literature should give a reasonable result. We have found that the initiation rate of translation for the lacZ gene in the lac operon is approximately 0.31 initiations per second per mRNA copy (Kennell and Riezman, 1977), which we consequently used as a standard.
A first run through the tool yielded adequate results for both PchB and BSMT1, however the output for PchA was unrealistically low. We realised the RBS for PchA was part of PchB, causing the low output. After communication with dr. Salis himself we settle on a different tool from his website, especially designed for operon structures.  This was indeed the appropriate tool to quantify the translation initiation of the operon pchBA : the output now showed a satisfactory translation rate for each of the proteins in E. coli. We obtained results for the lac operon (as a control) and for the genes we want to clone into E. coli ( https://salis.psu.edu/software/ ). They are listed in Table 1. The third column of this table shows the values of the translation initiation rate that are computed using the literature value from the lac operon.

<ref name=""Bezeichner"">Blablablub</ref> Controlling gene expression in a condition and tissue specific manner is a desirable tool for a wide variety of applications ranging from fundamental bioscience research to gene therapy. Having this idea in mind, it is inevitable to consider the starting point of gene expression: the promoter. Most efforts of obtaining any promoter focus on cloning them from nature. In eukaryotes, this approach leads to several problems. The one major issue is the complexity of eukaryotic systems resulting in cross-talk between pathways. In particular, promoters tend to respond to several transcription factors and are thus activated by more than one pathway. That way, one cannot determine which signal originally induced the promoter. Alongside this specificity, induction under a desired combination of conditions and at defined strengths would be valuable implementations.
Therefore, efforts have emerged to synthetically construct promoters. Two concepts of synthetic promoters in mammalian cells co-exist independently from each other. One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review) - promoters which can specifically be induced by a stimulus mammalian cells and are usually insensitive to, e.g. tetracycline [3] . Much fewer efforts have been put into developing promoters sensitive to endogenous signals (referred to as ""synthetic promoters"" in the rest of this article). Such promoters are of very high value for a broad variety of applications. Three examples should demonstrate this: First, in virotherapy for cancer and other diseases, it has become a desire to express toxic genes only in affected cells (reviewed in [4] ). For example, breast cancer cells are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor. Constructing a promoter which is active only at high estrogen receptor levels (preferable only in cells which are irradiated, as ER can be very active in other tissues of the female reproductive tract [17] ) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that being promoters which are specifically activated by a single transcription factor. Third, the concept can be transferred to plants, where synthetic promoters can be very valuable, as plant biotechnology is always in need for novel tissue- or development-specific promoters.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Phage Purification_-_-_TEXT.html,"  T4 phage had been plated on BL21 and W3110 and pulled off.  We took .1 mL of this and added it to 1 mL bacteria of both cultures.  After allowing to grow overnight, we centrifuged to pellet the bacteria and took off the supernatant of the phage.  We then did a dilution series using the supernatant as 0 concentration.  We diluted it up to -5 by adding 10 microL to 90 microL of LB.  We then spotted 2 microL from each tube on 4.5 mL x1 LBTA and .5 mL W3110.  Allowed them to sit for an hour and a half and placed the plates in the 37C overnight.

Today we did a titer of the T4 infected phage that was pulled off a plate of T4 phage on BL21 and W3110.  We took .1mL of this liquid culture and added it to 1 mL bacteria of both cultures. We allowed the phage to infect overnight, then centrifuged to form a pellet. We decanted the supernatant into a new eppendorf tube and used 10 microL as our 0 conc. in the titer assay. We performed the titer using 5 tubes of 90microL LB, transferring 10microL from each tube to the next. We spotted 2microL from each tube on 4.5 mL 1x TA and .5 mL W3110. We allowed them to sit for an hour and a half before placing the plates in the 37C incubator overnight.  Results: WE had plaques on both plates, but we have yet to achieve what appears to be a dilution - we get only a cleared plaque on every concentration. The control was clear of contamination.

AB 4/12/2013 Notes on Cholera presentation: Current testing method to identify cholera is long and expensive.  Begin by explaning that you can sense both presence and non presence of cholrea via RFP and GFP - GFP equal cholera present/high cell density, and RFP = low cd.

Conclusions
The main conclusions of this phylogenetic sequence analysis are listed below:
The C-terminal part of the Glms protein is highly conserved among the phylogeny.
A consensus sequence can be obtained for the attTn7 insertion site for those organisms which already have a Tn7 family transposon. In this consensus the first two positions at each codon are conserved. In addition, the translation of this consensus nucleotide sequence is identical to the C-terminal amino acids of Glms protein.
A consensus attTn7 site sequence can be also obtained for organisms of all kingdoms. This sequence also shows conservation only in the first two positions of each codon. The translation of this consensus sequence also gives the expected Glms amino acidic sequence. What is more, this consensus sequence is highly similar to the Tn7 organisms attTn7 consensus sequence.
A consensus attTn7 insertion site has been obtained which should be included in our miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit and it should work at least in all the organisms which appear in these studies.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Sequencing results showed in 4 out of 4 colonies the successful replacement of the tyrosine by the glycine codon.
SSM1 Site Saturated Mutagenesis 1
The isolated plasmid from SDM (Tyr32Gly) was used as template for further site saturated mutagenesis. A full gradient two step PCR with an elongation time of 50 sec/kbp was performed on site L65 due to its location within the 2 Å radius of DMNBS. The subsequent gel electrophoresis showed the PCR product at the expected length.
Figure 1: Gel electrophoresis of Site Saturated Mutagenesis 1 showing a PCR product at the expected length of 5321 bp
The tubes were pooled and cleaned and the product was transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 gold. The sequencing of 4 colonies showed in all 4 samples the successful mutation at the SSM1 site to various amino acids as well as the glycine codon mutation at position 32.
SSM2 Site Saturated Mutagenesis 2
With the purpose of performing Site Saturated Mutagenesis the colonies of SSM1 were washed off the transformation plates. The isolated plasmid was used as template for SSM2 (mutation sites D158 and I159). The first site was to be mutated due to known H-bonds of the tRNA/synthetase complex with the former ligand tyrosine. Second site had a sidechain, which was located within the 2 Å radius of DMNBS. The primers contain two partially randomized codons. A full gradient two step PCR was performed with an elongation time of 50 sec/kbp. Subsequent gel electrophoresis showed a PCR product at the expected length. The tubes were pooled and the product was isolated and subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 gold. 4 out of 4 colonies were sequenced and the results still showed a glycine codon in SDM position as well as different mutations in various combinations at the three SSM sites.

I am Qi-Jun Chen, a faculty from China Agricultural University. I am happy to have the opportunity as one of advisors of CAU_China iGEM team. I learned a lot about iGEM from the team, and shared a variety of wonderful ideas. I hope to provide more and useful suggestions, as well as technical supports, for the team in the future.
Wang Na
CAU_China is a family. Everyone learns, thinks, discusses, and has fun in this family. I learn fresh ideas from all members. Most of the time, I feel like a happy student more than an instructor. And synthetic biology brings me so much surprise and fun. As a teacher, I hope students to explore more fields and pay more attention to the effects on life.  Synthetic biology can change the world! But I have so much regret in this year. I don’t have enough time to talk with team members. I don’t pay more attention to the latest advances. But I will not change the belief that we can make more beautiful life by synthetic biology!

See procedure for August 17. Two petri dishes were returned to the incubator (one with bacteria, one without) at the end of the day. Again, the copper pieces in the petri dish with bacteria that were matched lost, on average, about four times as much mass due to etching as the pieces in the dish without bacteria.
Aug 21
The copper pieces in the last two petri dishes were massed. See procedure for August 17.
Aug 22
Setup for a new set of experiments took place today. More 2cm x 2cm copper pieces were cut and cleaned. The cells and supernatant were spun and the pellet was resubmerged in 10 mL of fresh AFM. We prepared the following petri dishes in triplicate (see solid media protocol for making solid media):
Hybrid dish with 1 mL OD 1.708 bacteria + 9 mL liquid AFM (10 mL liquid media layer in total).
Hybrid dish with 1 mL OD 1.708 bacteria + 4 mL liquid AFM (5 mL liquid media layer in total).
Hybrid dish with 1 mL OD 1.708 bacteria (1 mL liquid media layer in total).
Hybrid dish with 10 mL AFM only.
Hybrid dish with 5 mL AFM only.
Hybrid dish with 1 mL AFM only.
The dishes were placed in the incubator in the lab.
Aug 23
Flasks from yesterday were cleaned and autoclaved. The copper pieces from last week were viewed under a microscope.
Aug 25
One of each type of petri dish setup from Aug 22 was taken out of the incubator so that the copper pieces could be removed and weighed.  A 'C' was painted on the face of several pennies with nail polish and thrown into a flask with 100 mL of AFM an 1 mL of OD 0.35 A. ferooxidans and put on a shaker.
August 26 - September 1
The last of the copper pieces in the hybrid setup petri dishes from last week were massed this week. Another experiment was set up to test if we could decrease the amount of liquid media in these dishes even further and still have etching occur. See our Data and Conclusions Page for a summary of our data.

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"ation step. They decided to use a thicker agar plate and plate a higher concentration of cells (108 cells/mL), which resulted in colony growth (Figure 2).
Next, 5 µL of 8µM DNAzyme was added to the quadrants containing bacteria. To check for background fluorescence, 1 µL of DNAzyme was added to the quadrant labelled as DNAzyme. The plates were left to incubate for 1 hour and viewed under UV light as an alternative to using a fluorescence gel imager.
Results
Unfortunately, the experiments conducted by Calgary iGEM proved unsuccessful. They were unable to detect fluorescence following the addition of DNAzyme under UV, let alone whether B. subtilis displayed a lack of fluorescence. Due to limited DNAzyme, repetition of the experiment was not possible.
There are a variety of improvements required if we are to continue with this collaboration. The first is checking the stability of the DNAzyme during the shipping process. The DNAzyme was pelleted when it was sent to Calgary, and they resuspended it before usage. Our team should check DNAzyme activity in our own lab using pelleted form to rule this out as a potential interferant. The second factor to consider is the use of UV vs fluorescence imaging. It would be optimal if Calgary gained access to a fluorescence gel imager (Typhoon Imager) to be consistent with our experiments and imaging.
Future Directions
Once the DNAzyme has been optimized, there is one big factor to take into consideration: use of the DNAzyme by non-specialists. If this collaboration were to proceed, our DNAzyme would need to be usable by Mars colonists and without the need for extensive bacterial culturing and plating. As well, a faster readout is required. The current 1 hour of incubation is quite long if the DNAzyme were to be used as part of a leakage monitoring system. The last aspect to consider is the activity of the DNAzyme in a variety of sample matrixes, without sample enrichment. Bacterial detection has to occur without pure bacteria, and in the bioplastics synthesis system there will a variety of molecules present that should not interfere with the DNAzyme. These are all considerations that would be taken into account when designing the DNAzyme for use in a Mars colony.

How ETHERNO works
ETHERNO is a flexible approach of in-vivo functional DNA nanostructure synthesis. It consists of three functional components:
1. BioBricks encoding nanostructure component strands
In each BioBrick, the component strand sequence is followed by an HTBS, a stemloop for binding of HIV reverse transcriptase and B0054, a strong terminator. For nanostructures composed of multiple DNA strands of different sequences, the BioBricks required follow the same basic structure as shown in Fig. 1. The component strand sequences can be conveniently changed by seamless cloning methods, such as described in Fig. 2.
2. HIV reverse transcriptase (HIVRT)*
HIVRT binds to the HTBS and initiate polymerization of DNA on the mRNA transcribed from the BioBrick. mRNA translation is therefore blocked.
3. Murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (MLRT)*
HIVRT polymerizes the component strand slowly after binding to the HTBS. MLRT speeds up DNA polymerization and exerts RNAase H activity. MLRT does not bind to HTBS.
*Plasmids (pHIV_pTp66p51 and pMLRT) used in this project courtesy of Voigt Lab, Synthetic Biology Center, MIT.
Advantages
Instead of purchasing chemically-synthesizing DNA strands again and again, we harnessed E. coli's synthetic ability to produce single-stranded DNA for real life applications. There are several advantages of MIT system over chemically-synthesized DNA.
Firstly, production cost for intense DNA aptamer and origami research can be reduced in the long run. Once the correct sequence are acquired and inserted into E. coli genome, single-stranded DNA of interest can be produced efficiently and cheaply.
Secondly, since the genome of E. coli can be engineered, for example, with a lac operon, ETHERNO brings us closer to achieve regulated production of functional nanostructures inside cells.
Thirdly, ETHERNO confers E. coli endless possibilities of new functions, because of the flexibility of DNA nanostructures. Drug carriers, biosensors, nano-motors...you name it!

Meeting with companies
We got a chance to practise our presenting skills when we met with different companies and tried to convince them to sponsor us. What we got from them was advice on how to give presentations and how to emphasize our strongest points. We also got good practise on how to communicate with people who don’t have much background in biology, not to mention synthetic biology. Later in the project, we had a meeting with Algol, one of sponsors, where we presented our results. We were asked great questions on how we are going to motivate our choices and how we plan to explain the results at the Jamboree. Even though our presentation there was for people who don’t have a biological background, we had to think of e.g. how to explain that cyanobacteria are a problem for people who don’t live in Finland and have the same problems with it as we do.
When we met with companies, there was also a lot of discussion of the potential commercialization of our project, which meant patenting our idea. As discussed above, our conclusion was that it didn’t seem relevant to our project."

Two different primer sets were used. Biobrick primers 031 and 032 were used to verify the size of the insert. Primers 038 and 039 were used to verify the presence of EPO fragment within the biobrick backbone. Primers IV003 and IV004 were used to verify the presence of sgRNA for LacZ fragment within the biobrick backbone.
The PCR components and program can be found on the colony PCR protocol page. The PCR products were run on 2% TAE agarose gel shown on Figure 1. Upper lanes of Figure 1 shows amplification of insert with primers that anneal to the biobrick backbone flanking the insert (031 and 032). Lower lanes on Figure 1 shows amplification of insert with internal primers. All and all, the results confirmed insertion of the correct insert length.

gDNA PCR samples from 22/8/2018 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 5μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
This gel shows various bands, but no integration (5680bp) nor intact lacZ (4818bp). This suggests the parental strain is contaminated with a lacZ-deficient strain. This goes along with the absence of any expected blue colony phenotype from the transformation done on 20/8/2018.

University_of_Ottawa,2008,Team:University of Ottawa#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a library of constructs, containing different combinations of SSRE elements and tetO elements, and then to screen the strains produced from these for optimal pulse dynamics.
We also plan, if necessary, to modify gene expression kinetics of the pSSRE promoters by inducing rational TATA box mutations, based on the study of Blake et al. (2006) [ 9 ]. Here, it was found that TATA box mutations could affect expression output, without greatly affecting Hill parameters for expression. TATA box mutations were also found to decrease expression noise.
With a functioning pulse generator strain of yeast, we plan to design a separate strain of sender cells that express the enzyme IPT4 to synthesize the inducer molecule, IP. It is hoped that by culturing the sender cells and receiver cells together, the receivers will express the gene of interest in successive pulses or oscillations. Such a configuration would allow the culture to regulate recombinant protein expression on its own. It was later also realized that the delayed negative feedback loop could be sufficient for producing oscillatory gene expression, so while working on the various TetR constructs, we decided to also build a strain not containing the TetR cassette at all.
Other levels of non-genetic fine tuning are also available, including control of TetR activity by the use of tetracycline family compounds, and the modification of CKX activity with certain redox reagents. Additionally, the IPT4 gene is placed under the control of a yeast GAL1 promoter, which can be modulated by the addition of glucose or galactose to the media, allowing us to control the rate of IP synthesis. Unfortunately, however, in the original TM182α strain, PTP2 (the overexpressed phosphatase that keeps the Hog1 pathway turned off) is also under the control of a GAL1 promoter. Thus, modifying IP synthesis rate in the sender cells would also affect the viability of the receiver cells. To remedy this problem, we attempted to replace the PTP2 promoter with something different. One of our candidates was the PRP22 promoter available in our lab, which natively regulates a gene involved in RNA splicing. Over the course of our experiments, we determined that the PRP22 promoter is upregulated in response to cell stress caused by DNA damage induced by the compound methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Although basal expression levels were too low to function effectively in our system, we were able to characterize an interesting new biobrick for yeast.

One key point of our experiment is to tune the expression levels of two genes so as to tune the sensitivities of E coli cell to two toxic chemicals. The first such gene is tetA, an tetracycline transporter that can also transport toxic nickel ion into cell which reduce e coli growth rate and kill cells[2]. We first use different synthetic constitutive promoter, varying from J23100 to J23107 to drive the expression of tetA. An asv degradation tag is added to the c-terminal of tetA to increase its temporal response. A superfolder GFP is expressed under the control of the same promoter so that we can use fluorescent plate reader, flow cytometer and microscope to monitor the expression level of tetA. They are not fused. In the end, we constructed eight such plasmids which we also submitted as new biobricks.

World Maker Faire 2011: NYC
We teamed up with the Columbia Cooper (Genspace) iGEM Team to host Synthetic Biology Workshops at the GenspaceNYC booth in the world Maker Faire in New York City from September 17-18. We worked with the public to help them learn about synthetic biology and standard assembly method employed by iGEM teams by introducing them to various synthetically engineered organisms. We also introduced visitors to various software tools used in iGEM projects and walk them through design and building of a rudimentary synthetic organism in-silico, with discussions on current limits of the technology and future possibilities.

Several of them were inspired to pursue a career in, since they kept   talking about the topics and courses in different universities of our country. Surely the   enthusiasm for this new and promising field of science was awakened in many potential   young researchers.

SIFSC
     SIFSC (from Portuguese, Institute of Physics of São Carlos Integrated Week) is an event held annually, at Institute of Physics of São Carlos, which provides some employments or groups the chance to expose their works to the people who participate of it. This year, on October 9th, our group got a stand where we could expose our iGEM project, showing to those who come see us all we have done this year related to synthetic biology.

We thought about constructing a synthetic protein that combines zinc finger protein which can recognize the specific sequence of DNA and signal peptide that can make proteins be exported out of the bacteria by secretion pathway. Therefore, it is possible that plasmid can be exported out the cells together with the zinc finger protein.
Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) to treat cancer By Kuanwei Sheng
We thought to use Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) to treat cancer. Specifically, we thought about localizing antibody that can recognize certain cancer on the surface of OMVs via signal peptides. Also, we thought we may localize cell division inhibitor protein or protein that lead to cell death inside the OMVs. Therefore, we hoped that the OMV excreted by the bacteria can recognize and kill cancer cells.
Multicell Yeast By Wenxiong Zhou
Transform the yeast from a single-cell microbe to a multi-cell organism by setting bistability of gene expression among cells of yeasts adhered in amalgamation.
To kill superbacteria
Now with the spread usage of the antibiotics, many bacteria adopt ability to fight against the antibiotics. And now it’s a big problem that antibiotics are no longer useful as before. So to kill these bacteria, Jing and her group thinks they can device some proteins or artificial micromachine to detect DNA that code proteins contributing to the ability to degenerate antibiotics. And then by transferring these plasmids coding artificial proteins or micromachines, they can inhibit the expression of enzymes or proteins degenerating antibiotics.

A Letter from Fancy
There is a very meaningful sentence in the novel The Lord of the Ring: when the respected old Billbo was going to leave the village in which he had lived for many years, he gave a lecture--”The people among you whom I recognize haven’t reached half whom I should do, besides, among those whom I love are less than the half I should do, either.
None of us need to fight in a war or fight with monsters. However, all of us have indeed fought and stuck to the very end, regardless of whatever obstacles to overcome and whatever precious to sacrifice.
The greatness lies in the persistence to do the ordinary things perfectly. We are all inspired by our design. However, the gap between the repetitive, seemingly endless molecular cloning and the last magic probiotic can easily wreck the passion. To the opposite, most of us have successfully endured the monotonous life. Sometimes the enzymes just don’t function well. Other times the PCR never get right for some unclear reasons. We"
