Swiss Model is an automated system for modeling the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence using homology modeling techniques. We use OSC as the template to predict 3D model of Pangu. The model is named Pangu-Swiss Model.
After docking simulation, we made analysis of the results of the docking and evaluate model quality on Pangu. It shows that ligands and substrates bind strongly.
Logistic Function And Enzymatic Activity Simulation
Integration of Logistic functions to simulate enzymatic measurement during bacterium fermentation. In our beta-glucosidase expression assay, we incubated the growing bacterium E.coli BL21(DE3) harboring pSB1C3/BBa_K2072000 plasmid with PNPG, a colorless substrate for beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing into yellow PNP. We measured OD620 nm to reflect cell number and OD405 nm-1.5*OD620 nm to reflect PNP concentration. During the fermentation, both cell number and PNP are increasing. In order to simulate these factors, we integrate the logistic functions (1):
So, we get the formula,
We used Excel to graph functions (1) and (3) resulting following curves:

Error sources
No transformants at all on the plates:
The ATP in the ligation buffer was hydrolyzed (old buffer). Probably you forget a compound in the ligation mixture. The cells were not competent.
Same number of ligands and re-ligands on the plates:
Probably your DNA was not completely digested. Therefore, it is very important to check you digested DNAs by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to the ligation. You can at a least see that your plasmid DNA was linearized.
3A Assembly
Restriction Digests
The left part sample is cut out with EcoRI and SpeI.
The right part sample is cut out with XbaI and PstI.
The linearized plasmid backbone is a linear piece of DNA. It has a few bases beyond the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. It is cut with EcoRI and PstI.
All 3 restriction digests are heated to heat kill all of the restriction enzymes.
An equimolar quantity of all 3 restriction digest products are combined in a ligation reaction.
The desired result is the left part sample's SpeI overhang ligated with the right part sample's XbaI overhang resulting in a scar that cannot be cut with any of our enzymes.
The new composite part sample is ligated into the construction plasmid backbone at the EcoRI and PstI sites.
When the ligation is transformed into cells and grown on plates with antibiotic chloramphenicol, only colonies              with the correct construction survive.
3A Assembly overview.
DNA Sequencing
The correct sequences of PCR products or of newly constructed plasmids having the desired insert can be confirmed by the in-house sequencing facility, the G2L or by sending the DNA to the companies SeqLab (Göttingen). All facilities determine the DNA sequence by the chain- termination method that has been developed by Frederick Sanger in 1977. Sanger received in 1980, together with Paul Berg and Walter Gilbert, the Nobel Prize in chemistry. This became his second Nobel price because Sanger had been already awarded in 1958 for his work on protein sequencing. The Sanger method is based on the amplification of the template by a DNA polymerase, and the incorporation of normal deoxynucleotidetriphosphates (dNTPs) and modified dideoxynucleotidetriphosphates (ddNTPs). The incorporation of modified (fluorescently-labeled) ddNTPs results in termination"

Sample preparation
Cells
Grown cells for 5h in 0.5 mM IPTG
Measure the OD600 of the cells, and harvest them by centrifugation
Resuspend the cells in the appropriate volume of 2x Laemmili sample buffer so that OD600 of the cells is 10
Cook the cells for 10 min at 95oC
Cell extract
The cell extract was mixed 1:1 with Laemmili sample buffer
Heating 10 min at 95 oC
The electrophoresis is run under the following conditions:
- The current is set to 25 mA for 10 min
- After 10 min the samples have reached the separating gel, so the current is increased to 50 mA and ran until the front line reached the bottom of the gel.
Staining:
Gels are washed 3x for 5 min in miliQ water to remove the SDS.
Staining is performed with BIO-RAD Comassie dye for 30 min with gentle shaking
De-stain for 1h
Binding strength of the Fabric Binding Domains
Assaying the strength or the Fabric Binding Domains using the assay developed by our team
We assayed the strength or the Fabric Binding Domains using the assay developed by our team, carrying cotton, wool, silk and linen fabrics.
In our experiments we measure the fluorescence of the GFP fused with the FBD, therefore we set the plate reader to excite the samples with a wavelength of 475nm and for the emission a wavelength of 515nm.
We also wash the sample with different washing solutions, these were:
Water
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) 5% (w/v)
Ethanol 70% (v/v)
Catechol 0,03M
The steps we followed are the next:
1. Produce the cell extracts of BL21(DE3) strains carrying GFP-FBD fusion proteins were performed and 1/10 dilutions were made.
2. A volume of 200ul is incubated 24 hours in each well of the assay plate.
3. Measure the signal of the sample before removing the cell extract
4. Remove the cell extract and measure
5. First wash by adding 200ul of washing solution and removing it after 30 seconds
6. Measure again after the first wash
7. Repeat the step 5
8. Finally, measure again after the second wash

Re"
ETH_Zurich,2015,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," was a strain containing the following constructs.
a reporter GFP under the control of our hybrid promoter ( lldRO1-plac-lacO-lldRO2 - B0034 -sfGFP or lldRO1-plac-lacO-lldRO2 - B0034 -sfGFP
constantly expressed lldR and lldP ( J23118 - B0034 - lldP-lldR - B0015 )
constantly expressed LacI ( J23109 B0034 LacI )
Results
The promoter responded to both lactate and IPTG, as can be seen in Figure 8.
Figure 8. Heat map showing the fluorescence intensity depending on the concentration of the lactate and IPTG for Plac-lldR
Figure 9. Heat map showing the fluorescence intensity depending on the concentration of the lactate and IPTG for PlacUV5-lldR .
These results show that one of our combined promoters, Plac-lldR ( K1847010 ), reacts in an AND gate fashion to a combination of lactate and IPTG. Only in presence of both input signal there is high expression of the reporter GFP. We hereby show that our synthetically engineered hybrid promoter Plac-lldR exhibits the desired behavior which will be favourable for the establishment of an AND gate in our fold change sensor , with an ON/OFF ratio of 15. The second hybrid promoter we designed, PlacUV5-lldR ( K1847011 ), does not show the desired behavior in response to IPTG. A possible reason for this could be that the optimized LacUV5 promoter is changed in respect to Plac in a way that relies on free accessibility of the operator, which might no longer be given if there is LldR interacting with the LldR-operators close by.
What can be observed in Figure xx is that the repression due to LldR is much tighter in the absence of lactate, than the repression due to LacI in the absence of IPTG. A possible explanation for this may be found in the mechanism, which is thought to mediate the formation of a DNA loop [Aguilera 2008] . It is also possible that lactate acts as an additional activator for the responding promoter . Additionally, upon addition of lactate, the loop is resolved, which might be necessary for LacI to excert its inhibitory effect. Further experiments including the reaction of the hybrid promoters to LacI in absence of LldR are required for more detailed conclusions.

THE IDEA
We have developed a simple and fast method of determining ""the comfort"" of the bacterial culture by asking them four questions related with their metabolic state which are replied in the form of voice answers. Moreover, we have engineered another genetic construction to order them to produce a protein.  Here is an overview of how our bacteria work. For more information look the molecular mechanisms below.

Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," most of the day doing some heavy maths from Danny's paper. Apparently, the maths is not as easy as Tom Ouldridge said yesterday. Lab meeting at 5 pm.
Thursday
We have fluorescence and we can modulate it using NaSO4 as reducing agent to keep the system off. But as for now, still no spatially-defined patterns... The bioengineers have done a lot of maths (the one that Danny sent us). And it makes sense and is accurate enough to study our system. Essentially, the results show the concentration of redox molecules as a function of the length from the center of the electrode, and it is also normalised for the radius of the electrode. In the wet lab, there was a shift: Diellza is doing the electrochemistry experiments and Josh is trying to make the Golden Gate work. For Alberto is plate reader time as usual. We need to find a good positive control for the experiments. We also got our hands on iLOV (GFP-like that fluoresces in anaerobic conditions) from a PhD student from Karen Polizzi's lab.  Sequencing results came back, we are missing an A in the degradation tag and this could cause a frameshift. We don't know yet if it's the polymerase that slipped or its' the sequencing. If it's the polyerase, this could explain why we only have a 2-fold decrease in fluorescence rather than a 16-fold, as predicted by the modelling.  Lidia sent the order for the promoter library to IDT.  We did cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltametry for different solution at varying concentrations of Na2SO3 (+Pyo +FeCN + NaCl). Using the result we are trying to determine the optimal voltage to apply onto the agar plates. Siwat and Ismael designed the board game. It sounds like a lot of fun. Lab meeting at 5 without Tom nor Rodrigo.
Friday
Alberto is sick, so Yutong will take over the journal. We did another GG, becuase Nico's (apparent GG expert) GG didnt work. We proved that we need FCN(R) in the plate for it to work.   At 2pm (UK time) we Skyped with Tanya Tschirhart, the first author of the Nature Communications paper we are basing our work on (she is super nice). We tested higher conc. of  Pyo and used 2 separate chambers for oxidising and reducing, as Tanya suggested. We were able to get the oxidation and reduction peaks AND be"

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," snake envenomings. The potential to save thousand of lives motivated us greatly. We think that projects should focus on helping those in need, especially when corporate interest is void.  The people affected by snake bites are often field workers, who do not have the money for expensive treatment, which is why our focus has always been on potentially cheap solutions. Furthermore, 400,000 people each year suffer from amputations or disfigurements, which leads to huge loss of labour in a labour based economy [1].
Technology, Synthetic biology and Safety
Taking our project into account, the application does not raise alarms. We are working with closed contained products without any living organisms.
The parts we are using are safe. We are applying GMOs to produce the recombinant proteins going into the device, as we are not putting any GMOs in the device we are preventing any exposure and release of dangerous organisms.
Even though, our project is not utilising the most controversial tools of synthetic biology, there are still some important ethical aspects that have to be considered, and we are continuously aware of the power of technology and the responsibility that goes along with it.
Public Engagement
Snakebite is an urgent, neglected problem and we are immensely passionate about contributing to the solutions. We do not think that the final solution to this problem is near, we have therefore dedicated a large proportion of our project to educating and spreading awareness about the problem of snake bites.
Social media
Through social media such as Facebook, our homepage, instagram, twitter, and snapchat we have informed the public and our fellow students about our project and synthetic biology as a means to address important societal problems.
Fairs and presentations
Our team has attended multiple fairs during the project.
At DTU’s Open House we talked to potential new students about the opportunities you get by starting at DTU and being a part of an iGEM team such as DTU BioBuilders. We also attended two student fairs held at DTU the DSE Fair and PF Study Fair, where we reached out to DTU students to get people enthusiastic about our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology.
In collaboration with a Danish society called Young Scientist we attended their annual Science in Forum event where we had the opportunity to talk to learners and students of all ages as well as people from the industry about our project.
In an attempt to communicate the problem of snake envenoming, we presented at a multitude of events during the last 8 months. The presentation at the Synapse (a society for students and professional within the field) event was in collaboration with Copenhagen University’s iGEM"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"20 years, and most likely more than that. To illustrate the durability of the plastics, he notified us of several devices from the 1980s made of the same plastic, which still stand strong today.
One of the biggest concerns would be the release of GMOs into nature. While the GMOs used are not pathogenetic, they would be able to share the plasmids containing antibiotic resistance selectors to other bacteria, that might be pathogenic. Antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria complicates the treatment of an infected individual and could, in tragic cases, be the difference between life and death. However small the risk of this scenario might be, it should be addressed properly. Furthermore, antibiotic resistant E. Coli strains could outmatch some of their fellow E. Coli strains through natural selection. This could negatively affect the balance of nature, that we are aiming to restore with the development of the PowerLeaf.
To avoid these risks, several kill switch mechanisms should be implemented into the final device. This could be performed by implementation of a kill switch activated by exposure to light in the energy converting unit. This would of course mean, that the energy converting unit’s container would need to block all sunlight. A task that could easily be carried out by adding Carbon Black to the required areas of the container. The energy storing unit, which requires light to function, could then have a kill switch which makes it dependent on the presence of the energy converting unit. This could be accomplished by having harmless molecules, not naturally found in nature but required for the survival of the energy converting unit, circulating in the system. A similar effect could be accomplished by making the bacteria in the energy converting and storing units codependent on each other for their survival. The implementation of such kill switch mechanisms would tremendously improve the biosafety of the device by opposing hazards related to any kind of physical breakage.

This week was all about planning further experiments...
Felix, John, Matteo, Tim:
We started by the fabrication of new MITOMI chips.
We planned a competition MITOMI experiment to check whether there is competition in the binding of the thrombin aptamers 1 and 2. Sadly, it didn't work the first time, in part because the concentrations were too low, consequently, saturation could not be reached.
Elia, Lena, Lisa, Malek:
Non-biotinylated alpha human thrombin was ordered.
We brainstormed on the fabrication of a functional lateral flow immuno-assay using two anti-thrombin aptamers.

We learned how to use the data analysis program and determined the best statistical model for a saturation curve.
Plotted our first saturation curve for both the thrombin aptamers 1 and 2.

Here is a short video on the serial monitor collecting data. The numbers are in relative light intensity units. We measured the lab at normal lighting conditions.
Data collected
We decided to characterize lux brick using our sensor. We measure the light intensity of lux brick at different glucose concentrations. Here is a graph of our results.
The measurements obtained by the sensor indicate that at higher glucose concentrations the biolumiscence of the cells decreases. However, experimental data obtained by plate reader is contradictory. ( Check here for data ) We believe that the sensor was not sensitive enough to measure light intensity differences between the flasks. Also there was a lot of noise in the measurement as you can see in this rough graph of the data.

The sequencing results showed that in some samples we successfully modified our expression system with the desired mutations.
Testing the expresion
In the following we wanted to analyze the expression level of the different, mutated versions of subtilisin E.
To express a photocaged enzyme not only a stop codon at the target site is needed but also an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair that incorporates the desired non-canonical amino acid in response to the amber stop codon. While targeting the pro-peptide cleavage site, we wanted to use the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair for E. coli which derives from the tyrosyl-tRNA/synthetase pair from Methanococcus janaschii. This year, the DNA sequence for the ONBY-tRNA/synthetase-pair was available on the iGEM kit plate as BioBrick BBa_K1416000 . However, this part was only available in pSB1C3. This means, that the plasmids for both our expression system and the tRNA/synthetase-pair have the same origin"

Literature research on different applications of split inteins. Collection of ideas what can be included in a toolbox.
Circularization-Test:
First Inductions for Western Blots next week. Incubating at 37°C for 4h, induction with IPTG.
A concept for the toolbox has been set including all major possibilities split inteins provide: circularization, fusion (including translocation by tagging, posttranslational modifications, purification, oligomerization), and the intein protease.
For test on circularisation:
Really bad blot, you could not see anything in matters of circularisation. Lane of the GFP-control (pSB1C3-BBa_I746907) is overloaded. In the next blot I have to use different volumes of the different lanes.
Expression Vektors:
pSBX Expression vectors were cloned and tested qualitatively on expression.
Development of a cloning strategy for the intein protease construct based on the split intein SspDnaB. Planning of a cloning strategy for a test construct to show intein protease activity. It incorporates GFP fused to a membrane targeting signal, which is cleaved off by the intein protease. Primer order for these two constructs.
Circularization-Test:
Inducing several samples and driving first Western Blots. Samples on the Western Blots include two different inteins, Npu DnaE and Ssp DnaE, as well as two different backbones. Problems with Western Blots, so I tried different protocols and methods. Last Western blot was quite better but I mentioned that one of my constructs must have a mistake in the sequence. Checking the sequence showed that my foreboding was right. So I decided to clone this construct again. Furthermore I decided to continue only with one of two used backbones.
Cloning of the intein protease was begun. Cloning of the NpuDnaE assembly construct was begun.
Circularization:
In this week I cloned the second construct called pSB1AK8-BBa_I712074-2ZSspH6:GFP. At the end of the week I induced with IPTG this constructs after growing to an OD of 0.8 for 4h at 37°C.
Cloning of the test construct to show intein protease activity was begun. Cloning of the NpuDnaE assembly construct was successful (proven by sequencing)

The sequencing results showed that the sample had the correct sequence and could therefore be used in further experiments.
In the following we executed a co-transformation in E. coli BL21:
SDM 2-modified expression system and ONBY-tRNA/synthetase pair

As the transfer from the solid complex medium to liquid minimal medium causes a high stress-level for the E. coli cells, we intended to change at first from solid complex medium to solid minimal medium and then to liquid minimal medium. Hence, we streaked the same colonies that we used for the overnight cultures on M9 agar plates.

To back up the co-transformed cells in M9 medium we prepared cryo cultures of the overnight cultures. As the cells were able to grow in medium with two antibiotics, both plasmids must have been successfully transformed into them. As a consequence, these cells can be used for further experiments. Continuing the transfer to liquid minimal media, we prepared 5ml overnight cultures with the positive clones from the M9 agar plates in liquid M9 medium.

Tuesday, July 10, 2012< br/>    Chris received his sequencing data. It looked promising, however parts of it seemed inconclusive. He cultured this strain in preparation for testing it by inserting a promoter. Victoria ran a PCR reaction for some of the components for the Codon Optimization Project. Victoria and Alexander worked to make master cultures of components for the Codon Optimization Project.
Wednesday, July 11, 2012
Victoria, Kait, and Alexander mini-prepped cultures in preparation for sequencing. Chris transformed a plasmid, BBa_J23102, to use to test a construct that looks positive for having all the parts from the CBAR. Victoria also ran a digestion on the plasmids she prepared earlier to see if they possessed the correct restriction sites. The plasmids that looked promising were sent to sequencing. Kevin made more progress with the animation. He also worked with Nikki to help plan out the flow of the website.
Thursday, July 12, 2012
Chris checked his results from sequencing. With help from Hannah, he was able to conclude that there was a good chance that the plasmid was the desired construct. Hannah also checked her results from sequencing plasmids from her colonies from her second CBAR reaction. Her results showed to be negative, in response she ran another CBAR. Chris mini-prepped the J23102 that he grew up yesterday in preparation of inserting it into his suspected construct. Victoria ran a PCR for a fragment of the Codon Optimization Project, and cleaned the product of a previous PCR. Kevin made progress and created all new home and team pages. He also managed to get the navigation bar working, albeit in a crude format.

The purification method is based on the organic spider silk solubility. First 1 g of wet pellet can be combined with 1 ml 13.3N propionic acid, and thereafter diluted to 2.3N acid with ultrapure water. The solution is then set for stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. The precipitated proteins can be clarified by centrifugation at 50,000g for 30 min. The clarified supernatant will thereafter be dialyzed extensively into 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. The aggregates formed during this dialysis can be removed by sedimentation at 125,000g for 30 min. Now the silk proteins are solubilized and they can then be applied to a strong anion exchange resin, which will be equilibrated with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. After 1 hour agitation the resin will be transferred to the column, where after the silk proteins can be rinsed. The column should be washed with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 to recover any remaining silk protein. The silk proteins are then ready for spinning Dams-Kozlowska, H., et al. (2013).

TDPs - Designing for on-site usage
To preserve activity of Cas13a and provide our device with a longer shelf life, we investigated the use of Tardigrade intrinsically Disordered Proteins (TDPs), which were found to preserve protein activity after desiccation and subsequent rehydration ( Boothby et al. 2017 ). We picked four different TDPs, two cytosolic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) and two secretory abundant heat soluble (SAHS) proteins, further referred to as CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 33020 and SAHS 68234.
Achievements
Plasmid assembly
The first step in using TDPs to preserve Cas13a activity was assembling the construct from the gBlocks synthesized by IDT. Since the first stage in the TDP module involved protein purification, we chose the T7 promoter. This strong promoter results in overexpression of the produced proteins. To assemble the parts, a Gibson Assembly ( Gibson et al. 2009 ) was carried out following the Gibson assembly protocol , and cloned into a TOP10 strain. The resulting colonies were then screened for the inserts after extraction of their DNA and subsequent PCR amplification of the insert. The colonies chosen for sequencing, included in Figure 25, were purified using Miniprep and subsequently sequenced.
Figure 25: Gel electrophoresis of colony PCR products of the colonies resulting from the transformation of the assembled plasmids.The gels feature ladders (L), negative controls (x1) and the different inserts (1 to 6, respectively CAHS94205_2, CAHS94205, CAHS). Bands with the expected size for the insert are marked with.
The primers used for the PCR were chosen to anneal upstream the prefix and downstream the suffix of the backbone pSB1C3 to screen for the insert. The expected size of the PCR product without insert was 261 bp, while the inserts carrying the CAHS proteins (1.x, and 3.x) and SAHS (5.x and 6.x) had an expected size of ~1000 bp and ~850 bp, respectively. As shown in Figure 25, bands of approximately 1000 bp were found in the colonies 1.5, 3.2, 3.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9 while"

Promoter Characterization
By annealing PmerT-forward (5’-3’) and PmerT-reverse (5’-3’) primers, PTPCAD carrying a sticky end of EcoRI and SpeI was cloned upstream of BBa_E0840, a GFP generator. With exogenous expression of  MerR in bacteria, GFP’s expression could be induced by Hg (II) in a dose response manner. The PTPCAD-E0840 was then cloned into pSB3K3 backbone and the BBa_J23103 (constitutive promoter)-merR into pSB1A3.
Protocols for promoter characterization
1.An overnight culture of bacteria carrying the two plasmids pSB3K3 and pSB1A3 were grown in LB broth with ampicillin and kanamycin at 37°C was reactivated by diluting the culture in a ratio of 1:100 with fresh LB.
2.When OD600 reached 0.4-0.6, the bacteria was disposed to several EP tubes, each owning 500uL, and different dose of Mercuric chloride solution was spplied with 3 duplicates and the final concentration varied from 0 to 1.0E-6 mol/L. 100uL of the 500uL was added to the black-96-well plates for GFP intensity’s measurement and another 100uL was added to"

Prediction of Protein Structures and Functions
Structural properties of effector proteins are often essential for their function, so it is advantageous to know about them. It is for example necessary to know whether termini are accessible for protein fusion or whether the protein is only functional in a multimeric fold. For this reason a structure based search was performed in the protein database . As the number of identified structures is still limited, it is a promising attempt to look for homologous proteins whose crystal structures have been determined.
Analysis of Receptor Sequences – Choosing the right template
For several purposes of our project, we needed a synthetic receptor enabling us to integrate proteins into the membrane in the desired orientation, i.e. to express protein-domains on the intracellular or extracellular side of the cell membrane. We investigated several different plant-receptors from the well characterized dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana and the moss Physcomitrella patens, our chassis. The receptors from Arabidopsis thaliana have the advantage that their transgenic expression has successfully been demonstrated [ Quail et al., 1991 ] whereas the native receptors from Physcomitrella patens bear only a small risk of failing [ Reski, 1998 ].
Due to the fact that there were many different available receptors, which we could have used as template for our synthetic receptor, we used bioinformatical methods to evaluate the suitability of these receptors. The following three examples ERF, FLS2 and SERK shown in table 1 resulted from this equation.

Going to also, as with pSB1C3, try again with a multi-step PCR that begins at a lower temperature then increases, because the two bands with promise, 4 and 5, in the gel to the left, are completely empty.

Ran electrophoresis on the PCR products from yesterday for the terminator in the PR+Blh circuit (BBa_B0015 2) and Asa's part labelled AAA
20160703_125815.jpg
Top to bottom: Terminator at 65 C, terminator at 68 C, AAA. Excellent seperation of the ladder bands clearly shows that the bottom two have only primers (AAA is several kb long). The lower temp terminator is higher, if a little messy so I'm assuming we had some amplification.
Cut out the bands and purified the lower temp terminator, then nanodropped. Repeating analysis or reblanking without removing the PCR product produced gradually better results (higher peak, higher conc., lower 260/280, higher 260/230) (data not shown). Cleaned with dH2O and ran a new blank between trials 1 and 2.

Therefore, in every activity, we told people the principle of our INKOFF project and how it became different from traditional paper remaking process. In this way, people understand how enzymatic deinking affect the earth and their lives, thus they are willing to accept higher price of our INKOFF paper. When doing such study, not only we are educating people, but also people are giving us many advices from their views. For example, a lady told us she think it’s not convenient to brush yeast on the paper. So we change the way we implement our engineered yeast, we spray it instead of brush it on. In our project, we try hard to bring new enzyme deinking concept to people; however, we surprisingly gained a lot from the public. Through this process, we are closer to people’s needs and thoughts. And we believe we are able to provide better design via interacting with the public."

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

Sealing Device
Clean glass slide with soap, acetone, IPA, then with water.  Dry with air gun (located in on first bench).
Using the Xacto knife/razor cut out around your device with enough room around the inlets and outlet to make a good seal
Make sure the channel side is even, with no irregularities caused by the PDMS molding around the tape or wafer edges.
Place your PDMS device in the clean square Petri dish – channel side down.
Using the purple needles, punch holes in your inlets and outlets. Firmly push down on the needle and gently pull out of the PDMS.  Use the long yellow needles to push out the PDMS plug that should be now stuck in the barrel of the purple needle.
Make Sure the PDMS Plug has been Removed. If there is no plug in the barrel, it means your channel has not been punched through fully. Use the yellow needle to push the plug out of the device.
Plasma Treatment:
To get the PDMS to stick to either glass or silicon, you must treat the two surfaces with oxygen plasma to create reactive groups for bonding.
Place your device with the CHANNEL SIDE FACING UP and the binding surface – a clean glass slide into the plasma cleaner/sterilizer. Make sure that at least one other group is ready to use the machine.
Close the pressure valve (black knob) on the door.  Turn on the vacuum pump for approximately 5 minutes to evacuate the chamber of the sterilizer.
After 5 minutes, turn on the power switch (the setting dial should be on “high”).  This turns on the RF coil and should ignite the plasma in about 30 sec.
When the plasma ignites (you can tell by the purple glow you seen in the chamber window), start timing for 1 minute.
After 1 minute, turn off the power switch, and then the vacuum switch and slowly open the valve on the door to allow air to enter the chamber.
THIS STEP IS TIME SENSITIVE:  when you have taken your samples, move quickly out of the way for the next group!
When the pressure has normalized, remove your samples from the chamber and IMMEDIATELY invert the CHANNEL SIDE of your device onto the glass/silicon surface that was face up in the chamber.

DRILLING FOR A BETTER SOLUTION
The CU Boulder iGEM team was inspired by combining ideas from previous work and legislation related to fracking with recently-produced genetics including the use of logic gates and cell-to-cell signaling. This combination ultimately results in the most cutting-edge naphthalene biosensor for practical industrial use in controlling groundwater contamination due to fracking.
To determine what type of product could make the biggest impact, CU Boulder iGEM analyzed the environmental risks of fracking and the shortcomings of current solution methods. The result was a design that uses E. coli to test trace fracking fluid contaminants that anybody can use easily and effectively. CU Boulder iGEM interviewed petroleum engineer David Meyer for insight into the history of fracking.
Despite fracking being a relatively recent topic among environmental discussions, the technology to drill vertical hydraulic fracturing wells has been around and used since 1940s. It wasn’t until the 1980s when George P. Mitchell, a petroleum engineer from Texas, invented the horizontal drilling process. Soon, no natural gas companies could survive unless the adapted the technique themselves. By the 1990s, more than 80% of natural gas in the United States was extracted with fracking, and environmentalists began to fear some of the unintended consequences of the practice. Chemistry and law quickly stepped in to evaluate remediation options, all of which has led to the creation of CU Boulder iGEM team’s device.

Early Engineering of Whole Cell Biosensors
The first description of a whole-cell biosensor with environmental applications was described by researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology. They engineered Pseudomonas putida bacteria to luminesce proportionately to aqueous naphthalene concentrations. However, these bacteria had complex biochemical pathways that were not well enough understood to be easily adjusted and refined. Furthermore, the cells were not sensitive enough to report the dilute naphthalene concentrations that fracking companies may be interested in reporting.

The second stop, WOW! Delft is beautiful
Our next stop is in Delft, where advanced cloning and strategies were introduced. In additions to that, workshops were organized to help other iGEM team members to become more familiar with the computational analysis, modelling(mathlab), oscillation circuit and toggle switches simulation. But it was not all about the educational activities, another important aspect in iGEM is to get to know each other, forming a network between team members to help each other out during and outside of iGEM. This prompted us to organise a meeting where all Dutch iGEM teams could gather to present their work and exchange feedback.
Presentation and exchanging feeback
After the exchange of constructive feedback, we end our day with a nice cosy BBQ, though it was raining, we managed to find a shelter in a secluded area. One of the best things that all of us enjoyed during the time we spent on eating, was talking about science (good times).
BBQ on rainy day (there's always the first time)
iGEM Netherlands is the first of its kind where a collaborative effort has been established on a national scale within the context of iGEM. This has been very beneficial in propelling our projects towards success with the knowledge that we have gained during the preparatory courses and activies that have been organized. This type of collaboration would be beneficial to other iGEM teams as well, and is therefore certainly recommended by us, iGEM Netherlands.

Introduction
Bacteria have a choice between using nutrients for growth or for the production of (commercially) valuable proteins. Being able to control the bacterial growth cycle and inducing a premature stationary phase will create the possibility to spend more time producing, using less nutrients for biomass and more for desired production. Stationary phase is nothing more than a stop in an increase of cell numbers by cell death being equal to cell growth. Normally this is induced by the limitation of available nutrients or by means of quorum sensing in response to high cell density. With this knowledge, a culture can be created that can respond by limited cell death in response to an added molecule that mimics the response to high cell density.
See also Chemostat
One of the most important features of chemostats is that micro-organisms can be grown in a physiological steady state. In steady state, all culture parameters remain constant (culture volume, dissolved oxygen concentration, nutrient and product concentrations, pH, cell density, etc.). Because obtaining a steady state requires at least 5 volume changes, chemostats require large nutrient and waste reservoirs. Creating"
Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," and E but they are doing WASH. So when they are doing Water, Sanitation and Hygiene promotion they are also doing F and E. So we are working closely with them like in the villages we visited. Itˋs not the money from the trust they are utilising, actually they are utilising the funds from other partners and they are declaring villages open defecation-free which is quite a positive omen. We believe that we should be able to combat the disease and perhaps celebrate that we are done with it. But as long as the risk factors, not have been taken aboard, the likelihood of the disease recurring is very high. For example here, when you look around, itˋs all dust, itˋs very dry. You have seen the cows, there is dung all around. And there are flies all around. Now if we can’t take care of our eyes properly with F and E we don’t have to expect any progress.
Daniel C.:
How does it look during rainy season?
Michael Masika:
It looks very different. During rainy season itˋs waterlogged. Well this place is flat, so itˋs waterlogged for some few months and then itˋs completely dry for some months. So itˋs always very damp. Sometimes, during the rainy season all the toilets are destroyed and the people donˋt have toilets. But when itˋs dry, they are constructing them again. Itˋs on and off. Thatˋs the problem with the two districts that we have here, Chikwawa and Nsanje. They are flat and they are also prone to flooding.
David Chinyanya:
Like we fixed the Chikwawa three rounds of MDA, that was in 2013. In 2014 the we had the worst floods maybe some of us have seen so there was water all over, so all the toilets had gone so now we are starting construct latrines at the lake. So it´s not easy.
Daniel C.:
When you map and diagnose the people, when do you use the clinical signs and when do you use PCR for diagnosing?
David Chinyanya:
In most cases we use the clinical signs, the PCR we are just using for the program. But when we are outdoor diagnosing patients we use the clinical signs. So whenever they get the clinical signs we treat them there and then and if they need to be referred, we refer them to a hospital, where they then do surgeries on the lid.

Development of Mouse Movement Tracking Tool for NJU-China
During their project, 2015 wet-lab team NJU-China needs a tool that can track the dynamic movement of mice in the cage.
Demand: In their in vivo experiment, they recorded the movement of mice in the cage. The video was about two hours long. Then they needed a tool to fulfill the following three requirements.
The tool should be able to identify the existence of the mice in the cage. The problem is that the mice was always moving, and the tool must set a point on the mice to track their movement.
The tool should be able to record the coordinate of the mice’s current position.
The tool should be able to generate a heat map, to show how frequently the mice stayed in the light cage and in the dark cage.
Figure 1: Tracking of mouse movements in the cage.
Tools that can track the movement of mice exist; however, they can only track the movement qualitatively, without the detailed records of coordinates of mouse position.
Figure 2: Positions of the mouse at different times represented as coordinates.
Solution: According to their demand, we developed a tool in July. This tool can not only track the movement of mice in the cage, but also record the coordinates of mice’s position as well as accordingly generate a heat map.

A motivated and enthusiastic individual who is the guiding light of our team. Meet Michiel, the multi-tasker. I can assure you that you cant find a better leader if you go searching for one in broad daylight with a candle (or a glowing algae for that matter). He is doing a dual Master(because apparently one is not enough)in Process Biotechnology and Bio-informatics. Our taskmaster is interested in determining the origin of single cell Aspergillus niger by comparative transcriptome analysis. Also, he is modelling the production of the drug, lovastatin in A. niger. And he is setting up a database for secondary metabolite backbone enzymes in Aspergilli! Phew. In his remaining time he likes to cook, read European history, watch movies and get drunk in the weekends. He regrets, long hours of bench work, long hours of desk work, shaving his beard, travelling everyday to work with our supervisor Mark, life in general.
PS- A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. We believe that Michiel will lead this team on their way to Boston.

Skinny Indian boy who works till midnight, no time to eat every day. Haha, just for humorous effect. (Actually it is the working profile for all of us igemers.) For him, IGEM is a challenging experience and quite a lot of fun. He’s quite a dynamic and open minded partner, works really hard and is ready to help others. Additionally, a high-effective dreamer. He could always shock us by so many fantastic ideas during lunch meetings."

March 15th, 2018: A struggle for life
We decided to participate to the Grimoire event, a board game student lounge, to get feedback on the current version of Microbioworld. As expected, the game had to be revised on some points such as the names of some cards that were too complicated for non-biologists. Moreover, by playing many games, we realized that some cards were too strong. We decided to re-balance the game.
On the financial side, we contacted our usual partners such as the Université Paul Sabatier, the INSA Foundation, the LISBP or Toulouse White Biotechnology.
March 22nd, 2018: Because we care about our planet!
We closed up to the determination of our subject by considering ethical and responsible aspects. Indeed, we wanted a subject without risk of GMO spreading in the environment and without risk for living beings. We wished to have an eco-responsible approach that concerns the whole world. We also wanted it to remain accessible to all and to help the greatest number, whether or not they were initiated to biology.
LOGBOOK: APRIL
April 5th, 2018: The final choice
Choice of our subject! At the end of our reflection, we had only topics dealing about cellulose-containing materials to which we would like to add new properties. This was how we decided to built a new strategy with an optimized linker to functionalise cellulose. This subject corresponds perfectly to our ethical approach! Indeed, this project is not harmful for the environment nor for living beings. It is eco-responsible because it can help avoiding toxic fixation techniques. Moreover the possibilities of this project are infinite and can thus reach the greatest number!
April 12th, 2018: Time for an advice
We contacted Christine Lafforgue for information about the production of bacterial cellulose. We wanted to continuous co-culture microorganisms using a filter system. Unfortunately, this technique may result in clogging of the membranes. She rather advised us to perform a filtration system in tangential flow. With her knowledge, we hoped to optimize our production.

May 3rd, 2018: Determinant choices
We defined the microorganisms we will use. We first chose E. coli because it is the most used chassis in the field of synthetic biology, with many publications available to guide us in the handling"

For developing this community, we conducted a forum for us to meet up with others synbio community all over Indonesia. This forum (meet up) was initiated by UB iGEM Team, ITB iGEM Team and UI iGEM Team. For this year, 2014, the meeting was held in Brawijaya University, Malang, East Java, Indonesia on September, 27th 2014. The event combined with seminar and workshop in synthetic biology. We also invited synthetic biology community of Gadjah Mada University, synthetic biology community of Sumbawa Technology University, Biology department of Airlangga University and Biology department of State of Malang University.
We tend to do annual meet up for discussing anything about synthetic biology, start from research until social action. In the other hand, each of the university member will link together to be strengthen community and cooperate with government, practitioners and scientist in Indonesia.
Collaboration part with ITB teams are some cloned parts :
Syntethic sequence (P97 and P105) inserted into plasmid pJET.
GFP reporter in plate 4 well 11N inserted into plasmid PSB1A3 with Ampicillin resistance.
Promoter CMV in plate 1 well 21P inserted into PSB1C3 with chloramphenicol resistance.
""We acknowledge to all members of IGEM ITB team for helping us doing of parts project.""

Met all Deliverables on the Requirements Page
Created an attribution page on our wiki clearly indicating work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others.
Part Submission / Contribution: Documented at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to our project and submit it to the iGEM Registry. We submitted 3 BioBrick parts: BBa_K2127001, BBa_K2127002, BBa_K2127003
Silver medal
Validated Part / Contribution: Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part of our own design and construction works as expected. Our submitted part for this requirement is: BBa_K2127002
Collaboration: Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem. We collaborated with Team SCU-China on policies and practices related to Intellectual Property Laws in our respective countries, Canada and China. We also collaborated with Team UrbanTundra_Edmonton on introducing the concept of synthetic biology to a local junior high school. Additionally, we collaborated on the development of the DNA Origami Library for the existing iGEM Registry.
Human Practices: For policies and practices, our team focused on Intellectual Property, its definition, features, and challenges. As such, we’ve compiled our studies to allow other future teams to easily access and understand the general landscape of Intellectual Property in Canada and China
Gold medal
Integrated Human Practices: We’ve thought deeply and integrated the investigation into Intellectual Property rights in Canada after consulting with TEC Edmonton, our local incubator for entrepreneurs in technological ventures.

Our other bacteria with 10 ul product, but less than 100 ng backbone, did not grow.
Ligation of oligos and backbone
Checking our plates
No colonies grew on any of our plates that contained bacteria transformed with ligation product. We wondered if this was due to our ligase no longer working, so we decided to test our ligase.
Testing our ligase
We wanted to test our ligase by cutting our cross junction with Xba1, and then ligating it, so see if it formed the original cross junction. We ran a gel comparing our whole cross junction, our digested product, and our ligated product.
Comparing our original, cut, and ligated cross junction.
Our uncut cross junction was ~1.4 kb. We saw the appropriate sized bands of 593 and 739 bp after cutting the junction with Xba1. However, after ligation, we saw bands of varying lengths, at the one we expected (at ~1.4 kb) was not noticeably brighter than the other bands. We are unsure what these bands are.
Cutting and gel purifying CB Bottom
We also wondered if our unsuccessful ligation was due to an ineffective CB Bottom segment. We had been unsure exactly which band was the appropriate one, and so we cut both. Just in case we decided to re-do the digestion of the CB Bottom plasmid, with Bsa1. We used the following recipe:
46 ul DNA (to get 1 ug)
1 ul enzyme
5 ul Buffer T4
0.6 ul BSA
We then ran the product on a 0.7% agarose gel:
A gel of the CB Bottom backbone, after digestion. We expected a band at ~2.7 kb
We cut out the appropriate band, and put it in the fridge to gel purify tomorrow.
Making more Zif268 (whole) plasmid
We performed a miniprep of the Zif268 culture we grew yesterday. The miniprep had a yield of ~16 ng/ul.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Pace_-_-_TEXT.html," we already faced two of these challenging problems. First we had to adjust the flow rates in comparison to the flow rates in Dickinson-PACE based on the fact that we (i) used a turbidostat instead of a chemostat and (ii) investigated a low growth rate of the bacterial culture and thereby a doubling time of more than the expected 30 minutes. Second, we faced problems with a phage contamination in the turbidostat due to an extendable design of our PACE device and the waste tubings. Based on this observations, we slightly adjusted the tubings on our apparatus, yielding the actually used design. In the next steps we further tried to continously cultivate the N-terminal T7 RNAP phages with the first strain, used for PACE in the original paper. Since you cannot detect the phages simultanously during running PACE, we wanted to establish a quick detection method, which reveals a result in a shorter time than the usually used detection and quantification method - plaque assays. Several methods like the dot blot with M13 antibodies or the qPCR did not showed reliable and reproducible results. In contrast to these methods, a simple phage detection PCR using three characteristic PCR products in lengths of 200, 400 and 750 bp. The results of this PCR can be quickly analyzed on a agarose gel and yield an final result for the presence of your phages in the lagoon in only two hours. This detection method enables a more efficient and direct way of controlling the turbidostat.

This image shows the results of an phage detection PCR of samples from the final Dickinson-PACE run. NEB 2-log ladder was loaded on the first lane. All lanes are
Following the phage propagation experiment further, we not only wanted to propagate the phages but trying to start our directed evolution in analogy to the first seven days of the original publicated PACE run. During this seven days, three different strains with different negative APs were used to integrate various selection stringencies. To implement this, the required APs were transformed with MP1 in S1030 cells following the *transformation protocol*. By performing seven days of PACE, it was necessary to change strains for the first time. This presents another challenging step, since a contamination during the build-up procedure pose a risk for contamination again. On this account, it should be avoided if possible. On this basis, first seven days of PACE were implemented. For efficient organisation, the expiry was documented before the run (sie"

Whenever practical, laboratory supervisors should adopt improved engineering and work practice controls that reduce risk of sharps injuries. Precautions, including those listed below, must always be taken with sharp items. These include:
Careful management of needles and other sharps are of primary importance. Needles must not be bent, sheared, broken, recapped, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand before disposal.
Used disposable needles and syringes must be carefully placed in conveniently located puncture-resistant containers used for sharps disposal.
Non-disposable sharps must be placed in a hard walled container for transport to a processing area for decontamination, preferably by autoclaving.
Broken glassware must not be handled directly. Instead, it must be removed using a brush and dustpan, tongs, or forceps. Plastic ware should be substituted for glassware whenever possible.
Perform all procedures to minimize the creation of splashes and/or aerosols.
Decontaminate work surfaces after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with appropriate disinfectant.
Decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious materials before disposal using an effective method. Depending on where the decontamination will be performed, the following methods should be used prior to transport:
Materials to be decontaminated outside of the immediate laboratory must be placed in a durable, leak proof container and secured for transport.
Materials to be removed from the facility for decontamination must be packed in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
A sign incorporating the universal biohazard symbol must be posted at the entrance to the laboratory when infectious agents are present. Posted information must include: the laboratory’s biosafety level, the supervisor’s name (or other responsible personnel), telephone number, and required procedures for entering and exiting the laboratory. Agent information should be posted in accordance with the institutional policy.
An effective integrated pest management program is required.
The laboratory supervisor must ensure that laboratory personnel receive appropriate training regarding their duties, the necessary precautions to prevent exposures, and exposure evaluation procedures. Personnel must receive annual updates or additional training when procedural or policy changes occur. Personal health status may impact an individual’s susceptibility to infection, ability to receive immunizations or prophylactic interventions. Therefore, all laboratory personnel and particularly women of childbearing age should be provided with information regarding immune competence and conditions that may predispose them to infection. Individuals having these conditions should be encouraged to self-identify to the institution’s healthcare provider for appropriate counseling and guidance.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," Shuffling – PPTase Plasmids
As there is always leaky expression of indC* - due to the fact that E. coli TOP10 lacks the lac repressor and we use a lacPromoter - we assembled variants of the PPTase plasmids which also carry the lacI gene with a lacPromoter.
Engineered indC - Quantitative Assay
Since we want to characterize the indC*-variants and PPTases in a quantitative manner, we establish an assay for measuring the correlations between T-domains, PPTases, growth rate and indigoidine production using OD measurements. We take 96 well plates and measure absorption spectra of various indigoidine producing cultures.
Week 21
BioBricks for the Registry
This week we prepared our parts for submission to the registry. We submitted the coding sequences of indC, sfp, svp, entD and delC, as well as expression constructs coding for indC with the exchanged T-domains that resulted in a blue phenotype. These are pRB22 and pRB23-T8, -T10, -T12, -T13, -T14. We also submitted our construct in which the indC-T-Domain is exchanged by the ccdB gene.
A table of all the parts we submitted can be found on the Parts site.
Engineered indC – Quantitative Assay
We started with the detailled characterization of our engineered indC-variants using a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader to measure the absorbance spectra of 52 liquid cultures of different (co-)transformants over time. The table in the detailled lab journal shows the loading scheme of our 96 well plate and the transformants we used.
Since a variant of indC, where the T-domain has been exchanged by the bpsA T-domain with the specific domain borders b31 resulted in a blue phenotype, we ordered primers to try other native T-Domains with these newly defined domain borders.
Week 22
T-domain shuffling
Last week's co-transformation experiments showed that exchanging the indC-T-domain with the bpsA T-domain results in a functional indigoidine synthetase, provided specific domain borders were chosen. We now used this domain borders to also try the other native T-Domains T3-9 from B. parabrevis, D. acidovorans, P. luminescens and E. coli. We assembled the pRB23 variants T3 to T9 with the domain borders b31 and performed co-transformations with"

OUR HP With TEAM HFUT iGEM
In this section of collaboration, we helped the Team HFUT test their software Biodesigner Coral, an online software that can help users search for particular part of iGEM and construct their own part, the relationship among genes, compounds, or parts, and offer the detailed information of a plenty of genes. We discussed about the software according to the using experience of our team. We tried to use this software to build a part we use this year and search for some genes we often use. We gave them some suggestions online. Here are the screenshot pictures of the online chatting records. (We use the common social network QQ to communicate, Haoran Ding represented our team and Xinyu Chen reprensented Team HFUT)

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

is a sophomore at MIT studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. Jenna is excited about participating in iGEM because she wants to learn more about synthetic biology. She is interested in synthetic biology because after many years of athletics, she has experienced injury and encountered both kids and adults who have not been able to play a sport because of their physical disabilities. She believes that people can’t control diseases that they might be born with, and that shouldn’t keep people out. In the future, she wants to be able to design something in order to improve the lives of other people. She likes how iGEM is a rare experience where she can come up with her own project idea and work on it with the team. In the past year, she has been conducting research with the Langer Lab at MIT, working on building a scaffold which can be electrically stimulated to allow nerve cells to regenerate faster and with less scar tissue.

The number of CFU was calculated by inoculated respectively 10µL of pre-cultures of Pseudovibrio denitrificans in MB 1X and in M9-CASA+3%NaCl at OD (600nm) ~ 1.
In the aim to know if we can transfer Pseudovibrio denitrificans from a media, to the other one, we have made some tests and calculate a ratio of survivability.

March For Science in Munich
The March for Science is a demonstration taking place internationally since 2017. Together, scientists and interested laypeople are aiming at communicating the values that are the basis of a sound science. It takes place in over 600 cities with its main event in Washington, D.C.
We believe that the value of science for our society is still too frequently neglected. Independent of political orientation, we think it is important to campaign for strong and independent research. This motivated us to take part in the march as a group and show presence, as every additional person means more attention for this topic. It was not only fun taking part and meeting so many interested people, but it also reassured us that many believe in the positive effects science can have on society.
Since our project will only find its way to the public if the creativity and progressiveness of the idea finds acceptance, we felt directly concerned. We had a lot of fun thinking of good slogans and crafting them together.
The big surprise for us came the next day - CNN picked our signs as one of the wittiest around the world.
Open Day at Biology Center of LMU
The Open Day at the biology faculty is an annual event that provides the opportunity for everyone to get a look at what the biologically sciences have to offer.
There are interesting things to discover for school children, students and all interested citizens. Besides the program, the faculty displays different research activities of the biocenter and allowed the iGEM Munich team to take part as well.
We got in touch with interested students, scientists and pupils. It was a great experience of switching from explaining pipettes to DNA to details of our Phactory project. We did some pixel-pipetting-art with some very young natural talents and performed DNA extraction from the salvia. That even got some senior citizens excited.

Status: cloning before evaluation
Device three: BBa_J23115 + BBa_E0240, each in the backbone pSB1C3
Status: cloning before evaluation
The cloning:
Devices two and three were built from their individual parts. The plasmids containing the promotors (BBa_J23101 and BBa_J23115) were cut open with SpeI-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. The XbaI and PstI-HF digested GFP (BBa_E0240) was then ligated downstream of the promotors. Both devices were transformed into DH5α, plated out on chloramphenicol [35mg/µl] LB-agar plates and tested via colony-PCR to identify positive clones. For verification PCR-positive clones were sequenced: device two and device three
Flow cytometry analysis:
For each measurement 50 µl of an overnight culture were first incubated with 1 µl of the membrane stain FM4-64 (final concentration: 4ng/µl) at 37°C for 60 minutes. This is necessary to differentiate between dust or cell particles and intact cells during the measurement. After the incubation, 1 µl of each sample was diluted in 200 µl phosphate buffered saline solution and then evaluated via flow cytometry. In order to generate meaningful results the described measurements were perfomed three times with technical replicates.
For the analysis, all events were gated for a signal in the red channel (which corresponds to intact cells). For those events, the gfp-fluorescence was measured in fluorescence units. The graph below shows the avarage of the geometric mean of the gfp signals from 3 experiments. The empty DH5α strain was used as control for auto fluorescence of the cells.
For details please check our Interlab study submission: LMU-Munich Interlab form
Results:
The results indicate that the promoter BBa_K823005 shows the highest expression of GFP, followed by the device BBa_I20260 (BBa_K823005 + B0032). The lowest GFP expression was measured with the device carrying BBa_K823012.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html,". You can download the form in full here: http://research.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/HRP-312-WORKSHEET-Exemption-Determination-1.docx . To be clear, this is the form (or set of regulations) that the reviewer will be looking at to determine exemption status. That means that the protocol you write (should that be expected at your school the way it is at UC Davis) or any other measures that you fill out for the purposes of receiving and exemption will have to conform to these requirements. We will go through the page for the three most relevant sections.
Since these rules are founded in federal statute, the content will be similar at other US institutions, though the layout may look different. At UC Santa Cruz, for instance, there were more interactive features on the website for researchers to access. These standards are founded in bioethics on a global level and from the human dignity standards professed in the UN’s declaration, so similar expectations are held internationally, though they may not be regulated in the same pattern as the United States.
The first section lists categories that will not be able to be exempt. Your typical iGEM project human practices surveys and public outreach will likely not implicate these groups at the early stages of research that we find in the competition, but later on they may interact with FDA standards (elsewhere on our wiki the UC Davis team describes what this will look like), and certainly one can imagine circumstances where synthetic biology may be applicable to the condition of prisoners are therefore require such research. If your research does encounter these groups, then you will not be able to get an exemption. Otherwise, you can go to the next section.
The second section includes protocols that must be observed in order to maintain exemption status after the exemption determination. You need to maintain ALL of these categories.
The first box in this section indicates that your work must present no more than minimal risk, which means that participation in the survey will incur the absolutely least amount of danger. In surveys, this can mean that if you ask questions that could be potentially dangerous to the participant if identified there are special procedures or if the questioning could result in any mental distress to the participant. A potentially dangerous question can even be just a controversial opinion, that if revealed, could place the participant in danger. A question that may trigger flashbacks or other adverse reactions can also be considered dangerous or requesting them to perform psychological tests, like word association, can breach the boundaries of minimal risk. Opinions about synthetic biology seem unlikely to cause those kinds of danger, but that doesn’t mean that you should not be mindful about"

Biofuels and land use: a synthetic biology perspective
As CO2 levels in the atmosphere reach alarming levels and the world looks for possible solutions, one of the greatest debates has centered on whether the widespread growth of biomass for biofuels will compete with the land needed to feed our growing world population.
Just like fossil fuels, biofuels or renewable fuels are energy-packed hydrocarbons that can be burned to generate energy and are ultimately released back into the atmosphere as CO2. However, differently from fossil fuels, in which the CO2 was fixed by plant matter millions of years ago, in biofuels the carbon has been recently fixed from the atmosphere into biomass. Therefore, it can argued that the CO2 that results from burning biofuels is neutral, since it was taken from our already polluted atmosphere and will be recycled by the photosynthetic organisms used as biomass as soon as it is released from biofuel burning. So, by not adding CO2 into our atmosphere they are a better alternative than fossil fuels. Other advantages of biofuels are that they emit less toxic pollutants than fossil fuels and could help reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies.
There are two currently available biofuels, also known as first-generation biofuels. One is bioethanol obtained from yeast fermentation of plant-produced sugars, such as sugarcane juice and molasses (Brazil), corn starch (U.S.A.) and beet sugar (Europe). The second biofuel is biodiesel obtained through the transesterification of vegetable oil, such as soy oil, with a short-chain aliphatic alcohol and resulting in esters of fatty acids of varying lengths (biodiesel), with glycerol as the main subproduct.
Bioethanol is being used in gasoline blends for small vehicle engines in several countries. Brazil is the most successful example of bioethanol use. Since the 1970’s and driven by the oil crisis of 1973, the Brazilian government has promoted the large-scale substitution of fossil fuels with bioethanol from sugarcane juice and molasses. Several actions have been taken towards this goal, including the development of ethanol engines, mandatory ethanol content in gasoline ranging from 20"

Human Practices
The Penn State iGEM team wanted to find a way to communicate the ideas and ethics behind synthetic biology to the public. We wanted to educate more people about how genetic engineering actually works and maybe fix some of the misconceptions that people may have about it. Our team accomplished this goal by giving a lecture on synthetic biology to two different groups. One was a group of students involved with the ScienceU program at Penn State and the other were teachers who felt the need to learn more about the growing field of synthetic biology. We explained the ideas behind what we had been doing all summer and began a discussion of the ethical ramifications of genetically modifying organisms and what that might mean to the world.
Reaching out to the teachers was definitely something new for Penn State iGEM, not only did we talk with them about the ethics and the science behind synthetic biology. We created lesson plans with the help of the education majors on our team for those teachers to implement the lessons in their classrooms. This came with an activity for students to learn how to design constructs, an instructional video that covers the basics of synthetic biology, an interactive presentation for the teachers to introduce the topic, and an activity for the students to discuss the ethics of synthetic biology. With allowing the students to state their own opinions and think freely about the topics, it really allows for the growth of new ideas as well as getting feedback from a different point of view. The feedback from the teachers and the students was incredibly positive and now there are many more possible synthetic biologists out there.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"

Remove the bottom cap from the column and apply the appropriate amount of Strep- Tactin® matrix (1 ml of the 50 % suspension per 1 l of cell culture, column bed volume = 0.5). For all steps, allow the solutions on the column to drain off by gravity before adding the next one.
Equilibrate the column by adding 10 CV (CV = column bed volume) of buffer W.
Adsorption of Strep-tag proteins to the matrix and column washing
Load your crude extract on the column and keep 50 - 100 µl as a sample for later analysis (CE). Also, collect the flow through as a sample (FT).
Wash the column by adding 5 times with 2.5 CV of buffer W. Collect every fraction as “W1” - “W5”.
Elution of Strep-tag proteins from the matrix
Add 4 times 0.5 CV of buffer E and collect all fractions as “E1” - “E4”.
Analysis
To analyze the purification result, perform SDS-PAGE. For the gel, choose an appropriate polyacrylamide concentration according to the molecular weight of the purified protein. Load 5 µg of CE and FT fractions (determined by the Bradford assay) onto the gel and 15 µl of wash and elution fractions. Stain the gel with Coomassie Brilliant blue.
Dialysis/buffer exchange
To get rid of the desthiobiotin in the protein solution or to exchange the buffer, perform dialysis with the protein fraction of interest. Dialyze o/n against 1,000x volume of buffer W or a desired buffer.
Regeneration of Strep-Tactin column
Wash the column 3 times with 5 CVs Buffer R. The color should change from yellow to red.
The regeneration process is complete when the whole column got the same intensity in red color. When not, add more Buffer R.
Overlay with 2 ml Buffer W and store the column at 4°C.
Prior to the next use remove Buffer R by washing with 2 times 4 CVs Buffer W.
Bradford assay
The Bradford reagent can be used to determine the concentration of proteins in solution (Bradford, 1976). The procedure is based on the formation of a complex between the dye Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 and proteins in solution. The protein-dye complex causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm. The absorption is"
