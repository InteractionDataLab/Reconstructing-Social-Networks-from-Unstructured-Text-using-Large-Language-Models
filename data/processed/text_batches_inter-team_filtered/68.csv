Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,": 1803 [g/mol]).
We chose a buffer for our cleavage assay composed of 150mM K+ glutamate and 10mM HEPES, adjusted pH to 7.3 with NaOH.
The incubation took place for over 18 hours at 37°C. Analytic samples were drawn from the reaction at the beginning of the assay labeled P0 and after the 18 hours labeled P1.
In order to obtain an optimal and unambiguous result, we selected the most sensitive detection methods available, Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). According to our knowledge, we were the first to show a successful SNAP25 cleavage assay via MALDI-TOF measurement.
MALDI, combined with mass spectrometry, is a special procedure that enables the analysis of peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides through gentle ion generation. The analytical sample is embedded in a suitable matrix, which shows a high absorption at the irradiated laser wavelength, whereby not only higher intensities of the analyte molecule ions are obtained, but almost no fragment ions occur. Since the sensitivity of such mass spectrometric techniques extends into the femtomol and subfemtomol range, this method was selected to provide us with clear results regarding our ToxAssay.
This very high accuracy is also reflected in following graphs:
As displayed, each time the MALDI shows a peak at 1804 m/z generated through SNAP25 cleavage by LCwt which fits the molecular weight of described peptide. The consistency of peak occurance in an indicator for LC enzymatic activity and maintenance  of its protein function. In contrast, none of the samples incubated with LCmut show the described peptide fragment at 1804 m/z, which leads us to the conclusion that this enzyme was successfully deactivated via the triple mutation and thus leads in combination with the heavy chain to an inactivated, nontoxic botulinum neurotoxin.
To make sure, we detected the correct cleavage product, we further validated our results using a peptide synthesized specifically for this purpose as a positive control with the aforementioned peptide sequence. The peak displayed when only measuring the synthetic peptide, proved to be exactly the peak seen in the samples incubated with LCwt and therefore fortifies our conclusion of a successful detoxification.

BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#SmallPhage#Summerexp#8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test_-_-_TEXT.html," Thus further dilutions (to -5 and -6) and spot test was performed to more accurately estimate phage concentration. Spot test procedures are similar to that used previously.
12 extra spot tests were performed to verify results where plaque formation was faint or unclear.
Results from concentration spot test were superimposed on the deduced gradient. Reconstructed CsCl gradient is drawn below in the Results section.
V) Results
1) T7 propagation
Based on the results from the titer experiment, there are roughly 1.6E7 phage/20uL
2) Applying the mutagen
The OD reading was 0.354A, which indicates there are 1.77E8 bacteria/ml. Because there are 10ml in each tube, there is roughly 1.77E9 bacteria per tube.
3) Spot test to determine phage concentration
All three samples (0, 500, 850) went down to -6. No obvious death detected.
5) Characterizing post-CsCl phage
Specific descriptions of results are recorded with the procedures.
Spot test to estimate phage titer in each aliquot -2/-4 (left) and -4/-5/-6 (right).
Deduced gradient with respective estimated titer.
VI) Conclusion
This round of mutagenesis was successful in that we were able to get a high titer of phage in each aliquot (with an estimated average of 10E7 pfu/mL). However, because phages are spread out throughout the gradient and did not band, we cannot identify which ones are wild type and which ones are mutant. After discussion with Dr. Grose, we decided to hold off our next round of mutagenesis until the Phage Purification Team can get the wild type phage to band. In the meantime, we'll complete our modeling experiments.

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#project#biological construction#logic gates_-_-_TEXT.html," a sequence between two recombination sites has been switched, the sites are modified such that a second recombination event is impossible.
AND gates
The E.calculus full adder uses two different AND gates.
The first AND gate is composed of one promoter followed by two transcription terminators. Each terminator is surrounded by two recombination sites, each pair beeing recognized by two different recombinases: Bxb1 integrase and TP 901.1 integrase.
The two terminators are then followed by the downstream gene (with its own rbs and terminator).
If there is one input, the corresponding recombinase will be produced (the red one or the blue one), so one or the other terminator will be switched off and can then let the polymerase go.
It needs both recombinases production to transcript the downstream gene.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
For the design of the other AND gate, it is the ouput gene that has been put between the two pairs of recombination sites.
At the resting state (no gate activation), both the promoter and the gene (with its own rbs and terminator) are in the wrong direction and are therefore not fonctionnal. Both are surrounded by recombination sites recognized by two different recombinases (Phic31 integrase and FimE)
If there is one input, the corresponding recombinase will be produced (either the purple one or the green one), so either one of the promoter or the gene will be switched to the right direction. The transcription of the output gene will occur only in the presence of both recombinases, when the promoter and the gene are in the right direction.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!
XOR gates
The E.calculus full adder uses two different XOR gates.
The first one has the same design than the first AND gate. It is composed of one terminator surrounded by two different recombination sites (Bxb1 and TP901.1, same as for the first AND gate).
If there is one input, the corresponding recombinase will be produced (the red one or the blue one), so the terminator will be switched off and the downstream output gene can be transcribed.  When both recombinases are present, the terminator is switched twice: transcription is terminated. This system is designed to be activated (transcription of the output gene) only in the presence of one or the other recombinase, but not the two together.
Move the mouse over the figure to see how it works!

Risk assessment
 
 
As our project is to use the rice as a factory to produce astaxanthin, and we also hope that aSTARice can serve as a kind of food in human’s daily lives one days, so we are very concerned about the safety of aSTARice.
 
We believe that risks are mainly embodied in two aspects. The frist problem is that the encoding products of marker genes might be toxic and allergenic potentially for human or livestock. Antibiotic genes might be transferred into gut microbes’ genome of humans or animals, increasing the resistance of the microbes to the antibiotic. The other one is that marker genes could spread through pollens or other ways into other organisms, which is termed gene flow. In population genetics, gene flow (also known as gene migration) is the transfer of alleles or genes from one population to another, which may lead to unimaginable damage to the ecological environment.
 
In order to reduce the effects of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow on environment, we use a technique called selectable marker-free system, so the final aSTARice is a marker-free transgenic plants(MFTPs). We design a Cre-loxP based side-direct recombinant system to knock out hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, minimizing the effect of the selectable maker gene.
 
To further reduce the unpredictable  threat of gene flow, we grow rice in pot culture and greenhouse-environment. What's more, we are also analyzing coding products by HPLC and trying to make sure that there is no harmful products in our rice.
Because we are the first team who choose rice as a chassis, we have to assess the safety for rice. Rice is the self-pollinated plant so that the genotype in the individuals is pure and homogeneous. The probabilities that two flowers take place cross-pollinated is one percent, and the distance of the spread of rice pollen is close to one meter. Rice isn’t included in the white line, so we make a  checked-in on the official website.

As a proof of concept for our expression strain VibriXpress (click here for desciption) Dr. Stefan Merkl from the company Crystals First recommended the overexpression and purification of human matriptase. Matriptase is a membrane-spanning serine peptidase and a valuable drug target for medical research, because it promotes cancer (Uhland, 2006). By degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, it allows cells to migrate and also activates growth factors. To find new drugs against matriptase it is crucial to get high amounts of that protein. Unfortunately, in E. coli production of matriptase leads to the formation of occlusion bodies and by refolding of proteins the amount of correctly folded matriptase is limited to 1-5%. Since V. natriegens comes from salt marshes with frequently changing environments, it succumbs a lot of stress, making the availability of chaperons and other protein folding helper essential. We expected that V. natriegens might have a better chance to produce high amounts of correctly folded matriptase than E. coli.
Therefore, our plan was to transform a matriptase-bearing plasmid into V. natriegens, overexpress the protein and finally purify it. For this plan we were equipped by Crystals First with two plasmids, one plasmid harboring the wild type matriptase controlled by a T7 promoter and one plasmid with a C122S mutation of matriptase, which is assumed to promote correct folding. This plasmid has an ampicillin resistance gene and is controlled by a T5 promoter, that can be read by housekeeping polymerases. Due to the pending construction of our expression strain VibriXpress, we only considered the second plasmid as suitable target. Since V. natriegens cannot be addressed by ampicilline we adapted to the derivative carbenicillin instead. Our experiments with pMMB-tfox showed that carbenicillin can be used to select ampicillin-resistant cells (click here for results) .
However, despite various attempts, successful transformation of the matriptase plasmid into V. natriegens was not feasible. None of our several transformations via electroporation led to any colonies. For troubleshooting, we conducted a control experiment with another plasmid bearing an ampicillin resistance gene"

Design and Application of Mask for Acne Treatment
This research is aimed at solving the acne problem, which usually appears in adolescents. When sebaceous glands secret too much grease and can’t eliminate it in time. Then the grease will block pores and the bacteria which parasite in the pore cells will propagate quickly. Especially one kind of them named Propioni-bacterium acnes, their mass propagation will induce immunoreaction, and excessive immunoreaction will lead to inflammatory. We add the gene of cecropin P5 into the yeasts’ genome, to restrain the growth of the Propionibacterium acnes and reduce the secret of inflammation factor. In order to solve the problem that the Cecropin is too big and can’t permeate through cuticle, we link Cecropin with peptide chaperon TD1 to form a fusion protein which is more capable to permeate. The existence of too much oleic acid will induce the assembly of inflammatory factor, while the supplement of linoleic acid can reduce inflame-mation.
We want to design a kind of mask which consists of culture medium and reconstructive Pichia Pastoris. The reconstructive Pichia Pastoris has gene of △12 fatty acid desaturases with strong promoter, and itsω-3 fatty acid desaturases gene will be knockout by Crispr/Cas9. Thus, this kind of P.Pastoris can convert oleic acid into linoleic acid, and secret the product.

Fig.8 Pcons: a constitutive promoter. RBS: ribosome-binding site. T: transcriptional terminator. EmrR: repressor protein, which specifically binds to PemrR and blocks the transcription of PemrR. After binding to SA, emrR change its own conformation and is no longer able to bind with PemrR. PemrR: negative promoter, which is unable to transcript after binding to emrR. Only works when SA or uncouplers release the inhibition of emrR. gdh: glucose dehydrogenase. It works as a growth factor that can enhance the pentose phosphate pathway and give the strains growth advantage.
Design: universal gene circuit:
We have also realized that our genetic loop has an unavoidable defect: If we apply this pathway to prevent degradation of an engineered bacterial exogenous metabolic pathway, then we must find a repressor protein. The repressor protein can specifically bind to the promoter sequence to prevent transcription and change in conformation with the fermentation product to leave the specific sequence. However, the proteins present in nature are limited, so it is difficult to specifically find a repressor protein for a certain product molecule. And redesigning the repressor protein and then synthesizing is very complicated and cumbersome. Although many studies have provided good methods of finding, designing or engineering repressor proteins, their practical applications are still not very convenient, in other words, the existing gene loops do not have good universality.
Based on the above discussion, the existing experimental results and HP’s research, we can get the following conclusions: (1) The yield of salicylic acid will not be significantly enhanced using previous gene loop, but the response of emrR protein to salicylic acid is very sensitive, so salicylic acid can be used as a signal molecule; (2) The existing gene loop is not universal, and the number of the existing transducers that can respond to the product – the repressor proteins is limited; (3)In industrial production, E. coli is commonly used to produce a number of protein and peptide products.
In response to the above conclusions, we have designed a new universal anti-degradation loop for use in E. coli (Principle in Figure 9).

Then, the liquid from the tube with the disk is poured into the removable observation tray and inserted into the device. The operation switch is turned back on, and now when the reading is complete, a light flashes green and each window on the front of the device will turn green or red depending on which fungi are detected. The tray can then be removed and cleaned with ethanol.
Housing
Designed with extensive feedback from farmers, NGOs, government officials, and other iGEM teams, the housing best represents the nature of the project. The exterior of the device is 3D printed from a cheap but durable ABS plastic to improve the speed we could prototype. The progression of housings shown below reflect the constant adaptation to different feedback and improvements in functionality. The windows on the front of the housing represent different crops shown in pictures so that farmers who can’t read are able to use it, and it spans language barriers more easily. The housing was built so that these windows can be easily modified by simply inserting a different sheet of plexiglass with different plants included. The code for the arduino microcontroller can be easily programmed to produce different light signals behind the windows. Farmers preferred a green color if that crop was immune to whatever was found on the collection disk and red if it was susceptible. The housing contains mounting platforms for the LED indicator lights, a dock for the detection chamber, and is easily held closed with 4 bolts around the outside.
Detection Chamber
The detection chamber houses the actual fluorescence detection. Once the tray has been inserted into the detection chamber with the blank or the liquid that has contacted the disk, the switch is turned on. An excitation LED inside the detection chamber is turned on which is filtered to specific wavelengths, and excites any fluorescent proteins made by the engineered cells. These fluorescent proteins emit light at wavelengths that pass through another filter which removes the excitation light before being absorbed into a photodiode which turns the light’s energy into an electrical signal.
Electrical Circuitry
The device is run using an arduino uno microprocessor which is easily coded and modified. The electrical output from the detection chamber is amplified and filtered by two concurrent operational amplifiers before being read by an input into the arduino. Depending on the input voltage, and how it compares to a blank reading, the arduino will indicate which lights should turn red or green in the windows, indicating the presence or absence of a virulent fungi. The circuitry is fairly simple and easily adjusted to meet the needs"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," of industrialisation and rational economic performance measures. Traditional political and scientific institutions were increasingly incapable of providing security and certainty, which in turn, undermined the trust between the public and these institutions which was necessary to restrain lay insecurities in society. The resulting political development instigated a form of so-called subpolitics to redefine how modernity and its institutions shape the way society evolves. For the institution of science this implies the breaking up of the monopoly of expertise that scientists have held. This, then, can contribute to the elimination of reductionist conclusions about how environmental problems should be addressed (Beck 1999; Cohen 1997).
Risk society theorists differentiate between a first modernity and a second or high modernity. The first refers to the classical industrial society while second modernity has been about the modernisation of modernity itself. It has hence become reflexive. In this contemporary times, according to Ulrich Beck, this reflexive modernisation has felt it had to re-evaluate the unquestioned premises of modernity itself and therefore became more aware of the notion that being able to control or even master the world through scientific and technological achievement, was an inaccurate promise to make. As it becomes increasingly impossible to be infallible in delivering predictability in relation to unknown outcomes - another promise that is typically modern - the characteristics of second modernity started to emerge. This high modernity is particularly unpredictable because of specific technological and ecological uncertainties that could potentially harm societies and which are representative of contemporary hazards. Since late twentienth century these concerns have mainly revolved around the unintended consequences of nuclear energy, genetic engineering, new chemical implementations or climate change. In the process of reflexive modernisation, uncertainty is hence perceived as a driving force that steers society (Gross 2010).
Integrating Technological-Environmental Risk and Development
The main objective in this study is to reconcile the theories of risk society with ecological modernisation in order to construct an appropriate governance framework for synthetic biology. A typology created by Maurie Cohen (1997) shows how both theories of modernity interconnect as processes of social change. The result is an integrated framework of technological-environmental risk and development where the ecologically modern society and the risk society are seen as a potential outcome of pathways that are taken in the current modern society. These pathways differ depending on whether society is seen as either leaning towards a secure environment or towards insecurity. Both, however, are perceived to be one of two possible outcomes when modern society continues to develop.
In Cohen’s typology, modern society is demarcated from pre-modern society with the start of"

Polyketide Synthesis
Overview
In this project, we propose that DNA coding for polyketide synthase   domains can be standardized and reconstructed to generate chimeric   polyketide synthases that produce new-to-nature polyketides, through   which we can dramatically expand the library of antibiotic candidates.   In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we conducted   “proof of concept” experiments to synthesize a simple polyketide—  triketide lactone 1B—using a truncated erythromycin-producing   polyketide synthase assembled with biobricks constructed by   standardizing essential domains required for the synthesis of the   triketide lactone. The domains we standardized are the loading domain,   domains of DEBS1 and the thioesterase (TE) domain from DEBS3 (Fig. 1).   The loading domain is required for the direct loading of propionyl-CoA   to form a starter unit for triketide lactone. DEBS1 is a large   multifunctional polypeptide composed of two modules that incorporate   (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to form extender units. The TE domain catalyzes   the intramolecular cyclization of the triketide to form the target   triketide lactone. [1]The target product is expected to be detected   and identified from the culture broth.

Candidate selection
Biosynthesis of polyketides like erythromycin, tacrolimus and many   others are guided by modular PKS genes. These genes encode large   enzymes consisting of modules of domains, forming an ""assembly line""   to extend the ketide units to form"

TEAM
Our team is composed of students from ENSPS School. Initially, the project was carried out by a team of 6 students, but some of them have left the project in May. The team has so been restructured, and after discussions we have decided to continue the project, even with a small team. Indeed, the interest in presenting a project to iGEM competition, to be innovative in an emerging field like synthetic biology is a great experience, and the rest of the team is excited to finish the accomplished work, and to have the best results.
The team is so composed of only two students, advised by professors and doctors from the microelectronics laboratory InESS, and also by the biology professor J.Haeich, for the Strasburg faculty of Medicine.
Undergraduates:
Martin Andraud
Martin Andraud started studying electronics for his Baccalauréat in 2006. After a technician diploma in electronic systems in 2008, he did a preparatory course so as to integrate ENSPS in 2009. Here, after choosing the microelectronics course, he is now interested in applying electronics to live sciences (medicine, biotechnologies). This project is so a way for him to put his knowledge in electronics into an emerging research field, synthetic biology, and apply it to a new approach of merging those two sciences.
Vincent Wlotzko
Vincent Wlotzko has studied mathematics and physics, for his baccalauréat in 2007, and his two years preparatory course so as to enter at ENSPS in 2009. For the continuation of his course, he has chosen a specialization in micro and nano electronics, and the “bio-systems” module is a way for him to extend his electronics skills to a living science field, to develop a new idea of applying microelectronics to synthetic biology, and also give new possibilities, between those two fields.

This meant that the 72&degC; step turned out to be too short (only 45 sec) for the 5.6kb fragment to be amplified (which would require 168 sec), resulting in incomplete bands on the gel. Therefore, the strains showing bands were once again used for a colony PCR with these longer 72&degC; steps of 2min48. The bacteria used for the second PCR were transferred from the streaks made this morning during the first colony PCR.
These amplified samples were stored at 4&degC; to put on a gel later.

Glasgow,2014,Team:Glasgow#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," capacity to colonise the mammalian gut).  The genes we are inserting into E.coli K12 do not increase its pathogenicity.  Despite this, there is still a very small risk that the organism could revert back and/or regain it's ability to colonise.  So, we still use rubber gloves and wash our hands when leaving the lab.
To the General Public
Even if any biological materials escaped the lab, the risks are very small. As mentioned previously, the E.coli strain is debilitated.  We are not using any other whole organism.   The plasmids we are using could get into other strains of bacteria by natural transformations.  These strains of bacteria could potentially survive outside the lab.  However, none of the genes we are using would make them more pathogenic, though they could make them resistant to some antibiotics.
To the Environment
The K-12 strain does not survive well outside a controlled environment,  The plasmids we are are non-conjugative and non-mobilzable so that DNA cannot be easily transferred to other micro-organisms.
To security through malicious misuse
The organism and parts are non-pathogenic,, and so are unlikely to be used maliciously in this way.
What are we doing to negate/reduce these risks?
Use the E.coli strain K-12, which has a history of safe use in synthetic biology. The strain we used for many of our experiments is a derivative of AB1157 which is auxotrophic for 6 amino acids.  We obtained the gas vesicle genes from the iGEM distribution, rather than the planktothrix organism itself (this organism is known to produce toxins harmful to human health.
We also follow the safe lab practices outlined previously, and in our institution's guidelines.  All waste is disposed of safely and/or autoclaved. Good microbiological practices are followed when handling organisms at all times.  The lab is also equipped with magnetically sealed doors, which sound an alarm if left open too long.
Future Risks of our Project
What new risks might arise, should to project go further?
So long as the inducible chemical and both “sides” of our recombinase switch are selected safely and sensibly (I.e, don;t have the end product reacting with the inducer), we do not envision any new risks to lab workers, the general public or the environment arising from our project.
But, while are organism and the proteins the system creates are non-toxic, it is possible that the system itself may be used to improve the efficiency of bioproduct"

Since fossil fuels bring tremendous economic growth where they are abundant, many countries are in search of it. Oil, in particular, is a nightmare dressed like a daydream, a demanding mistress; because despite the enormous sums of money oil attracts wherever it's abundant, it also brings political instability, armed conflicts or a ""mini-world war"" in some cases (Rabie, 1992). As soon as it's discovered, many countries and co-operations seek to control the oil present, and this often ends in international conflict as can be seen in the infamous instance in the Persian Gulf, where its oil caused or triggered 35 years of international and economical crises responsible for far-reaching consequences like perhaps the best known one; 1973-74 oil embargo (Rabie, 1992). Such disputes occur frequently, wrecking world peace, ruining lives of millions, raising eyebrows, making one question its ethics.
With all of these reasons concerned, it's a no-brainer to say that fossil fuels are vile; and we desperately need to cut their use. They harm in almost every single way possible; from an environmental standpoint to a political one. Abandoning fossil fuels is not just essential; but also possible, and viable.
Figure 5: Current solutions to fossil fuels. Retrieved from: https://cna.ca/news/the-challenge-of-renewable-energy/
Current Solutions
Despite the world relying mostly on fossil fuels, the high cost and progressively limited sources of them, along              with the ever so growing pressure of having to reduce greenhouse gasses' emission made renewable energy resources              more attractive (Abu-Rub et al., 2014).
The potential renewable energy has is virtually limitless; since renewable energy can replenish itself in a relatively              short period of time, it is sustainable (Abu-Rub et al., 2014; U.S. Energy Information Administration [eia], 2017a).              Renewable sources such as biomass, wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal are first to come to mind (EPA).
Wind energy, for instance, has a considerable potential for being a clean energy source, thanks to it not producing              pollution and wide availability (Herzog et al., 2001). Having been used since antiquity in windmills, this source of              replenishable energy started being used for electricity generation since 20th century in the West (Herzog et al., 2001).              Despite its potential, the costs exceed the supply by a fair margin;"

WThis year, we want more people to be engaged in our projects and participated             in the activities we organized which are more receptive and meaningful ways to carry on our humanistic work and propaganda.
Spreading Biology
Responsibility comes with the ability. As main iGEM teams in Tianjin, we are entrusted with the duty of spreading our concept and advanced knowledge for education.
We held several meetups with other universities in Tianjin, and discuss the appropriate approach to advocating rational analysis and creative thoughts during the CCiC. Eventually, we took the first step in high schools.
We listened to experts and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to do and explain experiments for students. We went and met other teams there, we cooperated tightly for presenting a wonderful schedule containing: the concept of synthetic biology and its influence in reality, introduction of classic iGEM projects and example of our programs, non-toxic yeasts which showed different colors.
To our great surprise, we received countless fans of synthetic biology and they showed great passion about the amazing field. They listened carefully and asked questions actively. Afterwards, we introduced to them how to build a team and what is essential for team-building, they were really excited and couldnt help to join in the IGEM club. The energetic and creative thoughts provided us valuable inspiration about our program. It was our pleasure to expose them to shallow biology research.
Social Engagement
We are willing to introduce the advanced science to the public. Therefore, we went to a community near our campus, Shangdeyuan Housing Estate, and organized a workshop. People aged ranging 4 to 65 engaged our events and workshops to know more about synthetic biology.

Improved flagella shall boost bacteria Twelve students of the Master´s program “Biochemistry and Microbiology” of the University Göttingen took on a big task. This autumn, they plan to assert themselves with the results of their own research project at the European „international Genetically Engineered Machine Competition“ (iGEM) in Amsterdam.
Jan Erik Schliep, who became acquainted with iGEM already during his Bachelor studies at the Technical University Munich, quickly found allies amongst his fellow students when planning to participate in the competition. The competition, hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2003, awards a prize to persuasive student research projects in the field of synthetic biology. ""This involves the application of biological knowledge strongly inspired by engineering"", declares Schliep. Standardized biological components, partially modularly assembled, are specifically used in an entirely new context. Before the experimental work could start the usual steps, that are performed if a scientific project is set up, had to be run through. In the professors Heinz Neumann and Jörg Stülke proponents from the scientific field were found easily. The university supports the first iGEM Team of Göttingen with equipment laboratory workspaces. For the financing of consumables sponsors could be gained.

Yet, in  addition to the constitutive system, we are assembling a fatty acid inducible  construct that allows tunable gene expression according to the concentration of  fatty acid around. We decided to introduce this inducible system to prevent  fatty acid deficiency when the concentration of fatty acid in body is low,  hopefully overcoming the foreseeable shortcomings of the original constitutive shunt.
Lastly, the  inducible and constitutive system will be compared in terms of fatty acid  uptake rate in a range concentration of fatty acid and their performances shall  be evaluated.

Project  Achievements
Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). By using the approach of synthetic biology, our Tetracycline biosensor provides a new way to detect tetracycline. Click here to see the complete achievement.
Background
Currently, the overuse of antibiotics has not been effectively regulated in China. A survey from 4152 Internet users of 31 provinces and autonomous regions in China shows that 74% investigation families have been or have equipped with antibiotics. Moreover, the application rate of antibiotics in hospitalized patients is 80% in China, far more than the international standards (30%).
Many problem stems are from overuse and misuse of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, however, large-scale use of antimicrobials in agriculture also contributes to the crisis. For treatment, prevention of diseases and the need of promoting animal growth, some of the farmers use antibiotics extensively which cause the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Yonghong Xiao, professor of Clinical Pharmacology Research Institute of Peking University, pointed out that the annual production of raw materials antibiotics close to 210,000 tons, while 97,000 tons antibiotics is used in livestock breeding industry, which accounted for 46.1% of the total production.
Motivation and Innovation
The misuse of antibiotics is endangering human health and ecological balance. In terms of medicine use, we can develop standards to use antibiotics reasonably. But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group hopes to use synthetic biology method to provide a simple, reliable and efficient method for detecting the antibiotics.
After investigation, we choose tetracycline as the research object because of its extensive existence in animal husbandry. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics of tetracycline class may make these drugs residues in edible animal, which will cause a damage in human liver, kidney and digestive tract. A long-term residue"

Background
We ran different optimization experiments to test if recombineering in B. subtilis could be optimized in the same way as for E. coli. For E. coli the optimal amount of oligo is 5µM [2].  with a legnth of 90nt [7]. The mismatch frequency of E. coli could be fitted by a binomial distribution.
 
Experimental design
Using the dilution equation and the functional MAGE method, different experiments were run to optimize the efficiency of MAGE in Bacillus.
The three analyzed factors includes:
amount of oligo used, the length of the oligos, and the number of base pair mismatches inserted into the oligo.
 
Achievements
Characterized the insertion frequency of mismatches in the genome of B. subtilis.
Characterized the insertion frequency of oligoes with different length in the genome of B. subtilis.
The an estimate of the optimal amount of oligo was found.
 
Methods
All three experiments followed the ""MAGE in Bacillus subtilis 168""  protocol . The oligo we used is shown below introducing streptomycin resistance with one mismatch.

Given two vcsfmt, find the difference betweem them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcscmp
Reproduce the original input file from a vcsfmt or a vcscmp file.
The dwndiff utility still leaves a lot of work for the user to do. The user must scan in the file to track to produce a vcsfmt file, then track that using an external version control system (many suuch options are noted above). The user must then perform the same operation on that file whenever it is changed to produce a vcsfmt file, and then run dwndiff again to produce a .vcscmp file which will be tracked, and so on for each successive iteration. When another user wishes to use the changed file, they must obtain the vcscmp file from the version control system, then run dwndiff with the ""unzip"" option to obtain the original file. Future versions will automate this nonsense and reduce the hassle.
1. Recover original file from vcsfmt or vcscmp file
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file1> <file2> -c [-w -p]
As before, this takes in files and produces an output, which can be written to file or stdout. If written to file, it will have the "".vcscmp"" suffix. The difference between this and the previous command is that dwndiff can only have two input files for this mode of operation, and the input files must already have been preformatted by dwndiff. The resulting output, whether sent to stdout or to the specified file, will be the difference between the two, which, when reviewed by a version control system such as git or svn, will appear extremely small.
2. Take two vcsfmt files and produce the vcscmp ""diff""
Run dwndiff as follows:
dwndiff <file1> <file2> -c [-w -p]
As before, this takes in files and produces an output, which can be written to file or stdout. If written to file, it will have the "".vcscmp"" suffix. The difference between this and the previous command is that dwndiff can only have two input files for this mode of operation, and the input files must already have been preformatted by dwndiff.

Collaborations
Collaborations are crucial in iGEM and in scientific research in general. Sharing ideas and experiences with other teams can be of great help for improving the respective projects. Also, iGEM teams collaborate on human practices, joining their ideas to bring synthetic biology closer to the general public. During our iGEM journey we had the chance to collaborate with several teams from around the world.
Tartu_TUIT
Tartu_TUIT
As last year the first-ever Estonian team had collaborated with Aalto-Helsinki team, we were glad to be contacted by this year’s team and continue the tradition. Besides sharing some useful tips and advices on our projects during the Skype meetings, we decided to collaborate on public engagement. On the 22nd of September, members from the Estonian team traveled all the way from Tartu to Helsinki to help us during our exhibition at Heureka. At Heureka, they brought their fun games about synthetic biology and explained their project to visitors. On the 28th of September, some of us went to Estonia and took part in the AHHAA science fair where the Tartu_TUIT team was engaging the general public, and the children in particular, with a play-based learning approach. We also took part in this by explaining our plasmid game to AHHAA visitors. It was great to be able to meet the team in person and we think that both our human outreach activities benefited from gaining a more international perspective!

The UCL iGEM team was also working with silk protein this year. We had had several Skype meetings with them in which we discussed the challenges we encountered while producing and purifying the silk protein and talked about strategies on how to pull fibers out of it. In particular, it was very helpful to discuss purification methods, considering the advantages and disadvantages of using heat to lyse cells or isolating the protein using the His-tag instead. We also discussed about which E. coli strains would be more suitable for cloning and producing the protein and ended up using different production chassis"

The University
Calgary is a city located 100 kilometers east of the Rocky Mountains in the southern part of Alberta, Canada. With a population of just over 1.2 million people, Calgary is the fifth largest metropolitan area in Canada. Due to large oil and agriculture industries, Calgary has the strongest economy in Canada. Ranked the cleanest city on earth by the Mercer Global Report and one of the five most livable cities on earth, Calgary is currently the second fastest growing city in North America.
Located in the northwest quadrant of the city, the University of Calgary, established in 1966, is quickly becoming one of the top universities in Canada. With over 30 000 students enrolled in 14 faculties, the university boasts over 30 research institutions and centers and 140 000 alumni. Research is one of the University of Calgary’s top priorities as the school aims to be one of the top five research institutions in Canada by the university’s 50th anniversary in 2016.

For example, B would induce the production of the integrase, Bxb1.
$$ \begin{align*} \frac{d[B]}{dt} &= \alpha_B - d_{B} [B] \\ \frac{d[Bxb1]}{dt} &= \alpha_{Enz} \frac{[B]^n}{K_{B}^n + [B]^n} - d_{Bxb1} [Bxb1] \end{align*} $$
Production Module
Here, outputlogic is the output of the XOR logic gate, factorized in one term for simplicty's sake. For more information on this function, see the XOR gate modeling page .
$$\begin{align*} \frac{d[Enz]}{dt} &= output_{logic} - d_{Enz} [Enz] \\ \frac{d[B]}{dt} &= \alpha_B \frac{[Enz] [A]}{K_d + [A]} - d_{B} [B] \end{align*} $$
Simulations
We implemented this solution in our whole-cell model . As no parameters were known, we assumed their values to be in the range of standard rates. The results indicate that the system could work, the next step would be to test this prediction experimentally.

(Expansión, 2010).
How our solution is compatible with solution key points extracted from both UN’s page and World Economic Forum:
Enforce and strengthen legislation to stop marine litter (UN, 2017).-     Invest in research to develop non-toxic material (UN, 2017).-  PHA is biodegradable: it is used by bacteria as carbon storage so producers can eat it under food deprivation conditions.
Circular economy (WEF, 2016) - Two main proposals: the first using a waste from Tequila production (Agave bagasse) as carbon source. Agronomy is another consideration since there is not just one type of Agave in Mexico, and other types are used for production of different beverages. Our project can be easily adapted to fit them as well, having more national reach...
Not using fossil fuels for the production of plastic (WEF, 2016): since the source of our bioplastic does not come from fossil fuels, the carbon footprint is drastically reduced.
It is important to know that our solution applies to our context but our production processes can be modified to suit necessities of other countries, e.g. sugar bagasse or other residual vegetal sources. The important thing to notice is that our process is more environmentally friendly in several stages (please check our environmental analysis).
Engage with local, national and/or international communities:
We engaged and formed a collaboration with CIATEJ (Jalisco’s Center for Research and Assistance in Technology and Design) for the IGEM project.
We’ve made several visits to Tequila industries in Jalisco to discuss our project and their main concerns within bagasse disposals. These includes El tequileño, Camarena, Saro, Tequilera El Olvido, and El triángulo, all national producers within our state.
We’ve attended the COP8MOP13  from the UN Biodiversity Conferences in Cancún, México where we formed Youth Biotech and our cluster for the PHAgave iGEM Team Tec GDA.
Youth Biotech, an international association that focuses on science communication, science regulation and science development. Under the science development track we founded the PHAgave project and we have been carrying out our public engagement activities through this platform since then.
We’ve hosted Science Communication events such as #SynbioLIVE in collaboration with ISGP’s The Forum and supported by Cornell Alliance for Science, which was an all live-online event for the general public which discussed synthetic biology as a"

Introduction to Human Practices
A big part of synthetic biology is all about being aware of how the science is being perceived by the public. In the Synthetic Biology Dialog it was found that the public have a particular interest in the day-to-day lives of synthetic biologists. We wanted to open up our lab experience to the public with our blog, vlog, presence at open day, presenting at the Glasgow Science Centre and our ""Life in the Lab"" time lapse videos.
We also engaged with companies with potential interest in our project by sending them letters to gage their view on synthetic biology. We endeavoured to make future iGEM experiences easier by providing a booklet that we aim to have shipped out with the starter kits by next year, and writing a brief introduction ""Advise for the first time modeller"".
It is important for us to be aware of whether our project is seen as interesting, confusing or even frightening to members of the public without scientific training. Based on feedback we can then convey information in an accessible manner, that can develop interest, expand understanding or allay fears as necessary.
Throughout our project we maintained a twitter account, regular video-logs (which are available on youtube) and one member of our team has been keeping an honest blog on the Life Sciences of Scotland website about her experiences with iGEM.
We also maintained a stop-motion camera operating in the lab. This was partly for allowing people to keep track of what we'd been up to during the day; and also partly because it's incredibly fun to watch a sped up version of yourself tearing around a lab - performing science at break-neck speed, whilst still observing all the safety protocols!
Another thing to keep in mind is that public presence is not just for the benefit of the general public. Through use of directed feedback, it also has some genuine implications for keeping a project relevant, ideas for future applications cohesive and a beleaguered iGEM team motivated!
To that end, we've undertaken a"

XMU-China iGEM
The iGEM team XMU-China provided information from iGEMers all over the world. We participated by providing our project presentation and survey.
Survey
For iGEM competition, knowing people points of view and ways of understanding allows the improvement of projects. Survey is the most common way to recollect data and information. Our team created its own survey about PLA and also filled surveys of other teams like iGEM Manchester , TecCEM Collegiate , IONIS or Purdue .
The Virginia iGEM team created and shared a survey about Biocontainment. Our team completed this survey and earned this wonderful badge!
We received this awesome badge from Paris-Saclay team for answering the questionnaire about synthetic biology and CRISPR-cas9 system.

We really appreciate LZU-China’s help in 2015’s iGEM competition. LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp"

We were able to successfully express our fusion csgA-CBD protein using this composite part on a pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. We then purified the resulting csgA-CBD protein using standard his-tag purification protocols on Ni-NTA resin spin columns, followed by isoelectric precipitation. The final pure protein product tied for the strongest bonding strength on a mycelium substrate out of the proteins we tested, and had the best ratio of strength on mycelium to strength on cardboard.

Azobenzene
Azo Benzene Experiments
After learning the theory behind Azo-Benzene, and modeling the behavior of cells combined into a bio-film by it, we decided to step into the wet-lab.  This was not very easy, as we have not found any previous attempts to test the effects of AB on bacteria. However, guided by our simulations, we knew that a positive result would be clearly visible to an OD-meter, and maybe even to the naked eye. Since there is no existing protocol, and since there are many different variables to be changed (the frequency of excitation, the amount of light in the excitation, the concentration of Azo-Benzene, the initial OD of the bacteria, and the concentration of EDC), we decided to use a high-throughput experimental system. At the center of our system was a TECAN made Freedom EVO® wet-lab robot:
We programmed the robot to fill several 96-well plates, so that the conditions of each of the wells will be different. We then activated the AB in the different wells to different degrees, using different wavelengths. When presenting the results of a high-throughput experiment, there is clearly a tradeoff between the number of data-points presented, and the amount of data that can be conceivably presented per data-point. That is why we have chosen three main techniques of obtaining data, going from the high resolution to the many data-points:
Microscopic Imaging
Initially, we just grew the bacteria with/without AB, and shone light on it. We then took deposits of cells from the bottom of the wells, and imaged them using a microscope. We also used a function of the micro-scope called a z-stack, which takes several images while changing the focal point in between. Using this function, we can see the three-dimensionality of the constructs imaged by the microscope.
These results are clearly in agreement with the model which predicts very large clusters containing thousands of cells, which brought us to the next step:
High-Resolution Plate Reader Imaging
At the end of an experiment where we grew cells on one plate with AB and on another without, we noticed that both the plates with AB and the ones without had large deposits of cells at the bottom of plate, but that their shapes were different: in the plate without AB, we saw round symmetric deposits for an a plate left in an incubator, and crescent shaped sediments for a plate that was left on the workbench. Meanwhile in the plate with AB we saw that all the deposits had the same shape - one or"

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#HumanPractice#freedthefrogs_-_-_TEXT.html," would prefer that animal experimentation is done on rats rather than on cats on the simple basis that rats are disgusting and cats are cute. This is a case of speciesism.
Tom Regan is the most radical of the three authors we will present here. His approach is part of a deontological way of thinking ethics. This involves a clear definition of what is good and what is bad based with which you can’t negotiate. A basic statement reflecting a deontological approach would the commandment “You shall not murder”. Tom Regan considers that each subject-of-a-life has an intrinsic value. For this reason it is morally wrong to consider animals “as supplies at our disposal, to be eaten, to be subjected to surgical experiments or to be exploited or money or sports” . The only way according to Tom Regan for the animal condition to evolve towards a more respectable treatment is to give them a special place in the law. Hence, T. Regan defends the concept of animal rights, a quite radical concept, the only one that could help establishing a coherent and rational justice with regards to the foundation of justice. Indeed, according to the author, a theory of justice based on the capacity of reasoning and talking would exclude from its realm children and some of the most handicapped people. Concerning our subjects, animal experimentation and animal biotechnologies, T. Regan would defend an abolitionist position that can’t be debated in reason of his deontological perspective.
Though the title of Peter Singer’s book, Animal Liberation, may seem quite aggressive it is far more moderate than Regan’s theory. Peter Singer develops a utilitarian theory in the continuation of Bentham. P. Singer doesn’t want to mix justice with morality, talking about “animal rights” doesn’t mean much to him as rights have to be link with duties and responsibilities: animals can’t fulfill them. Neither can children nor strongly handicapped people, this is why they have tutors, people responsible for them. Nevertheless, P. Singer still defends a form of equality between human and non-human animals, which is called an equality of interest. This theory is based on the ability for animals to feel pain, to the interest of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. Hence we have to do our best to respect those interests. This means reducing animal experimentation, breeding cows and pigs in good conditions, forbidding bullfight and other cruel games involving animals. But equality of interest doesn’t mean equality of life value or equality of treatment. Some species have more interests than others, for example they need forms of society, communication etc. As the principle is too privilege the maximum of interests,"

Making an Elastin Mimetic
Elastin fibers are insoluble even in hot, basic solution, but they are made up of identical, soluble tropoelastin monomers. These monomers are defined by a pentapeptide repetitive motive, Val-Pro-Gly-X-Gly, which is responsible for many of elastin’s properties, in addition to lysine-based cross-linking domains. The intrinsically random and modular structure of tropoelastin makes it suitable for production via circular mRNA. While most mRNA represents the entire sequence of a protein and proceeds linearly from start codon to stop codon, this is not an absolute requirement for translation. Work by the 2014 and 2015 Gifu IGEM teams showed the efficacy of an mRNA circularization device, which could be used to produce translated protein product when a complete coding sequence was enclosed. In addition, they demonstrated that without a stop codon translation would occur for multiple rounds of the same coding sequence with eventual random termination of translation. This process was adapted to produce long tropoelastin-like monomers using a subset of human tropoelastin exons representing alternating cross-linking and coacervation domains, replicating many of the properties which make tropoelastin both interesting and useful.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," MIDAS-11 can reduce gold ions without external reducing agent, but also A3 and its fusion with Flg. AuNP almost showed no signs of aggregation in the presence of A3 peptide (Fig 2A) (8). In the latter paper there was lack of experimental controls and the experiments were carried only in one buffer. Even the conclusions were stated incorrectly predicting that A3 peptide directly interacts with gold ions, however no further evidences were found. Later on, it was showed that actually A3 requires external reducing agent HEPES buffer () and the peptide was described as nonreducing inhibitor, which caps the formed AuNP and prevents aggregation (9). Furthermore, modelling was used in order to understand the importance of each amino acid in A3 peptide for AuNP binding. Following simulations showed 4 regimes called diffusive, anchoring, crawling and binding. In addition specific amino acids responsible for each of them (except the diffusive regime, because it is thought to be random) were characterized (Fig 2B). Also, the comparison between other AuNP capping peptides revealed compositional similarities, which could be used later on for further designing of the active peptides (10).
Overall, all of the three mentioned peptides have low pI and are capable of stabilising AuNP by interacting with them and electrostatically repelling the other peptide covered nanoparticles at neutral pH (6, 8). This prevents them from aggregation; otherwise during the AuNP formation process random agglomeration would occur causing huge variations in sizes. Electrostatics could potentially be used to avoid interaction of nanoparticles with the bacterial plasma membrane, which was shown to be the key in toxicity process (13).
Fig 1. The structure of delftibactin. Relatively complex molecule containing various ring structures as well as modified side chain and the only similarity with the peptides is amide bonds.

The simulation studies predicted the behaviour of the A3 peptide in the solution containing gold nanoparticles and showed the conformational changes during the binding process (B).
We decided to make various fusions of MIDAS-2 and A3 peptides (MIDAS-11 was left as alternative and not used) and express them only when the gold ions are present (incorporate as responsive element in the gold sensing part). Thus, in the presence of gold the transcription is induced of our synthetic operon controlled by promoter PgolT/S and production of the peptides begins. Additionally, N"

5) The plate was set again into the platereader, where we ran it for 12 hours with continous shaking. Optical density measurements were made every ten minutes.
Results
Data was produced in triplicate via the 96 well plate. This graphic shows the mean over the three data points for the measurements taken every 10 minutes, with the exception of the 250 uM curve for which only two data points were available for the time evolution. The values on the y-axis are optical density (OD) at 600nm, while the x-axis represents time. The curves indicate that maximal lysis is produced with 500 uM IPTG, and that lesser degrees of lysis can be obtained with smaller doses of IPTG.
The dose-response graph above was also made using triplicate data. This time, the functional T7-lysis plasmid (C2) was tested against two negative controls: a T7-RFP plasmid (which should only fluoresce, not lyse) and a plasmid containing a non-functional lysis cassette driven by a T7 promoter (C11). The points of each curve are the OD values of each replicate averaged over the last hour of the experiment. For the lysis plasmid we observed a strong lysis response with increasing IPTG concentrations. Both controls show no significant change in endpoint OD in respect to IPTG concentration.

Shipment of Geraniol Synthase with iGEM Nagahama
The University of Nagahama iGEM’s team requested parts from our team.  After we received their request after the team we determined the best way to send the desired part.   It was interesting to learn to communicate with this team due a difference in language. We also provided them with much needed guidance on who to ensure proper use of parts, how to amplify the gene and clone it into E. coli Additional information on the processes used to determine how to ship the objects can be found on the safety section.
Biosafety
The University of Georgia iGEM Team was contacted by the Nagahama iGEM team in request as the geraniol synthase gene. Our team was happy to oblige their request and send them this part, however our advisor warned us of the many regulations in sending genetically modified organism. Early on, the team decided to learn more about the rules and regulation regarding the shipment of genetic information. The team first discovered that some shipments must be marked by category if they are to be shipped from the United States. The level for sending a recombinant organism would be classified as a “Level A” shipment, which was highly regulated and controlled.  With access to a limited budget and due to time constraints the team decided that the best way to send the part was by sending just the Geraniol Synthase Gene. The researchers also contacted iGEM Headquarter and learned that they were able to simply mail the dry DNA samples.
The iGEM team interest was piqued and we set out to learn more about the rules and regulations concerning the shipment of genetically modified organisms. Our first source was the Office of Biosafety at the University of Georgia. Therefore, researchers must become a certified shipper in order to mail genetically recombinant organisms.  Patricia Cooke, a representative from the Office of Biosafety gave us some answers to the questions we were looking for. First she told us that it would be much more feasible to send the DNA versus sending the parts within a chassis.  She also stated that these issues are very important because of a need for the safety of not only scientists but the entire community because some of these organisms can be extremely dangerous and could be used malevolently if obtained by the “wrong person.”
We felt that the issues brought up by her were quite interesting and that a greater dialogue should be had about the rules and regulations regarding"

What we did
We used standard parts from the Registry from the Gronigen Team (K190015: ArsR-regulated promoter) and the Endy Lab (E0840: GFP-generator) and from the MIT 2006 Team (J45119: Wintergreen generator).  We made two composite parts with the ArsR-regulated promoter and the GFP-generator or the Wintergreen generator.  We then joined them together to make our device which scientifically detects arsenic by a green fluorescent glow and warns about arsenic with a wintergreen smell, in case you don't have any scientific equipment.

The objective of our project was to build a population-encoding galactose sensor with the ability to measure and store the concentration level at one specific time-point. The temporal selectivity of the sensor was achieved by light-induced conformational changes of Dronpa, which is a monomeric fluorescence protein. Its fluorescence is activated by violet light (400nm) and deactivated by cyan light (500nm). Dronpa tetramerizes in the fluorescing 'ON'-state. [Zhou2012]
We utilized Dronpa’s behavior to introduce light-dependent regulation to Cre monomers, which tetramerize to a recombinase complex. In our chassis, the Cre recombinase deletes RFP, which prevents the transcription of a luciferase reporter. The mechanism of our sensor is the galactose dependent expression of Dronpa (in the ON state), which after the exposure to 500nm light no longer inhibits the recombinase. Consequently, a Cre-Lox recombination deletes RFP, which activates the reporter.
A recombinase event could be considered a stochastic process, that depends on the Cre concentration and on the time span in which it was active. Because the concentration of Dronpa and of the linked Cre is determined by the galactose concentration, the change in luciferase activity in a population is a measure of the galactose concentration at the time point of 500nm light exposure.
Figure 1: Overview of the chassis
Figure 1: The dynamic species and their interactions in the model
Our model is based on the constructs pGAL - NLS - Dronpa - Cre-Dronpa and PADH - RFP - Luciferase. The variable parts of the model are depicted in the upper diagram. We assume that the PADH mediated expression and the overall Dronpa concentration are constant.

We implemented a quick and cheap prescreening.
We improved a barcoding tool to allow for multiplexing of samples.
Approach
As a team we highly value responsible research. Therefore, we wanted to make sure our project is responsible from the start till the end and beyond. To ensure a highly responsible project, we made our project pass through the phases that constitute Responsible Research and Innovation according to Stilgoe et al. (2013) , i.e. anticipation, inclusion, reflection, and responsiveness.
The dimension of anticipation focuses on researchers investigating what is known, what is possible and what is likely in the field. This includes scenario building, making an assessment of their plausibility through interaction with experts as well as the general public, and the stimulation of an open and multidisciplinary collaboration. This we did through surveys, train debates, and through visiting conferences to learn about developments in the field and to make connections.
Subsequently, inclusion targets the process of open innovation and user-centered design. It focuses on transparency and collectively challenging regulations and standards. Grove-White et al. (2000) argue that the public conversation should stretch further to include the debate on future social worlds, while critically rethinking the ‘social constitutions’ inherent to the technological choices – that is, the ethical, political and social implications of the development. This we did during inclusion processes as the train debates and the expert discussion in Stirling.
Throughout the project, the process of reflexivity has continuously been going on. We are used to professional self-reflexivity during the complete product development process. Our team continuously challenged our detection and we even had an intra-team detection method hacking challenge. However, as was stated by Wynne et al. in 1993, responsibility makes reflexivity into a public matter too. According to Stilgoe et al. (2013) reflexivity demands scientists to publically combine their scientific and moral responsibilities. This has been a prominent focus from the choice of our topic till our final design as can be seen from our interaction with the many stakeholders involved and the design requirements we derived from that.
Lastly, we responded to all stakeholder input by making a value sensitive"
UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence from the copper plasmid when induced in a 100 uM concentration of copper. For the banana project, we attempted to ligate the T7 promoter to TLP, but it was not successful. There was no detectable TLP on the gel from the TLP+Hly plasmid. We attempted to run a copper fluorescence assay, but the procedure was performed incorrectly so the data had to be thrown out. We tested the phIF controlled GFP expression with salicylate since it has similar effects to fusaric acid ( without killing the cells). However, the results weren't significantly different between the induced and uninduced samples so we will need to redo the experiment.
October 2- October 8
This week, we attempted to ligate the TLP with our promoter and ligate the Copper plasmid with the Lead and Zinc plasmids. Unfortunately, the TLP ligation was unsuccessful. We miniprepped the copper plasmid to check to make sure that it was completed. We tested the phIF+GFP part with salicylate. We received samples from William and Mary from their project to test and we sent them our copper plasmid. We made some new agar plates in preparation for their samples. Unfortunately, our fluorescence testing was delayed due to factors out of our control so we didn’t get to complete it this week. We also went to another nearby high school to talk to them about synthetic biology and introduce them to the concepts. This weekend is the Farmer’s Market and another meeting with BUGSS. We hope to talk to farmers about some of the work we did in relation to the banana project. We are also starting to put things together onto the website and compiling our research from the summer. Our LaunchUMD page was confirmed to launch soon to help us fundraise more money.
October 9- October 14
We sequenced some of our plasmids this week using GeneWiz. We also started producing overnights for our constitutive TLP and normal competent cells to look for the expression of TLP using a Western blot. Once again, we tried to ligate the T7 promoter with the TLP plasmid. We made overnights of the cas9-RFP plasmid. We didn’t have a lab meeting this week because many of our members were out visiting the WSSC. We received a positive inducible control of TLP as well as a conjugated antibody for the Western blot so it got pushed back until the next week.

Protocol of chip-based XFP degradation rate detection in E.coli.
First of all, E.coli will be measured after shaking to about OD2.0（600）in the chip which was washed by plasma water, vacuum pumping. The bacteria liquid was pushed into the chip, letting the cells enter the small triangle. Then use the constant flow pump culture medium into chip (the laboratory constant temperature, can not guarantee the training environment, 37°E. coli slower growth). The medium speed is about 200ul/h. Finally we test the data after yeast fulled in the triangles.Using the IPTG medium, the new RFP expression was stopped and we can regard the lights as degradation tags' efficiency.

Project: ANN
Artificial neural networks offer powerful tools for pattern recognition, discriminant analysis and machine learning.  Originally developed as a model of human cognitive activity, artificial neural networks have been adopted by  statistical modelers for their capacity to partition high-dimensional parameter spaces and ""learn"" to classify inputs through teaching and reinforcement.  The massively parallel nature of artificial neural networks have provided motivation to implement them in-vitro rather than in-silico.  Indeed, steps toward in vitro implementation have been taken by a number of previous iGEM teams.  We hope to improve upon these efforts.
In particular, we wish to provide tools for the construction of a multi-layer feed forward net with back-propagation of error.  Owing to the parallel nature of the net, implementation must consist of the development of a single computational unit along with the processes by which units can be rationally composed.  Such a project will require the completion of several subtasks.
The first item is the acceptance of input by the user.  We intend to employ cellular signaling mechanisms for communicating with the input layer.  Between network layers, we intend to employ the addressible conjugation method developed by Berkeley 2006.After input has been received by a node in a given layer of the net, it must be weighted, summed, and fed through a non-linear threshold function.  Weighting may be accompolished by molecular AND gates which limit the expression of the input protein to levels which may be governed by the concentrations of ""weighting proteins"" within the cell.  Summing and thresholding may then be naturally accomplished by cellular metabolism.  Output may be given to the user through the expression of fluorescent  proteins.  Lastly, back-propagation of error may be accomplished by separate channels of addressing plasmids which up- or down-regulate rates of conjugation in the previous layer.
The above constitutes an ambitious program which may exceed the scope of the summer.  We wish to focus our efforts upon techniques for parallel, asynchronous addressible conjugation, especially so as to permit input from multiple nodes in the previous layer and allow computation of multiple input instances through a"

XJTLU-CHINA,2016,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#Interlab_-_-_TEXT.html," In the formal experiment, 5 devices with replication and blank were pipetted into 96-well plates to obtained OD600 and fluorescence data from plate reader. However, we only have transparent and black 96-well plates, therefore we doubled everything from the protocol in this experiment: we used 20ml medium and take 200uL cultures every time - 100ul for transparent plate to measure OD600 and 100ul for black plate to measure fluorescence. In addition, our incubator can only reach maximum 190rpm so we use 190rpm to incubate the cultures.
Results

Figure.2 Absolute fluorescence measurement of devices 1 to 3, as well positive control and negative control. Each group have two repetitions.
Figure.3 Relative fluorescence measurement, plotted base on OD600 measurement and Absolute fluorescence measurement
Discussion
OD600 measurement displays the characteristic of cell growth, which shows exponential growth from 1 hour to 4 hour. No atypical points appear as well.
Absolute fluorescence also exhibits the same motif as OD600 as the fluorescence intensity grows exponentially during 1 hour to 4 hour. However, the fluorescence intensity decreases from the fifth hour. Two message from this picture should be attention. First, there is an atypical data point at the fifth hour of device 2 replicate 2 which may due to operation mistake or mechanical error. Second, except the atypical point, both repetition of device 2 show a higher fluorescence density than the device 1 throughout the time scale revealed by the plot. These phenomena will be discussed later.
In relative fluorescence measurement, device 2 shows a higher relative fluorescence than device 1 as the. Device 3 has the lowest relative fluorescence among the three devices. These characteristics can also be observed at the plot of absolute fluorescence.
Before starting the exam, we have made a hypothesis of the difference of fluorescence intensity of three devices from documented promoter strength. Based on the promoter stringency, we think that devices one, which embedded the strongest promoter should have the highest absolute fluorescence. Device 3, which promoter is the weakest among the three devices, should have lowest absolute fluorescence. Though indeed the device 3 exhibited the lowest absolute fluorescence, absolute fluorescence of device 2 is higher than device 1. First we thought that we might got device 1 and 2 mixed up however we sequenced the strains we used and made sure that we have correctly transformed those cultures. Therefore, in our experiment the devices two did exhibited higher absolute"

CRISPR key deletion
Another biological security layer is provided by our key deletion    system. We have been working on two different approaches. Here we are    presenting the second approach, which makes use of a CRISPRcas system    which will delete the key from the genome if no special treatment is    applied. Addition of Atc or tetracycline will stop the cas9 expression.
This system is highly flexible and biological layers can easily be    added or modified to the wishes of the use. An other goal of the    biological safety layer is to prevent the release of the genetically    modified bacteria carrying our encrypted message or key. The message    and key are integrated into the AmyE locus of the Bacillus subtilis genome, with the use of the BBa_K823023 B. subtilis integration vector    . (See integration) This is advantageous, because it has been    demonstrated that the amyE locus can be deleted by using the    CRISPR/Cas9 system [1] .
The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat    (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems are a part of the bacterial adaptive    immune system. Recently a genome editing tool has been designed based    on a type II CRISPR/Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes [2] . The    CRISPR-Cas system needs an additional sequence next to the protospacer    to distinguish the difference between it’s own DNA and “foreign” DNA.    This sequence is the protospacer adjacent motif, also known as PAM    sequence. [3] The PAM motif is essential for cleavage and makes sure    that nearly any DNA can be targeted by crRNA, assisted by    trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) cas9 to bind to the protospacer with    the PAM sequence and cleaves the double-strand DNA (dsDNA). The fusion    of crRNA and tracrRNA is sgRNA. [4]

The highest OD600 is associated with the lowest volume with values of 2.63, 2.42 and 1.89 using the 12 well plate,   24 well plate and 48 well plate, respectively.    Irrespective of volume, the highest OD600 values were reached using the 12 well plate. Specifically,    the OD600 value of 2.27 using 3 mL in the 12 well plate is still higher than the OD600 value of    2.03 using 1 mL in the 24 well plate.    After determining the best plate and volume to perform cultivations with, we investigated the influence of the rpm by    cultivating three biological replicates at 500, 600, and 700 rpm in the 12 well plate in 1 mL cultivation volume.
Figure 2: Growth curves of the three replicates of E.coli BL21 (DE3) in    LBCM25 at 350, 500, 600, and 700 rpm, respectively. The DNA concentration was measured under the optimal condition     of 600 rpm and 1 mL volume.
Cultivation at 600 rpm yields the highest OD600 with a value of about 4.96 after 6.5 h.     If the rpm is further increased, the cells grow badly due to an out of phase movement of the media.     We finally concluded that the perfect cultivation conditions are reached in a 12 well plate with a total volume     of 1 mL and shaking with 600 rpm.   For analysis of the retention and preservation of the unnatural base pair, the isolation of a sufficient amount of    plasmid DNA from the culture is important. In order to evaluate the plasmid concentration during the cultivation,    we cultivated at 600 rpm on a 12 well plate in 1 mL. We inoculated the wells with a starting OD600 of 0.1 and    conducted a plasmid isolation using 1 mL for each measurement. The highest DNA concentration was reached in the exponential   phase at a OD600 of 2.75 with about 2.5 µg/µl plasmid isolated from 1 mL culture.

Their Response
Hi ATOMS Turkiye,
For the first question, we will introduce our gene construct to the bacteria before hand and then introduce it to the host bee via food (a process called paratransgenesis), so it is highly unlikely for the other bacteria to get this part. Also, our system is optimized for b. subtilis, the promoters we used and the products as a whole have slim to no chance of functioning anywhere else.
For the second question, the bacillus strain we selected is native to the bees' gut. It is normally not found in the honey stomach of the bee, even if the bacteria were to get into honey, it will still be in the natural levels. Other than that, according to literature, IPTG is never traced in honey, so our little germs, even if they can make it into honey, will be killed because of our kill switch.
The third question was a hard one because there is actually no real data about the p-coumaric acid levels let alone it is not known if such a thing as p-coumaric acid overdose exists. We used in our system a constitutive promoter for the production of it too. What we expect and what we could argue from literature is that having p-coumaric acid is in all cases preferable. Maybe exceeding levels could cause increased energy consumption and maybe even acid accumulation, a decrease in tyrosine(a precursor of p-coumaric acid) etc. What most probably will happen (and what we actually hope for) is that the natural feedback mechanism will be triggered and control the process. But you are right, a inductive system would have been prettier :)
For the last question, p-coumaric acid is mostly produced by plants. Even vanilla production and cinnamon flavour begins with p-coumaric acid. Many plants produce p-coumaric acid so p-coumaric acid exposure should not cause any harm to them. Besides, p-coumaric acid will be produced in the midgut of the bee, so it is unlikely for p-coumaric acid to find its way directly to the plant.
Kind regards,

Promotion
The past couple of weeks we have been filming for our first crowdfunding promotion. Working with the Media Department of Leiden University, we are sure the result will be amazing. In August                                                           our crowdfunding will be launched, so stay tuned for more updates!
Working in the lab
In order to start our lab work as efficiently as possible we have made sure that the lab and all the equipment are ready for us to get to work the coming weeks. The materials and disposables                                                           are on their way, the DNA-primers have been ordered and some early enthusiasts have prepared the first batches of competent cells. From the 9th of July until the end of August it will only be lab work, more lab work and even more labwork. Wish us luck!
Human Practices
 
Working in the field of Synthetic Biology comes with enormous responsibility. We feel the importance of thinking about the impact of our project on society. This is why we have planned to                                                           discuss                                                           our project with experts in the field of antibiotics. Besides the opinion of experts, we also find it important to make people aware of the problem that we are facing, which is antibiotic resistance.                                                           We try to attend as much events as possible and inform visitors in a fun way about synthetic biology and how we can use it in our battle against bacteria. Come visit us at one of our upcoming                                                           events                                                           and share your opinion on synthetic biology!
In the spotlight
The past month we have attended several events. Here we have been introducing the broader public to our project and to Synthetic Biology in general. To make the subject more comprehensible we                                                           have offered them the opportunity to draw with bacteria. This                                                           resulted in some very beautiful pictures. On the left  you can see some of the results from our visit to UTwente. Interested?

Wednesday 5/8
Today we raised sample’s concentration to run the gel electrophoresis in the final step. Joy mingling with surprise, we found that both PDE5A and GUCY1B3 were expressed in the cells. DNA strips stained by GV could be seen clearly.
Friday 7/8
Today we tested two methods of extract cGMP. The two methods were repetitive freeze-thawing and lysate.  From the test result, we found that repetitive freeze-thawing extracting cGMP was more effective. And we also used sodium nitroprusside to treat cells but it cannot enhance the cGMP concentration.
Saturday 8/8
Today we invited SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX teams to sharing academic experience. And we began a two-day cultivation today. We have the following arrangement today: extracting the plasmid, enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis’s learning includes that how to make up the gel and how to recycle the gel. It’s our pleasure to share our experiment experience to members of high school team. We spent a beautiful day together.
Sunday 9/8
We taught SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX teams that transformation and coating plates. At last we exchanged our ideas about projects and gave some guidance to high school students. The two-day cultivation ended in a satisfactory way.
Monday 10/8
We redesigned the αsubunit primers. We did the experiment again to find out the optimal primer. We successfully found out the best primer by summing up the experience of previous mistakes. Everything goes smoothly today.
Thursday 13/8
We learned to use RT-PCR instrument from professor Ye Yanrui. The professor taught us seriously. We were grateful for him. At last, We put knowledge to practical usage. We set the PT-PCR condition first. And then put the solution into the instrument and start to run. After two hours waiting, the expression of gene had been detected. According to the diagram from the computer, we found that the results of three sample which were silenced gene PDE5A were satisfactory.
On the other side, we did the experiment of cell transfection, and we decided to evaluate the efficiency for eukaryotic cell transfection by using GFP as a report gene in common transfection ways.
Friday 14/8
We reported the effect of gene silence to our teacher. We found out some abnormal data in the diagram. Maybe"

Wilson Chun Pong HO
Wilson is a year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology student. His favourite things to do outside the lab include distance-running, eating and sleeping. He is not sure about what to do after graduation, maybe he will apply to be a firefighter, or pursue other things he is interested in.
Random Info
Wilson loves daydreaming. When he is doing so, he will sit there, do nothing, and think nothing. Sometimes it seems like he short-circuited.
Lynn Yuqi WANG
As a sophomore Biochemistry student, Lynn is a hard working girl with an optimistic attitude toward life. She has a good sense of humor that always makes her friends happy. Lynn plans to pursue further study in the US after graduating from HKUST, where she has her memorable university life.
Cherished Lab Memories
Lynn is in charge of using GC-MS to quantify fatty acid. However, during the sample preparation, she used droppers to absorb the organic layer together with some water into the tube. That caused the FA concentration measurement to be 0 after one day of waiting.
Satien WILIAWATY
Satien came from Jakarta, Indonesia and was born in 1994. This is her second year at HKUST. Her major is Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She loves watching movies, video editing, and singing. She joined iGEM because she wanted to learn more about synthetic biology. After HKUST, she might take further studies in the same field or a different field or maybe find a job. We never know what will happen in the future.
She loves to...

Input File Formatting
In order to run the program, the user has to provide a text file containing the sequences in need of optimization and/or primer design. Each sequence should be included on a separate line; any blank newline entries and spaces will result in a processing error. The sequences should also contain no other characters other than that representing nucleotides (A,T,G,C) or amino acids (G,A,L,M,F,W,K,Q,E,S,P,V,I,C,Y,H,R,N,D,T,*).
For protein optimization, sequences in the input file are not limited to only amino acid or nucleotide sequences--the user can input either and the program will recognize the sequence type and process it accordingly. This is limited however in cases"

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," cscB on extracellular sucrose concentrations against the wild-type when sucrose production is induced by saltwater.
Figure 3. CscB (sucrose symporter) pumps sucrose across the cell membrane using a proton gradient.
Promoter Biobricks
S. elongatus enters stationary phase, stopping replication, upon producing and secreting sucrose because carbon is redirected from growth [3]. Because this phenotype is unfavorable and easily selected out of our cyanobacteria, we aimed to induce sucrose production and secretion once S. elongatus has reached maximum cell density. Researchers such as Ducat et al. have used IPTG-inducible promoters; however, such promoters are leaky, and using IPTG is not cost-effective or easy to toggle in an industrial setting [3]. Additionally, despite S. elongatus being a model photosynthetic bacterium, there is a lack of characterized promoters in the registry.
We intended to characterize a variety of promoters in S. elongatus as BioBricks. These promoters will be valuable tools for the rest of the cyanobacteria synthetic biology community. We characterized the ferric ion repressible promoter associated with the idiA gene [7,8], the high-light inducible promoter of psbA2 [9], and strong constitutive promoters of cpcB native to S. elongatus and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [10]. We cloned these promoters into Dr. Golden’s promoterless luxAB vector pAM1414 (Addgene plasmid # 40237). Then, a luciferase assay was used to measure levels of expression.
Figure 4. Our regulatory promoters
Application of Novel Promoters
After characterizing the promoters as BioBricks, we intended to use them to induce sucrose production and secretion by combining them with our cscB and sps BioBricks. Using some of the aforementioned promoters in an industrial setting has numerous advantages. The ferric ion repressible promoters initiate transcription with high on-off ratios once iron concentrations fall below millimolar thresholds [7,8]. Since iron is a micronutrient in our cyanobacteria’s BG-11 media, this is easily tunable. We can adjust the concentration of the media such that iron is completely exhausted upon reaching maximum cell density, which would trigger sucrose production.
Alternatively, the psbA2 promoter would make sucrose production easy to toggle. It is only expressed when S. elongatus is exposed to ¼ peak sunlight intensity or greater (roughly 500 µmoles photons/s/m^2"

The Goal
All images were taken by Team UAlberta with the consent of our interviewees.
UAlberta 2018 wanted to create a project centred on our community. We did this by choosing to address an issue which was brought to our attention by an individual in our community, and by keeping stakeholders and their input involved in all aspects of our project. This was primarily done through interviews, where we asked not only for their expertise on the issue of Nosema and the practice of beekeeping but also questions about how we could improve our project, to best suit them. These interviews and what we learned from them are collated in our documentary.
""By interviewing dozens of beekeepers, we were able to come to understand the full scope of their community. We designed a project that took into account what would work best for their lifestyles."".
For example, beekeepers expressed to us that they wanted a product that could be applied similarly to  Fumagilin -  a previous treatment for Nosema. As a result we developed our project in a way that would potentially allow us to feed our construct to bees, mimicking the application method for fumagillin.
Ultimately, Team UAlberta has created a project with a “community first” approach. This has lead to all aspects of our project being shaped by the connections we have built with members of the Alberta beekeeping community.
The Stats
6 researchers contacted and worked with  Hundreds of beekeepers contacted 12 beekeepers interviewed 3 beekeeping associations worked with  The past producer of Fumagillin interviewed
How did we integrate what we learned?
At the beginning of the year team UAlberta knew that we wanted to work on a project that would be truly impactful in and outside of Alberta. Through our brain storming and preliminary research sessions, we realized that a project on bees would be the best way to do this. Our team was drawn to a project focused on bees; we are fearful of the negative impact that the loss of bees could have on people and the environment at large. More importantly, a project of this nature is was very applicable and meaningful in our direct community.
We decided we wanted to ensure that we were creating a project focused on two fronts: on the bees we were passionate about, and on our direct community that we wanted"
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," about two minutes before the deadline!  (Consuelo, Kara, and Veronica went to the BU user study today since I had a lot of writing to do.)  Also Wendy and i went to a Q&A session about our summer research experience hosted by Cathy Summa, director of the Science Center Research Program.  We talked about our experiences doing research in biology, neuroscience, and interdisciplinary computer science research.  Talking about the experience made me realize how much I treasure my time doing research in the HCI lab, and how that's completely changed my Wellesley experience and gave insight to my job search in the future.
Tuesday, 7/31: The main focus for today is the poster for the science center summer research program.  Since everyone else is busy coding and refining things we've picked up from the three sets of user studies, I'm in charge of making the MoClo/Synbio Search poster.  Today the focus was really on finding the right words to put on the poster, and iterating both the design and the content of the poster.  It's been a very, very long day and I'm only on version 9 of the poster...
Wednesday, 8/1: Still working on the poster, but making a lot of progress!  The content of the poster is mostly done- I just had to do a lot of formatting and small, detailed editting before we are to print it this afternoon.  :)  I think everyone is supposed to be also working on what they need to say for the science center poster session.
Thursday, 8/2: Summer poster session was today!  Our lab shirts also arrived today!  It was super exciting getting to try the green things on- the design was really cute, and the shirts themselves extremely comfortable.  It was definitely interesting looking at our research and the amount of progress we've made over the summer and compare it to my peers' research.  It made me realize how much collaboration and interdisciplinary dialogue occurs in this lab for the project to happen, and also made me realize how grateful I am for being to participate in cutting-edge synthetic biology and computer science research.
Preparing to go to the SciCenter Poster Presentation.
Friday, 9/3: Looking up background information and pulling up relevant writing to MoClo Planner today for Orit's ITS Demo.

Northwestern
The iGEM team at Northwestern worked on OMVs as part of their project, and we had a Skype meeting with them to discuss their applications of OMVs and how these can be used with our system.
EPFL
We met the EPFL iGEM team at the Open Plant Forum where we learned that they were also working towards using a cell-free system. Instead of working in a living system like we did, EPFL worked directly with cell-free lysates for their project, so were willing to have a meeting with us to discuss how they made their lysates and used them giving us a better understanding about how to apply cell-free lysates to our own system.
McMaster II
The McMaster II iGEM team ran molecular dynamic simulations of our system. They simulated the SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) interaction in a 300 ns all-atom MD simulation and calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for all residues; this information allowed us to determine the stability of the ST/SC interaction. As we were unable to test the ST/SC interaction in vivo, McMaster’s collaboration was invaluable in helping us assess the functionality of our composite OMV circuit. Please refer to our Design page for the RMSD graph and last few ns of the simulation.
In return, we gave the McMaster advice on how to create a MATLAB scripts for kinetic modeling.

SynBio-Day
Due to strong ecological / organic movements in Tübingen’s population any bioscientific ventures will be considered rather critically at first. Especially genetic engineering projects are very problematic in this environment. At last year’s SynBio-Day we noticed that there are many misconceptions about genetics and molecular /cell biology and that many opponents of genetic engineering were not very well informed about both, biology in general (many people thought for example that sausages and tofu do not contain DNA) and genetic engineering in particular. In contrast, many individuals with extensive knowledge about biology and GMOs had a highly differentiated opinion about genetic engineering and were able to distinguish between green genetic engineering and other applications when questioned about their position. Last year, we met many people who proposed the application of genetic engineering especially for the synthesis of drugs and enzymes.
Having this correlation between opinion about GMOs and knwowledge in mind, we decided to establish a tradition for the iGEM-Team Tuebingen by again taking part at the nationwide SynBio-Day in order to inform the public about our work and synthetic and molecular biology itself. In the end, our main aim was to spark informed discussions between proponents and opponents of genetic engineering by giving both parties some basic knowledge about the methods and the scientific background of molecular / synthetic biology.
In order to achieve our aims we set up a small booth in Tübingen’s historic city center on a nice Saturday morning. Like last year, we had prepared a little quiz to test people’s basic knowledge about (synthetic) biology. Due to the upcoming federal elections in Germany many political parties were present nearby on Tübingen’s marketplace with their booths and their campaign workers thus many people were strolling through town and talking to politicians. Many passersby stopped at our booth and had a look at our posters and many people were curious to know why we (not being a political organization) had set up our booth. Discussions about our project and synthetic biology started quickly and over"

3/18/13
-KP Cholera Destroy Plan of attack- Get Vibrio Cholerae Grow Biofilm Find constructs from last year Test constructs against biofilm Construct our own biofilm destroyer to test out. Cholera Detect There is already a lot done from last year, so we need to test the constructs from last year. The first step is sequencing and then getting it into E. Coli. Just like the destroy group, we first need to start growing some Cholera. Big phage Need to do more research on what has already been done. One possible question is how to get a plasmid to form with medicine or something inside. Small Phage They are trying to decide which phage to use. They are going to grow phage and see if any mutations produce a smaller phage. They need to come up with a screening method. Here is what we need to do right now. We went to Dr. Robison’s lab and asked for a sample of cholera. We will return on Wednesday to pick it up. It is important that we can get the cholera to grow and produce biofilm. Next, we are looking through the work that the iGEM team did last year. We want to try some of their constructs on the biofilm to see if they actually work. We will also try some of our own ideas.
-KK Our priority list right now is: 1) Get cholera growing a biofilm, and 2) Test existing constructs from last year’s iGEM. We talked with Annette, Dr. Robison’s lab manager, and she promised us she would have a streak of cholera available for us by Wednesday. As soon as we get Cholera, we’re going to form a plan with Dr. Grose for how we can store it so as to not need to constantly ask Dr. Robison’s lab for cholera. On Wednesday we’ll begin to see if we can get cholera to grow biofilms. Today I looked over existing plasmid constructs. Apparently iGEMers from last year did clone many genes into plasmids but the plasmids aren’t yet in the registry. Since the plasmids have not been sequenced, that will be another priority on Wednesday. We also learned that Calgary in 2008 created “Champion,” a bacteria that sensed AHL and AI-2. They used colicin to succesfully eliminate “Bad Guy 1” (which I think is so tacky, and I struggled"

We were able             to attract this much attention for our project, because we""ve identified clear             niches in which our product would be able to easily outperform existing             technologies. We would love to give clear examples about these niches, but that             is not yet possible. Due to negotiations with ESA and an associate from             McKinsey, we are not able to disclose this information at this point. By the             time that we have made all arrangements, we will update the status of our             business case.

We choose TlpA36 since the original version showed bit intensive leakage at the temperature it supposed not to be turned on. Besides, we add TlpA39 (TlpA repressor respond at 39 degree Celsius) and Tcl42 (cI repressor respond to 42 degree Celsius) to the registry, giving the user more selective temperature for future users’ project.
The first thing we want to verify is its function at a different temperature, we assumed that there would be leakage since the promoter we choose for TlpA protein was not the strongest promoter. Then we need it to sense the change from high to low temperature since, in the real-world scenario, the temperature is higher in the fermenter than the environment. According to the previously assumed mechanism by previous researches, we assumed that the dimerized TlpA protein would block the expression of TlpA promoter. Later, since lethal gene needs to turn on when the temperature drops, so the signal should be inverted, we decided to use repressor to invert this. dCas9 system was first mentioned, but it did not fit in to our project since cytotoxicity was too high for overexpression, and if the expression of this repression drops, lethal gene might be expressed ahead; Then we came up with the idea of tetR family repressor, (Stanton et al.), but the energy cost is quite high, so we chose sRNA(Storz et al.) as the repressor. sRNA will consume far less energy than protein repressor, also as a single strand RNA, it is unstable, so when the expression is blocked, the derepression will be quite fast. sRNA mainly consists of three regions: Seed Region, antisense to the target mRNA; the Hfq binding region, which binds to the Hfq protein which can stabilize the sRNA-mRNA complex, waiting for RNase to degrade it; and a termination region, it is a terminator.
We designed six set of sRNA, with different seed regions (one for 5’UTR and one for Coding Sequence) and different Hfq binding regions.
We designed sRNA based on the sequence of our reporter gene, mNeonGreen and our selected RBS, J61101. We designed nine sRNA, synthesized 6 of them, characterized 3, finally we chose 1 to use it on our final circuit.
sRNAs include a seed region, which is the region antisense to the target sequence; an Hfq protein binding region; a termination region, to stop"

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we are studying meets the needs of current production and research?"". Therefore, we performed the cross-over analysis. The analysis results show that the majority of people who understand the use of both products believe that our intelligent metabolic pathways meet current needs, but need to be improved; while people who do not understand our products have listened to our explanations and believe that this intelligent metabolic pathway is in line with current needs very significantly,which also reflected that our publicity is very effective.
The Result of the Investigation
Do you think our method can meet the needs of current development and production?
22.55%: Very consistent, optimistic about the results
66.63%: Yes, but need constant improvement
7.84%: Does not fit well, need innovative design
0.98%: No consistent, new experimental routes need to be designed
The Result of the Investigation
Do you konw about the production and application of these two kinds of things?
46.08%: Do not know much about it
28.43%: Knowing little about it
21.57%: Knowing
3.92%: Knowing it well
We compared the answers of the same questions pre- and post- presentation. In fact, More people have realized that our intelligent metabolic approach is feasible, at least in terms of ideas that are very consistent with current needs.
In addition, many people expressed concerns about biosafety and the use of antibiotic, which will be showed in the pages of Human Practice and Safety.
The Result of the Investigation
What's your attitude towards the use of antibiotics?
47.06%: Expressing concern because antibiotics are overused at present
39.22%: It is necessary to use reasonably under normal supervision
12.75%: Expressing optimism and it can be used normally
0.98%: Must stop using it as it may produce super bacteria

Austin_Texas,2012,Team:Austin Texas#Spinach reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"- ex:587 em: 610nm), and the assumption was made that the construct was not performing as intended. The plate reader we first used had detection problems, and was not able to detect either fluorescence wavelength.  We tried another plate reader and were able to observe Spinach fluorescence over time, but mCherry fluorescence was not observed. We were only able to observe mCherry fluorescence when the cultures were grown in a shaking incubator and then measured in a plate reader. This lead to the hypothesis that low oxygen conditions that existed in the machine during fluorescence trials prevented maturation of the mCherry protein. Given the difficulty with quantifying the translational strength due to poor mCherry signal, it was decided that focus would be put on characterizing fluorescence of the Spinach aptamer + stabilizing tRNA scaffold by itself, and when produced attached to the 800 bp mCherry mRNA.
Data
The following graphs have been created from measuring Spinach Aptamer fluorescence at 501nm over time in a Tecan F 200 plate reader.
3' Spinach/mCherry Reporter
This graph shows the Spinach aptamer fluorescence of the 3' construct over time. This construct functioned very similarly to the 5' construct (picture below). As well, neither construct functioned well in terms of mCherry fluorescence.
5' Spinach/mCherry Reporter
Graph showing the Spinach aptamer fluoresence in the 5' construct.
Comparison of Spinach Aptamer by itself, 5' construct, and 3' construct in 200uM DFHBI.
This graph shows the comparison of the Spinach aptamer by itself, the 3', and 5' constructs. As depicted, the larger constructs that contained the ~800bp mCherry gene had overall less fluorescence and over all lower OD600 values. It is likely that attaching a large gene such as this to the Spinach tRNA results in overall less tRNA and less expression of Spinach aptamer fluorescence.
Spinach Aptamer
This graph shows the fluorescence of the Spinach Aptamer BBa_K734002 over time in a dilution series of DFHBI concentrations. DFHBI, 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI), shown below, is a synthetic fluorophore designed in the Jaffrey Lab at Cornell University. When spinach mRNA binds to DFHBI, it exhibits green fluorescence, which we utilized as a method to measure promoter strength. Based on the curve of 400"
