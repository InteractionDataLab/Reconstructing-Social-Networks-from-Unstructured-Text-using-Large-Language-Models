CrO42- / Cr2O72-
Beschreibung des Sensors
1998 wurde ein Plasmid (pEBZ141) entwickelt, welches eine Fusion ist von dem Chrom-Resistenz Gen chr und einer Luciferase ist.
chr kodiert unter anderem fuer einen Chromtransporter.
Der Sensor ist sehr selektiv (effektiv reagiert er nur auf Chromat und Dichromat) und scheint zuverlaessig zu arbeiten.
Fuer eine hohe Effizienz wird ein bestimmter Stamm von CH34 benoetigt (AE104), welcher kein naturliches Plasmid besitzt.
Problembeschreibung
Ich habe den Kontakt mit der Gruppe hergestellt. Prinzipiell koennen wir das Plasmid haben, wir brauchen jedoch die Zustimmung von Bayer. Anfrage wurde versendet (Mittwoch), bisher noch keine Antwort.
Ein weiteres Problem koennte der CH34 Stamm sein. Angeblich wird eine Einstufung nach S2 diskutiert und der Prof. kann die entsprechenden Staemme deswegeb nicht verschicken. Wir haben ein S2 Labor zur Verfuegung. Noch keine Ruecksprache gehalten. Warte auf Bayer.

I made up an experimental and control Gibson Assembly, outlined in the table below. This was mixed and put on 50 degrees Celcius on the thermocycler for 20 minutes. Then, it was incubated with some thawed DH5alpha (from the batch just made competent a couple days ago) for 30 minutes. Then heat shocked at 42 degrees for 30 seconds (as opposed to teh 55 seconds that we've been doing). 950 uL of SOC added, then put in incubator w/ vigorous shaking for an hour. 100uL of the 1mL put onto two Chlor plates,"

Overview
Welcome to the Nottingham iGEM 2018 Human Practices pages. This overview will introduce you to the projects that we investigation for our Human Practices efforts, as well as why we investigated them and what our results showed.
For our silver medal criteria, we complied 3 reports on the impact of our project, how people feel about phage therapy and what current legislation there is on phage therapy. The objective of compiling these reports was to investigate whether our work was responsible and good for the world. We engaged with a variety of communities including field experts, community discussion groups and scientific articles and research papers to gain a wide scope of information to demonstrate the positive impact of our work.
For our gold medal criteria, we analysed how we could integrate the findings of our discussion group and field expert interviews into our project. We chose to document this via a clear flowchart so that we can explain how we have taken on board feedback and modified our project as a result. We hope enjoy learning about our Human Practices work on this year’s project. Click the dropdown menu and pages to find our more details about our work!

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," unbelievable that someone would question her commitment to her family and her love for her child because of her decisions about not giving up her career to devote full attention to her child. The consequences of views like these are quite severe, in that it can seriously affect the mental health of an individual. When asked whether by putting such societal pressure on women, whether mental health issues can arrive, she said yes, there is a
lot of social pressure put on young mums
which can lead to diseases like depression.
We were again led to question whether shared parental leave would relieve some of this pressure put on women? In fact, the ‘Swedish model’ of parental leave and balancing career with family commitments shows some very desirable qualities that employers would look for: ability to multitask (especially under pressure), commitment to career, etc. However, Dr Santos warned us about attributing the fact that fewer women are taking up jobs in higher up roles within Bioscience to maternity leave -
Maternity is an easy excuse
.
Dr Santos emphasised that just because it seems like there is a correlation between fewer women taking roles beyond post-doctorate level and women wanting to start a family, it doesn’t necessarily mean that this is the only explanation.
The difficult bit is changing the attitude of supervisors to post docs...men specifically but also women - who don’t realise it, but can be very discriminatory (too)
The need for supervisors to act as role models to young, aspiring post-docs is very apparent, especially as role models are so important for undergraduates and postgraduates, so why should this stop at levels beyond this?
To conclude this meeting, we asked Dr Santos what she thinks needs to be done to improve gender equality in science and her response was as follows:
“Social change” - on a massive scale, ie structural change within Britain to encourage a more inclusive environment for all.
“Discussions with undergraduates” - opening up communications with students to publicise the problems of gender inequality in science, but also to highlight what students can do.
“Empowering (women) to better deal with pressures” - potentially through more advice from senior role models
“Free choice as opposed to social pressure” - emphasising the importance of giving a distinct voice to women, so they can make decisions about their own life, career and family without local, social pressures.

UK iGEM meetup
In August, we were invited to attend the UK iGEM meetup organized by the iGEM teams from the University of Westminster, University of Warwick and University College London.  Almost the whole team attended this event which spanned over two days. The first day involved attending a series of lectures and a team poster presentation followed by debates and presentations by iGEM teams at the Shard on the second day.
This was a great opportunity for our team to interact with other teams and to gain feedback on our device.
University of Nottingham
One of our team members, Thea helped the Nottingham iGEM team in developing their game - NottPortal. Thea helped with providing he voice for one of the characters in the game.
We helped the Nottingham team in showing proof of application of their device. The Nottingham team sent us some freeze dried bacteria which we revived and then checked if the bacteria can actually be retrieved, stay alive and grow.
University of Peshawar
The Peshawar team helped with our human practices by speaking to clinicians in Pakistan.These clinicians informed us the medicinal practice and about antibiotic usage in Pakistan where we learnt that patients rely on self prescription and the availability of even fourth generation antibiotics over the counter encourages this practice. The Peshawar team also provided us with data of multi-drug resistant strains in Pakistan and the treatments regimens that are currently used."

Bdh2 with no pelB secretion tag induction assay. In addition to testing BBa_K1149050 growth, we looked at induction whereby we see that more sfGFP is produced when induced. Although the promoter is leaky as the curve of intracellular bdh2, as seen with bdh2-pelB is followed tightly by the non-induced cells. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
CLE growth assay. E. coli (MG1655) transformed with CLE BBa_K1149009 were grown with either 0% or 2% Xylose to induce CLE and sfGFP expression. Induction with xylose shows growth inhibition. Ideally you would normalise the fluorescence with OD600 to give fluorescence/cell in order to get the actual difference in induction expression. A two-tailed t-test shows that p = 0.4308 > 0.05, therefore there is no statistical difference between induced and uninduced. Growth was at 37°C with shaking. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
CLE induction assay. E. coli (MG1655) transformed with CLE BBa_K1149009 were grown with either 0% or 2% Xylose to induce CLE and sfGFP expression. CLE induction does not seem to increase the amount of fluorescence emitted by the GFP. Growth was at 37°C with shaking. Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
ETSCS2 growth assay. E. coli (MG1655) transformed with ESTCS2 BBa_K1149002 were grown with either 0 μM or 6 μM Arabinose to induce ESTC2 and sfGFP expression. The growth curves appear very similar, which is confirmed by a two-tailed t-test p-value = 0.8118, thus no reason to say that there is any growth inhibition. Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.

Macquarie_Australia,2017,Team:Macquarie Australia#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," They were seeking ideas that were original and achievable, and we were selected as one of six presenters from numerous applications. In just 30 seconds, one of our team members communicated the benefits of using synthetic biology as a tool to create a renewable alternative for production of hydrogen fuel to a global audience.
The reach of our pitch at this event was huge. With hundreds of attendees in the live audience, thousands more watching at satellite events around the country and it was also broadcasted globally on a live simulcast stream. Additionally, the event was uploaded onto YouTube and has so far reached 1,434 views.
Conferences
Synthetic Biology Australasia Conference (SBA)
The Synthetic Biology Australasia (SBA) Conference 2017 was attended by the team, and our iGEM project was showcased in a presentation. Not only did we gain the opportunity to share our work with experts in synthetic biology, but we were able to watch inspiring presentations on exciting new research in the field and received great advice regarding the ethics involved with our project.  We were very fortunate to meet Dr John Glass from the Craig Venter Institute, who gave us much appreciated advice on presenting our work.
Additionally, the conference gave us the opportunity to meet iGEM teams from USyd, Melbourne, and Auckland at a social event organised by iGEM HQ Representative Abigail Sison.
Australasian Conference of Undergraduate Research (ACUR)
Team members were accepted to present our research in a 10 minute presentation at the Australasian Conference of Undergraduate Research (ACUR) 2017. We were able to communicate our research findings to many people, with the conference having a high attendance with approximately 100 speakers alongside judges and guests. At the conclusion of our presentation we were asked many questions from the audience, which allowed us to understand the concerns people have and address these in our final design.
Synthetic Biology Edutainment Game
Our team collaborated with game designer Ryder Boyton from 8-bit Equation, to develop a game that was equally educational and entertaining on synthetic biology and the aspects of our iGEM project. We designed the game with the idea in mind that the player would learn basic concepts indirectly throughout the gameplay rather than having to rote learn blocks of information. Research suggests the most impactful learning from games occur when the educational content is part of the intrinsic challenges of the game, and a successful educational game provides the opportunity for kinetic, strategic, cognitive learning, and prior knowledge application (Boyan & Sherry 2011).
The gameplay was designed for a high school aged audience, to provide a fun introduction to synthetic"

How we have identified, investigated and addressed
the biosafety issue in the context of the ExpandED project.
The Edinburgh OG iGEM 2016 team has directly worked with non-model organisms and ultimately the goal of our project is to encourage future iGEM teams to use these microorganisms as well as domesticate additional, novel microorganisms. We therefore have an obligation to review and inform the current situation regarding the use of non-model organisms,  the current regulatory framework and its biosafety and biosecurity status. As synthetic biology develops at a faster pace than the regulatory framework in which it exists the onus is placed upon practitioners to deliver the tools and safeguards required for adequate risk assessment and safe delivery of the technology (Purnick and Weiss, 2009).
As previously mentioned, the intended expansion of strains to be used within the context of synthetic biology (SynBio) through the domestication of uncommon microorganisms comes with biosafety and biosecurity issues that need to be addressed properly. For example, when analysing our microorganisms, we found out that filamentous fungi are able to produce a wide array of important secondary metabolites (e.g. naphto-γ-pyrones and ß-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin) with diverse biological activities relevant for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries: antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-tubercular, anti-HIV and anti-hyperuricuric (Choque et al. 2014). Nonetheless, they may also produce mycotoxins that can cause unwanted health and environmental problems, such as human disease (myxotoxicoses) (Peraica et al. 1999) and food and silage spoilage (Filtenborg et al. 1996).
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS
The commercial applications of SynBio might entail the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. For instance, the NTU-Taida 2012 iGEM project involved the direct interaction of genetically modified bacteria with humans as they engineered Escherichia coli as a vector to deliver peptide drugs to the human gut and thus sewage and water systems (NTU"

Integrated human practice
We investigate 10 Chinese companies who provide ctDNA detection or cancer screening services. The investigation on current ctDNA detection services among 10 Chinese companies gives us a vision on the diversity of detection services and market share in China.
Conclusion:
Each company has its unique method to carry out service. It suggests there is no technology monopoly in this industry. Therefore our product can compete with others in technology aspect as we have our own method to detect lung cancer. The time required to complete the service is between 2~8 days, except for EZlifeBio. It is seen to me that our product have a clear advantage in the length of time required because the detecting process can finish within few hours and the result can be read straight away. Similarly, EZlifeBio also sell detector and kit to customers and customers can run the detecting process. However, our target audiences are different. Their detectors are targeting hospitals or laboratories but our product is targeting the end user, patients, in this industry. The outcome from each service is slightly vary but all of them provide an assistance in cancer diagnosis or cure. It is distinct to our product as we aiming to provide a straightforward result for customer to understand. However, our product shows its limitation in the result compare to other outcomes from those services. It needs to be developed to generate more completed result in order to compete with other services.

Communication with BGI product research department Before we start to design our product, we consulted a staff who works in BGI product research department. She gave us a lot of advice on how to design a product and what should be the main concerns during the development of a product. Her suggestions inspired us to create a simple screening paper for lung cancer detection.

Microfluidics How-To Part I: Making Chips
Microfluidics Main | How-To Part I | How-To Part II | Tamagotchip
There are three main steps in the making of a microfluidic chip:
Designing the chip
Making a mould
Moulding PDMS chips.
Designing chips is a subtle task, but for many applications one can re-use an existing design. Moulds are also usually made using expensive equipment found in clean rooms. If you have a clean room, somebody there will be able to train you on fabrication, based on our protocols . If you do not, you can try to experiment with making moulds out of laser machined metal, but it will probably be easier to order them. Stanford offers a foundry service .
Moulding is the most common task: it must be done over and over again, as the chips are usually single use. Again, this requires specific equipment not usually found in a bio lab. So unless a friendly lab in your neighbourhood is equipped, you'll probably have to order the chips.
Making a Mould
Our moulds are made by photolithography: a layer of AZ or SU-8 resist is spin-coated onto a silicon wafer, then exposed, developed,  and etched, to only a positive image of the channels in resist. The mould is thus a plane of silicon, with features made in photoresist. To provide the mould walls, we place the wafer in an aluminium-foil-lined petri dish.
The complete protocol for the clean room fabrication of the mold can be found here . Many pictures of the fabrication process in our clean rooms are in our picasa gallery

CAS conference Munich
From the 23th to 25th of July 2012 the CAS Conference took place, which was organized by the LMU Center for Advanced Studies in Munich. The conference was arranged in order to bring scientists of different expertise together to promote projects by an interdisciplinary discussion. Several notable speakers working on Synthetic Biology informed about their field of work, as for example Martin Fussenegger (ETH Zürich), Víctor de Lorenzo (CSIC Madrid) and Jay Keasling (University of California, Berkeley). Apart from this, two poster sessions were organized for companies, working groups and also the iGEM teams to present their work. For the program and a list of all speakers see here .
Several members of our iGEM team attended the conference. This offered us the possibility to extend our knowledge as well as to take part in interesting discourses on different fields of Synthetic Biology. Moreover we got the chance to discuss with experts about aims, achievements and problems of our project as well as to get to know some other iGEM teams and to inform us about their projects. We debated with the experts about the active center and the wide substrate spectrum of our laccases, about the production of them in our two chosen expression systems as well as about advantages, risks and alternatives especially for the use in wastewater treatment plants. We also held an interview to the iGEM team UCL London about the topic ""Collaboration and competition in the iGEM competition"". In this connection a collaboration between the team UCL London and us was planned (see here ).
Furthermore the philosopher Alfred Nordmann (TU Darmstadt) presented his point of view about Synthetic Biology during the CAS conference. To provoke some thoughts about Synthetic Biology, he chose the following main topics:
Do we produce a shift in biology?
Do we educate a new generation of scientists?
Is it necessary to create something for understanding it? (Richard Feynman’s dictum)
What happens to evolution by natural selection when notions of design are reintroduced?
How mindful could we be of the “evolutionary fate” of designed organisms?
Do we really understand the whole of our creation?
How does it affect society?
What influence does it have on our relation to and our respect for evolved biological nature?
For example: Why should we worry about biodiversity when it could be designed?
Apart from us the iGEM teams from Bonn , TU Darmstadt , UCL London , TU München , LMU München , Marburg , Potsdam , Frankfurt , Tübingen , Wageningen as well as the last"

UCLouvain,2018,Team:UCLouvain#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". However,                 this is the third time our University has participated in this competition. Currently, this Swedish team know all the workings of the competition. That's why we asked them for advice.
Uppsala Igem team have a project called “WormBusters” related to the problem of nematode parasites in the horse in an agricultural setting. They want to develop a detection kit that can be used easily by farmers. If you want to know                 more about their project : https://2018.igem.org/Team:Uppsala
This summer, Nina (from UCLouvain team) left for a week in Sweden to meet them and talk about a potential collaboration between our two teams. Our two teams had the opportunity to present their projects to each other.
Firstly, we exchanged our impressions about both projects (BactWars and WormBusters). What helped us most was to learn more about the internal organization of their team.                 This summer, we had some problems with our results of the InterLab too and the Uppsala team gave us advice regarding the Interlab. It’s mainly thanks to them that we were able to obtain valid results for the InterLab part.
To thank them for their help, we shared on the social networks their french form about their problematic. Indeed, one of the official languages ​​in Belgium is French. And it allows them to check if their problematic affects only                 their country or if their project could help farmers from other countries.

Collaboration with Laval University (Canada)
We wanted to work with overseas teams for our European Conference. It was important for us to not only work with European teams. So propose to other worldwide teams to organize a                 rediffusion of our event. In this perspective we got in touch the University of Laval. As they were very enthusiastic we planned together the logistic details and talk about some content details. They book a room and invited over 20                 students to watch and interact during our event.
Collaboration with IGEM Paris Saclay (France)
In early March Celestin went to Paris to meet two iGEM teams in order to share our mutual experience on all the aspect of the contest. He first met met with Arthur Radoux and his colleague Julie Miesch from the Paris Saclay iGEM                 team. We able to share our concern about different aspect of the contest such as the modeling part, etc. It was great to have this opportunity to help each"

People tend to fear bacteria and oppose genetic modification, and thus synthetic biology. Our attempt at a novel outreach approach will teach the audience facts about bacteria, DNA and GMO in a fun and participatory way.
At the burger joint, Mamma's Burgers, crazy things might happen but it sure will be educational!
The Untapped Food Resource of the Century
Edible coli is a proposal for a sustainable food source.
A modified strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli will provide the optimal quantities of nutrition a human needs, by degrading otherwise non-degradable material for the human body.
First step is the production of a nutritional protein, the OneProt, and the biosynthesis of essential fatty acids – additionally, it will carry the appealing touch of lemon flavor. Then the Nutrition Generator, a custom designed, innovative and revolutionary cultivation tank will ensure an on-going amplification of the Edible coli products, easy to handle and drain from.
Could the world live off of microorganisms?

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," vitro Transcription
Malachite Green Aptamer template (10 µM) was hybridized by heating up a forward and reverse oligo to 95 °C. DNA was cooled down to room temperature. dsDNA was then stored at -20 °C.
Malachite Green Aptamer Activity
Malachite Green Aptamer activity was tested by transcribing the prepared DNA-Template in vitro with T7 polymerase as described above and in presence of 1 mM malachite green (Sigma). To ensure synchronic initiation a master mix containing the buffer, enzymes, dye and template were pipetted separately. The assay was performed in 384 well micro titer plates (black, flat round, transparent bottom [Corning, 3540]) on a 20 µL scale. Evaporation during transcription was prevented by using a sealing tape (#232701, Nunc). Measurements on micro titer plates were performed in a microplate reader (Tecan Safire 2). Following parameters were chosen for the assay setup: Ex= 630 nm and Em=652 nm, 10 nm excitation/ emission bandwidth, high sensitivity flash mode and 40 µs integration time. The reaction was measured every 30 sec at 37 °C. To ensure the functionality of the assay, samples of the in vitro transcription were analyzed on a 10 % 8 M urea PAGE.
Time-resolved in vitro Transcription
To describe in vitro transcription time-resolved in terms of NTP consumption, following conditions were applied: 500 nM renatured ATP Aptamer Spinach2 RNA, 10 µM Malachite Green Aptamer DNA template, 40 mM Tris pH 8.1, 1 mM spermidine, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 4 mM each NTP, 10 mM DTT, 5 % DMSO, 100 µM DFHBI, 1 mM malachite green, 0.1 mg/mL T7 RNA Polymerase, 0.2 U/µL Ribolock RNase and 0.1 U Pyrophosphatase (Thermo Scientific). The assay was performed in 384 well micro titer plates (black, flat round, transparent bottom [Corning, 3540]) on a 20 µL scale. Evaporation during transcription was prevented by using a sealing tape (#232701, Nunc). Measurements on micro titer plates were performed in a microplate reader (Tecan Safire 2).

School Visit
We believe that one of the most important aspects of synthetic biology is to try and educate the younger generations. To do this we organised a school visit with Montsaye Academy, where Chris talked to 16-17 year olds about synthetic biology and biology as a whole. He taught the students about how genetic engineering and microbial genetics works.
After a quick lab safety introduction, Chris started out with a pipetting challenge where he told the students to pipette 5 PCR tubes with different coloured dyes. This helped the students learn how to use Gilson pipettes, and get a taste for the skills they will be using in the future.
He also demonstrated the use of GFP and RFP as reporter genes and how they can be used to draw glowing art! The final demonstration was a plasmid card game devised by us. This involved creating plasmids out of various components and teaching the students about genetic engineering and microbial genetics in a fun yet interesting way.
The students were excited about seeing how genetic engineering works through the creations they made using the game. By educating the younger generations, we feel as though they are more comfortable with the idea of synthetic biology since there is such bad press around this subject. We hope that after this visit the students have taken a interest in synthetic biology and will one day help in this subject.
Meet-Up
In order to take part in a possible collaborations, and to get meet other UK iGEM team, a few member of our team went to the London iGEM meet up, at Westminster University. At the meet up we were able to talk and get to know more about the other teams and their projects. The day was structured that we first had the opportunity to listen geneticist; Dr Tom Ellis from Imperial College London and Dr Vitor Bernardes Pinheiro from the University College London give talks on ‘Balancing biology with engineering to produce molecules and materials’ and ‘Directed evolution’. We then were able to walk around and view all the teams’ poster presentations, and have others view our poster. At the end of the day each team was given 15 minutes to present their project, and an additional 5 minutes to answer questions from other teams. The London meet up was a great experience and gave"

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html,"teams. The Human Practices team designed an exercise to identify ethical and social issues and to trigger debate on those issues. We made a short movie. One of the issues that informs the movie is the possibility of cheater mutant bacteria. Complementarily, we carefully modelled the risk of mutant cheaters and finally end up by discovering that mutant cheaters were in fact among our cultures! We characterized such mutants, performed experimental evolution tests and found them to behave as expected/modeled/feared: mutants actually display an evolutionary advantage on “honest”, heterologous protein-expressing clones. The consequences of all this were already anticipated in the script of our movie, one of the first things we attempted in this challenging project, and maybe the best way to close it:

Yale,2011,Team:Yale#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", please visit our BioBricks page.
Expression:
Large scale production and subsequent purification of RiAFP was achieved. This is the first reported recombinant expression of RiAFP. Expression was verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and observing green pellets. We also verified expression of the TmAFP BioBrick by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and flourimetry. This characterization was not previously done by Tokyo Tech, a team that had previously worked with TmAFP. Importantly, RiAFP was expressed in soluble form in very high quantities (150mg/L), as determined by UV-vis. Several temperatures, length of induction, and IPTG concentrations were investigated to optimize yields. The high level of expression is significant because expression of other comparably active insect antifreeze proteins, such as TmAFP, results in inclusion bodies of largely inactive material and requires expensive refolding protocols. This has limited the use of hyperactive insect antifreeze proteins in industry thus far. We believe that RiAFP is an attractive potential commercial reagent for applications requiring freeze resistance.
To read more about our protein expression, please visit our proteins page.
Purification:
Purification of RiAFP was achieved in high quantities. We tried several methods of purification, including cobalt, loose-beaded and pre-packed Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography to purify RiAFP, which had a C-terminal 6-His tag.  To further ensure purity, size exclusion chromatography via FPLC was completed. Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE. Since our RiAFP-GFP fusion protein expressed at much higher levels compared to RiAFP by itself (likely because GFP increases the solubility of the protein), we first purified the GFP-TEV-RiAFP fusion protein, exposed pure fractions to TEV protease, and conducted size exclusion chromatography to isolate RiAFP.   A novel purification method to take advantage of the active ice-binding sites of antifreeze protein in using ice-affinity chromatography, as a facile, inexpensive method to purify any AFP fusion constructs, was also explored.
We have introduced a novel technique for protein purification using AFPs as a fusion protein for future iGEM teams to cheaply (<$15) purify proteins in high volume and purity, and provided associated CAD designs and protocols for such an apparatus.
To read more about our protein purification, please visit our proteins page.

The observed transition occurs at a concentration of approximately 1 nM of 3OC6-HSL. The light-blue curve plotted shows modeling data of pLux induced by 3OC6-HSL (Lux-AHL) binding to the corresponding LuxR regulator . This curve from the model and the dark blue data points obtained from experiments were plotted as a reference in all the other graphs describing pLux . Crosstalk can be observed for the cases where the 3OC12-HSL (Las-AHL) binds the LuxR regulator .  Additionally for 3OC12-HSL binding to its corresponding regulator LasR and then binding to the pLux as seen in the middle of the top row and center of the matrix.  For the case of Las-AHL binding the regulator LasR and subsequently the promoter pLux , the transition occurs at 1 nM and reaches 0.5 fold the fluorescence as pLux induced by 3OC6-HSL binding LuxR . In the case of 3OC12-HSL binding LuxR and inducing the promoter pLux , the transition is observed at approximately 100 nM and severe crosstalk is observed, meaning that the ON-OFF-ratio is not significantly different from the reference curve.
Observation of C4-HSL has shown, that there is no significant crosstalk with the LuxR regulator and LasR regulator binding C4-HSL and subsequently to pLux . This is indicated on top right and middle right graphs. However, RhlR induced with its corresponding inducer (C4-HSL) binds to pLux and activates expression of GFP at about 100 nM.

DLUT_China,2018,Team:DLUT China#test40_-_-_TEXT.html,"etyl homoserine lactone after more than a threshold, Las lasR activates expression promoter downstream genes. We designed Gp2 in the downstream gene. Gp2 is an RNA polymerase inhibitory protein that inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, so as to control the quantity of Nissle escherichia coli in the intestinal tract.
Lethal system:
In order to prevent the loss of our Nissle escherichia coli to the external environment, compete with the dominant local strains, and disrupt the normal ecological balance of the environment, we decided to set up in vitro lethal system. Since we were involved in more sequences, we decided to design two plasmids and introduce them into one bacterium at the same time. Therefore, we also set up the plasmids loss killing system.
We designed two systems.
SRNA in plasmid 1 is an inhibitory element of lysis2 in plasmid 2, which inhibits lysis2 expression. SRNA in plasmid 2 is an inhibiting element of lysis1 in plasmid 1, which inhibits lysis1 expression. When one of the plasmids is lost, the lytic protein of the other plasmids will not be inhibited, that is, the bacteria will express the lytic protein and cause the bacteria to lyse, thus killing the bacteria that lose the plasmids, so as to prevent the loss of plasmids.
Due to the high concentration of uric acid in the intestines of hyperuricemia patients, we use uric acid as the response signal of the lethal system. When the uric acid concentration exceeds the threshold, HucR is inhibited by uric acid, and Phuco is in the open state. Subsequent genes can be transcribed and translated normally, but since lysis1 is inhibited by sRNA, the bacteria will not be cracked. When the uric acid concentration was lower than the threshold value, HucR inhibited Phuco, and Phuco was turned off. Subsequent genes could not be transcribed and translated, so that sRNA inhibiting lysis2 could not be expressed, while lysis2 could be normally expressed, resulting in death of bacteria. Due to the high concentration of uric acid in the intestinal tract of uric acid patients, the death rate of bacteria in the patient is not high. However, when the bacteria are lost to the external environment, the uric acid concentration in the external environment is lower than the threshold value, which activates the lethal system of the bacteria"

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process?

My inability to work on this project initially, however, did get me wondering about the possibility for an interface to create a model of the system beforehand, so as to avoid confusion if parts of the circuit were not working (initially, our photoreceptor did not work).
All in all, the day was very productive, and I am glad we got to take this change from our usual routine of computer programming to have this new experience.
June 6
Today was another break from day-to-day coding. We visited BU, a lab with which we work closely, and they briefed us on how their projects were going, and what they are doing this summer. I knew before coming to the Wellesley lab that we were a ""dry"" lab, and they were a ""wet"" lab, but I didn't know just how different work in each setting would be - after all, both are tracks in iGem. Today, however, I saw not only the great differences between our lab environments, but the importance of both tracks in synthetic biology. BU works in the type of biological lab I once worked in - with pipettes, flow cytometers, centrifuges, and other such instruments for making quantitative data of biological function. Our lab has none of these things. But, the BU lab also has much less coding experience than we do. When they do code, it seems like they really only want to run basic simulations or simple functions - unlike our lab, where we are developing complete software packages. Our lab advisers have really been trying to drive home the point that our work this summer is intended to assist biologists who have less understanding of coding or computer science - and the importance of this became apparent today. I can see how access to a program which runs simulations through a visual interface, or otherwise without requiring knowledge of coding, could really expedite the process at which people like the BU team could undertake wet biological research. It was also interesting to note that many of the BU iGem members shared my major - biomedical engineering - whereas I don't think anybody else in the Wellesley lab is pursuing this track, they are mostly computer science majors. I am actually glad that this is the case - I feel like my work here is going to give me invaluable experience with the type of work that I know I will either be actively participating in or will be helping me with my future wet biological work.

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#pt#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," inducer 2) as a secondary metabolite, we decided to use this compound as a recognition factor. Our E. coli will be an AI2- strain and won´t produce native AI2. The presence of AI2 in the culture medium indicates the presence of contaminants, which will be recognized by an AI2 sensitive promoter present in our E. coli.
In the absence of contaminants, the amount of worker cells will be much higher than the number of killer ones, so the industrial process will occur at maximum efficiency.
Contaminants in the culture medium are recognized by the presence of AI2.
2)  Differentiation mechanism
The initial differentiation mechanism is based on a random slippage mechanism that will determine the expression of a CRE recombinase in a small percentage of cells. This device is an adaptation from the device presented by the Caltech 2008 iGEM team. When expressed, the CRE recombinase will remove a device from the genome – containing a gene involved in the cell cycle and a gene that represses conjugation – and thus lead to the differentiation into killer cells. Killer cells are unable to reproduce, but able to conjugate. This device is an adaptation of the device presented by the Paris 2007 iGEM team.  Moreover, the presence of AI2 in the culture medium will also trigger the expression of CRE recombinase and thus induce the differentiation of more worker cells into the killer cells, so the proportion of killer cells will be elevated during the decontamination process. After a certain number of generations, the proportion of killer and worker cells will return to its original state, due to the killer cells being unable to reproduce.
3) Killing mechanism
We decided to use conjugation as a sensor that will trigger the killing mechanisms. Our E. coli is going to be an F+ strain, carrying a modified version of the conjugative plasmid pPed100 containing a killing gene. Only the killer lineage will be able to conjugate because in the worker lineage the pPed100 plasmid will be repressed. Since most bacterial strains in nature are F- our F+ E. coli will be able to conjugate with most contaminants. There will be two killing mechanisms, one carried by the modified pPed100 plasmid into the contaminant and another triggered by the conjugation signal. This secondary mechanism is necessary to stall contaminant growth because conjugation may take some time to occur and may be impaired due to culture conditions. This secondary killing mechanism will be triggered by the presence of a diffusible conjugation signal and will be able to induce neighboring killer"

                                                                                                                                                                Interview with the local experts
                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.
                                                                                                                                                                        Q1: How can the greasing removal apply in civil engineering?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q2: In the field of civil engineering, are there any other applications?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q3: How efficient is this method or else than biological method?
                                                                                                                                                                Based on these three question, Professor gave the following answer to all of these.
                                                                                                                                                                Reinforced concrete structure has been widely used in construction engineering, and the corrosion of concrete will cause irreversible damage of the structure,

Participation to iGEM Japan and its survey
Introduction
Our team is participating as one group of iGEM-Japan to improve the image and perception of iGEM in Japan. iGEM-Japan is organization constituted by Japanese iGEM teams. The purpose of this organization is to make of iGEM a more active enterprise fueled by inter-group cooperation. The main member teams constituting iGEM are Osaka , Kyoto, Tokyo Metropolitan , UT-Tokyo, Tokyo Tech, Sapporo and our KIT-Kyoto. So far, the organization has performed various activities, for example, contributing an article to a magazine, holding pre competition conferences and meetings in Japan, and others.
As a part of our activities, we conducted a survey widely targeted to public ranging from high school students to citizens in general. The objective of the survey was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its problems like bioethics or safety. We asked people who came not only from biology departments but also from various fields of study. We also asked visitors at the open campus mentioned above. Furthermore, we made it able to answer from iGEM Japan’s website so that we could collect the answer from various classes.
The Questionnaire

[ genetic engineering / biotechnology ]
1. When shopping, do you buy ""not genetically modified food”?
[ Always buy / Tend to buy / Hardly mind / Not mind / I have never seen such an indication ]
2. What do you associate with [ genetic engineering and biotechnology ]? (※Please circle all that apply)

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," things like your food and drinks differently, if your only judge is what you feel, smell or taste.  Your perception of a bar changes if you cannot see all the people around you and are limited to hear a lot of voices and conversations mixing from different directions.
It was difficult to adapt to this new situation but we all managed to eat, drink and to pay. However, this experience gave us a small insight into challenges for the visually impaired. Although we know that this experience is not equivalent to real everyday situations for people with visual impairment, it still gave us an idea of the challenges some people have overcome day by day.
Interviews: Studying Science with Visual Impairment
Interview with the Dean of Biology Astrid Brandis-Heep
Our hometown Marburg is known as “the capital of blind people” but visually impaired students can only rarely be found in fields like biology or chemistry.  What could be the reasons for this? We used the opportunity to talk to Dr. Brandis-Heep, the dean of students in the department of biology.
iGEM Marburg 2018: ""Are biology students with visual impairment in our department?""
Dr. Brandis Heep: “From time to time there are students with visual impairment in the department of biology. The practical work in the lab is more challenging for them”
iGEM Marburg 2018: “Are there special lab spaces for students with special needs? How do they manage to do the practical work?”
Dr. Brandis Heep: “If   students need special support they can get help from assistants and besides that all our lab courses are done in groups of two or more students. The big advantage is that students can help each other. So both sides learn from each other. This would not be possible if students have to pass the courses alone.”
iGEM Marburg 2018: ”Are there special safety instructions for students with visual impairment?”
Dr. Brandis Heep: “They should be able to follow the safety instructions given to all students who work in the lab. Sometimes special instructions are necessary depending on the grade of visual impairment.”
iGEM Marburg 2018: “Are students with handicap allowed to provide a replacement if they are not able to complete a course?”
Dr. Brandis Heep: “In our department, usually every student is free in choosing the modules he or she wants to take. Students with a handicap will choose lectures and courses in the way they are able to take part. This means not all practical courses may be possible. Sometimes they need an assistant to do"

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Background of the Project
From the very beginning it was clear that we would aim to create an actual application for the work done in the lab and through modeling. This was only natural, since our team has expertise well beyond the lab in the areas of product design and business. Having a concrete and familiar looking product might also be a great way to encourage conversation about synthetic biology with the public. All of the team members share a remarkably similar set of values, so we wanted our final product to be accessible, mainly thanks to it being low price, environmentally friendly, safe to use and ethical.
Brainstorming and Narrowing Down Ideas
Initially we came up with more than 30 ideas, so we had to narrow it down several times before getting to Dermcidin. In order to shape our ten best ideas and make some important contacts that could help us during our journey we visited The ChemBio fair (29.3.-30.3.2017) and Upgraded Life Festival (25.4.-26.4.2017). The ChemBio fair was unfortunately mostly focused on the lab equipment and therefore wasn’t as useful as we would have hoped. Upgraded Life Festival, however, was more focused on health tech and the health start-up scene in the Helsinki area in Finland. During the spring, two of our team members, Michal and Meo had worked for the two-day event as volunteers and so had quite a good picture of the companies and presenters. Thus, there were countless possibilities to approach different companies and alliances to discuss possible collaboration. Whilst attending the most interesting presentations, we also managed to approach nearly all parties that we thought were interesting or were related to our initial project ideas.
We also met and discussed with several deans from both universities and presented our top 10 ideas on a SynBio course to Aalto University students in order to get their insights and feedback. After accidentally stumbling upon the molecule Dermcidin, while looking into another idea, we also had a meeting with Bayer. The company"

Lauren is currently in her third year of working towards a Bachelors of Science in Food Science with a Leadership in Integrated Learning minor. When she isn't studying, working one of her two jobs, meeting with the e-boards of various clubs, or in the lab with the team, you can find her listening to Bastille (a.k.a. literally the best band ever), watching musicals, or eating. Possibly all three at once, but most likely eating. Too many wants and too many dreams - challenge accepted to reach each and every one. Far too ambitious for her own good, but adventure is out there and she can't wait to see where life takes her.

On the 10th of July, we gave an elaborate presentation on our project, during which we discussed the setup and story with the people at CVI.
They mentioned that the Zika virus can slumber in the placenta, which might be an interesting side-topic for our application. They also said that the current antibody dipstick tests for HAT are of bad quality since confirmation tests are always needed. Furthermore, the interpretation of the result is subjective and depends on the researcher, hence there is a high chance of false positives or false negatives. One way to solve this is to quantify our results, making it more objective. In addition, a cold chain is currently needed while delivering the tests, and tests that can avoid the need for a cold-chain would be very beneficial. The delivery on site is very important, so the on-site test is definitely of value. A drawback in detecting antigens instead of antibodies is that we need to test for viruses in blood, which is difficult but not impossible. This is not so much a problem for HAT. An alternative"

Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#RNASeq_-_-_TEXT.html," count data, which can be assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. However, due to the many unknown sources of variance within and between samples, these counts are overdispersed with respect to a Poisson distribution. This implies that we can fit a GLM type regression model with a negative binomial error structure. The Bioconductor package edgeR has implemented this type of analysis and includes a built-in function to calculate TMM normalization. 6,7 , edgeR estimates tag-wise or common dispersion, depending on the assumptions made. We chose to estimate tag-wise dispersion, meaning each gene has its own dispersion estimate. Since RNAseq analysis involves considerable multiple testing (k = 7784, n = 3), uncorrected p-values would yield unacceptably high false positive rates. Therefore, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values are reported in the results section. Furthermore, significance can be achieved without meaningful interpretation when the relative difference in expression is very low. Hence, ²log-fold changes are reported in addition to p-values.
All analyses were with the statistical software R version 3.2.4 (R Development Core Team 2015). 8
Results RNA Isolation
In table 1, the yields of each RNA isolation are shown, as reported by BaseClear’s quality control check. 8 out of 9 samples were successfully sequenced in the first run by BaseClear and the last sample (0g, replicate 2) was run again at a later time. Since this sample comes from a different batch, there may be larger dispersion in the 0g treatment than the other treatment.

Overview
     Over the years, NCTU_Formosa has been revolutionizing the way we farm, one project at a time. With Operation Debug (2014), we developed an efficient and effective biological pest control method; We achieved sustainable and automated pest elimination with Pantide (2016); Parabase (2017) added fungal disease prediction and protection to our repertoire; and now, finally, we’ve perfected bacterial control to reach the pinnacle of fertilization with Plant B. These concepts, already powerful on their own, could transform the field of agriculture entirely, allowing for drastic growth in countless markets. To test the efficacy of our project designs, we integrated all of them in a small demonstration farm outside our campus, using turmeric plants as test subjects.

1. The 2-step PCR products were tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel. However, the band sizes of both gBlock 2 and the whole construct were wrong though they showed similar bands.
2. New gBlock 2 had arrived and resuspension with TE buffer was done so that the final concentration became 10 ng/uL. The fragment was then tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel but the band was invisible due to the low concentration of gBlock 2 in the well.
3. PCR was performed to amplify the new gBlock 2 using Q5 polymerase. 2 temperatures were used for the 30-second annealing step: 59.9 degree Celsius and 61.5 degree Celsius.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins. Many of these proteins are binding proteins or enzymes for metabolism. Some gram negative bacteria also have β–lactamases to inhibit antibiotics in the periplasmic fluid. The outer membrane is bilayered, but is distinctive for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules found in the outermost layer. The cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria must also have porins, or channels, to allow the entry of small (700 daltons or less) essential hydrophilic compounds while larger ones require specialized transport mechanisms. Thus gram negative cells have a defense system of degradative enzymes in the periplasm and porins and specialized transport mechanisms exclusively for essential hydrophilic molecules.[2]
http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n8/images/nrd1153-f1.jpg
Antibiotic mechanisms:
The majority of utilized antibiotics target one of five vital processes in bacterial growth: cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, or tetrahydrofolate synthesis.[1,3]
Cell wall synthesis inhibitors include β-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptides, and others. The β-lactam antibiotics are so named for the four-member ring structures that they have in common. Examples of β-lactam antibiotics include the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams. These β-lactam antibiotics function to inhibit cell wall synthesis by preventing the transpeptidation reaction responsible for linking the peptidoglycan, or murein, side chains together. β-lactams may also covalently bond with the transpeptidase enzyme which similarly inhibits cell wall synthesis and triggers autolysins which normally degrade peptidoglycan during bacterial growth and division. The glycopeptides include vancomycin, daptomycin, and teichoplanin which are especially effective against gram-positive bacteria. This is because they inhibit the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala muropeptides thereby preventing the essential cross-linking of the peptidoglycan. Other antibiotics like fosfomycin and bacitracin inhibit cell wall synthesis at more initial stages, specifically the conversion of N-acetylglucosamine to N-acetylmuramic acid. Without intact peptidoglycan, the bacterium is more likely to lyse from osmotic pressure with its environment.[1]
Protein synthesis inhibiting antibiotics include aminoglycosides, tetracy"

Figure 1:
Scheme of the cell surface display of streptavidin
We knew we wanted to bind Nanoparticles to the Bacteria using the very strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin.
Next we needed to decide which strategy would be the best so the E.coli expresses streptavidin on the outer membrane.
E.Coli are Gram-negative bacteria and they have two membranes, an inner one and an outer one, separated by a periplasmic space. Furthermore, the outer membrane is covered with a glycocalix, a layer of sugars.
There are different ways to express a heterologous protein on the outer membrane of E.coli. Peptides can be fused with outer membrane proteins or on fimbriae, fused to beta-autotransporters or lipoproteins, as for example the (Lpp)-OmpA protein. But then there is also another promising display system based on the use of ice nucleation protein (INP) from Pseudomonas syringae. Which we decided to use.
Our Biobricks
For Details, please move the cursor onto the image.
Ice nucleation Protein
INP originates from the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae. It is an outer membrane protein. That has successfully been used for cell surface display of enzymes, antibodies and antigens.
Streptavidin
Streptavidin originates from the bacterium Streptomyces avidinii. It is a tetrameric protein, each of the four subunit can bind one biotin molecule with a very high affinity.
For our Biobricks we used three different kinds of streptavidin.

'Life' is too big a word, especially when we are talking about synthetic biology, but we still find it interesting, in our life, when everyone meets alternatives and makes his decisions, that colorful behaviors and lifestyles just differentiate from small left-or-right choices, and that widely-differed ones make up a well-operated society. This year our study will be concentrated on controllable choice-making E.

iGEM 2010 Notebook
The lab notebook chronicles our journey in the creation of the Genomikon kit.  Many paths were woven together in space and time to reach this finished masterpiece.  To help you navigate through these trials with us we have laid out our notebook in a layered fashion.  This page gives a sketch of each project and how it interacts with each other.  Then follow the links to a projects page for time line of the major landmarks and accomplishments.  If you require more details on the project the links within that page will take you to our day-by-day work log.
Building Parts
The Building Parts project was responsible to first build a plasmid (plasmid 01)that contained our own specialized prefix and suffix nested inside of the standard BioBrick prefix and suffix.  After plasmid 01 existed we inserted the CcdB gene (the ""death"" gene) between our prefix and suffix removing the gene for Kanamycin resistance (plasmid 02).  Plasmid 02 is fantastic base plasmid from which we are able to amplify any part at all because it provides a positive selection marker when transformed into DH5α. At this point we were able to make parts en masse to put in our kit. After obtaining a particular part in a plasmid we PCRed the part and digested it ready to use in Assembly or to Test the plasmid.
Testing Parts
Before we were able to test parts we created 2 base testing plasmids (vector 01 and vector 02).  Vector 01 is designed to test Open Reading Frame parts, or parts that code for proteins.   The part is flanked by a promoter and the start codon on"

Ulrich and Philipp produced liposomes containing fluorophore.
On Friday, we had to move to another laboratory, since the one where were in summer is needed again, so we were very busy tidying up, clearing out and cleaning up.
In that week we were also generating the fragments for our Sweden-collaboration. For this we ran a PCR to obtain Laccase and Mutated Laccase via gel electrophoresis. We also obtained an alpha Leader sequence

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.

Designed primers with Ruichen and Mehul.
More specifically, the primers were for constitutively expressed GFP, RFP, and YFP to be put in the PCC1FOS vector. An EcoRI site was added just before the start of the promoter, and a BamHI site was added to the 5' end of the reverse complement. The melting temperature was normalized to about 59°C, and the primers were checked for any secondary structure.
There were no colonies on the plates transformed with any putative biobricks, so the procedure was attempted again.

Still no biobrick colonies. Tried again with an altered ligation protocol. Also ordered a variety of kill switches from the registry, along with Joe's Panamanian Pseudomonas Rhamnosyltransferase. Repeated PCR on things that had previously failed, and got the final amino acid biobrick and Ruichen's knockout resistance construct. Joe's knockout resistance cassette remains recalcitrant. It should be noted that I ran reactions with either PFU or phusion, and only the phusion worked. This may have been because of the low volume (0.5 uL) used.
At the meeting, the gasoline debacle was discussed, as was the general progress of the project, and potential fixes for some of the problems that we have been having.
I suggested to Joe that he use the 2-17F biobrick for his forward kanamycin resistance cassette, and other ideas were thrown around as well.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"Design is the distinguishing activity of synthetic biology”
This paraphrased quote, originally coined by Herbert A. Simon to describe engineering, perfectly outlines the cornerstone of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition: the rational design of biological circuits by modular parts. Fueled by pure excitement for the promising and novel field of synthetic biology, we embarked on a multi-faceted journey into the world of iGEM and designed a bimodal project. The principal pillar of our efforts has been pANDORRA; a programmable AND OR RNAi Assembly platform engineered to optimize logic circuit design and implementation. We applied our modular assembly platform to build a multi-input RNAi based logic circuit to specifically target colorectal cancer cells. Adjuvantly, we concocted a bactofection system performing cell-specific adhesion and bacterial density dependent invasion and plasmid transference.
pANDORRA pipelinea re-invention of the engineering cycle
RNAi-based logic circuits
We aimed to develop a fully-predictable regulatory program, exploiting the distributed cellular availability of specific molecular input to differentiate various cell types by the production of a protein output. Following the engineering cycle, as described in [ 1 ], our first step was “Specification”. Our end goal at the beginning, was quite singular: create a molecular logic circuit, a biocomputer, that can trigger cell death or produce fluorescence when a certain expression profile is found in a cell. Before delving deeper into the inner working of our logic circuit design, let’s review two fundamental notions concerning the computing of such circuits:
1. The nature of the biological switches. Switches are the physical entities that implement a universal set of logic gates, thus enabling computation. A plethora of biomolecules can be utilized upon which to build switches. Between gene-based, RNA-based, protein-based etc. biological switches, we chose trans-acting RNA switches and specifically miRNAs. Thanks to their ability to regulate a large fraction of the human transcriptome and natural implementation NOR logic [ 2 ] when multiple ones regulate the same gene, miRNAs have been extensively studied in mammalian systems. Moreover, they are excellent internal inputs since miRNAs are found to play crucial roles in the disease spectrum [ 3 ].
2. The rudimentary circuit abstraction. In order for a miRNA-based cell profiling to function, in accordance with seminal papers of the field [ 2 , 4-7 ], a number of miRNA markers are selected and the circuit computes an AND gate  with these markers in order to perform a classification task. Since miRNAs are molecules exerting"

Human Practices
The UCLA iGEM Team is committed to being an advocate for the universal advancement and acceptance of synthetic biology, and we believe that progress through the field can only be achieved by informing and teaching the youth of our society. As such, our Human Practices project centers around education of Los Angeles youth to show them the potential of synthetic biology, and furthermore think of the implications and ethics behind scientific progress and research.
This year, we worked with Nava College Prep Academy, a school community founded and run school in East Los Angeles to inspire high school students and help them explore the world of synthetic biology. Our project consisted of a two day workshop, the first of which took place at UCLA and the latter in East Los Angeles.
The first workshop was centered around providing an introduction to synthetic biology, as the high school students were about to embark on a month long synthetic biology unit in their science class. We shared our previous work with our 2015 iGEM project-the customization and functionalization of synthetic silk fibers, as well as the foundation the 2016 project. Following a short presentation about the Central Dogma of Biology, genetic circuitry, and gene expression, we then asked the students to apply what the learned to manipulate genetic circuits and create bi-stable switches using parts we provided for them. Many of the students were very eager and engaged with the activity, almost viewing it like a puzzle-in a very similar way that we as researchers approach our own projects! We concluded the workshop with a tour of our lab space and a Q&A panel, giving the students a chance to ask any questions they had about research or synthetic biology.
Our second workshop occurred at the conclusion of the students' synthetic biology unit, and as such we chose to focus on inspiring their creativity and innovation. After a short presentation about cool technologies and projects that have arisen out of synthetic biology today, we had the students think about what the world would like look in the frame of synthetic biological and biotechnological advances. The students, armed with new knowledge about the power of synthetic biology, were able to harness into its potential and come up with many cool ideas-from GMOs that could withstand any kind of weather and terrain, to making new wacky species of animals that are crosses of other species. It was really awe-inspiring to see the young people of our society thinking creatively about"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicsReportPreface_-_-_TEXT.html,". That change sometimes permits the development of a critical perception, or, at least, makes it more attainable. That critical perspective permitted by reflexivity is one of the ways to get to ethical reflexion.
Among the large field of synthetic biology, the IGEM competition invites young scientists, future researchers to interdisciplinary experimentation. Heterogeneous teams focus on freedom, innovation and motivation can lead teams to perform that disciplinary “insider/outsider” team standing. The specifications of the competition encourage to this reflexive position. In other word, the point is how exploration and experimentation in the way to build up an IGEM project can lead teams to that critical reflexion. Freedom and experimentation, encouraged by the structure of the competition, make the ethical reflexion both relevant and accessible to the teams' mind.
If we go ahead with our inquiry, crossing several institutional or disciplinary structures which promote a critical standpoint and ethical reflexion, we have to examine our own structure of participation in the competition : our team. We can find two “original” explanations to that reflexivity of the team. The Parisian team is build by volunteers to the “IGEM call” made by the Center for Research and Interdisciplinary (CRI) not only because of the student's membership of a certain university. Therefore, the team(iGEM Paris Team) is hybrid both socially and disciplinarily. Students come from high school or undergraduated programs, and differences in disciplines and specializations are large and various. At first, we had to make an effort to understand each other's different backgrounds. In the course of the project development, that “different regard” of the members was transformed, becoming a “shared regard” by building up our project and knowledge, in the process of building a team.
These differences between members, understood as a wealth, were already in the mind of the researchers of the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI). The CRI was founded in 2005 at the Medical University of Paris Descartes and defines itself as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. New ways of teaching and learning are daily practices at the CRI, for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and researchers. The originality of the collaborative, non-hierarchical interactions between students and teachers can be found in the autonomy of the student (they collectively choose the content of the classes) but also in the main research's themes and perspectives. The CRI “call for participation” to IGEM has to be understood in that perspective of giving to students critical tools, understood as"

The Debate
The debate is part of our new developed approach, which is bottom-up structured.
The aim of the debate was to focus on ethical issues surrounding synthetic biology in a way which is accessible to students, academics, but also non-scientists.
The poster of our debate.
We organized a debate in which four speakers were invited with different backgrounds to debate the ethical concerns surrounding synthetic biology. The panel members were: René Custer , regulatory affairs manager at the VIB (Flemish institute for biotechnology). Prof. Johan De Tavern"

Intro: Today I created glycerol stocks of Yeates' cage cells.
The stocks were created at 10:00 am, after letting the cells incubate in 5 mL LB overnight. Given the length of the incubation time, it is possible that the cells grew past the log phase. Three cryo tubes were each filled with 0.5 mL of iGEM 50% glycerol stock (sterile filtered 4.23.15 by VCL). Then 0.5 mL of bacterial culture was pipetted into each tube. After vortexing to mix, the tubes were labeled and stored in David's section of the -80C freezer in Sri's lab. They were placed in the upper right quadrant of the box with all three vials in a row. The remaining cell solution was bleached and disposed.

Kent,2016,Team:Kent#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is very encouraging. It shows that teams are working towards democratization of biology, in lie with the iGEM organisation ethos of having DNA repository where everyone can submit a Biobrick and have access to it.
Yet again, problems popular among teams are antibiotic resistance, environmental problems, water pollution. This agrees with Human Practices/Practice & Policy topics, which is not surprising.
The word or terms related to “magnetic” is not there, which could possibly signify that iGEM Kent is solving a very novel problem.
PubMed entries with the keyword “Synthetics Biology”

Figure 4 is mapping of 15 topics from PubMed keyword search “Synthetic biology”. Abstract of 9628 PubMed articles under the search keyword “Synthetic Biology” were scraped for the model.
Interestingly, the topic “cancer” appears here again, similar to HP topics, suggesting it is not only a popular subject for iGEM teams but also for the synthetic Biology community.
The red circle located at the right side of the map contains a topic of “organ regeneration” might implies that synthetic biology could be a promising field for this. In contrast with “cancer”, this topic is exclusive to synthetic biology researchers, possibly due to the time needed to work on such challenge.
Conclusion
In general, topic model has proven itself to be a very useful and powerful tool as our results show the area of magnetosome is a novel topic. Thus, our well integrated quantitative approach to human practices approach has feedbacks to our project and informed us where it is placed in current research and in the iGEM communities. It has also shown important areas that need to be discovered such as application of magnetosomes and ethics and policy for Human Practices. Our model has also shown popular iGEM projects and iGEM teams in the future can utilise the approach we pioneered to help choose their projects. For this reason, as an analogy to BioBricks, our results could be called ‘Human Practice-Bricks’.
HMM LDA is one of the algorithms that LDA topic model uses, and LDA is one of several several topic models. In this age of ever increase contents of information, it is exciting to wait and see what future iGEM teams will do with their topic models and larger sample of data. They could improve our/other topic models and produce better results. Hopefully, our efforts to HP using topic modelling shows that even at early stage is a powerful tool with growing potentials, and convince future iGEM teams that is newly opened door is worth walking through."
St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#drugdel_-_-_TEXT.html," Capsules have been used since their creation in 1834, as they allow the medicine to be contained within functionally-important media, such as oil, and in pre-measured amounts and combinations to assist with accurate dosing.  A capsule simply contains medicine within a stable shell coating, which will dissolve within the body and allow the uptake of the contained chemical into the system.  Pills are the current norm within drug delivery, but they are far from the most effective way to deliver medicine to the body.
The advantage that bacterial drug vectors have over pills is the natural specificity that bacteria have towards it preferred ecological niche.  Escherichia coli, for instance, move through the body after being ingested and colonize the lower intestines.  They have evolved over millions of years, and trillions of replications, to survive within the environment of the gut, evading host defenses, gathering nutrients, and reproducing within the natural parameters of the lower intestine.  If there was a drug that needed to be directly delivered to the gut, E. coli may offer a hyper-specific delivery vector that could outshine pill counterparts.
One of the obvious benefits of site-specific drug delivery would be the pronounced reduction in unwanted systemic effects of useful, functional drugs.  For instance, catabolic steroids that would benefit a single organ must currently be taken via injection or oral means, resulting in the possibility of a whole range of detrimental side effects including hypertension, weight gain, decreased muscle mass, cataracts, and a decrease in infection sensitivity and response associated with long term use (Noone, 2006).  Rather than the site of absorption be into the bloodstream, which spreads the steroids to internal areas where they can cause these side effects, site-specific steroid release would greatly reduce excess steroid concentrations in the blood.  Not only that, our cells would need to release a much lower concentration of drug than required in pill form.  We would no longer have to flood the bloodstream with a high concentration of drug so the intended site in effected, and this would reduce the severity of, or perhaps even remove altogether, some of the drugs side effects (Noone, 2006).  Another example would be the ingestion of antibiotics used to fight other infections within the body.  High dose broad-spectrum antibiotics would normally damage gut flora before being absorbed into the bloodstream (Martin, 2003).  Our E. coli vectors would be able to release this drug not only in small doses, but to smaller areas within the gut, resulting in far lower collateral damage to symbiotic bacteria.  The bacterial ability to move to the site of"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"

Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis of RBS0.01 was correct so  did the gel extract and did the ligation of RBS0.01-luxITT, PBADRBS-luxITT  and PBADRBS-luxRTT. Did two ligations of PBADRBS-luxRTT,  one is put in 4°C and the other is in 16°C to test the effect of ligase.
Fluorescence  Test:
Fluorescence  measurements were designed to determine the top values of fluorescence and the  time when the value of fluorescence fall. We set a group of inducers included  four high levels of arabinose concentration in today’s fluorescence  measurements of PBADRLT. Measurements were taken in a time interval of 15  minutes. We got a series of data containing 18 groups of value in every level.  These data was enough for us to get four curves of fluorescence.

Original  plan is to perform the controlled experiments again to verify the ligation  procedure is alright. Bad things happened again: no bands in electrophoresis  photo. Maybe the plasmid isolation kits were contaminated or something wrong  with purification columns. The band of RETPcIRLT seemed strange, maybe need  another ligation.
